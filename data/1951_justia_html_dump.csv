<p>1.

<p>2. Without counsel and without being offered counsel or advised of his right to counsel, petitioner pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two consecutive terms of five to fifteen years each on charges of armed robbery and attempted armed robbery.  Years later, in a habeas corpus proceeding in a Pennsylvania court, he alleged that, both upon his arrest and at his arraignment, he was told that he was charged with ""breaking and entering,"" that he was then a young, irresponsible boy who had spent several years in a mental institution, and that he did not know that he was charged with armed robbery until after he reached prison.  The record was not sufficient to refute these allegations, but the state court dismissed his petition without affording him an opportunity to prove them.</p>

<p>Opinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE BLACK, announced by MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER.</p>
<p>This Court has repeatedly held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to afford defendants assistance of counsel in noncapital criminal cases when there are special circumstances showing that, without a lawyer, a defendant could not have an adequate and a fair defense. <span class='l-asterix'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/134/case.html"">*</a></span>  Petitioner, a prisoner in a Pennsylvania penitentiary, is serving the second of two five-to-fifteen-year sentences simultaneously imposed after pleas of guilty to state offenses.  He sought release in these habeas corpus proceedings filed in a Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas.  His petition alleged that his pleas of guilty were entered without benefit of counsel, and that other special circumstances existed which deprived him of opportunity and capacity fairly to defend himself.  Answers of the warden and district attorney admitted that petitioner had not been represented by counsel, but asserted that the trial record sufficiently refuted petitioner's allegations.  On consideration of the petition and answers, the court held that petitioner's allegations, in light of the record, failed to show probable cause for his discharge.  The case was then dismissed, thereby depriving petitioner of any opportunity to offer </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""136"">Page 342 U. S. 136</a></p><p> evidence to prove his allegations.  The Superior Court affirmed, 167 Pa.Super. 88, 74 A.2d 725, and the State Supreme Court refused to allow an appeal.  The right to counsel being an important constitutional safeguard, we granted petitioner's motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> and his petition for certiorari.  341 U.S. 919.</p>
<p>We must look to the petition and answers to determine whether the particular circumstances alleged are sufficient to entitle petitioner to a judicial hearing.  In summary, these allegations are:  when petitioner was arrested December 20, 1930, the officers told him that he was charged with ""breaking and entering the Leaders Dry Goods Store.""  Later, before a magistrate, he was again told that the charge was ""breaking and entering.""  Petitioner never saw the indictments against him, nor were they read to him.  He never knew he had been charged with robbery, and never intended to plead guilty to such a crime.  Taken to the courtroom,</p>
<p>""the District Attorney informed the Court, that 'the defendant wishes to plead guilty' and, in the matter of a minute, more or less, the foregoing sentence was entered after he answered 'Yes' to the Court's query, 'Do you plead guilty to this charge?'  Petitioner 'was not represented by counsel, nor offered counsel, or advised of his right to have counsel.' . . .""</p>
<p>After arrival at the penitentiary, petitioner first learned, according to his petition, that he had been sentenced for robbery, and not for the lesser charge of ""breaking and entering.""  The petition also alleges that petitioner, when arrested, was</p>
<p>""a young irresponsible boy, having spent several years in Polk (because he was mentally abnormal), as well as several years in Morganza.""</p>
<p>This allegation of mental abnormality is supported by the penitentiary warden's answer showing that petitioner had been confined in Polk (a state institution) from August, 1918, to September, 1920, because he was an ""imbecile.""  The warden's answer also shows that petitioner was born </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""137"">Page 342 U. S. 137</a></p><p> in 1909; was a state orphanage inmate for a year beginning in 1916, and was in reformatories for larceny or ""breaking and entering"" for eight of the ten years between the time of his release from the mental institution and the time of the offense for which he is now in prison.</p>
<p>All of the foregoing allegations, if proven, would present compelling reasons why petitioner desperately needed legal counsel and services.  Incarceration as a boy for imbecility, followed by repeated activities wholly incompatible with normal standards of conduct, indicates no qualities of mind or character calculated to enable petitioner to protect himself in the give-and-take of a courtroom trial.  Moreover, if there can be proof of what he charges, he is the victim of inadvertent or intentional deception by officers who, so he alleges, persuaded him to plead guilty to armed robbery by telling him he was only charged with breaking and entering, an offense for which the maximum imprisonment is only ten years, as compared to twenty years for armed robbery.  18 Purdon's Pa.Stat.Ann. (1930) &#167;&#167; 2892, 3041.  In this aspect of the case, the allegations are strikingly like those that we held entitled the petitioner to a hearing in <em>Smith v. O'Grady,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/312/329/case.html"">312 U. S. 329</a></span>.</p>
<p>It is strongly urged here, however, that petitioner's allegations are satisfactorily refuted by the trial record, and that the Court should not now look behind that record, particularly in view of the long time that has elapsed since petitioner pleaded guilty.  Of course, the trial record may relevantly be considered in the habeas corpus proceeding.  In some respects, petitioner's allegations are refuted by the record.  But that record does not even inferentially deny petitioner's charge that the officers deceived him, nor does the record show an understanding plea of guilty from this petitioner, unless by a resort to speculation and surmise.  The right to counsel is too valuable in our system to dilute it by such untrustworthy </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""138"">Page 342 U. S. 138</a></p><p> reasoning.  <em>Cf. Hawk v. Olson,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/326/271/case.html"">326 U. S. 271</a></span>,  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/326/271/case.html#278"">326 U. S. 278</a></span>.  The judgment dismissing the petition is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the State Supreme Court for further action not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>
<p>* <em>Uveges v. Pennsylvania,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/335/437/case.html"">335 U. S. 437</a></span>; <em>Bute v. Illinois,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/333/640/case.html"">333 U. S. 640</a></span>,  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/333/640/case.html#677"">333 U. S. 677</a></span>, and cases cited.  It was pointed out in the <em>Uveges</em> opinion that a minority of the Court believed the Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments require both state and federal courts to afford defendants in all criminal prosecutions the assistance of counsel for their defense.</p>

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 26</p></b><p><b>Argued October 17, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided December 11, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 143</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>For 15 years, a newspaper publisher enjoyed a substantial monopoly of the mass dissemination of local and national news and advertising in its community, and 99% coverage of the community's families.  After the establishment of a competing radio station, the publisher refused to accept local advertising from those who advertised over the radio station.  The purpose of the publisher was to destroy the broadcasting company.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the publisher was engaged in an attempt to monopolize interstate commerce, in violation of &#167; 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and was properly enjoined under &#167; 4 from continuing the attempt.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/143/case.html#144"">342 U. S. 144</a></span>-157.</p>
<p>1. The conduct of the publisher was an attempt to monopolize interstate commerce.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/143/case.html#149"">342 U. S. 149</a></span>-152.</p>
<p>(a) The distribution within the community of the news and advertising transmitted there in interstate commerce for the sole purpose of immediate and profitable reproduction and distribution to the reading public is an inseparable part of the flow of the interstate commerce involved.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/143/case.html#152"">342 U. S. 152</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) Without the protection of competition at the outlets of the flow of interstate commerce, the protection of its earlier stages is of little worth.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/143/case.html#152"">342 U. S. 152</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. The publisher's attempt to regain its monopoly of interstate commerce by forcing advertisers to boycott a competing radio station violated &#167; 2 of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/143/case.html#152"">342 U. S. 152</a></span>-155.</p>
<p>(a) In order to establish this violation of &#167; 2, it was not necessary to show that the publisher's attempt to monopolize was successful.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/143/case.html#153"">342 U. S. 153</a></span>-154.</p>
<p>(b) A lone newspaper, already enjoying a substantial monopoly in its area, violates the ""attempt to monopolize"" clause of &#167; 2 when it uses its monopoly to destroy threatened competition.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/143/case.html#154"">342 U. S. 154</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) The right claimed by the publisher as a private business concern to select its customers and to refuse to accept advertisements from whomever it pleases is neither absolute nor exempt from regulation.  Its exercise as a purposeful means of monopolizing interstate commerce is prohibited by the Sherman Act.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/143/case.html#155"">342 U. S. 155</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""144"">Page 342 U. S. 144</a></p><p></p>
<p>3. The injunction against the newspaper publisher's continuing to attempt to monopolize interstate commerce does not violate the First Amendment's guaranty of freedom of the press.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/143/case.html#155"">342 U. S. 155</a></span>-156.</p>
<p>4. There is no obvious error in the form or substance of the decree of the District Court, and, in the circumstances of the case, this Court relies upon that court's retention of jurisdiction over the cause for whatever modification the decree may need in the light of the entire proceedings and of subsequent events.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/143/case.html#156"">342 U. S. 156</a></span>-157.</p>
<p>92 F.Supp. 794, affirmed.</p>
<p>In a civil action brought by the United States under the Sherman Act, the District Court enjoined appellants from violation of the Act.  92 F.Supp. 794.  A direct appeal to this Court was taken under the Expediting Act.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/143/case.html#157"">342 U. S. 157</a></span>.</p>

Illinois</p></b><p><b>No. 95</p></b><p><b>Argued November 5-6, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided December 3, 1951<L=|342 U.S. 104ast|>*</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 104</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, petitioner, a prisoner in an Illinois penitentiary, filed in the state court in which he had been convicted a petition alleging facts sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie</em> violation of his rights under the Federal Constitution through the admission of a coerced confession in evidence at his trial.  The State's Attorney did not deny these allegations, but moved to dismiss the petition on grounds of <em>res judicata</em> and failure to state a cause of action.  The court dismissed the petition without a hearing or otherwise determining the factual issues presented.  The State Supreme Court, without argument and without opinion, dismissed a writ of error by a form order reciting that it had examined and reviewed the petition and record in the post-conviction hearing and found the same to disclose no violation or denial of petitioner's constitutional rights.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  judgment vacated and cause remanded for further proceedings.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/104/case.html#105"">342 U. S. 105</a></span>-112.</p>
<p>1. If his allegations are true, and if his claim has not been waived at or after trial, petitioner is held in custody in violation of federal constitutional rights, and he is entitled to his day in court for resolution of these issues.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/104/case.html#110"">342 U. S. 110</a></span>-111.</p>
<p>2. On remand, petitioner should be advised whether his claim that his constitutional rights were infringed at his trial may be determined under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, or whether that Act does not provide an appropriate state remedy in this case.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/104/case.html#111"">342 U. S. 111</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. If petitioner's claim may be resolved in a proceeding under that Act, either by an inquiry into the verity of his factual allegations or a finding that his federal rights were waived during or after his trial, such resolution may proceed without further action by this Court.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/104/case.html#111"">342 U. S. 111</a></span>-112.</p>
<p>4. If Illinois does not provide an appropriate remedy for such a determination, petitioner may proceed without more to apply to the United States District Court for a writ of habeas corpus.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/104/case.html#112"">342 U. S. 112</a></span>.</p>
<p>Judgments vacated and causes remanded. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""105"">Page 342 U. S. 105</a></p><p></p>
<p>Illinois trial courts dismissed petitioners' petitions under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Ill.Rev.Stat., 1951, c. 38, &#167;&#167; 826-832.  The Illinois Supreme Court dismissed writs of error.  This Court granted certiorari.  341 U.S. 947; 342 U.S. 811.  <em>Judgments vacated and causes remanded,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/104/case.html#112"">342 U. S. 112</a></span>.</p>

Minard</p></b><p><b>No. 2</p></b><p><b>Argued October 16, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided December 3, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 117</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. In civil proceedings brought in the Federal District Court under R.S. &#167; 1979, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 43 (Civil Rights Act), petitioners sought an injunction against the use, in pending state criminal proceedings against them in New Jersey, of evidence claimed to have been obtained by an unlawful search by state police.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the District Court properly dismissed the complaints.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/117/case.html"">342 U. S. 117</a></span>-125.</p>
<p>2. Federal courts should refuse to intervene in state criminal proceedings to suppress the use of evidence even when claimed to have been secured by unlawful search and seizure.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/117/case.html#120"">342 U. S. 120</a></span>-125.</p>
<p>184 F.2d 575, affirmed.</p>
<p>In suits brought by petitioners under R.S. &#167; 1979, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 43, to enjoin the use, in a state criminal trial, of evidence claimed to have been obtained by an unlawful search by state police, the District Court dismissed the complaints.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  184 F.2d 575.  This Court granted certiorari.  341 U.S. 930.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/117/case.html#125"">342 U. S. 125</a></span>.</p>

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Cook v. Cook, 342 U.S.  126 (1951)</h3><p><b>Cook v. Cook</p></b><p><b>No. 30</p></b><p><b>Argued November 7, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided December 3, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 126</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. It is to be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that a Florida court which granted a decree of divorce had jurisdiction over both parties, thereby rendering the issue of jurisdiction over the cause <em>res judicata</em> on a collateral attack in another state.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/126/case.html#127"">342 U. S. 127</a></span>-128.</p>
<p>2. Upon the record in this case, the Vermont court could not, consistently with the Full Faith and Credit Clause, sustain a collateral attack upon a Florida divorce decree, since the presumption of jurisdiction over the cause and the parties to which the Florida decree was entitled was not overcome by extrinsic evidence or by the record itself.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/126/case.html"">342 U. S. 126</a></span>-129.</p>
<p>116 Vt. 374, 76 A.2d 593, reversed.</p>
<p>In a proceeding brought by respondent in a Vermont state court for the annulment of his marriage and remarriage to petitioner, the State Supreme Court held both marriages null and void.  116 Vt. 374, 76 A.2d 593.  This Court granted certiorari.  341 U.S. 914.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/126/case.html#129"">342 U. S. 129</a></span>.</p>

California</p></b><p><b>No. 6, Original</p></b><p><b>Decided Dec. 3, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 891</p></b><p><b></p></b><p>The order of February 12, 1949, appointing William H. Davis, Esquire, of New York City, Special Master herein, is continued, and he is directed to conduct hearings and to submit to this Court with all convenient speed his recommended answers to the following questions, with a view to securing from this Court an order for his further guidance in applying the proper principles of law to the seven coastal segments enumerated in Groups I and II of the Master's Report of May 31, 1949, ordered filed June 27, 1949, pp. 1 and 2 of said Report:</p>
<p>Question 1. -- What is the status (inland waters or open sea) of particular channels and other water areas between the mainland and offshore islands, and, if inland waters, then by what criteria are the inland water limits of any such channel or other water area to be determined?</p>
<p>Question 2. -- Are particular segments in fact bays or harbors constituting inland waters and from what landmarks are the lines marking the seaward limits of bays, harbors, rivers, and other inland waters to be drawn?</p>
<p>Question 3. -- By what criteria is the ordinary low water mark on the coast of California to be ascertained?</p>
<p>In holding hearings, the master is authorized to exclude such evidence as he may deem immaterial or unduly cumulative in arriving at his recommendations.  Each party may make proffer or any part of such excluded evidence in written form to this Court.  Excluded evidence so proffered shall accompany the record of proceedings upon which the Master acted, but shall not be a part of that record.</p>

Nebraska</p></b><p><b>No. 94</p></b><p><b>Argued October 8, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided November 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 55</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Petitioner, a 38-year-old Mexican farm hand who can neither speak nor write English, was arrested, jailed, and questioned in Texas, and, after four days, during which he claims he was mistreated, he confessed to a homicide in Nebraska.  Thereafter, he was taken to Nebraska, where he again confessed, although he makes no claim of mistreatment by the Nebraska authorities.  Twenty-five days after his arrest and fourteen days after his arrival in Nebraska, he was brought before a magistrate for the first time, and he pleaded guilty.  Two days later, before trial, counsel was appointed to defend him.  At his trial in a state court, the two confessions and the plea were admitted in evidence over his objection, and he was convicted of manslaughter.  The State Supreme Court affirmed.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  upon the record in this case, it cannot be said that the admission in evidence of the confessions and plea violated petitioner's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/55/case.html#56"">342 U. S. 56</a></span>-68;  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/55/case.html#68"">342 U. S. 68</a></span>-73.</p>
<p>(a) The rule of <em>McNabb v. United States,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/318/332/case.html"">318 U. S. 332</a></span>, is not a limitation imposed by the Constitution, and is not applicable to trials of criminal cases in state courts.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/55/case.html#63"">342 U. S. 63</a></span>-65;  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/55/case.html#71"">342 U. S. 71</a></span>-72.</p>
<p>(b) On the record in this case, it cannot be said that Nebraska violated the requirements of due process in this conviction.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/55/case.html#60"">342 U. S. 60</a></span>-63,  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/55/case.html#65"">342 U.

<p>152 Neb. 831, 43 N.W.2d 1, affirmed.</p>
<p>Petitioner's conviction in a state court of Nebraska for manslaughter, claimed to have been in violation of rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, was affirmed by the State Supreme Court.  152 Neb. 831, 43 N.W.2d 1.  This Court granted certiorari.  341 U.S. 947.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/55/case.html#68"">342 U.

Funicane</p></b><p><b>No. 18</p></b><p><b>Argued October 10, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided November 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 76</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. The procedure prescribed by &#167; 338 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 738, is the exclusive procedure for revoking naturalization on the ground of fraud or illegal procurement, based on evidence outside the record.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/76/case.html#77"">342 U. S. 77</a></span>-88.</p>
<p>2. A state court granted petitioner a certificate of citizenship.  At the same term, as permitted by state practice, it granted a motion of the Government, based on evidence outside the record, to vacate and set aside its order of naturalization on the ground of fraud in procurement.  Petitioner appeared personally and admitted the fraud.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  This revocation of petitioner's naturalization is void, because it was not in accordance with the uniform procedure prescribed by &#167; 338 of the Nationality Act.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/76/case.html#77"">342 U. S. 77</a></span>-88.</p>
<p>(a) Congress intended to prescribe a uniform and carefully safeguarded procedure for revoking naturalization on the ground of fraud or illegal procurement based on evidence outside the record, and this purpose would be defeated if state courts could follow instead widely diverse state rules affecting the finality of local judgments.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/76/case.html#79"">342 U. S. 79</a></span>-86.</p>
<p>(b) A different result is not required by <em>Tutun v. United States,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/270/568/case.html"">270 U. S. 568</a></span>, sustaining the right of an alien to appeal from an order denying naturalization.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/76/case.html#86"">342 U. S. 86</a></span>-88.</p>
<p>87 U.S.App.D.C. 137, 184 F.2d 225, reversed.</p>
<p>The District Court granted petitioner a judgment declaring him to be a citizen of the United States.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  87 U.S.App.D.C. 137, 184 F.2d 225.  This Court granted certiorari.  341 U.S. 919.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/76/case.html#88"">342 U. S. 88</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""77"">Page 342 U. S. 77</a></p><p></p>

Wunderlich</p></b><p><b>No. 11</p></b><p><b>Argued November 6, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided November 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 98</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Under the standard provision of a government contract that all disputes involving questions of fact shall be decided by the contracting officer, with the right of appeal to the head of the department, ""whose decision shall be final and conclusive upon the parties thereto,"" a finding by the head of a department on a question of fact may not be set aside by the Court of Claims, unless it was founded on fraud, alleged and proved.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/98/case.html"">342 U. S. 98</a></span>-101.</p>
<p>(a) By fraud is meant conscious wrongdoing, an intention to cheat or be dishonest.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'>342 U. S. 100</span>.</p>
<p>(b) A finding by the Court of Claims that the decision of the department head was ""arbitrary,"" ""capricious"" and ""grossly erroneous"" is not sufficient to justify setting it aside.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'>342 U. S. 100</span>.</p>
<p>117 Ct.Cl. 92 reversed.</p>
<p>The Court of Claims set aside a decision of a department head on a question of fact arising under a standard form government contract.  117 Ct.Cl. 92.  This Court granted certiorari.  341 U.S. 924.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/98/case.html#101"">342 U. S. 101</a></span>.</p>

BURKE, Warden, New Eastern State Penitentiary. <P> Nos. 80, 81 and 82. <P> Supreme Court of the United States <P> Argued and submitted Nov. 5, 1951. <P> November 26, 1951</B></span> <P> On Writs of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. <P> Mr. Archibald Cox, Cambridge, Mass., for petitioners. <P> Messrs. James W. Tracey, Jr., John H. Maurer, Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent. <P><P> <P></B>PER CURIAM. <P> <P> The judgments are reversed. Townsend v. Burke, <a href=""/cases/federal/us/334/736/case.html"">334 U.S. 736</a>. <P><P> Memorandum by Mr. Justice MINTON, dissenting. <P> These cases only illuminate the error of this Court in Townsend v. Burke, <a href=""/cases/federal/us/334/736/case.html"">334 U.S. 736</a>. I would not compound the error. I would overrule Townsend rather than send these petitioners back to be proceeded against nicely. Their guilt is not questioned. They say, 'If we had only had a lawyer, maybe we would not have received such long sentences.' Yet, the sentencing judge gave two of the petitioners much shorter terms than the maximum provided by statute. They complain not so much of the sentences they received but the manner in [ Keenan v. Burke <a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/881/case.html"">342 U.S. 881</a> (1951) ][881-Continued.] <P>which they received them. <P> Admit the sentencing judge was facetious, even that he bulldozed the petitioners-he sentenced them all within the limits authorized by law. Maybe the judge's conduct called for a curtain lecture. At most, that was a matter for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and that court did not see even an error of state law in the judge's conduct, let alone a federal constitutional question. We sit only to determine federal constitutional questions, not to scold state trial judges. It is utterly incomprehensible to me how a judge can commit a denial of federal due </p><p><A NAME=882 class=""page-number"">Page 342 U.S. 881 , 882</a></p><p> process by being facetious in the sentencing of defendants where the sentences he imposes are within the limits prescribed by statute. I would affirm. <br /><br /><br/>

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 346</p></b><p><b>Nov. 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>Statement of Jurisdiction Distributed Oct. 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>Rehearing Denied Jan. 7, 1952</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 882</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em>See</em> 342 U.S. 911.</p>
<p>PER CURIAM.</p>
<p>The motion to affirm is granted, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.</p>
<p>The Interstate Commerce Commission has ordered intrastate commuters' fares of the New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company increased in New York to the level of interstate commuters' fares.  The Commission found that the transportation conditions surrounding intrastate trains were substantially similar to those surrounding interstate trains.  Interstate fares were determined to be reasonable.  But present intrastate fares were found not to be producing a reasonable return on investment.  The Commission concluded that persons and localities in interstate commerce, and interstate commerce, were being unduly discriminated against.  Pursuant to &#167; 13(4) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 13(4), it ordered intrastate fares raised to the level of interstate fares to remove the discrimination.  A three-judge district court affirmed the order of the Commission as to the finding of discrimination against interstate commerce, but did not pass on the finding of discrimination against persons and localities in interstate commerce.  98 F.Supp. 855. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""883"">Page 342 U. S. 883</a></p><p></p>

Carignan</p></b><p><b>No. 5</p></b><p><b>Argued October 8, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided November 13, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 36</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. Having confessed that he assaulted a woman with intent to commit rape, respondent was arrested and duly committed on that charge on a Friday.  While in lawful custody on that charge, he was questioned on Saturday and Monday (but not on Sunday) about the murder of another woman during an attempt to commit rape, and he confessed to the murder on Monday, without having been arrested, indicted or committed on that charge.  There was no evidence of violence, persistent questioning or deprivation of food or rest.  Respondent was told that he did not have to make a statement and that no promises could be made to him in one way or another.  Prior to his confession, he was permitted to consult privately with a priest on two different occasions.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  on the uncontradicted facts in this record, the confession of murder was not inadmissible in evidence under the principles of <em>McNabb v. United States,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/318/332/case.html"">318 U. S. 332</a></span>, and <em>Upshaw v. United States,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/335/410/case.html"">335 U. S. 410</a></span>.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/36/case.html#37"">342 U. S. 37</a></span>-45.</p>
<p>(a) So long as no coercive methods by threats or inducements to confess are employed, constitutional requirements do not forbid police examination in private of those in lawful custody or the use as evidence of information voluntarily given.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/36/case.html#39"">342 U. S. 39</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) The <em>McNabb</em> doctrine was not intended as a penalty or sanction for violation of Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  <em>United States v. Mitchell,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/322/65/case.html"">322 U. S. 65</a></span>.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/36/case.html#42"">342 U. S. 42</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) Respondent's confession of murder was not given during unlawful detention, because he was being lawfully detained on another charge, although he had not been arrested for or charged with murder when the confession of murder was made.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'>342 U. S. 43</span>-44.</p>
<p>(d) This Court declines to extend the <em>McNabb</em> doctrine to statements to police or wardens concerning other crimes while prisoners are legally detained on criminal charges.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/36/case.html#45"">342 U. S. 45</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. Issues which were in controversy in the Court of Appeals, but which that court did not decide, are available to a respondent in certiorari as grounds for affirmance of the judgment, even though the respondent did not petition for certiorari.  P. 38,  <a href='#F1' name='T1'>n</a> 1.</p>
<p>3. When the admissibility of respondent's confession was in issue in the trial court, the judge committed reversible error in refusing to </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""37"">Page 342 U. S. 37</a></p><p> permit respondent to testify in the absence of the jury to facts believed to indicate the involuntary character of his confession.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/36/case.html#38"">342 U. S. 38</a></span>.</p>
<p>4. The facts in this record surrounding the giving of the confession do not necessarily establish coercion, physical or psychological, so as to render the confession inadmissible.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/36/case.html#39"">342 U. S. 39</a></span>.</p>

Jeffers</p></b><p><b>No. 3</p></b><p><b>Argued October 15, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided November 13, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 48</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. Without a warrant for search or arrest, but with reason to believe that respondent had narcotics unlawfully concealed there, officers entered the hotel room of respondent's aunts, in their absence and in the absence of respondent, searched it, and seized narcotics claimed by respondent.  The search and seizure were not incident to a valid arrest; and there were no exceptional circumstances to justify their being made without a warrant.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  The seizure violated the Fourth Amendment; and, on respondent's motion, the narcotics so seized should have been excluded as evidence in his trial for violation of the narcotics laws.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/48/case.html#49"">342 U. S. 49</a></span>-54.</p>
<p>(a) That the evidence seized in these circumstances was not on respondent's premises, did not deprive him of standing to suppress it.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/48/case.html#51"">342 U. S. 51</a></span>-52.</p>
<p>(b) Nor is a different result required by the provision of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 3116 that ""no property rights shall exist"" in such contraband goods.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/48/case.html#52"">342 U. S. 52</a></span>-54.</p>
<p>2. Since the evidence illegally seized was contraband, the respondent was not entitled to have it returned to him.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/48/case.html#54"">342 U. S. 54</a></span>.</p>
<p>88 U.S.App.D.C. 58, 187 F.2d 498, affirmed.</p>
<p>In the District Court, respondent's motion to suppress evidence seized without a warrant was denied, and he was convicted of violating the narcotics laws, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 2553(a) and 21 U.S.C. &#167;174.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  88 U.S.App.D.C. 58, 187 F.2d 498.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 951.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/48/case.html#54"">342 U. S. 54</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""49"">Page 342 U. S. 49</a></p><p></p>

Boyle</p></b><p><b>No. 400</p></b><p><b>Argued October 18, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided November 5, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 1</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. The twelve petitioners were arrested on charges of conspiring to violate the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C. (Supp. IV) &#167;&#167; 371, 2385, and their bail was fixed initially in amounts varying from $2,500 to $100,000.  Subsequently, the District Court fixed bail pending trial in the uniform amount of $50,000 for each of them.  They moved to reduce bail, claiming that it was ""excessive"" under the Eighth Amendment, and filed supporting statements of fact which were not controverted.  The only evidence offered by the Government was a certified record showing that four other persons previously convicted under the Smith Act in another district had forfeited bail, and there was no evidence relating them to petitioners.  The motion to reduce bail was denied.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  Bail has not been fixed by proper methods in this case.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/1/case.html#3"">342 U. S. 3</a></span>-7.</p>
<p>(a) Bail set before trial at a figure higher than an amount reasonably calculated to fulfill the purpose of assuring the presence of the defendant is ""excessive"" under the Eighth Amendment.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'>342 U. S. 5</span>.</p>
<p>(b) The fixing of bail before trial for any individual defendant must be based upon standards relevant to the purpose of assuring the presence of that defendant.  Rule 46(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'>342 U. S. 5</span>.</p>
<p>(c) If bail in an amount greater than that usually fixed for serious charges of crimes is required in the case of any of the </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""2"">Page 342 U. S. 2</a></p><p> petitioners, that is a matter to which evidence should be directed in a hearing, so that the constitutional rights of each petitioner may be preserved.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/1/case.html#6"">342 U. S. 6</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. After their motion to reduce bail was denied, petitioners did not appeal, but applied to the same District Court for habeas corpus.  This was denied and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>(a) Petitioners' remedy is by motion to reduce bail, with the right of appeal to the Court of Appeals.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/1/case.html#6"">342 U. S. 6</a></span>-7.</p>
<p>(b) The order denying the motion to reduce bail is appealable as a ""final decision"" of the District Court under 28 U.S.C. (Supp. IV) &#167; 1291.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/1/case.html#6"">342 U. S. 6</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) While habeas corpus is an appropriate remedy for one held in custody in violation of the Constitution, the District Court should withhold relief in this collateral habeas corpus action where an adequate remedy available in the criminal proceeding has not been exhausted.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/1/case.html#6"">342 U. S. 6</a></span>-7.</p>
<p>(d) The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to the District Court with directions to vacate its order denying petitioners' applications for writs of habeas corpus and to dismiss the applications without prejudice.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/1/case.html#7"">342 U. S. 7</a></span>.</p>
<p>(e) Petitioners may move for reduction of bail in the criminal proceeding, so that a hearing may be held for the purpose of fixing reasonable bail for each petitioner.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/1/case.html#7"">342 U. S. 7</a></span>.</p>
<p>192 F.2d 56, judgment vacated and case remanded.</p>
<p>Petitioners' applications for habeas corpus were denied by the District Court.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  192 F.2d 56.  This Court grants certiorari, <em>post,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/1/case.html#4"">342 U. S. 4</a></span>.  Judgment vacated and case remanded, p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/1/case.html#7"">342 U. S. 7</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""3"">Page 342 U. S. 3</a></p><p></p>

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 25</p></b><p><b>Argued October 11, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided November 5, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 19</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Pursuant to a decree in Sherman Act proceedings against certain motion picture companies, a plan for the reorganization of Warner Bros. provided for the separation of Warner's theater business from its production and distribution business.  Two new companies were to be formed, one to receive the theater assets, the other to receive the production and distribution assets, and Warner Bros. was to be dissolved.  Warner was guarantor of a long-term lease of theater properties made by appellant to a Warner subsidiary, and, under the plan of reorganization, the guaranty was to be assumed only by the new theater company.  Appellant sought to intervene in the Sherman Act proceedings to protect its guaranty, but the District Court denied leave.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. If appellant was entitled to intervene as of right, the order denying leave is appealable. P. 20.</p>
<p>2. The decree in the Sherman Act proceedings is not <em>res judicata</em> of the rights which appellant sought to protect through intervention, and appellant was therefore not entitled to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/19/case.html#21"">342 U. S. 21</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. On the record in this case, appellant has not shown that it will be ""adversely affected"" by the reorganization, and hence may not intervene as of right under Rule 24(a)(3).  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/19/case.html#22"">342 U. S. 22</a></span>.</p>
<p>4. The claim of injury to appellant is too speculative and too contingent on unknown factors to conclude that the court's denial of leave to intervene was an abuse of its discretion under Rule 24(b).  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/29/case.html#32"">342 U. S. 23</a></span>.</p>
<p>Appeal dismissed.</p>
<p>In proceedings under the Sherman Antitrust Act, the District Court entered a consent decree against Warner Bros. and certain of its subsidiaries, and entered an order denying appellant's motion for leave to intervene.  On </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""20"">Page 342 U. S. 20</a></p><p> a direct appeal to this Court from this order and from the consent decree, <em>the appeal is dismissed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/19/case.html#23"">342 U. S. 23</a></span>.</p>

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 17</p></b><p><b>Argued October 17, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided November 5, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 25</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. Under the Clarification Act, the claim of a seaman against the United States for injuries and maintenance and cure, ""if administratively disallowed in whole or in part,"" may be enforced pursuant to the provisions of the Suits in Admiralty Act, which provides that any suit thereunder ""shall be brought within two years after the cause of action arises.""</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the period of limitation begins to run from the date of the injury, not from the time of the administrative disallowance of the claim.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/25/case.html"">342 U. S. 25</a></span>-27.</p>
<p>2. Upon the record in this case, it is inappropriate to consider whether the statute of limitations is tolled for a maximum of sixty days while a claim is pending and not disallowed either by notice or by operation of the regulations.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/25/case.html#28"">342 U. S. 28</a></span>.</p>
<p>186 F.2d 227 affirmed.</p>
<p>Petitioner's complaint in a suit against the United States was dismissed by the District Court as barred by limitations.  91 F.Supp. 593.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  186 F.2d 227.  This Court granted certiorari.  341 U.S. 930.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/25/case.html#28"">342 U. S. 28</a></span>.</p>

Panama Railroad Co.</p></b><p><b>No. 22</p></b><p><b>Argued October 11, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided November 5, 1951</p></b><p><b>342 U.S. 29</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. Upon the facts of this case, laches was not a defense to petitioner's suit in admiralty against respondent to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been sustained while a passenger on respondent's steamship, although an action at law was barred by the local statute of limitations.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/29/case.html#30"">342 U. S. 30</a></span>-32.</p>
<p>(a) Although the question of laches is one primarily addressed to the discretion of the trial court, it should not be determined merely by a reference to, and a mechanical application of, the statute of limitations; the equities of the parties must also be considered.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/29/case.html#30"">342 U. S. 30</a></span>-31.</p>
<p>(b) Where there has been no inexcusable delay in seeking a remedy, and where no prejudice to the defendant has ensued from the mere passage of time, relief should not be denied on the ground of laches.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/29/case.html#31"">342 U. S. 31</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. Public Law 172, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 63 Stat. 444, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2680(m), which excluded claims against the Panama Railroad Company from the provisions of the Tort Claims Act, is not to be interpreted as summarily cutting off the remedy of all who had sued the United States for torts which had been committed by the company during the year preceding its enactment, but as permitting outstanding claims upon which suit had been instituted against the United States to be enforced by prompt proceedings directly against the company.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/29/case.html#31"">342 U. S. 31</a></span>-32.</p>
<p>185 F.2d 730, reversed.</p>
<p>Petitioner's suit in admiralty against respondent was dismissed by the District Court on the ground of laches.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  185 F.2d 730.  This Court granted certiorari.  341 U.S. 934.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/342/29/case.html#32"">342 U. S. 32</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""30"">Page 342 U. S. 30</a></p><p></p>

Ackermann, petitioners,<BR>v.<BR> UNITED STATES of America.<BR>No. 199. <P> Supreme Court of the United States <P> October 15, 1951</B></span> <P> Messrs. Elbert R. Jandt and Ben F. Foster, for petitioners. <P> Solicitor General Perlman, Assistant Attorney General McInerney and Mr. Robert S. Erdahl, for the United States. <P> Petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. <P> Denied. <P><P> Memorandum by Mr. Justice JACKSON, dissenting. <P> This case involves the power of federal officials to bring state officials to punishment under the remnants of Reconstruction Period legislation. The state officer in this case, I may observe, richly deserves severe punishment. But the question in the case is one of federal against state power, a line which should not waver with the merits of individuals involved. <P> The statute, 18 U.S.C. 242, is vague and general in the extreme. It makes criminal the willful 'deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States ....' <P> It is apparent from this case that this statute enables a federal administration to hold over all state officers a threat of prosecution whose vagueness is attested by the fact that this Court cannot decide most issues of deprivation of constitutional right without dissent, and often divides five to four. The constitutionality of this very statute was recently sustained by a margin so narrow that no opinion could muster a Court majority. Even those who sustained it did so only by an interpretation of 'willful' to require more than doing of the forbidden act, saying such 'narrower' construction had support in the history of the act. It was construed to require a specific intent to deprive </p><p><A NAME=853 class=""page-number"">Page 342 U.S. 852 , 853</a></p><p> one of constitutional rights in addition to the evil purpose in doing the act itself. The lower courts were reversed because the issue of specific intent to deprive a constitutional right was not presented to the jury. Screws v. United States, <a href=""/cases/federal/us/325/91/case.html"">325 U.S. 91</a>. <P> Mr. Justice BLACK is of the opinion certiorari should be granted. <P> In this case the trial court properly charged the jury that it must find this specific intent. But it also instructed that 'The color of the act determines the complexion of the intent. The intent to injure or defraud is presumed when the unlawful act, which results in loss or injury, is proved to have been knowingly committed. It is a well settled rule, which the law applies to both criminal and civil cases, that the intent is presumed and inferred from the result of the action.' <P> This is wrong even by the test of the Screws decision. That opinion, referring to the specific intent, said, 'And in determining whether that requisite bad purpose was present the jury would be entitled to consider all the attendant circumstances-the malice of petitioner, the weapons used in the assault, its character and duration, the provocation, if any, and the like.' Screws v. United States, supra, 325 U.S. at page 107, 65 S.Ct. at page 1038. In other words, while the Screws decision contemplated the decision of this issue on the whole evidence, the charge below presumed it from a single act. This is not a technical difference. Under the trial court's construction, the Government may merely prove the act and rest-the presumption does the work of evidence. Under the Screws case, no such presumption was authorized-the Government would have to produce evidence, circumstantial in most cases, to be sure, from which the jury could reasonably infer the specific intent. That, of course, made the way of the Government harder, but it was in this fact that the Screws opinion found assurance that the vague generalities of the statute could not become a menace to civil liberties or to <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#005500><A NAME=854>[342 U.S. 852 , 854]</A> <br /><br /><br/>

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 336</p></b><p><b>Argued December 4, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided June 4, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 494</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. As construed and applied in this case, &#167;&#167; 2(a)(1), 2(a)(3) and 3 of the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 671, making it a crime for any person knowingly or willfully to advocate the overthrow or destruction of the Government of the United States by force or violence, to organize or help to organize any group which does so, or to conspire to do so, do not violate the First Amendment or other provisions of the Bill of Rights and do not violate the First or Fifth Amendments because of indefiniteness.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/494/case.html#495"">341 U. S. 495</a></span>-499,  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/494/case.html#517"">341 U. S. 517</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. Petitioners, leaders of the Communist Party in this country, were indicted in a federal district court under &#167; 3 of the Smith Act for willfully and knowingly conspiring (1) to organize as the Communist Party a group of persons to teach and advocate the overthrow and destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence, and (2) knowingly and willfully to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing and destroying the Government of the United States by force and violence.  The trial judge instructed the jury that they could not convict unless they found that petitioners intended to overthrow the Government ""as speedily as circumstances would permit,"" but that, if they so found, then, as a matter of law, there was sufficient danger of a substantive evil that Congress has a right to prevent to justify application of the statute under the First Amendment.  Petitioners were convicted, and the convictions were sustained by the Court of Appeals.  This Court granted certiorari, limited to the questions:  (1) Whether either &#167; 2 or &#167; 3 of the Smith Act, inherently or as construed and applied in the instant case, violates the First Amendment and other provisions of the Bill of Rights, and (2) whether either &#167; 2 or &#167; 3, inherently or as construed and applied in the instant case, violates the First and Fifth Amendments because of indefiniteness.</p>

		<h4>Facts</h4>		<div>
						
			Dennis was convicted of conspiring with other Communist Party leaders to overthrow the government by force or violence under the Smith Act. This law generally prohibited any conspiracy to advocate or teach the overthrow of the government by force or violence or to organize people to perform such advocacy or teaching. The Communist Party literature and public statements clearly pursued these goals, and it was a tightly controlled, highly disciplined organization that permitted no internal dissent. It was shown to be skilled at infiltrating strategic positions as well as at using aliases and language with multiple meanings.

										<p>
					The government has a compelling interest in preventing its overthrow by force or violence, so it is justified in placing some limits on speech to protect that interest, notwithstanding the First Amendment. Whether an attempt to overthrow the government poses a clear and present danger to it should not be determined according to whether such an attempt will be likely to be successful. Instead, the appropriate standard is whether the gravity of the evil, discounted by its improbability, warrants a restriction on free speech that is needed to avoid the danger. A clear and present danger existed here, taking into account the strength and sophistication of the organization as well as the unstable nature of governments around the world, tensions between the U.S. and Communist countries, and recent revolutions abroad in similar situations.

		<h4>Case Commentary</h4>
		<div>
			The clear and present danger test used in this early First Amendment decision no longer holds significant value and is largely useful from a historical perspective, showing how the doctrine in this area has evolved. It also is curious what courts have found to constitute clear and present dangers, which often seem relatively harmless in hindsight.

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 352</p></b><p><b>Argued April 24, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided June 4, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 593</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>In a civil action brought by the United States against appellant, a domestic corporation, to enjoin alleged violations of the Sherman Act, the complaint charged that appellant had combined and conspired with a British corporation and a French corporation, in each of which it had a financial interest, to restrain interstate and foreign commerce in the manufacture and sale of antifriction bearings.  The District Court found that, under agreements between them the corporations had allocated trade territories among themselves; fixed prices on products of one sold in the territory of the others; cooperated to protect each other's markets and to eliminate outside competition, and participated in cartels to restrict imports to, and exports from, the United States.  The court concluded that appellant had violated the Sherman Act as charged, and entered a comprehensive decree designed to bar future violations.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. The District Court's material findings of fact are not ""clearly erroneous,"" and are accepted here.  Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., 52(a).  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/593/case.html#596"">341 U. S. 596</a></span>-597.</p>
<p>2. The opinion of the District Court sufficiently complies with the requirements of Rule 52(a) relative to findings of fact and conclusions of law.  P. 597,  <a href='#F7' name='T7'>n</a> 7.</p>
<p>3. Agreements between legally separate persons and companies to suppress competition among themselves cannot be justified by characterizing the project as a ""joint venture.""  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/593/case.html#597"">341 U. S. 597</a></span>-598.</p>
<p>(a) Agreements providing for an aggregation of trade restraints such as those existing in this case are prohibited by the Act, whether or not incidental to a ""joint venture.""  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/593/case.html#598"">341 U. S. 598</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) Common ownership or control of the contracting corporations does not liberate them from the impact of the antitrust laws.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/593/case.html#598"">341 U. S. 598</a></span>.</p>
<p>4. Nor can the restraints be justified as reasonable steps taken to implement a valid trademark licensing system, since the trademark provisions of the agreements were secondary to the central purpose of allocating trade territory, and since the agreements provided </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""594"">Page 341 U. S. 594</a></p><p> for control of the manufacture and sale of antifriction bearings, whether carrying the trademark or not.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/593/case.html#598"">341 U. S. 598</a></span>-599.</p>
<p>(a) A trademark cannot lawfully be used as a device for violating the Sherman Act, and its use therefor is penalized by the Trade Mark Act of 1946.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/593/case.html#599"">341 U. S. 599</a></span>.</p>
<p>5. The suggestion that what appellant has done is reasonable in view of current foreign trade conditions, and that therefore the Sherman Act should not he enforced in this case, is rejected.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/593/case.html#599"">341 U. S. 599</a></span>.</p>
<p>6. The decree of the District Court properly enjoined continuation or repetition of the conduct which it found to be illegal.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/593/case.html#600"">341 U. S. 600</a></span>.</p>
<p>7. The relief which a district court may grant in a Sherman Act ease need not be confined to the narrow limits of the proven violation.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/593/case.html#600"">341 U. S. 600</a></span>.</p>
<p>8. The District Court should not have ordered appellant to divest itself of its stockholdings and all other financial interests in the British and French corporations, and the decree is modified so as to eliminate provisions directed to that end.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/593/case.html#600"">341 U. S. 600</a></span>-601.</p>
<p>83 F.Supp. 284 modified and affirmed.</p>
<p>In a civil action brought by the United States against appellant, to restrain alleged violations of the Sherman Act, the District Court found that appellant had violated the Act, and a decree of injunction was entered. 83 F.Supp. 284. On direct appeal to this Court, the decree is <em>modified and, as modified, affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/593/case.html#601"">341 U. S. 601</a></span>.</p>

Fetter</p></b><p><b>No. 355</p></b><p><b>Argued March 1-2, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided June 4, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 609</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Appellant administrator brought this action in a Wisconsin state court to recover damages for the death of a decedent who was fatally injured in an automobile accident in Illinois.  The complaint was based on the Illinois wrongful death statute, and named as defendants the allegedly negligent driver and an insurance company.  Appellant, the decedent, and the individual defendant were residents of Wisconsin; appellant had been appointed administrator under Wisconsin laws, and the insurance company was a Wisconsin corporation.  The trial court dismissed the complaint, pursuant to a Wisconsin statute which creates a right of action only for deaths caused in that State, and which establishes a local public policy against Wisconsin courts' entertaining suits brought under the wrongful death acts of other states.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the statutory policy of Wisconsin which excludes from its courts this Illinois cause of action is in contravention of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/609/case.html#610"">341 U. S. 610</a></span>-614.</p>
<p>(a) The Illinois statute is a ""public act"" within the meaning of the federal constitutional provision that ""Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts . . . of every other State.""  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/609/case.html#611"">341 U. S. 611</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) Wisconsin cannot escape its constitutional obligation to enforce the rights and duties validly created under the laws of other states by the simple device of removing jurisdiction from courts otherwise competent.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/609/case.html#611"">341 U. S. 611</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) Wisconsin's policy against entertaining suits under the wrongful death acts of other states must give way, in the circumstances of this case, to the strong unifying principle embodied in the Full Faith and Credit Clause looking toward maximum enforcement in each state of the obligations or rights created or recognized by the statutes of sister states.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/609/case.html#611"">341 U. S. 611</a></span>-613.</p>
<p>(d) Assuming that the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em> might, under some circumstances, justify a forum state in refusing to accord full faith and credit to acts of sister states, the Wisconsin statutory policy cannot be considered as an application of that doctrine, since this case is not one which lacks a close relationship with Wisconsin.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/609/case.html#612"">341 U. S. 612</a></span>-613.</p>
<p>257 Wis. 35, 42 N.W.2d 452, reversed. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""610"">Page 341 U. S. 610</a></p><p></p>
<p>Appellant's action in a Wisconsin court, to recover damages for a wrongful death arising out of an accident which occurred in Illinois, was dismissed pursuant to the provisions of a Wisconsin statute.  The State Supreme Court affirmed.  257 Wis. 35, 42 N.W.2d 452.  On appeal to this Court, <em>reversed and remanded,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/609/case.html#614"">341 U. S. 614</a></span>.</p>

Alexandria</p></b><p><b>No. 399</p></b><p><b>Argued March 7-8, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided June 4, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 622</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>A so-called ""Green River ordinance"" of a municipality forbids the practice of going in and upon private residences for the purpose of soliciting orders for the sale of goods without prior consent of the owners or occupants.  Appellant, representing a foreign corporation, was engaged in door-to-door soliciting of subscriptions for nationally known magazines and periodicals.  Subscriptions were acknowledged by a card sent from the home office of the corporation, and the publications were delivered by the publishers in interstate commerce through the mails.  Appellant was convicted of a violation of the ordinance solely because he had not obtained the prior consent of the owners or occupants of the residences he solicited.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. The ordinance is not invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/622/case.html#629"">341 U. S. 629</a></span>-633.</p>
<p>(a) The ordinance can be characterized as prohibitory of appellant's legitimate business of obtaining subscriptions to periodicals only in the limited sense of subscriptions by house-to-house canvass without invitation.  It leaves open the usual methods of solicitation -- by radio, periodicals, mail and local agencies.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/622/case.html#631"">341 U. S. 631</a></span>-632.</p>
<p>(b) The Constitution's protection of property rights does not render a state or city impotent to guard its citizens against the annoyances of life because the regulation may restrict the manner of doing a legitimate business.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/622/case.html#632"">341 U. S. 632</a></span>-633.</p>
<p>2. The ordinance does not so burden or impede interstate commerce as to violate the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/622/case.html#633"">341 U. S. 633</a></span>-641.</p>
<p>(a) The ordinance does not discriminate against interstate business and is a valid local regulation of solicitation.  <em>Hood & Sons v. Du Mond,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/336/525/case.html"">336 U. S. 525</a></span>, and <em>Dean Milk Co. v. Madison,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/349/case.html"">340 U. S. 349</a></span>, distinguished.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/622/case.html#633"">341 U. S. 633</a></span>-641.</p>
<p>(b) Appellant, as a publishers' representative or in his own right as a door-to-door canvasser, is no more free to violate local regulations to protect privacy than are other solicitors.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/622/case.html#637"">341 U. S. 637</a></span>-641. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""623"">Page 341 U. S. 623</a></p><p></p>
<p>(c) When there is a reasonable basis for legislation to protect the social, as distinguished from the economic, welfare of a community, it is not for this Court, because of the Commerce Clause, to deny the exercise locally of the sovereign power of the state.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/622/case.html#640"">341 U. S. 640</a></span>-641.</p>
<p>3. The ordinance does not abridge the freedom of speech and press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/622/case.html#641"">341 U. S. 641</a></span>-645.</p>
<p>(a) The fact that periodicals are sold does not put them beyond the protection of the First Amendment.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/622/case.html#641"">341 U. S. 641</a></span>-642.</p>
<p>(b) The constitutional guaranties of free speech and free press are not absolutes.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/622/case.html#642"">341 U. S. 642</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) <em>Martin v. Struthers,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/319/141/case.html"">319 U. S. 141</a></span>; <em>Marsh v. Alabama,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/326/501/case.html"">326 U. S. 501</a></span>; and <em>Tucker v. Texas,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/326/517/case.html"">326 U. S. 517</a></span>, distinguished.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/622/case.html#642"">341 U. S. 642</a></span>-644.</p>
<p>(d) It would be a misuse of the great guaranties of free speech and free press to use them to force a community to admit the solicitors of publications to the home premises of its residents.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/622/case.html#645"">341 U. S. 645</a></span>.</p>
<p>217 La. 820, 47 So.2d 553, affirmed. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""624"">Page 341 U. S. 624</a></p><p></p>

Hardyman</p></b><p><b>No. 217</p></b><p><b>Argued January 8-9, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided June 4, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 651</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>A complaint in an action to recover damages under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 47(3) alleged that the plaintiffs were members of a political club which planned a meeting to adopt a resolution opposing the Marshall Plan; that defendants conspired to deprive plaintiffs of their rights as citizens of the United States peaceably to assemble and to equal privileges and immunities under the laws of the United States; that, in furtherance of the conspiracy, defendants proceeded to plaintiffs' meeting place and, by threats and violence, broke up the meeting, thus interfering with the right of plaintiffs to petition the Government for redress of grievances, and that defendants did not interfere or conspire to interfere with meetings of other groups with whose opinions defendants agreed. There was no averment that defendants were state officers or acted under color of state law.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  The complaint did not state a cause of action under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 47(3).  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/651/case.html#652"">341 U. S. 652</a></span>-663.</p>
<p>(a) Assuming, without deciding, that the facts alleged show that defendants deprived plaintiffs ""of having and exercising"" a federal right, the facts alleged did not show that the conspiracy was ""for the purpose of depriving [them] of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws,"" and therefore, in this case, a cause of action under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 47(3) was not stated.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/651/case.html#660"">341 U. S. 660</a></span>-663.</p>
<p>(b) Section 47(3) does not attempt to reach a conspiracy to deprive one of rights unless it is a deprivation of equality, of ""equal protection of the law,"" or of ""equal privileges and immunities under the law.""  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/651/case.html#660"">341 U. S. 660</a></span>-661.</p>
<p>(c) The fact that the defendants broke up plaintiffs' meeting but did not interfere with the meetings of those who shared defendants' views is not inequality before the law unless there is some manipulation of the law or its agencies to give sanction or sanctuary for doing so.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/651/case.html#661"">341 U. S. 661</a></span>.</p>
<p>(d) Although plaintiffs' rights were invaded, disregarded, and lawlessly violated, neither their rights nor their equality of rights under the law have been, or were intended to be, denied or impaired.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/651/case.html#661"">341 U. S. 661</a></span>-662.</p>
<p>183 F.2d 308, reversed. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""652"">Page 341 U. S. 652</a></p><p></p>
<p>In an action brought by respondents against petitioners to recover damages under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 47(3), the District Court dismissed the complaint.  80 F.Supp. 501.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  183 F.2d 308.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 809.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/651/case.html#663"">341 U. S. 663</a></span>.</p>

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Labor Board v. International Rice Milling Co., Inc., 341 U.S.  665 (1951)</h3><p><b>Labor Board v. International Rice Milling Co., Inc.</p></b><p><b>No. 313</p></b><p><b>Argued February 27, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided June 4, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 665</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Although the union here involved was not certified or recognized as the representative of the employees of a certain mill engaged in interstate commerce, its agents picketed the mill with the object of securing recognition of the union as the collective bargaining representative of the mill's employees.  In the course of their picketing, the agents sought to influence two men in charge of a truck of a neutral customer to refuse, in the course of their employment, to go to the mill for an order of goods, and they threw rocks at the truck when it proceeded to the mill by a detour.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  such action did not violate the ""secondary boycott"" provisions of &#167; 8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/665/case.html#666"">341 U. S. 666</a></span>-674.</p>
<p>(a) The union's picketing and its encouragement of the men on the truck did not amount to such an inducement or encouragement to ""concerted"" activities as the section proscribes.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/665/case.html#670"">341 U. S. 670</a></span>-671.</p>
<p>(b) It is the object of union encouragement that is proscribed by &#167; 8(b)(4), rather than the means adopted to make it felt, and violence on the picket line is not material in this case, since the complaint was not based upon that violence as such, and did not rely upon &#167; 8(b)(1)(A).  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/665/case.html#672"">341 U. S. 672</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) Congress did not seek by &#167; 8(b)(4) to interfere with ordinary strikes.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/665/case.html#672"">341 U. S. 672</a></span>-673.</p>
<p>(d) By &#167; 13, Congress has made it clear that &#167; 8(b)(4), and all other parts of the Act which otherwise might be read so as to interfere with, impede or diminish a union's traditional right to strike, may be so read only if such interference, impediment, or diminution is ""specifically provided for"" in the Act.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/665/case.html#673"">341 U. S. 673</a></span>.</p>
<p>183 F.2d 21 reversed.</p>
<p>The National Labor Relations Board dismissed a complaint of an alleged violation of &#167; 8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""666"">Page 341 U. S. 666</a></p><p> Management Relations Act, 1947. 84 N.L.R.B. 360.  The Court of Appeals set aside the dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings.  183 F.2d 21.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 902.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/665/case.html#674"">341 U. S. 674</a></span>.</p>

Denver Building &</p></b><p><b>Construction Trades Council</p></b><p><b>No. 393</p></b><p><b>Argued February 27, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided June 4, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 675</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. A decision of a district court in a preliminary proceeding under &#167; 10(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, that the activities complained of did not affect interstate commerce and were therefore not within the jurisdiction of the Board, was not <em>res judicata</em> of that issue in a proceeding on the merits under &#167; 10(e) and (f).  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html#681"">341 U. S. 681</a></span>-683.</p>
<p>2. A subcontractor engaged by a general contractor to do the electrical work on a building being constructed purchased $86,560 of raw materials during the year, $55,745 of which were purchased outside the state.  It performed no services outside the state, but shipped $5,000 of its products outside the state.  It had expended $315 for labor and $350 for materials on the project when its services were terminated because of a strike.  Both the National Labor Relations Board and the Court of Appeals found that the strike affected interstate commerce.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  this conclusion is sustained.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html#683"">341 U. S. 683</a></span>-685.</p>
<p>(a) The fact that the instant building, after its completion, might be used only for local purposes does not alter the fact that its construction, as distinguished from its later use, affected interstate commerce.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html#684"">341 U. S. 684</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) The maxim <em>de minimis non curat lex</em> did not require the Board to refuse to take jurisdiction of the instant case.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html#685"">341 U. S. 685</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. The National Labor Relations Board found that, by engaging in a strike an object of which was to force the general contractor on a construction project to terminate its contract with a subcontractor employing nonunion labor on the project, respondent labor organization committed an unfair labor practice within the meaning of &#167; 8(b)(4)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  this finding is sustained.  <em>Labor Board v. Rice Milling Co., ante</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/665/case.html"">341 U. S. 665</a></span>, distinguished.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html#685"">341 U. S. 685</a></span>-692.</p>
<p>(a) It was an object of the strike to force the contractor to terminate the contract of the electrical subcontractor.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html#687"">341 U. S. 687</a></span>-689. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""676"">Page 341 U. S. 676</a></p><p></p>
<p>(b) A strike with such an object is an unfair labor practice within the meaning of &#167; 8(b)(4)(A), even though that may not be the sole object.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html#689"">341 U. S. 689</a></span>-690.</p>
<p>(c) Section 8(c) safeguarding freedom of speech has no significant application to the picket's placard in this case, and does not immunize respondent's action against the specific provisions of &#167; 8(b)(4)(A).  <em>See Electrical Workers v. Labor Board, post,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/694/case.html"">341 U. S. 694</a></span>.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html#690"">341 U. S. 690</a></span>-691.</p>
<p>(d) The Board's findings on questions of fact in this field are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, and the Board's interpretation and application of the Act in doubtful situations are entitled to weight.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html#691"">341 U. S. 691</a></span>-692.</p>
<p>(e) As applied in this case, the views of the Board conform with the dual congressional objective of preserving the right of labor organizations to bring pressure to bear on offending employers in primary labor disputes and of shielding unoffending employers and others from pressures in controversies not their own.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html#692"">341 U. S. 692</a></span>.</p>
<p>87 U.S.App.D.C. 293, 186 F.2d 326, reversed.</p>

Labor Board, 341 U.S.  694 (1951)</h3><p><b>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v.</p></b><p><b>National Labor Relations Board</p></b><p><b>No. 108</p></b><p><b>Argued February 26-27, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided June 4, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 694</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>By peaceful picketing, the agent of a labor organization induced union employees of a carpentry subcontractor on a construction project to engage in a strike in the course of their employment.  An object of such inducement was to force the general contractor to terminate its contract with the electrical subcontractor, who was employing nonunion workmen.  The National Labor Relations Board found that the labor organization and its agent (petitioners here) had committed an unfair labor practice within the meaning of &#167; 8(b)(4)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, and ordered them to cease and desist.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  this finding and the order are sustained.  <em>See Labor Board v. Denver Building Trades Council, ante,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/675/case.html"">341 U. S. 675</a></span>.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/694/case.html#695"">341 U. S. 695</a></span>-706.</p>
<p>1. The actions complained of had sufficient effect upon interstate commerce to sustain the jurisdiction of the Board.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/694/case.html#699"">341 U. S. 699</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. The findings demonstrate that the picketing was directed at the union employees of the carpentry subcontractor to induce them to strike, and thus force the carpentry subcontractor to force the general contractor to terminate the contract of the electrical subcontractor.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/694/case.html#699"">341 U. S. 699</a></span>-700.</p>
<p>3. It was sufficient that an objective, although not necessarily the only objective, of the picketing was to force the general contractor to terminate the contract of the electrical subcontractor.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/694/case.html#700"">341 U. S. 700</a></span>.</p>
<p>4. Section 8(c) does not immunize peaceful picketing which induces a secondary boycott made unlawful by &#167; 8(b)(4).  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/694/case.html#700"">341 U. S. 700</a></span>-705.</p>
<p>5. The prohibition of inducement or encouragement of secondary pressure by &#167; 8(b)(4)(A) carries no unconstitutional abridgment of free speech.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/694/case.html#705"">341 U. S. 705</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""695"">Page 341 U. S. 695</a></p><p></p>
<p>6. The order issued by the Board in this case properly enjoined petitioners from exerting this pressure upon the electrical subcontractor through other employers, as well as through the general contractor and the carpentry subcontractor.  Pp. 705-706.</p>
<p>181 F.2d 34, affirmed.</p>
<p>The National Labor Relations Board found that petitioners had committed an unfair labor practice within the meaning of &#167; 8(b)(4)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, and ordered them to cease and desist.  82 N.L.R.B. 1028.  The Court of Appeals ordered enforcement.  181 F.2d 34.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 902.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/694/case.html#706"">341 U. S. 706</a></span>.</p>

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Carpenters Union v. Labor Board, 341 U.S.  707 (1951)</h3><p><b>Carpenters Union v. Labor Board</p></b><p><b>No. 85</p></b><p><b>Argued February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided June 4, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 707</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>On the day before the effective date of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, amending the National Labor Relations Act, a union ordered its members, who were working on a dwelling renovation project, to strike.  They did so, and the strike continued after the effective date of the amendment.  One of the objects was to force the owner of the dwelling to cancel a contract for the installation of wall and floor coverings by a merchant using nonunion workmen in their installation.  The National Labor Relations Board found that the union and its agent (petitioners here) had engaged in an unfair labor practice within the meaning of &#167; 8(b)(4)(A) of the Act and ordered them to cease and desist.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  its finding and order are sustained.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/707/case.html#708"">341 U. S. 708</a></span>-715.</p>
<p>1. On the record in this case, the actions complained of had sufficient effect on interstate commerce to sustain the Board's jurisdiction.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/707/case.html#712"">341 U. S. 712</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. Section 8(c) is not applicable.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/707/case.html#712"">341 U. S. 712</a></span>-713.</p>
<p>3. It is enough that one of the objects of the action complained of was to force the owner of the dwelling to cancel the merchant's contract, and it does not immunize such action from &#167; 8(b)(4)(A) to show that another object was to enforce a rule of the union that its members should not work on a project on which nonunion men were employed.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/707/case.html#713"">341 U. S. 713</a></span>.</p>
<p>4. It is immaterial that the strike had its origin before the effective date of the amended Act, since it was prolonged after the effective date, for the same objective.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/707/case.html#713"">341 U. S. 713</a></span>-714.</p>
<p>5. The case has not been rendered moot by the completion of the renovation project.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/707/case.html#715"">341 U. S. 715</a></span>.</p>
<p>181 F.2d 126, affirmed.</p>
<p>The National Labor Relations Board found that petitioners had committed an unfair labor practice within the meaning of &#167; 8(b)(4)(A) of the National Labor Relations </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""708"">Page 341 U. S. 708</a></p><p> Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, and ordered them to cease and desist.  80 N.L.R.B. 533.  The Court of Appeals ordered enforcement.  181 F.2d 126.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 902.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/707/case.html#715"">341 U. S. 715</a></span>.</p>

Board of Public Works of Los Angeles</p></b><p><b>No. 453</p></b><p><b>Argued April 25, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided June 4, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 716</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. The Federal Constitution does not forbid a municipality to require its employees to execute affidavits disclosing whether or not they are or ever have been members of the Communist Party or the Communist Political Association.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/716/case.html#720"">341 U. S. 720</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. In 1941, the California Legislature amended the Charter of the City of Los Angeles so as to provide, in substance, that no person shall hold or retain or be eligible for any public office or employment in the service of the City (1) who advises, advocates or teaches the overthrow by force or violence of the State or Federal Government or belongs to an organization which does so, or (2) who, within the five years prior to the effective date, had so advised, advocated or taught or had belonged to an organization which did so.  In 1948, the City passed an ordinance requiring each of its officers and employees to take an oath that he has not, within the five years preceding the effective date of the ordinance, does not now, and will not while in the service of the City, advise, advocate or teach the overthrow by force, violence or other unlawful means, of the State or Federal Government or belong to an organization which does so or has done so within such five-year period.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  The ordinance is not a bill of attainder or <em>ex post facto</em> law, nor, as here construed, does it violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/716/case.html#720"">341 U. S. 720</a></span>-724.</p>
<p>(a) The Charter amendment is valid under the Federal Constitution to the extent that it bars from the City's public service persons who, since its adoption in 1941, advise, advocate or teach the violent overthrow of the Government or who are or become affiliated with any group doing so, since the provisions, thus operating prospectively, are a reasonable regulation to protect the municipal service.  The question of its validity insofar as it purported to apply retrospectively for a five-year period prior to its effective date is not here involved.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/716/case.html#720"">341 U. S. 720</a></span>-721.</p>
<p>(b) The ordinance clearly is not <em>ex post facto,</em> since the activity covered by the oath had been proscribed by the Charter in the same terms, for the same purpose, and to the same effect over </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""717"">Page 341 U. S. 717</a></p><p> seven years before, and two years prior to the period covered by the oath.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/716/case.html#721"">341 U. S. 721</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) The ordinance is not a bill of attainder, since no punishment is imposed by a general regulation which merely provides standards of qualification and eligibility for public employment.  <em>Lovett v. United States,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/328/303/case.html"">328 U. S. 303</a></span>, distinguished.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/716/case.html#722"">341 U. S. 722</a></span>-723.</p>
<p>(d) It is assumed here that the oath will not be construed as affecting adversely persons who during their affiliation with a proscribed organization were innocent of its purpose, or those who severed their relations with any such organization when its character became apparent, or those who were affiliated with organizations which were not engaged in proscribed activities at the time of their affiliation; and that, if this interpretation of the oath is correct, the City will give those petitioners who heretofore refused to take the oath an opportunity to take it as interpreted and resume their employment.  As thus construed, the requirement of the oath does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/716/case.html#723"">341 U. S. 723</a></span>-724.</p>
<p>98 Cal. App. 2d 493, 220 P. 2d 958, affirmed.</p>
<p>In a suit by discharged employees of a city for reinstatement and unpaid salaries, the state court denied relief.  98 Cal.App. 2d 493, 220 P. 2d 958.  This Court granted certiorari. 340 U.S. 941.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'>341 U. S. 724</span>.</p>

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 565</p></b><p><b>Argued March 26-27, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 28, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 412</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>After extensive hearings on, and demonstrations of, three different methods of color television transmission, the Federal Communications Commission issued an order which, in effect, permits use of the method of Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and excludes use of others.  This order was based upon findings that the CBS method was the best presently available, and had reached a state of development which justified its acceptance to the exclusion of others, though color telecasts by the CBS method could not be received either in color or in black and white on the millions of existing black and white receivers without costly adaptations.  Subsequently, the Commission declined to reopen the proceedings at the request of Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which claimed to have made great advances toward a method of color television transmission which could be received in black and white on existing black and white receivers without any adaptation.  The District Court dismissed a suit by RCA to enjoin and set aside the Commission's order.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. The District Court did not fail to review the record as a whole in determining that the Commission's order was supported by substantial evidence.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/412/case.html#414"">341 U. S. 414</a></span>-416.</p>
<p>2. The District Court did not misapprehend or misapply the proper judicial standard in holding that the Commission's order was not arbitrary or against the public interest as a matter of law.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/412/case.html#416"">341 U. S. 416</a></span>-420.</p>
<p>(a) Viewing the record as a whole, the Commission did not err as a matter of law in concluding that the CBS color method had reached a state of development which justified its acceptance to the exclusion of others.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/412/case.html#416"">341 U. S. 416</a></span>-419.</p>
<p>(b) The Commission's determination, after hearing evidence on all sides, that the CBS method will provide the public with color television of good quality and that television viewers should be given an opportunity to receive it if they so desire, was not capricious.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/412/case.html#419"">341 U. S. 419</a></span>-420. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""413"">Page 341 U. S. 413</a></p><p></p>
<p>(c) Courts should not overrule an administrative decision merely because they disagree with its wisdom.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/412/case.html#420"">341 U. S. 420</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. Whether the Commission should have reopened its proceedings to permit RCA to offer proof of new discoveries for its method was a question within the discretion of the Commission, and that discretion was not abused.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/412/case.html#420"">341 U. S. 420</a></span>-421.</p>
<p>95 F.Supp. 660 affirmed.</p>
<p>A three-judge district court sustained an order of the Federal Communications Commission prescribing standards for color television transmission.  95 F.Supp. 660.  On direct appeal to this Court under 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1253 and 2101(b), <em>affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/412/case.html#421"">341 U. S. 421</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""414"">Page 341 U. S. 414</a></p><p></p>

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Standard Oil Co. v. New Jersey, 341 U.S.  428 (1951)</h3><p><b>Standard Oil Co. v. New Jersey</p></b><p><b>No. 384</p></b><p><b>Argued March 5, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 28, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 428</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Under the New Jersey Escheat Act, proceedings were instituted in a state court to escheat to the State certain personal property, including unclaimed shares of appellant corporation's stock and unclaimed dividends.  Personal service was made on appellant, and notice identifying the property and the last-known owners was given by publication.  Appellant is a New Jersey corporation, but has no office or place of business in the State except a statutory registered office.  It has no tangible property in the State except its stock and transfer books.  The stock was issued and the dividends held in other states, and the last-known addresses of the owners were chiefly in other states and foreign countries.  Over appellant's objection to the validity of the proceedings under the Federal Constitution, it was decreed that the unclaimed stock and dividends had escheated to the State.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the judgment is sustained.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/428/case.html#429"">341 U. S. 429</a></span>-443.</p>
<p>1. The notice required by the statute, as construed by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, and which was given, was adequate to bind interested persons.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/428/case.html#432"">341 U. S. 432</a></span>-435.</p>
<p>2. The statute does not impair the obligation of contracts in violation of Art. I, &#167; 10, 1, of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/428/case.html#435"">341 U. S. 435</a></span>-436.</p>
<p>3. Regardless of theories as to their situs, stock certificates and undelivered dividends may be abandoned property subject to the disposition of the domiciliary state of the corporation when the whereabouts of the owners are unknown for such lengths of time, and under such circumstances, as permit a declaration of abandonment.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/428/case.html#437"">341 U. S. 437</a></span>-442.</p>
<p>(a) The fact that appellant is a New Jersey corporation, amenable to process through its designated agent at its registered office in New Jersey, gave New Jersey power to seize the <em>res</em> here involved -- <em>i.e.,</em> the ""debts or demands due to the escheated estate.""  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/428/case.html#438"">341 U. S. 438</a></span>-439.</p>
<p>(b) No matter where appellant's assets may be, since it is its obligation to pay to the escheated estate that is taken, personal service on appellant effects a seizure of that obligation.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/428/case.html#439"">341 U. S. 439</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""429"">Page 341 U. S. 429</a></p><p></p>
<p>(c) Since choses in action have no tangible existence, control over them can only arise from control over the persons whose relationships are the source of the rights and obligations.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/428/case.html#439"">341 U. S. 439</a></span>-440.</p>
<p>(d) Since the New Jersey court had jurisdiction of appellant by personal service and of the owners of the stock and dividends through notice or service by publication, New Jersey had power to act on their rights respecting these choses in action within constitutional limits.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/428/case.html#440"">341 U. S. 440</a></span>-441.</p>
<p>4. Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Federal Constitution, the debts and demands against appellant represented by the stock and dividends cannot be taken from appellant by another state when they have already been taken from appellant by a valid judgment of New Jersey.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/428/case.html#442"">341 U. S. 442</a></span>-443.</p>
<p>5 N.J. 281, 74 A.2d 565, affirmed.</p>
<p>A New Jersey court decreed escheat to the certain unclaimed stock of appellant and of unclaimed dividends.  2 N.J.Super. 442, 64 A.2d 386; 5 N.J.Super. 460, 68 A.2d 499.  The Supreme Court of New Jersey affirmed.  5 N.J. 281, 74 A.2d 565.  On appeal to this Court, <em>affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/428/case.html#443"">341 U. S. 443</a></span>.</p>

McGrath</p></b><p><b>No. 298</p></b><p><b>Argued February 28, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 28, 1951*</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 446</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>After ""transfers"" of assets of German nationals had been forbidden by Executive Orders Nos. 8785 and 8389, issued by the President pursuant to &#167; 5(b) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, petitioners, American holders of claims against German banks, levied attachments on the debtors' accounts in a New York bank and prosecuted the claims to judgments in New York state courts.  Subsequently, the Alien Property Custodian issued Vesting Orders vesting in himself the right, title and interest of the debtors in the accounts.  Due to the outstanding attachment levies, the New York bank refused to release the accounts, and the Custodian sued in a federal district court for a declaratory judgment that petitioners ""obtained no lien or other interest in"" the attached accounts, and that the Custodian was entitled to possession of the funds in the accounts.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the Custodian was not entitled to the relief sought.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/446/case.html#447"">341 U. S. 447</a></span>-449,  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/446/case.html#464"">341 U. S. 464</a></span>.</p>
<p>1. Under New York law, petitioners have judgments, secured by attachments on balances owned by German aliens, good as against the debtors, but subject to federal licensing before they can be satisfied by transfer of title or possession.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/446/case.html#449"">341 U. S. 449</a></span>-452.</p>
<p>2. The attachment levies in this case are not nullities as against the right, title and interest of the German banks.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/446/case.html#452"">341 U. S. 452</a></span>-459.</p>
<p>(a) Attachments such as these have been treated as valid by consistent administrative practice, and are not to be deemed invalid by retroactive application of General Ruling No. 12 specifically designating an attachment levy as a ""transfer"" prohibited by Executive Order No. 8389.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/446/case.html#452"">341 U. S. 452</a></span>-459.</p>
<p>3. The attachment proceedings pursued in this case are not inconsistent with the federal program for control of alien property, </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""447"">Page 341 U. S. 447</a></p><p> sine they do not purport to control the Custodian in the exercise of the federal licensing power or in his power to vest the res for purposes of administration.  <em>Propper v. Clark,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/337/472/case.html"">337 U. S. 472</a></span>, distinguished.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/446/case.html#459"">341 U. S. 459</a></span>-463.</p>
<p>4. As against the German debtors, the attachments and the judgments they secure are valid under New York law, and they cannot be cancelled or annulled under a Vesting Order by which the Alien Property Custodian takes over only the right, title and interest of those debtors in the accounts.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/446/case.html#463"">341 U. S. 463</a></span>-464.</p>
<p>182 F.2d 349, reversed.</p>
<p>In declaratory judgment actions against petitioners by the Alien Property Custodian, the District Court granted the relief sought.  82 F.Supp. 740.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  182 F.2d 349.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 882.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/446/case.html#464"">341 U. S. 464</a></span>.</p>

McGrath</p></b><p><b>No. 299</p></b><p><b>Argued February 28, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 28, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 471</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>After ""transfers"" of assets of German nationals had been forbidden by Executive Orders issued pursuant to the Trading with the Enemy Act, petitioners, American holders of claims against a German bank, levied attachments on accounts of the debtor in a New York bank and prosecuted the claims to judgments in New York state courts.  The Alien Property Custodian served on the New York bank Vesting Orders and also a ""turnover directive"" requiring that all funds in the accounts be turned over to him ""to be held, administered, and accounted for as provided by law.""  In an action in the Federal District Court, the Custodian sought a declaratory judgment that he is ""entitled to possession"" of the funds in the accounts.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the Custodian is entitled to possession of the funds and to administer them.  <em>Zittman v. McGrath, ante,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/446/case.html"">341 U. S. 446</a></span>, distinguished.  Pp. 472- <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/471/case.html#474"">341 U. S. 474</a></span>.</p>
<p>182 F.2d 349 affirmed.</p>
<p>In declaratory judgment actions against petitioners by the Alien Property Custodian, the District Court granted the relief sought.  82 F.Supp. 740.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  182 F.2d 349.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 882.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/471/case.html#474"">341 U.

McGrath</p></b><p><b>No. 324</p></b><p><b>Argued February 28, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 28, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 475</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Petitioner is the sheriff who levied the attachments against accounts of German nationals ""frozen"" under Executive Orders Nos. 8785 and 8389, which were involved in the two preceding decisions (<em>Zittman. v. McGrath, ante</em> pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/446/case.html"">341 U. S. 446</a></span>,  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/471/case.html"">341 U. S. 471</a></span>).  His claim for his fees was denied by the courts below incidentally to their denial of the rights asserted by the attaching creditors.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the judgment is reversed insofar as the fees of the sheriff relate to the accounts to which the Custodian was held not entitled to possession, and affirmed insofar as they relate to the accounts to which the Custodian was held entitled to possession -- without prejudice to certain rights of the sheriff as indicated in the opinion.  Pp. 475-478.</p>
<p>182 F.2d 349, affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>
<p>Petitioner's claim to his fees as sheriff were denied by the courts below incidentally to the denial of the rights asserted by the attaching creditors.  82 F.Supp. 740; 182 F.2d 349.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 882.  <em>Reversed in part and affirmed in part,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/475/case.html#478"">341 U. S. 478</a></span>.</p>

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 513</p></b><p><b>Argued April 25, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 28, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 479</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. Claiming that answers might tend to incriminate him of a federal offense, petitioner refused to answer certain questions asked him by a special federal grand jury making a comprehensive investigation of violations of numerous federal criminal statutes and conspiracies to violate them.  He had been publicly charged with being known as an underworld character and a racketeer with a 20-year police record, including a prison sentence on a narcotics charge.  The questions he refused to answer pertained to the nature of his present occupation and his contacts and connections with, and knowledge of the whereabouts of, a fugitive witness sought by the same grand jury and for whom a bench warrant had been requested.  The judge who had impaneled the grand jury and was familiar with these circumstances found no real and substantial danger of incrimination to petitioner and ordered him to answer.  Petitioner stated that he would not obey the order, and he was convicted of criminal contempt.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  The conviction is reversed.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/479/case.html#480"">341 U. S. 480</a></span>-490.</p>
<p>(a) The privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment extends not only to answers that would in themselves support a conviction under a federal criminal statute, but also to those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a federal crime.  <em>Blau v. United States,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/159/case.html"">340 U. S. 159</a></span>.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/479/case.html#486"">341 U. S. 486</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) To sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/479/case.html#486"">341 U. S. 486</a></span>-487.</p>
<p>(c) In this case, the court should have considered that the chief occupation of some persons involves evasion of federal criminal laws and that truthful answers by petitioner to the questions as to the nature of his business might have disclosed that he was engaged in such proscribed activity.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/479/case.html#487"">341 U. S. 487</a></span>-488. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""480"">Page 341 U. S. 480</a></p><p></p>
<p>(d) Answers to the questions as to his contacts and connections with the fugitive witness and knowledge of his whereabouts at the time might have exposed petitioner to peril of prosecution for federal offenses ranging from obstruction to conspiracy.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/479/case.html#488"">341 U. S. 488</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. Two weeks after his conviction of contempt and denial of bail pending appeal, petitioner filed in the District Court a paper captioned ""Petition for Reconsideration of Allowance of Bail Pending Appeal,"" accompanied by an affidavit and exhibits explaining his refusal to answer the questions and presenting facts to justify his fear that answers would tend to incriminate him.  These papers were filed in the Court of Appeals as a supplemental record on appeal, but that Court struck them from the record and affirmed the conviction.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>   the supplemental record should have been considered by the Court of Appeals, since it was actually directed to the power of the committing court to discharge the contemnor for good cause -- a power which courts should be solicitous to invoke when important constitutional objections are renewed.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/479/case.html#489"">341 U. S. 489</a></span>-490.</p>
<p>185 F.2d 617 reversed.</p>
<p>In a federal district court, petitioner was convicted of contempt for refusal to answer questions before a federal grand jury.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  185 F.2d 617.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 946.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/479/case.html#490"">341 U. S. 490</a></span>.</p>

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Hammerstein v. Superior Court, 341 U.S.  491 (1951)</h3><p><b>Hammerstein v. Superior Court pf California</p></b><p><b>No. 421</p></b><p><b>Argued March 9, 1951</p></b><p><b>Cause continued March 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>Dismissed May 28, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 491</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. The Supreme Court of California having based its denial of certiorari on petitioner's failure to appeal from the Superior Court's default judgment, this Court has no jurisdiction to review the proceedings arising from the default judgment.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/491/case.html#492"">341 U. S. 492</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. The California District Court of Appeal's denial of a writ of prohibition in this case being rested on its decision of a federal question, and not upon an independent state ground, this Court has jurisdiction to review that judgment.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/491/case.html#492"">341 U. S. 492</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. Since petitioner could have obtained review of the final adjudication of the merits of this case by appealing from the default judgment, and since the Supreme Court of California apparently refrained from taking action because of the existence of that remedy, this Court deems it advisable not to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction, and dismisses the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/491/case.html#492"">341 U. S. 492</a></span>-493.</p>
<p>Writ of certiorari, 340 U.S. 919, dismissed.</p>

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Alabama Comm'n v. Southern R. Co., 341 U.S.  341 (1951)</h3><p><b>Alabama Public Service Commission v. Southern Railway Co.</p></b><p><b>No. 395</p></b><p><b>Argued February 27-28, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 21, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 341</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Appellee applied to the Alabama Public Service Commission for a permit to discontinue certain local intrastate trains, on the ground that they were operating at a loss.  After a hearing, the Commission found that there was public need for the service, and entered an order denying the permit.  Without applying to a state court for the adequate judicial review to which it was entitled as a matter of right under state law, appellee sued in a federal court to enjoin enforcement of the Commission's order.  It alleged that its enforcement would result in irreparable injury, either through operating losses resulting from compliance or through severe penalties for violations.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  assuming that the federal court had jurisdiction, such jurisdiction should not be exercised in this case as a matter of sound equitable discretion.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/341/case.html#342"">341 U. S. 342</a></span>-351.</p>
<p>(a) The problems raised by the discontinuance of these trains cannot be resolved alone by reference to appellee's loss in their operation, but depend more upon the predominantly local factor of public need for the service rendered.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/341/case.html#347"">341 U. S. 347</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) Since adequate state court review of an administrative order based on predominantly local factors is available to appellee, intervention of a federal court is not necessary for the protection of federal rights.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/341/case.html#349"">341 U. S. 349</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) In these circumstances, under the usual rule of comity governing the exercise of equitable jurisdiction by federal courts in matters affecting the domestic policies of the states, appellee should be left to pursue through the state courts whatever rights it may have.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/341/case.html#350"">341 U. S. 350</a></span>.</p>
<p>91 F.Supp. 980, reversed.</p>
<p>In a suit by a railroad, a three-judge federal district court enjoined enforcement of an order of the Alabama Public Service Commission.  91 F.Supp. 980.  On appeal to this Court under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1253, <em>reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/341/case.html#351"">341 U. S. 351</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""342"">Page 341 U. S. 342</a></p><p></p>

Brandhove</p></b><p><b>No. 338</p></b><p><b>Argued March 1, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 21, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 367</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Respondent sued petitioners in the Federal District Court for damages under 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 43 and 47(3), alleging that, in connection with an investigation by a committee of the California Legislature, he had been deprived of rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.  Petitioners are the committee and the members thereof, all of whom are members of the legislature.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  From the allegations of the complaint, it appears that petitioners were acting in a field where legislators traditionally have power to act; and 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 43 and 47 (3) do not create civil liability for such conduct.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/367/case.html#369"">341 U. S. 369</a></span>-379.</p>
<p>(a) The privilege of legislators to be free from arrest or civil process for what they do or say in legislative proceedings has been carefully preserved in the formation of our State and National Governments.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/367/case.html#372"">341 U. S. 372</a></span>-375.</p>
<p>(b) By 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;43 and 47(3), Congress did not intend to limit this privilege by subjecting legislators to civil liability for acts done within the sphere of legislative activity.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/367/case.html#376"">341 U. S. 376</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) The privilege is not destroyed by a claim that the motives of the legislators were improper.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/367/case.html#377"">341 U. S. 377</a></span>.</p>
<p>(d) In order to find that a legislative committee's investigation has exceeded the bounds of legislative power, it must be obvious that there was a usurpation of functions exclusively vested in the Judiciary or the Executive.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/367/case.html#378"">341 U. S. 378</a></span>.</p>
<p>(e) Legislative privilege deserves greater respect in a case in which the defendants are members of the legislature than where an official acting on behalf of the legislature is sued or where the legislature seeks the affirmative aid of the courts to assert a privilege.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/367/case.html#379"">341 U. S. 379</a></span>.</p>
<p>183 F. 2d 121, reversed.</p>
<p>In an action brought by respondent against petitioners under 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 43 and 47(3), the District Court dismissed the complaint.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  183 F.2d 121.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 903.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/367/case.html#379"">341 U. S. 379</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""369"">Page 341 U. S. 369</a></p><p></p>

Calvert Distillers Corp.</p></b><p><b>Argued April 9-10,1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 21, 1951<L=|341 U.S. 384ast|>*</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 384</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>The Miller-Tydings Act exempts from the operation of the Sherman Act ""contracts or agreements prescribing minimum prices for the resale"" of specified commodities when ""contracts or agreements of that description are lawful as applied to intrastate transactions"" under local law.  Respondents, distributors of gin and whiskey in interstate commerce, have contracts or agreements with Louisiana retailers fixing minimum retail prices for respondents' products.  Louisiana law authorizes enforcement of price-fixing not only against parties to a ""contract,"" but also against nonsigners.  Petitioner, a retailer in New Orleans, refused to sign a price-fixing contract with respondents and sold respondents' products at cut-rate prices.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  Respondents were not entitled by reason of the Miller-Tydings Act to enjoin petitioner from selling their products at less than the minimum prices fixed by their schedules.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/384/case.html#385"">341 U. S. 385</a></span>-395.</p>
<p>(a) Price-fixing is unlawful <em>per se</em> under the Sherman Act.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/384/case.html#386"">341 U. S. 386</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) The Miller-Tydings Act exempts ""contracts or agreements prescribing minimum prices for the resale"" of the articles purchased, not ""contracts or agreements"" respecting the practices of noncontracting competitors of the contracting retailers.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/384/case.html#387"">341 U. S. 387</a></span>-390.</p>
<p>(c) The history of the Miller-Tydings Act supports the construction here given it.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/384/case.html#390"">341 U. S. 390</a></span>-395.</p>
<p>184 F. 2d 11, reversed.</p>
<p>The District Court enjoined petitioner from alleged unlawful price-cutting.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  184 F. 2d 11.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 928.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/384/case.html#395"">341 U. S. 395</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""385"">Page 341 U. S. 385</a></p><p></p>

Co., 341 U.S.  322 (1951)</h3><p><b>National Labor Relations Board v.</p></b><p><b>Highland Park Manufacturing Co.</p></b><p><b>No. 425</p></b><p><b>Argued April 23, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 14, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 322</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) is a ""national or international labor organization"" within the meaning of &#167; 9(h) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, and the National Labor Relations Board could not proceed against an employer at the instance of a union affiliated with CIO when the officers of CIO had not filed the non-Communist affidavits required by that section, although the affiliated union's own officers had filed such affidavits.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/322/case.html#323"">341 U. S. 323</a></span>-325.</p>
<p>2. When a court of appeals is petitioned to decree enforcement of an order of the National Labor Relations Board requiring an employer to bargain with a union and the facts regarding compliance with &#167; 9(h) are not in dispute, the employer is entitled to a judicial review of the legal question whether there has been compliance with &#167; 9(h).  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/322/case.html#325"">341 U. S. 325</a></span>-326.</p>
<p>184 F.2d 98 affirmed.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals denied enforcement of an order of the National Labor Relations Board requiring an employer to bargain with a union affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations because the officers of the latter had not filed the non-Communist affidavits required by &#167; 9(h) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 61 Stat. 146, 29 U.S.C. (Supp. III) &#167; 159(h), 184 F.2d 98.  This Court granted certiorari. 340 U.S. 927.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/322/case.html#326"">341 U. S. 326</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""323"">Page 341 U. S. 323</a></p><p></p>

Michigan Comm'n, 341 U.S.  329 (1951)</h3><p><b>Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v.</p></b><p><b>Michigan Public Service Commission</p></b><p><b>No. 486</p></b><p><b>Argued April 23, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 14, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 329</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Appellant is engaged in the transportation of natural gas by pipeline from other states into Michigan, and is subject to regulation by the Federal Power Commission under the Natural Gas Act.  Appellee gas company is a Michigan public utility which distributes natural gas, obtained entirely from appellant, to domestic, commercial and industrial consumers in the Detroit area, and a substantial portion of its revenues is derived from sales to large industrial consumers.  Appellant seeks to make direct sales of natural gas to large industrial consumers in Michigan, and in its operations would use streets and alleys in the Detroit area.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  an order of the Michigan Public Service Commission requiring appellant to obtain from that Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity before selling natural gas direct to industrial consumers in a municipality already served by a public utility is not in conflict with the Natural Gas Act or the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/329/case.html#330"">341 U. S. 330</a></span>-337.</p>
<p>(a) The sale to industrial consumers as proposed by appellant is clearly interstate commerce, but the sale and distribution of gas to local consumers by one engaged in interstate commerce is ""essentially local"" in aspect, and is subject to state regulation.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/329/case.html#333"">341 U. S. 333</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) The Natural Gas Act applies only to such sales of gas in interstate commerce as are for resale, and does not apply to sales made direct to consumers, the latter being left to state regulation.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/329/case.html#334"">341 U. S. 334</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) There are in this case no conflicting claims between state and federal regulation.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/329/case.html#336"">341 U. S. 336</a></span>.</p>
<p>(d) To require appellant to secure a certificate of public convenience and necessity before it may enter a municipality already served by a public utility is regulation, not absolute prohibition.  <em>Hood & Sons v. Du Mond,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/336/525/case.html"">336 U. S. 525</a></span>, distinguished.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/329/case.html#336"">341 U. S. 336</a></span>-337.</p>
<p>328 Mich. 650, 44 N.W.2d 324, affirmed. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""330"">Page 341 U. S. 330</a></p><p></p>
<p>A cease and desist order issued against appellant by the Michigan Public Service Commission was affirmed by the State Supreme Court. 328 Mich. 650, 44 N.W.2d 324.  On appeal to this Court, <em>affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/329/case.html#337"">341 U. S. 337</a></span>.</p>

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Jordan v. De George, 341 U.S.  223 (1951)</h3><p><b>Jordan v. De George</p></b><p><b>No. 348</p></b><p><b>Argued March 5, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 7, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 223</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Conspiracy to defraud the United States of taxes on distilled spirits is a ""crime involving moral turpitude"" within the meaning of &#167; 19(a) of the Immigration Act of 1917, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 155(a), which requires the deportation of any alien who is sentenced more than once to imprisonment for one year or more because of conviction in this country of any such crime.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/223/case.html"">341 U. S. 223</a></span>-232.</p>
<p>(a) Crimes in which fraud is an ingredient have always been regarded as involving moral turpitude.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/223/case.html#227"">341 U. S. 227</a></span>-229,  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/223/case.html#232"">341 U. S. 232</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) The phrase ""crime involving moral turpitude"" does not lack sufficiently definite standards to justify this deportation proceeding, and the statute is not unconstitutional for vagueness.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/223/case.html#229"">341 U. S. 229</a></span>-232.</p>
<p>183 F.2d 768, reversed.</p>
<p>In a habeas corpus proceeding to challenge the validity of a deportation order, the District Court dismissed the petition.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  183 F.2d 768.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 890.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/223/case.html#232"">341 U. S. 232</a></span>.</p>

Northwestern Public Service Co.</p></b><p><b>No. 77</p></b><p><b>Argued November 27, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided May 7, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 246</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Petitioner and respondent are public utility electric companies engaged in interstate commerce and subject to the Federal Power Act.  For ten years, while under the same management through interlocking directorates and joint officers with the approval of the Federal Power Commission, petitioner's predecessor and respondent interchanged electric energy, shared expenses, and made a number of intercompany contracts establishing rates and charges which were filed with and accepted by the Commission.  After separation of their management, petitioner sued in a federal district court to recoup losses alleged to have resulted from its predecessor's paying respondent unreasonably high charges for what respondent furnished it and receiving unreasonably low rates for what it furnished respondent.  It alleged that these rates and charges were fraudulent and unlawful, and were due to the interlocking directorates, which prevented protest to the Commission to have reasonable rates and charges established pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Power Act.  There was no diversity of citizenship of the parties, and federal jurisdiction was asserted solely on the ground that the case arose under the Federal Power Act.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. Since the complaint asserted a cause of action under the Federal Power Act, the District Court had jurisdiction to determine whether it stated a cause of action maintainable in a federal court and, if so, whether it was sustained on the facts.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/246/case.html#249"">341 U. S. 249</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. The complaint stated no cause of action maintainable in a federal court.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/246/case.html#249"">341 U. S. 249</a></span>-255.</p>
<p>(a) Under the Federal Power Act, the right to a reasonable rate is the right to the rate which the Commission files or fixes, and, except for review of the Commission's orders, a court can assume no right to a different rate on the ground that, in the opinion of the court, such different rate is the only reasonable rate or a more reasonable rate.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/246/case.html#250"">341 U. S. 250</a></span>-252.</p>
<p>(b) In the absence of diversity of citizenship, the allegation of fraud resulting from the interlocking relationship did not state a cause of action maintainable in a federal court.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/246/case.html#252"">341 U. S. 252</a></span>-253. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""247"">Page 341 U. S. 247</a></p><p></p>
<p>(c) Since the Federal Power Act does not authorize the Commission to grant reparations for unreasonable rates collected in the past, the District Court could not properly refer the case to the Commission for determination of the reasonableness of the rates here involved.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/246/case.html#253"">341 U. S. 253</a></span>-254.</p>
<p>3. Since the case involves only issues which a federal court cannot decide, and can only refer to a body which also would have no independent jurisdiction to decide them, the complaint must be dismissed.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/246/case.html#255"">341 U. S. 255</a></span>.</p>
<p>181 F.2d 19 affirmed on a different ground.</p>
<p>In a suit alleged to be founded on the Federal Power Act, the District Court awarded petitioner a judgment for losses sustained on past rates and charges which the District Court found to be unreasonable and based on fraud.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the District Court was without jurisdiction.  181 F.2d 19.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 806.  <em>Affirmed on a different ground,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/246/case.html#255"">341 U. S. 255</a></span>.</p>

<p>1. Respondent was appointed by a federal district court as reorganization trustee for two common law trusts whose principal assets were securities of subsidiary companies.

<p>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p>The principal question here concerns personal liability of a reorganization trustee who, although making no personal profit, permitted key employees to profit from trading in securities of the debtors' subsidiaries.  Upon a long record, controlling facts have been found with little disagreement.</p>
<p>In 1935, the United States District Court appointed respondent Darrow as reorganization trustee for two common law trusts.  These had functioned as holding companies, and their principal assets were the securities of twenty-seven underlying companies, each of which owned improved real estate and had its own debt and capital structure.  Both the subsidiary companies and </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""269"">Page 341 U. S. 269</a></p><p> the two trusts had been promoted by Jacob Kulp and Myrtle Johnson, who thoroughly knew the inside of the business and were acquainted with many of the investors.  The tangled financial history leading to the reorganization is not important to our issue.</p>
<p>Darrow employed Kulp and Miss Johnson to assist in his trusteeship.  That they were competent and useful is undenied.  Kulp managed the physical properties, while Miss Johnson supervised the office, had complete charge of all records of income, expenditures, and properties of both debtors and all underlying companies.  Darrow decided upon a policy of buying in bonds of the subsidiaries for retirement, where they were available at a discount, and during his trusteeship reduced the outstanding bonds of subsidiaries by this method by about two and one-half million dollars.  Darrow depended upon Miss Johnson's judgment and advice in allocating funds for sinking fund operations, in his purchase of securities, and in fixing prices to be offered.</p>
<p>Kulp and Miss Johnson were employed by Darrow with the express agreement that they could continue to trade in securities of the debtors' subsidiaries personally and through Colonial Securities Corporation, which they owned.  Without such consent, they stated they would not have remained.  Darrow and Colonial for a considerable period shared office facilities and personnel, with Miss Johnson in charge both of the trustee's office, which was interested in the purchase of bonds, and her own Colonial, interested in the same thing.</p>
<p>Miss Johnson and Kulp, during their employment by the trustee, traded extensively in bonds of the subsidiary companies.  On many occasions, they acquired bonds for themselves and on the same day, or within a few days, transferred them to Darrow at a profit.  Darrow paid for some securities in advance of their delivery to him, and for some even before Miss Johnson had made her </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""270"">Page 341 U. S. 270</a></p><p> own purchase of them.  Johnson and Kulp sometimes bought for themselves bonds offered by bondholders who had come to the trustee's office to dispose of them to the trustee.  They made substantial profits through these transactions.</p>
<p>In his eight years of trusteeship, Darrow filed but one account for one of the debtor-corporations and none for the other.  The Securities and Exchange Commission intervened and demanded investigation of his conduct of the trust, and thereafter he resigned and filed his accounts, which were met with objections by his successor trustee.  These issues were referred to a special master, who heard a long contest over the foregoing and many other items unimportant here.  The master recommended a surcharge on account of the foregoing conduct.  The master's report was reviewed by the District Court, which concluded that the evidence supported the findings and recommendations and surcharged the trustee in the amount of $43,447.46, reserving some questions for later consideration.  Darrow appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the District Court, for reasons that we will later consider.  184 F.2d 1.  We conclude that the District Court was correct, and the decision of the Court of Appeals cannot stand.</p>
<p>At the outset, we are met with a jurisdictional objection.  Respondent contends that we are powerless to grant a motion to substitute parties because the petition for the writ of certiorari is jurisdictionally defective in that it is filed in the name of Stacy Mosser, a resigned trustee.  It is further contended that John W. Guild, the other named petitioner, is without standing to seek review because he is only an indenture trustee.  Both contentions are erroneous.</p>
<p>An indenture trustee's standing is expressly authorized by 52 Stat. 894, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 606, which provides,</p>
<p>""The debtor, <em>the indenture trustees,</em> and any creditor or stockholder </p><p><a class='page-number' name='271'>Page 341 U. S. 271</a></p><p> of the debtor shall have the right to be heard on all matters arising in a proceeding under this chapter.""</p>
<p>(Italics added.)  And respondent, in opposing the motion to substitute, erroneously relies on cases involving government officers.  <em>Davis v. Preston,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/280/406/case.html"">280 U. S. 406</a></span>; <em>Snyder v. Buck,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/15/case.html"">340 U. S. 15</a></span>,  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/15/case.html#21"">340 U. S. 21</a></span>.  Successor trustees, unlike successors of public officers, are regarded as transferees or assignees of all the interests of their predecessor, and removal of a trustee does not cause abatement.  52 Stat. 840, 860, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 74.  We hold, in accord with <em>Bowden v. Johnson,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/107/251/case.html"">107 U. S. 251</a></span>,  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/107/251/case.html#264"">107 U. S. 264</a></span>, that substitution is fully authorized and proper in these circumstances, and accordingly turn to the merits.</p>
<p>This was a strict trusteeship, not one of those <em>quasi</em>-trusteeships in which self-interest and representative interests are combined.  A reorganization trustee is the representative of the court, and it is not contended, and would not be arguable, that, if he had engaged for his own advantage in the same transactions that he authorized on the part of his subordinates, he should not be surcharged.  Equity tolerates in bankruptcy trustees no interest adverse to the trust.  This is not because such interests are always corrupt, but because they are always corrupting.  By its exclusion of the trustee from any personal interest, it seeks to avoid such delicate inquiries as we have here into the conduct of its own appointees by exacting from them forbearance of all opportunities to advance self-interest that might bring the disinterestedness of their administration into question.</p>
<p>These strict prohibitions would serve little purpose if the trustee were free to authorize others to do what he is forbidden.  While there is no charge of it here, it is obvious that this would open up opportunities for devious dealings in the name of others that the trustee could not conduct in his own.  The motives of man are too complex for equity to separate, in the case of its trustees, the motive </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""272"">Page 341 U. S. 272</a></p><p> of acquiring efficient help from motives of favoring help, for any reason at all or from anticipation of counterfavors later to come.  We think that which the trustee had no right to do, he had no right to authorize, and that the transactions were as forbidden for benefit of others as they would have been on behalf of the trustee himself.</p>
<p>It is argued here, and appears to have been the view of the Court of Appeals, that principles of negligence applied, and that a trustee could not be surcharged under many decisions unless guilty of ""supine negligence.""  We see no room for the operation of the principles of negligence in a case in which conduct has been knowingly authorized.  This is not the case of a trustee betrayed by those he had grounds to believe were trustworthy, for these employees did exactly what it was agreed by the trustee that they should do.  The question whether he was negligent in not making detailed inquiries into their operations is unimportant, because he had given a blanket authority for the operations.  The liability here is not created by a failure to detect defalcations, in which case negligence might be required to surcharge the trustee, but is a case of a willful and deliberate setting up of an interest in employees adverse to that of the trust.</p>
<p>It is contended, however, that the trust has incurred no loss.  Indeed, it is argued, and much evidence was taken to the effect, that the buying program of Darrow, as a whole, was to the advantage of the trust.  Of course, these dealings in a rising market did not directly extract any amounts from the till of the trustee.  But it is obvious that a buying program to retire at discount bonds of subsidiaries advances most rapidly and achieves its greatest results when the purchase prices are lowest.  Darrow concededly relied on Miss Johnson in fixing offering prices.  Those offering prices were sufficiently above what bondholders were willing to accept so that a margin was left for Miss Johnson to profit.  It may not have </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""273"">Page 341 U. S. 273</a></p><p> been intentionally rigged for the purpose, but there can be no doubt of the result.  If people were willing to trudge to the trustee's office to dispose of their holdings for less than his offer, there is no reason why the advantage of that low price should not have been taken by the trustee.  Instead, in his own office, Miss Johnson intervened between the seller and the buyer and made a profit for herself by doing so.</p>
<p>In one of the larger transactions, a block of securities was offered at judicial sale.  Darrow did not bid, but Miss Johnson did.  About one-half of the purchase price she obtained through a resale to Darrow.  He paid her, in advance of delivery, $12,447 for securities that cost her approximately $8,000, and his check was used by Miss Johnson to make the payment due under her bid.  If Darrow's employees were able to purchase in the open market these securities at less than Darrow on their advice thereafter offered and paid, it is difficult to say that there was no injury to the estate of the trust through these transactions.  But equity has sought to limit difficult and delicate factfinding tasks concerning its own trustee by precluding such transactions for the reason that their effect is often difficult to trace, and the prohibition is not merely against injuring the estate -- it is against profiting out of the position of trust.  That this has occurred, so far as the employees are concerned, is undenied.</p>
<p>It is argued, and the Court of Appeals appears to have been impressed by the argument, that this surcharge creates a very heavy liability upon a man who enjoyed no personal profit, and must be condoned ""so as not to strike terror into mankind acting for the benefit of others and not for their own.""  184 F.2d 1, 8.  Trustees are often obliged to make difficult business judgments, and the best that disinterested judgment can accomplish with foresight may be open to serious criticism </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""274"">Page 341 U. S. 274</a></p><p> by obstreperous creditors aided by hindsight.  Court are quite likely to protect trustees against heavy liabilities for disinterested mistakes in business judgment.  But a trusteeship is serious business, and is not to be undertaken lightly or so discharged. The most effective sanction for good administration is personal liability for the consequences of forbidden acts, and there are ways by which a trustee may effectively protect himself against personal liability.</p>
<p>The practice is well established by which trustees seek instructions from the court, given upon notice to creditors and interested parties, as to matters which involve difficult questions of judgment.  In this particular matter, it is claimed that the special knowledge of Miss Johnson and Kulp was indispensable to the trustee.  This, it is said, is the reason the trustee yielded to their insistence upon the right to speculate in the securities underlying the trust.  If their services were so indispensable that an arrangement so highly irregular was of advantage to the trust, this might have been fully disclosed to the court, and the creditors cited to show cause why it should not have been openly authorized.  Instead of this, the trustee, although he did discuss with Judge Holly the employment of Kulp and Miss Johnson, did not disclose the critical fact that he was employing them on terms which permitted their trading in the underlying securities.  Indeed, it appears that he did not even disclose this feature of the transaction to his own counsel.  It is hardly probable that a candid disclosure to creditors, to the court, and to interested parties would have resulted in instructions to have pursued this course; but, had it been authorized, at least the assenting creditors might have found themselves estopped to question the transaction.</p>
<p>A further remedy of a trustee for limiting, if not avoiding, personal liability is to account at prompt intervals, which puts upon objectors the burden of raising their </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""275"">Page 341 U. S. 275</a></p><p> objections.  And had the trustee accounted, as good practice would have required, he undoubtedly would have discovered long ago that this arrangement was objectionable.  It hardly lies in the mouth of a trustee to allow his liabilities to accumulate over such a period of time and then ask the court to relieve him of them because they have become too burdensome.</p>
<p>In fairness to the trustee, it is to be noted that there is no hint or proof that he has been corrupt, or that he has any interest, present or future, in the profits he has permitted these employees to make.  For all that appears, he was simply misled into thinking these persons indispensable, but he entered into an arrangement which courts cannot sanction unless they are to open the door to practices which would demoralize trusteeships and discredit bankruptcy administration.</p>
<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p><em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE BURTON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>

Brannan</p></b><p><b>Argued April 11, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 7, 1951<L=|341 U.S. 277ast|>*</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 277</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. Petitioners are veterans entitled to the benefits of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944.  They were appointed as attorneys in a Government Department in 1943, when a civil service regulation limited such appointments to the duration of the war plus six months, and persons so appointed were not to acquire a classified (competitive) civil service status.  In 1947, through a reduction in force, petitioners and other attorneys in the Department were separated from the service, although nonveteran attorneys with classified status were retained.  They sought relief in an action in the District Court, alleging that their separation from the service was unlawful.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  petitioners' separation from the service was in accord with the Civil Service Commission's retention preference regulations; the regulations were consistent with &#167; 12 of the Act and were valid, and petitioners' separation from the federal service was therefore valid.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/277/case.html#281"">341 U. S. 281</a></span>-285.</p>
<p>(a) Petitioners did not acquire a classified civil service status, and were not entitled under civil service regulations to retention preference over all nonveterans.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/277/case.html#281"">341 U. S. 281</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) The proviso of &#167; 12 of the Act does not give to veterans with an efficiency rating of ""good"" or better an absolute preference over all other employees, with or without classified status or its equivalent.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/277/case.html#283"">341 U. S. 283</a></span>-285.</p>
<p>(c) The Commission's retention regulations, adopted pursuant to &#167; 12 of the Act, can hardly be deemed invalid for making a distinction on the basis of tenure when they reflect a longstanding definition of ""competing"" groups, when they were issued by the agency which proposed the statutory language finally adopted, and when Congress indicated no intent whatsoever to supply a new standard.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/277/case.html#285"">341 U. S. 285</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""278"">Page 341 U. S. 278</a></p><p></p>
<p>(d) The contention that, apart from &#167; 12, veterans were given an absolute preference by &#167; 4 of the Act of 1912, 37 Stat. 413, and that the preference so granted was carried over by the saving clause in &#167; 18 of the 1944 Act, cannot be sustained as to these temporary war service employees.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/277/case.html#285"">341 U. S. 285</a></span>-286.</p>
<p>(e) Section 2 of the 1944 Act does not, in and of itself, extend absolute preference to veterans with limited tenure.  No specific preference rights are granted by that section.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/277/case.html#286"">341 U. S. 286</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. Petitioners' complaint also alleged that the Department had rehired some of the other attorneys, that some of those rehired had a lower classification on the retention register than that of petitioners, and that petitioners were thus wrongfully denied preference in rehiring.  They did not allege that they had requested that their names be placed on the appropriate reemployment list, nor that the appointing officer failed to follow the procedures specified by &#167;&#167; 7, 8, 15, and pertinent regulations.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the complaint was insufficient to state a cause of action under the Act.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/277/case.html#286"">341 U. S. 286</a></span>-289.</p>
<p>(a) Section 2 of the 1944 Act grants petitioners no ""reinstatement and reemployment"" preference rights.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/277/case.html#281"">341 U. S. 281</a></span>-287.</p>
<p>(b) Reinstatement or reemployment preferences are not to be measured by retention preference regulations under &#167; 12 of the Act.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/277/case.html#287"">341 U. S. 287</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) Petitioners' rights to preference in reemployment were governed by &#167; 15 of the Act.  They were entitled to those rights only if they requested that their names be placed on the appropriate reemployment list, and, even if they did so, their preference rights were violated only if the appointing officer failed to follow the procedures specified by &#167;&#167; 7, 8, 15, and pertinent regulations.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/277/case.html#289"">341 U. S. 289</a></span>.</p>
<p>87 U.S.App.D.C. 117, 184 F.2d 219, affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>
<p>In actions brought against the Secretary of Agriculture by two veterans who sought to be restored to their former positions in the Department, the District Court granted the motion of the Secretary for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the cause.  87 U.S.App.D.C. 117, 184 F.2d 219.  This Court granted cross-petitions for certiorari.  340 U.S. 928.  <em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the District Court,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/277/case.html#289"">341 U. S. 289</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""279"">Page 341 U. S. 279</a></p><p></p>

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>United States v. Champlin Refining Co., 341 U.S.  290 (1951)</h3><p><b>United States v. Champlin Refining Co.</p></b><p><b>No. 433</p></b><p><b>Argued March 8-9, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided May 7, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 290</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Appellee owns and operates a pipeline from its refinery in Oklahoma to its terminals in other States.  It uses the pipeline solely to carry its own refined petroleum products.  No other pipeline or refiner has connections with appellee's line, and no other refiner has ever shipped products through it.  At each of its terminals, appellee has storage facilities from which it makes deliveries to jobber purchasers, who supply their own transportation therefrom.  At two of its terminals, it has ethyl plants where it processes 20% of its products.  Appellee presently handles 1.98% of the total products consumed in its marketing area.  There are ample common carrier pipeline facilities available to these markets, and no refinery or other pipeline company has requested a connection with appellee.  In an earlier proceeding, <em>Champlin Refining Co. v. United States,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/329/29/case.html"">329 U. S. 29</a></span>, this Court found that appellee was a ""common carrier"" within the meaning of &#167; 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, and sustained a Commission order under &#167; 19a requiring appellee to file valuation data, maps, charts, etc. pertaining to its operations.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. A subsequent order of the Commission is sustained insofar as it requires appellee, under &#167; 20 of the Act, to file annual, periodic and special reports, and to institute and maintain a uniform system of accounts applicable to pipelines.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/290/case.html#294"">341 U. S. 294</a></span>-297.</p>
<p>2. Insofar as the order requires appellee, under &#167; 6 of the Act, to publish and file schedules showing rates and charges for interstate transportation of refined petroleum products -- which might force appellee to devote its pipeline at least partially to public use -- it goes beyond what Congress contemplated when it passed the Act, and it cannot be sustained.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/290/case.html#297"">341 U. S. 297</a></span>-301.</p>
<p>95 F.Supp. 170, affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>
<p>The Interstate Commerce Commission issued an order requiring appellee to take certain steps under &#167;&#167; 6 and 20 of the Interstate Commerce Act. 274 I.C.C. 409.  A three-judge district court denied enforcement. 95 F.Supp. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""291"">Page 341 U. S. 291</a></p><p> 170.  On direct appeal to this Court, <em>affirmed in part and reversed in part,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/290/case.html#301"">341 U. S. 301</a></span>.</p>

<p>A private motor carrier sued in the Court of Claims to recover just compensation for an alleged temporary taking of its property and business by the United States under Executive Order No. 9462.  While the case was pending, the Motor Carrier Claims Commission Act was enacted, and the motor carrier timely filed its claim with the Commission before the Court of Claims entered judgment.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>   this deprived the Court of Claims of jurisdiction to enter judgment in the case.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/319/case.html"">341 U. S. 319</a></span>-320.</p>

<p>Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2412(a), costs may not be assessed against the Federal Security Administrator in a suit brought against him in his official capacity, when there is no express statutory authority for the allowance of such costs.</p>
<p>185 F.2d 781, reversed in part.</p>
<p>In a suit against the Federal Security Administrator in his official capacity, the District Court awarded a judgment and assessed costs against the Administrator.  88 F.Supp. 315.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  185 F.2d 781.  Certiorari granted, and judgment <em>reversed</em> insofar as it relates to the taxation of costs against petitioner.</p>

Pewee Coal Co., Inc.</p></b><p><b>No. 168</p></b><p><b>Argued January 2-3, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided April 30, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 114</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Respondent is a coal mine operator whose property was seized and operated by the United States during a temporary period in 1943 to avert a nationwide strike of miners.  Respondent sued in the Court of Claims to recover under the Fifth Amendment for the total operating losses sustained during that period.  The Court of Claims awarded respondent judgment for only that portion of the operating loss (<em>viz.,</em> increased wage payments made in accordance with a War Labor Board order) which the court found was attributable to government operation of the mine.  Respondent did not seek review here; certiorari was granted on the petition of the Government.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. Under the circumstances, there was a ""taking"" of respondent's property, which entitled respondent to recover compensation under the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/114/case.html#115"">341 U. S. 115</a></span>-117.</p>
<p>2. The judgment of the Court of Claims awarding compensation for that portion of the operating loss which it found attributable to government operation is affirmed.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/114/case.html#117"">341 U. S. 117</a></span>-119.</p>
<p>115 Ct.Cl. 626, 88 F.Supp. 426, affirmed.</p>
<p>In a suit by respondent to recover compensation for an alleged taking of its property, the Court of Claims awarded judgment for respondent, but in less than the amount claimed.  115 Ct.Cl. 626, 88 F.Supp. 426.  On the petition of the Government, this Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 808.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/114/case.html#119"">341 U. S. 119</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""115"">Page 341 U. S. 115</a></p><p></p>

McGrath</p></b><p><b>No. 8</p></b><p><b>Argued October 11, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided April 30, 1951*</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 123</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Purporting to act under Part III, &#167; 3 of Executive Order No. 9835, the Attorney General, without notice or hearing, designated the three petitioner organizations as Communist in a list furnished to the Loyalty Review Board for use in connection with determinations of disloyalty of government employees.  The Board disseminated the list to all departments and agencies of the Government.  Petitioners sued for declaratory judgments and injunctive relief.  They alleged that their organizations were engaged in charitable or civic activities or in the business of fraternal insurance; all three implied an attitude of cooperation and helpfulness, rather than one of hostility or disloyalty toward the United States; and two expressly alleged that their respective organizations were not within any classification listed in Part III, &#167; 3 of the Order.  Petitioners further alleged that the actions of the Attorney General and the Board greatly hampered their activities and deprived them of rights in violation of the Constitution; that the Executive Order violates the First, Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution; that &#167; 9A of the Hatch Act, as construed and applied, is void; and that petitioners were suffering irreparable injury and had no adequate remedy at law.  The District Court granted motions to dismiss the complaints for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  The judgments are reversed, and the cases are remanded to the District Court with instructions to deny the motions that the complaints be dismissed for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted.

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 435</p></b><p><b>Argued March 9, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided April 30, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 214</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Before trial on an indictment for violation of &#167; 1 of the Sherman Act, defendants obtained under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure an order requiring the Government to produce for inspection all documents or objects obtained from defendants and obtained by seizure or process from others.  The Government complied with that order.  Defendants also moved, under Rule 17(c), for an order directing compliance with a subpoena <em>duces tecum</em> requiring the production for inspection of certain documents and objects obtained by the Government by means other than seizure or process and which (a) had been presented to the grand jury, or (b) were to be offered as evidence at the trial, or</p>
<p>""(c) are relevant to the allegations or charges contained in said indictment, whether or not they might constitute evidence with respect to the guilt or innocence of any of the defendants.""</p>
<p>For refusal to comply with this order, respondent, a government attorney who had possession of the subpoenaed materials, was found guilty of contempt.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. Under Rule 17(c), any document or other material which has been obtained by the Government by solicitation or voluntarily from third persons, and which is admissible in evidence, is subject to subpoena.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/214/case.html#218"">341 U. S. 218</a></span>-221.</p>
<p>(a) It is not required that materials thus subpoenaed be actually used in evidence, but only that a good faith effort be made to obtain evidence, and the court may control the use of Rule 17(c) to that end by its power to rule on motions to quash or modify.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/214/case.html#219"">341 U. S. 219</a></span>-220.</p>
<p>(b) Where such materials are required to be produced, the court should be solicitous to protect against disclosures of the identity of informants and the method, manner and circumstances of the Government's acquisition of the materials.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/214/case.html#221"">341 U. S. 221</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. Clause (c) of the subpoena is invalid, being not intended to produce evidentiary materials, but being merely ""a fishing expedition to see what may turn up."" P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/214/case.html#221"">341 U. S. 221</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""215"">Page 341 U. S. 215</a></p><p></p>
<p>3. The subpoena being part good and part bad, respondent may not be held in contempt for refusal to comply with it.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/214/case.html#221"">341 U. S. 221</a></span>.</p>
<p>185 F.2d 159, judgment vacated.</p>
<p>Upon review of an order of the District Court finding a government attorney guilty of contempt for refusal to comply with a subpoena <em>duces tecum,</em> the Court of Appeals reversed.  185 F.2d 159.  This Court granted certiorari. 340 U.S. 919.  <em>Judgment vacated and cause remanded to the District Court,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/214/case.html#222"">341 U. S. 222</a></span>.</p>

Williams</p></b><p><b>No. 134</p></b><p><b>Argued January 8, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided April 23, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 58</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>In a prosecution for violation of what is now 18 U.S.C. &#167; 242, arising out of the alleged beating of persons to coerce confessions, and for conspiracy against Fourteenth Amendment rights of citizens in alleged violation of what is now 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241, appellee Williams was convicted and the other three appellees were acquitted of the substantive offenses, and the jury was unable to agree on a verdict on the conspiracy counts.  Appellees were reindicted for the conspiracy and were convicted, but, on appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and ordered the indictment quashed on the ground that &#167; 241 does not embrace Fourteenth Amendment rights.  An indictment of appellees under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1621 for perjury in the first trial, charging Williams with falsely testifying that he had not beaten the victims, and charging the other appellees with falsely testifying that they had not seen Williams beating the victims, was dismissed by the District Court.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. The conviction of Williams on the charge of beating the victims did not bar, as double jeopardy, his prosecution for perjury in testifying falsely that he had not beaten them.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/58/case.html#62"">341 U. S. 62</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. That the other appellees had been acquitted of the substantive offense of aiding and abetting Williams in abusing the victims did not bar, on the ground of <em>res judicata,</em> their subsequent prosecution for perjury in testifying that they had not seen Williams beating them.  <em>Sealfon v. United States,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/332/575/case.html"">332 U. S. 575</a></span>, distinguished.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/58/case.html#63"">341 U. S. 63</a></span>-65.</p>
<p>3. Testifying falsely in the first trial on the conspiracy charges constituted perjury under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1621 even though, on appeal, it was determined that the later indictment for conspiracy was defective.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/58/case.html#65"">341 U. S. 65</a></span>-69.</p>
<p>(a) In the trial of the first conspiracy charges, the District Court had jurisdiction of the subject matter (an alleged violation of a federal conspiracy statute) and of the parties, and therefore was a ""competent tribunal"" within the requirement of the perjury statute.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/58/case.html#65"">341 U. S. 65</a></span>-66. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""59"">Page 341 U. S. 59</a></p><p></p>
<p>(b) The circumstance that ultimately it is determined on appeal that the indictment is defective does not affect the jurisdiction of the trial court to determine the case presented by the indictment.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/58/case.html#66"">341 U. S. 66</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) Where the court in the proceedings in which the alleged perjury occurred had jurisdiction to render judgment on the merits in those proceedings, defects developed <em>dehors</em> the record or in the procedure, sufficient to invalidate any judgment on review, do not bar a conviction for perjury.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/58/case.html#67"">341 U. S. 67</a></span>-69.</p>
<p>93 F.Supp. 922, reversed.</p>
<p>The District Court dismissed an indictment of appellees for perjury under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1621.  93 F.Supp. 922.  On direct appeal to this Court under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3731, <em>reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/58/case.html#69"">341 U. S. 69</a></span>.</p>

<p>After one of the respondents had been convicted and the others acquitted of substantive offenses under what is now 18 U.S.C. &#167; 242 -- <em>i.e.,</em> beating or aiding and abetting the beating of certain suspects until they confessed to a theft -- they were convicted in the Federal District Court for a violation of what is now 18 U.S. C. &#167; 241.  The indictment arose out of the same facts, and alleged that, ""acting under the laws of . . . Florida,"" they</p>
<p>""conspired to injure the free exercise and enjoyment of the rights and privileges secured to him and protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.""</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals reversed their conviction on this conspiracy indictment.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/70/case.html#82"">341 U. S. 82</a></span>.</p>
<p>(a) MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE JACKSON and MR. JUSTICE MINTON, was of the opinion that &#167; 241 only covers conduct which interferes with rights arising from the substantive powers of the Federal Government, and that including an allegation that the defendants acted under color of state law in an indictment under &#167; 241 does not extend the protection of the section to rights which the Federal Constitution merely guarantees against abridgment by the States.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/70/case.html#71"">341 U. S. 71</a></span>-82.</p>
<p>(b) MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurred in the result on the ground that trial under this conspiracy indictment was barred by the principle of <em>res judicata.</em>  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/70/case.html#86"">341 U. S. 86</a></span>-86.</p>
<p>179 F.2d 644 affirmed.</p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, joined by MR. JUSTICE REED, MR. JUSTICE BURTON, and MR. JUSTICE CLARK, dissented.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/70/case.html#87"">341 U. S. 87</a></span>.</p>
<p>A conviction of respondents for violation of what is now 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241 was reversed by the Court of Appeals.  179 F.2d 644.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 849.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/70/case.html#82"">341 U. S. 82</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""71"">Page 341 U. S. 71</a></p><p></p>

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 365</p></b><p><b>Argued January 8, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided April 23, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 97</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. A special police officer who, in his official capacity, by use of force and violence, obtains a confession from a person suspected of crime may be prosecuted under what is now 18 U.S.C. &#167; 242, which makes it an offense for any person, under color of law, willfully to subject any inhabitant of any State, Territory, or District to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/97/case.html#98"">341 U. S. 98</a></span>-104.</p>
<p>2. Petitioner, a private detective who held a special police officer's card issued by the City of Miami, Fla., and had taken an oath and qualified as a special police officer, was employed by a business corporation to ascertain the identity of thieves who had been stealing its property.  Showing his badge and accompanied by a regular policeman, he beat certain suspects and thereby obtained confessions.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  on the record in this case, petitioner was acting ""under color"" of law within the meaning of &#167; 242, or at least the jury could properly so find.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/97/case.html#99"">341 U. S. 99</a></span>-100.</p>
<p>3. As applied, under the facts of this case, to the denial of rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, &#167; 242 is not void for vagueness.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/97/case.html#100"">341 U. S. 100</a></span>-102.</p>
<p>4. Where police take matters into their own hands, seize victims, and beat them until they confess, they deprive the victims of rights under the Constitution.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/97/case.html#101"">341 U. S. 101</a></span>.</p>
<p>5. In view of the terms of the indictment, as interpreted by the instructions to the jury, it cannot be said that any issue of vagueness of &#167; 242, as construed and applied, is present in this case.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/97/case.html#102"">341 U. S. 102</a></span>-104.</p>
<p>179 F.2d 656 affirmed.</p>
<p>Petitioner was convicted of a violation of what is now 18 U.S.C. &#167; 242.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  179 F.2d 656.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 850.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/97/case.html#104"">341 U. S. 104</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""98"">Page 341 U. S. 98</a></p><p></p>

Maloney, 341 U.S.  105 (1951)</h3><p><b>California State Automobile Association</p></b><p><b>Inter-Insurance Bureau v. Maloney</p></b><p><b>No. 310</p></b><p><b>Argued March 8, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided April 23, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 105</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>The California Compulsory Assigned Risk Law requires all insurers transacting liability insurance in the State to participate in a plan for the equitable apportionment among them of those applicants for automobile liability insurance who are in good faith entitled to such insurance (to enable them to retain drivers' licenses) but are unable to procure it through ordinary methods.  Uninsurable risks are excluded from the plan, policies issued may be limited to coverages of $5,000-$10,000, and premiums commensurate with abnormal risks may be charged.  Appellant is an unincorporated association engaged in writing reciprocal liability insurance solely for members of an automobile club having a selected membership, and the plan would require it to write insurance for nonmembers of the club who are poor risks.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  as applied to appellant, the statute does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/105/case.html#106"">341 U. S. 106</a></span>-111.</p>
<p>96 Cal.App.2d 876, 216 P.2d 882, affirmed.</p>
<p>A California court sustained the California Compulsory Assigned Risk Law, Cal.Stat. 1947, c. 39, p. 525, as amended, against a claim that it violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 96 Cal.App.2d 876, 216 P.2d 882.  On appeal to this Court, <em>affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/105/case.html#111"">341 U. S. 111</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""106"">Page 341 U. S. 106</a></p><p></p>

Election Board</p></b><p><b>No. 577</p></b><p><b>Argued April 9, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided April 12, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 56</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>A decision by the highest court of Maryland upholding the validity of a Maryland law, construed as requiring that, in order for a candidate for public office in that State to obtain a place on the ballot, he must make oath that he is not engaged ""in one way or another in the attempt to overthrow the government by force or violence,"" and that he is not knowingly a member of an organization engaged in such an attempt, is here affirmed on the understanding that an affidavit in those terms fully satisfies the requirement.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/56/case.html"">341 U. S. 56</a></span>-57.</p>
<p>___ Md.,  ___ 78 A.2d 660, affirmed.</p>

Allied Oil Corp.</p></b><p><b>No. 364</p></b><p><b>Argued March 6, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided April 9, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 1</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. In actions brought by the Administrator under &#167; 205(e) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 to recover damages from sellers who sold commodities at over-ceiling prices, which actions were pending when price controls were terminated, the substitution of the United States (rather than the Administrator's successor) as the party plaintiff was authorized by Executive Orders Nos. 9841 and 9842.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/1/case.html#2"">341 U. S. 2</a></span>-4.</p>

Finn</p></b><p><b>No. 252</p></b><p><b>Argued December 7, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided April 9, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 6</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>In a suit brought in a Texas court by a resident of that State to recover for a loss by fire, the complaint named as defendants two foreign insurance companies (one of which is the petitioner here) and a resident agent of the companies.  The single wrong for which relief was sought was the failure to compensate for the loss, and the three defendants were joined because of uncertainty as to who was liable.  After September 1, 1948, petitioner removed the case to the Federal District Court, which rendered judgment against petitioner and absolved the other defendants.  Petitioner thereafter moved to vacate the judgment and to remand the case to the state court.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. In the light of the allegations of the complaint in this case, separate and independent causes of action were not stated; and, under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441(c), there was no right of removal of the case from the state court to the federal court.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/6/case.html#9"">341 U. S. 9</a></span>-16.</p>
<p>(a) In adopting the ""separate and independent claim or cause of action"" test for removability, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441(c) (1948), Congress intended to avoid the difficulties experienced in determining the meaning of the former provision of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 71, and to limit removal from state courts.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/6/case.html#9"">341 U. S. 9</a></span>-10.</p>
<p>(b) A separable controversy is no longer an adequate ground for removal unless it also constitutes a ""separate and independent claim or cause of action.""  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/6/case.html#11"">341 U. S. 11</a></span>-12.</p>
<p>(c) The phrase ""cause of action,"" as used in &#167; 1441, must be given a meaning which will accomplish the congressional purpose of limiting and simplifying removal.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/6/case.html#12"">341 U. S. 12</a></span>-13.</p>
<p>(d) Where a plaintiff seeks relief for a single wrong, arising from an interlocked series of transactions, there is no ""separate and independent claim or cause of action"" under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441(c).  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'>341 U. S. 13</span>-14.</p>
<p>2. Because of the presence of a citizen of Texas on each side, the District Court would not have had original jurisdiction of this suit, either as stated in the complaint or in the posture of the case at the time of judgment.  Therefore, the judgment of the District Court must be vacated.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/6/case.html#16"">341 U. S. 16</a></span>-19. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""7"">Page 341 U. S. 7</a></p><p></p>
<p>(a) To permit a federal trial court to enter judgment in a case removed without right from a state court where the federal court could not have original jurisdiction of the suit, even in its posture at the time of judgment, would, by the act of the parties, work a wrongful extension of federal jurisdiction and give district courts power that Congress has denied them.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/6/case.html#17"">341 U. S. 17</a></span>-18.</p>
<p>181 F.2d 845, reversed.</p>
<p>In a suit removed by petitioner from a state court, the District Court entered judgment against petitioner.  The District Court's denial of petitioner's subsequent motion to vacate the judgment and remand the case to the state court was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  181 F.2d 845.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 849.  <em>Reversed and remanded,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/6/case.html#19"">341 U. S. 19</a></span>.</p>

Sims</p></b><p><b>No. 147</p></b><p><b>Argued December 5, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided April 9, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 22</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>With the consent of Congress under the Compact Clause of the Federal Constitution, West Virginia and seven other States entered into a Compact to control pollution in the Ohio River system.  They created a Commission consisting of representatives of each of the eight States and the United States, and agreed to delegate certain powers to it and to appropriate funds for its administrative expenses.  The West Virginia Legislature approved the Compact and appropriated funds to defray West Virginia's share of the expenses.  In a mandamus proceeding to compel the State Auditor to issue a warrant for payment of these expenses, the State Supreme Court denied relief.  It found that the state legislation constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power and violated the debt limitation provision of Art. X, &#167; 4 of the State Constitution.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. This Court has final power to pass upon the meaning and validity of compacts between states. P. 28.</p>
<p>2. An agreement entered into between states by those who alone have political authority to speak for a state cannot be nullified unilaterally, or given final meaning by any organ of one of the contracting states.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/22/case.html#28"">341 U. S. 28</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. This Court is free to examine determinations of law by state courts where an interstate compact brings in issue the rights of other states and the United States.  <em>Kentucky v. Indiana,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/281/163/case.html"">281 U. S. 163</a></span>; <em>Hinderlider v. La Plata Co.,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/304/92/case.html"">304 U. S. 92</a></span>.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/22/case.html#28"">341 U. S. 28</a></span>-30.</p>
<p>4. The fact that the questions as to the Compact are before this Court on a writ of certiorari, rather than by way of an original action brought by a state, does not affect the power of this Court to decide those questions.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/22/case.html#30"">341 U. S. 30</a></span>.</p>
<p>5. West Virginia had authority under her Constitution to enter into a Compact which involves only such delegation of power to an interstate agency as the Ohio River Compact presents.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/22/case.html#30"">341 U. S. 30</a></span>-32. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""23"">Page 341 U. S. 23</a></p><p></p>
<p>6. The obligation of the State under the Compact is not in conflict with the debt limitation provision of Art. X, &#167; 4 of the State Constitution.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/22/case.html#32"">341 U. S. 32</a></span>.</p>
<p>134 W.Va.___, 58 S.E.2d 766, reversed.</p>
<p>In a mandamus proceeding, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia held that state legislation authorizing the State's participation in a Compact with other States violated the State Constitution.  134 W.Va. ___, 58 S.E.2d 766.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 807.  <em>Reversed and remanded,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/22/case.html#32"">341 U. S. 32</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""24"">Page 341 U. S. 24</a></p><p></p>

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 301</p></b><p><b>Argued March 7, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided April 9, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 41</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>The Treaty of 1850 between the United States and Switzerland provides that citizens of one country residing in the other ""shall be free from personal military service.""  Section 3(a) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, provided for the exemption of neutral aliens from service in the land or naval forces of the United States, with the proviso that one who claimed exemption should thereafter be barred from becoming a citizen of the United States.  Petitioner, a Swiss national, applied for and obtained exemption from service in the land or naval forces of the United States.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  under the circumstances detailed in the opinion, he was not debarred from United States citizenship.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/41/case.html#42"">341 U. S. 42</a></span>-47.</p>
<p>(a) As a matter of law, the Act imposed a valid condition on petitioner's claim of exemption from military service.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/41/case.html#45"">341 U. S. 45</a></span>-46.</p>
<p>(b) Petitioner did not knowingly and intentionally waive his rights to citizenship.  Considering all the circumstances of the case, elementary fairness would require nothing less than an intelligent waiver to debar petitioner from citizenship.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/41/case.html#46"">341 U. S. 46</a></span>-47.</p>
<p>182 F.2d 734, reversed.</p>
<p>An order of the District Court admitting petitioner to citizenship, 85 F.Supp. 683, was reversed by the Court of Appeals.  182 F.2d 734.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 910.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/41/case.html#47"">341 U. S. 47</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""42"">Page 341 U. S. 42</a></p><p></p>

Alcea Band of Tillamooks</p></b><p><b>No. 281</p></b><p><b>Argued March 2, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided April 9, 1951</p></b><p><b>341 U.S. 48</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>In determining the amount of compensation to which respondents were entitled after the decision of this Court in <em>United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/329/40/case.html"">329 U. S. 40</a></span>, the Court of Claims entered judgment for the value of the lands as of 1855 plus interest from that date.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  The award of interest was erroneous, since recovery was not grounded on a taking under the Fifth Amendment and the relevant statute contains no provision expressly authorizing an award of interest.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/341/48/case.html"">341 U. S. 4849</a></span>.</p>
<p>115 Ct.Cl. 463, 87 F.Supp. 938, reversed.</p>

Lewis</p></b><p><b>No. 347</p></b><p><b>Argued March 2, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided March 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 590</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>In his 1944 income tax return, respondent reported $22,000 received that year as an employee's bonus, which he claimed in good faith and used unconditionally as his own.  In subsequent litigation, it was decided that the bonus had been computed improperly, and, under compulsion of a judgment, respondent returned $11,000 to his employer in 1946.  He then sued in the Court of Claims for refund of an alleged overpayment of his 1944 income tax.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  under the ""claim of right"" doctrine announced in <em>North American Oil v. Burnet,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/286/417/case.html"">286 U. S. 417</a></span>, the entire $22,000 was income in 1944, and respondent was not entitled to recompute his 1944 tax.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/590/case.html"">340 U. S. 590</a></span>-592.</p>
<p>117 Ct.Cl. 336, 91 F.Supp. 1017, reversed.</p>
<p>The case is stated in the opinion.  The judgment below is <em>reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/590/case.html#592"">340 U. S. 592</a></span>.</p>

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 363</p></b><p><b>Argued March 5-6, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided March 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 593</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Under &#167; 304 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Government filed a libel to condemn 62 cases of a product which closely resembled fruit jam in appearance and taste, claiming that it was ""misbranded"" within the meaning of &#167; 403(g).  The product did not meet the standards for fruit jam prescribed in the regulations issued under &#167; 401 and incorporated by reference in &#167; 403(g), but it was wholesome and fit for human consumption, was plainly labeled as ""imitation"" in compliance with &#167; 403(c), and was sold as ""imitation jam,"" without any effort to misrepresent it as genuine fruit jam.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  it was not ""misbranded"" within the meaning of &#167; 403.  <em>Federal Security Administrator v. Quaker Oats Co.,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/318/218/case.html"">318 U. S. 218</a></span>, distinguished.

<p>183 F.2d 1014, reversed.</p>
<p>On a libel by the United States against certain food products under &#167; 304 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the District Court held that they were not ""misbranded"" within the meaning of &#167; 403.  87 F.Supp. 735.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  183 F.2d 1014.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 890.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/593/case.html#601"">340 U. S. 601</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""594"">Page 340 U. S. 594</a></p><p></p>

O'Connor</p></b><p><b>No. 132</p></b><p><b>Argued November 29-30, 1950</p></b><p><b>Reargued January 10, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided March 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 602</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. Connecticut imposes upon the franchises of foreign corporations, for the privilege of doing business within the State, a tax computed at a nondiscriminatory rate on that part of the corporation's net income which is reasonably attributable to its business activities within the State.  The tax is not levied as compensation for the use of the highways or collected in lieu of an <em>ad valorem</em> property tax.  It is not a fee for inspection or a tax on sales or use.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  as applied to a foreign corporation which was engaged exclusively in interstate trucking, the tax was invalid under the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/602/case.html#603"">340 U. S. 603</a></span>-610.</p>
<p>(a) The fact that, if some intrastate commerce were involved or if an appropriate tax were imposed as compensation for the corporation's use of the highways, the same sum of money as is at issue here might be lawfully collected from the corporation cannot sustain the constitutional validity of the tax.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/602/case.html#607"">340 U. S. 607</a></span>-608.</p>
<p>(b) Whether a state may validly make interstate commerce pay its way depends first of all upon the constitutional channel through which it attempts to do so.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/602/case.html#608"">340 U. S. 608</a></span>.</p>
<p>(c) As construed by the state courts, this is a tax solely on the franchise of petitioner to do a business which is exclusively interstate, and such a tax contravenes the Commerce Clause no matter how fairly it is apportioned to business done within the state.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/602/case.html#608"">340 U. S. 608</a></span>-610.</p>
<p>2. The Federal District Court had jurisdiction of this case in the first instance because of the uncertainty of the adequacy of a remedy in the state courts, and it did not lose that jurisdiction by virtue of the later clarification of the procedure in the courts of the State.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/602/case.html#605"">340 U. S. 605</a></span>.</p>
<p>181 F.2d 150, reversed.</p>
<p>The case is stated in the opinion, pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/602/case.html#603"">340 U. S. 603</a></span>-605.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is <em>reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/602/case.html#610"">340 U. S. 610</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""603"">Page 340 U. S. 603</a></p><p></p>

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Johnson v. Muelberger, 340 U.S.  581 (1951)</h3><p><b>Johnson v. Muelberger</p></b><p><b>No. 296</p></b><p><b>Argued January 4, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided March 12, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 581</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. In a divorce proceeding brought in Florida by the second wife of a New York resident, wherein he answered on the merits and had full opportunity to contest (but did not contest) the jurisdictional issues, the court granted a decree of divorce, although the wife had not complied with the jurisdictional 90-day residence requirement of Florida.  He married again, and, after his death, his third wife elected, under New York law, to take the statutory one-third share of his estate.  This was contested in New York by a daughter of his first marriage (sole legatee under his will), who challenged the validity of the Florida divorce on the ground that the complainant had not complied with the 90-day residence requirement.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  The daughter could not have challenged the validity of the Florida decree in the courts of that State, and therefore she was precluded by the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Federal Constitution from collaterally attacking it in the courts of New York.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/581/case.html#582"">340 U. S. 582</a></span>-589.</p>
<p>2. When a decree of divorce cannot be attacked on jurisdictional grounds by parties who were actually before the court, or by their privies, or by strangers, in the courts of the State in which the decree was rendered, the Full Faith and Credit Clause precludes their attacking it in the courts of a sister State.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/581/case.html#589"">340 U. S. 589</a></span>.</p>
<p>301 N.Y. 13, 92 N.E.2d 44, reversed.</p>
<p>An order of the New York Surrogate's Court sustaining the validity of an election by petitioner to take as surviving spouse the statutory share of a decedent's estate was affirmed by the Appellate Division, 275 App.Div. 848.  The Court of Appeals reversed on constitutional grounds.  301 N.Y. 13, 92 N.E.2d 44.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 874.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/581/case.html#589"">340 U. S. 589</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""582"">Page 340 U. S. 582</a></p><p></p>

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 20</p></b><p><b>Argued November 7, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 367</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Under subpoena, petitioner appeared before a federal grand jury and testified without objection that she had been Treasurer of the Communist Party of Denver, had been in possession of its records, and had turned them over to another person, but she refused to identify the person to whom she had delivered the records, giving as her only reason her wish not to subject another person to what she was going through.  She was committed to the custody of the marshal until the next day, and advised of her right to counsel.  On the next day, her counsel informed the court that, on his advice, petitioner would answer the question to purge herself of contempt.  Upon her reappearance before the grand jury, she again refused to answer the question.  Brought back into court and charged with contempt, she then, for the first time, asserted her privilege against self-incrimination.  Her claim of privilege was overruled, and she was convicted of contempt.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the conviction is sustained.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/367/case.html#368"">340 U. S. 368</a></span>-375.</p>
<p>(a) Since the privilege against self-incrimination is solely for the benefit of the witness, petitioner's original refusal to answer could not be justified by a desire to protect another from punishment, much less to protect another from interrogation by a grand jury.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/367/case.html#371"">340 U. S. 371</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) Books and records kept in a representative, rather than a personal, capacity cannot be the subject of the personal privilege against self-incrimination, even though production of them might tend to incriminate their keeper personally.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/367/case.html#371"">340 U. S. 371</a></span>-372.</p>
<p>(c) Having freely answered self-incriminating questions relating to her connection with the Communist Party, petitioner could not refuse to answer further questions which would not subject her to a real danger of further incrimination.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/367/case.html#372"">340 U. S. 372</a></span>-375.</p>
<p>(d) Questions relating to activities in the Communist Party are incriminating, both as to a violation of the Smith Act and as to a conspiracy to violate that Act, <em>Blau v. United States,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/159/case.html"">340 U. S. 159</a></span>.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/367/case.html#375"">340 U. S. 375</a></span>.</p>
<p>179 F.2d 559, affirmed. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""368"">Page 340 U. S. 368</a></p><p></p>
<p>In a federal district court, petitioner was convicted of contempt for refusal to answer questions asked by a federal grand jury.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  179 F.2d 559.  This Court granted certiorari.  339 U.S. 956.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/367/case.html#375"">340 U. S. 375</a></span>.</p>

Wisconsin Board, 340 U.S.  383 (1951)</h3><p><b>Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway &</p></b><p><b>Motor Coach Employees of America, Division 998</p></b><p><b>v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board</p></b><p><b>No. 329</p></b><p><b>Argued January 9-10, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951<L=|340 U.S. 383ast|>*</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 383</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>The Wisconsin Public Utility Anti-Strike Law, which makes it a misdemeanor for any group of public utility employees to engage in a strike which would cause an interruption of an essential public utility service, as applied in these cases, conflicts with the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, and is invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/383/case.html#385"">340 U. S. 385</a></span>-399.</p>
<p>1. By the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, safeguarding the right of employees to strike, Congress occupied this field and closed it to state regulation, and any concurrent state regulation of peaceful strikes for higher wages is invalid.  <em>Automobile Workers v. O'Brien,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/339/454/case.html"">339 U. S. 454</a></span>.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/383/case.html#389"">340 U. S. 389</a></span>-390.</p>
<p>2. The Federal Act applies to a privately owned public utility whose business and activities are carried on wholly within a single state.  <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Labor Board,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/305/197/case.html"">305 U. S. 197</a></span>.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/383/case.html#391"">340 U. S. 391</a></span>-393.</p>
<p>3. The result finds further support in the 1947 amendments, whereby Congress provided special procedures to deal with strikes which might create national emergencies.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/383/case.html#393"">340 U. S. 393</a></span>-396.</p>
<p>4. The questions of policy raised here are for legislative determination, and have been resolved by Congress adversely to respondents.  This Court, in the exercise of its judicial function, must take the comprehensive and valid federal legislation as enacted and declare invalid state regulation which impinges on that legislation.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/383/case.html#397"">340 U. S. 397</a></span>-398. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""384"">Page 340 U. S. 384</a></p><p></p>
<p>5. As applied in this case, the Wisconsin Act is in direct conflict with the Federal Act, and therefore is invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/383/case.html#398"">340 U. S. 398</a></span>-399.</p>
<p>257 Wis. 43, 42 N.W.2d 471; 258 Wis. 1, 44 N.W.2d 547, reversed.</p>
<p>The cases are stated in the second and third paragraphs of the opinion.  The judgments below are <em>reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/383/case.html#399"">340 U. S. 399</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""385"">Page 340 U. S. 385</a></p><p></p>

Wisconsin Employment Relations Board</p></b><p><b>No. 302</p></b><p><b>Argued January 9-10, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 411</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Appellants sued in a Wisconsin State Court for a declaratory judgment that the Wisconsin Public Utility Anti-Strike Law contravened the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution and was invalid as in conflict with federal labor legislation.  The state trial court decided against appellants on all issues.  On appeal, the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed, but on the ground that a decision on the federal constitutional questions would be premature in the absence of a concrete factual record.  Appellants did not petition this Court for certiorari.  Subsequently, when a strike was in progress, appellants sued in a federal district court for declaratory and injunctive relief holding the Wisconsin Act invalid as in conflict with federal labor legislation.  The Federal District Court held that the suit was barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em>  In another suit involving the same parties and presenting the same issues, however, the State Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of the Wisconsin Act, and its judgment is this day reversed by this Court, <em>ante</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/383/case.html"">340 U. S. 383</a></span>.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. The District Court's interpretation of the state law as to <em>res judicata</em> in this particular case was erroneous.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/411/case.html#414"">340 U. S. 414</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. This Court having declared the Wisconsin law to be invalid under the Federal Constitution, <em>ante</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/383/case.html"">340 U. S. 383</a></span>, a federal court judgment restraining its enforcement as prayed in this suit is neither necessary nor appropriate.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/411/case.html#414"">340 U. S. 414</a></span>-415.</p>
<p>90 F.Supp. 347, judgment vacated.</p>
<p>The case is stated in the opinion.  The judgment below is vacated, and cause remanded, p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/411/case.html#415"">340 U. S. 415</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""412"">Page 340 U. S. 412</a></p><p></p>

Wisconsin Board, 340 U.S.  416 (1951)</h3><p><b>Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway &</p></b><p><b>Motor Coach Employees of America, Division 998 v.</p></b><p><b>Wisconsin Employment Relations Board</p></b><p><b>No. 330</p></b><p><b>Argued January 9-10, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 416</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>This is a proceeding to review a judgment of a Wisconsin State Court sustaining an arbitrators' award under the Wisconsin Public Utility Anti-Strike Law.  The award was for one year only, and that time has elapsed.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. There being no subject matter upon which the judgment of this Court can operate, the cause is moot.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/416/case.html#417"">340 U. S. 417</a></span>-418.</p>
<p>2. Whether or not it is the practice of the Wisconsin courts to decide questions of importance where a case has become moot, this Court is without power to decide moot questions.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/416/case.html#418"">340 U. S. 418</a></span>.</p>
<p>257 Wis. 53, 42 N.W.2d 477, judgment vacated.</p>
<p>The case is stated in the opinion.  Judgment below <em>vacated, and cause remanded,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/416/case.html#418"">340 U. S. 418</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""417"">Page 340 U. S. 417</a></p><p></p>

Rock Island Motor Transit Co.</p></b><p><b>No. 25</p></b><p><b>Argued November 7, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 419</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. The Interstate Commerce Commission authorized a railroad's motor carrier affiliate to acquire two other motor carriers.  The first acquisition was approved by the Commission under &#167; 213 (now &#167; 5) of the Interstate Commerce Act, and a certificate of convenience and necessity was issued under &#167; 207.  The certificate contained the condition that the Commission might impose such further restrictions as may be necessary to insure that the service should be auxiliary or supplementary to the train service of the railroad.  The second acquisition was approved under &#167; 5 of the Act by a report and order which did not contain this condition, but no certificate of convenience and necessity had been issued under &#167; 207.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the Commission had power, in a subsequent proceeding not under &#167; 212, to modify the certificate covering operations under the first acquisition, and to impose like conditions on the certificate to be granted in respect of the second acquisition, so as to confine the motor carrier operations to service auxiliary to, and supplemental of, rail service.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#422"">340 U. S. 422</a></span>-436,  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#444"">340 U. S. 444</a></span>-448.</p>
<p>(a) The Commission has power at the time of its approval of an application to limit the authority to be granted by certificates of convenience and necessity for the operation of motor carriers, whether the certificate is issued on an original application under &#167; 207 or after acquisition under &#167; 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#430"">340 U. S. 430</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) At the time of issuance of a certificate, if the Commission reasonably deems the restriction useful in protecting competition, or for other statutory purposes, the Commission may require a railroad-affiliated motor carrier to perform only those services that are auxiliary and supplemental to the rail service.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#430"">340 U. S. 430</a></span>-431.</p>
<p>(c) The restriction of a railroad motor-carrier affiliate to operations which are auxiliary and supplemental to rail service is a logical method to insure the maximum development of the two transportation agencies -- rail and motor -- as coordinate transportation </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""420"">Page 340 U. S. 420</a></p><p> services in accordance with the Declaration of Policy in the Motor Carrier Act of 1935 and with the National Transportation Policy.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#431"">340 U. S. 431</a></span>.</p>
<p>(d) Specific statutory authority for such restriction is found in the requirements of the proviso in &#167; 213(a) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935 and &#167; 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended in 1940.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#431"">340 U. S. 431</a></span>,  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#436"">340 U. S. 436</a></span>.</p>
<p>(e) Since competition, public interest in the preservation of the inherent advantages of rails and motors, and use of motor service by railroads in their operations, are the basis for allowing acquisitions of motor routes by railroads under the National Transportation Policy, it is consonant with that policy to reserve the right to make further limitations, restrictions or modifications to insure that the service remain auxiliary or supplemental.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#434"">340 U. S. 434</a></span>-435.</p>
<p>(f) Such reservation of power in the Commission to modify the certificate does not offend against the provision of &#167; 212 that a certificate ""shall remain in effect until suspended or terminated"" under that section.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#435"">340 U. S. 435</a></span>.</p>
<p>(g) The specific requirement of the National Transportation Policy that the inherent advantages of all modes of transportation be retained, or of &#167; 5 that acquisition of motor routes by railroads shall require special findings and may be subject to special conditions, is not overridden by the general provisions of &#167;&#167; 208, 216 (c)</p>
<p>and 217(a).  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#435"">340 U. S. 435</a></span>-436.</p>
<p>2. The Commission ordered that the certificate covering the first acquisition be modified so that future operations thereunder would be subject in substance to the following conditions:  (1) the service of the motor carrier shall be limited to service which is auxiliary to, or supplemental of, train service of the railroad; (2) the motor carrier shall not render any service to or from any point not on a rail line of the railroad; (3) no shipments shall be transported by the motor carrier between any of the designated ""key points,"" or through, or to, or from, more than one of said points; (4) all contracts between the motor carrier and the railroad shall be subject to revision by the Commission; (5) the Commission may impose such further conditions as it may find to be necessary to insure that the service shall be auxiliary or supplemental to rail service.</p>
<p><em>Held.</em>  the new conditions are within the limits covered by the reservation of power in the certificate to impose such further limitations as might be found necessary ""to insure that the service shall be auxiliary or supplementary to the train service"" of the railroad.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#436"">340 U. S. 436</a></span>-444. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""421"">Page 340 U. S. 421</a></p><p></p>
<p>(a) Such added conditions are not changes in or revocations of a certificate in whole or in part, but a carrying out of the reservation in the certificate.  <em>United States v. Seatrainlines,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/329/424/case.html"">329 U. S. 424</a></span>, distinguished.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#442"">340 U. S. 442</a></span>-443.</p>
<p>(b) The meaning of auxiliary and supplemental is not limited by the Commission's practice at any particular time, but embraces such requirements as may fairly be said to fall within the meaning which the Commission has given to the terms.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#443"">340 U. S. 443</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. The Commission had the power also to place in the certificate to be issued in connection with the second acquisition the modified conditions of the certificate covering the first acquisition, since the order approving the second acquisition was not a final order.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#444"">340 U. S. 444</a></span>-448.</p>
<p>(a) The certificate is the final act or order that validates the operation, and, until its form and contents are fixed by delivery to the applicant, the power to frame it in accordance with statutory directions persists.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#448"">340 U. S. 448</a></span>.</p>
<p>4. In view of the National Transportation Policy and &#167; 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, approval of the acquisition of a motor carrier by a railroad may be conditioned by the Commission on the purchaser's willingness to accept a narrower certificate than that possessed by the seller.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#448"">340 U. S. 448</a></span>-449.</p>
<p>5. By the Commission's modification of the certificate of the railroad's motor carrier affiliate, to insure that its operations would be auxiliary and supplemental to rail service, the motor carrier was not deprived of property without due process of law.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#449"">340 U. S. 449</a></span>.</p>
<p>90 F.Supp. 516, reversed.</p>
<p>A three-judge District Court set aside and permanently enjoined enforcement of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.  90 F.Supp. 516.  On appeal to this Court, <em>reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html#449"">340 U. S. 449</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""422"">Page 340 U. S. 422</a></p><p></p>

Texas & Pacific Motor Transport Co.</p></b><p><b>No. 38</p></b><p><b>Argued November 7-8, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951<L=|340 U.S. 450ast|>*</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 450</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Under &#167; 213 (now &#167; 5) of the Interstate Commerce Act, providing for the acquisition of operating rights from other carriers, and under &#167; 207, providing for new operations, the Interstate Commerce Commission had issued certificates of convenience and necessity to a motor carrier affiliate of a railroad.  In each of the certificates, the Commission reserved the right to impose further restrictions to confine the motor carrier's operations to service ""auxiliary to, or supplemental of, rail service.""</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the Commission had power, in subsequent proceedings, to modify the certificates so as, in substance, to bar the motor carrier from issuing its own bills of lading or performing all-motor service under all-motor local rates or all-motor joint rates with connecting motor carriers, from substituting rail service for motor service, and from participating in motor-carrier tariffs.  <em>United States v. Rock Island Motor Transit Co., ante</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/419/case.html"">340 U. S. 419</a></span>.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/450/case.html#451"">340 U. S. 451</a></span>-458.</p>
<p>1. The action of the Commission in thus modifying the certificates was not invalid as in conflict with &#167; 216 of the Transportation Act of 1940, nor invalid as not complying with the revocation procedure prescribed by &#167; 212 of the Interstate Commerce Act; nor unconstitutional as confiscatory.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/450/case.html#457"">340 U. S. 457</a></span>-458.</p>
<p>2. In a certificate issued to a motor carrier affiliate of a railroad, the Commission may reserve the right to impose further restrictions to confine the motor carrier's operations to service which is auxiliary to, and supplemental of, rail service, whether the certificate be issued under &#167; 207 for a new operation or in acquisition proceedings under &#167;&#167; 5 and 213.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/450/case.html#458"">340 U. S. 458</a></span>-459. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""451"">Page 340 U. S. 451</a></p><p></p>
<p>3. The order of the Commission was not without support in the evidence.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/450/case.html#459"">340 U. S. 459</a></span>-460.</p>
<p>4. In the hearing by the Commission, the motor carrier was not denied procedural due process.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/450/case.html#460"">340 U. S. 460</a></span>-461.</p>
<p>87 F.Supp. 107, reversed.</p>
<p>In a proceeding to set aside two orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the three-judge District Court set aside the orders and entered a permanent injunction.  87 F.Supp. 107.  The United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission (No. 38) and an intervenor (No. 39) appealed.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/450/case.html#461"">340 U. S. 461</a></span>.</p>

Ragen</p></b><p><b>No. 83</p></b><p><b>Argued November 27-28, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 462</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Department of Justice Order No. 3229, issued by the Attorney General under 5 U.S.C. &#167; 22, a subordinate official of the Department of Justice refused, in a habeas corpus proceeding by a state prisoner, to obey a subpoena <em>duces tecum</em> requiring him to produce papers of the Department in his possession.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  Order No. 3229 is valid, and the subordinate official properly refused to produce the papers.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/462/case.html#463"">340 U. S. 463</a></span>-468.</p>
<p>2. The trial court not having questioned the subordinate official on his willingness to submit the material ""to the court for determination as to its materiality to the case"" and whether it should be disclosed, the issue of how far the Attorney General could or did waive any claimed privilege against disclosure is here immaterial.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/462/case.html#468"">340 U. S. 468</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. Order No. 3229 was a valid exercise by the Attorney General of his authority under 5 U.S.C. &#167; 22 to prescribe regulations not inconsistent with law for ""the custody, use, and preservation of the records, papers and property appertaining to"" the Department of Justice.  <em>Boske v. Comingore,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/177/459/case.html"">177 U. S. 459</a></span>.

National Labor Relations Board</p></b><p><b>No. 40</p></b><p><b>Argued November 6-7, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 474</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>The National Labor Relations Board ordered petitioner to reinstate with back pay an employee found to have been discharged because he gave certain testimony in another proceeding under the National Labor Relations Act.  The evidence as to the reason for his discharge was conflicting, and the Board overruled its examiner's findings of fact and his recommendation that the proceedings be dismissed.  In decreeing enforcement, the Court of Appeals held that the Board's findings of fact were ""supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole"" within the meaning of &#167; 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended in 1947.  This holding was based partly on the view (1) that the 1947 amendments had not broadened the scope of judicial review, and (2) that the Board's rejection of its examiner's findings of fact was without relevance in determining whether the Board's findings were supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. In the light of the legislative history, the standard of proof required under &#167; 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, to support a decision of the Labor Board on judicial review is the same as that to be exacted by courts reviewing every administrative action subject to the Administrative Procedure Act.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html#477"">340 U. S. 477</a></span>-487.</p>
<p>2. In amending &#167; 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act so as to require that, on judicial review, the Board's findings of fact must be supported by substantial evidence ""on the record considered as a whole,"" Congress made it clear that a reviewing court is not barred from setting aside a Board decision when it cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting that decision is substantial, when viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes, including the body of evidence opposed to the Board's view.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html#487"">340 U. S. 487</a></span>-488.</p>
<p>3. When read in the light of their legislative history, the Administrative Procedure Act and the Labor Management Relations Act, </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""475"">Page 340 U. S. 475</a></p><p> 1947, require the courts to assume more responsibility for the reasonableness and fairness of Labor Board decisions than some courts have shown in the past.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html#488"">340 U. S. 488</a></span>-490.</p>
<p>4. Whether, on the record as a whole, there is substantial evidence to support agency findings is a question which Congress has placed in the keeping of the courts of appeals.  This Court will intervene only in what ought to be the rare instance when the standard appears to have been misapprehended or grossly misapplied.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html#491"">340 U. S. 491</a></span>.</p>
<p>5. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that it was barred from taking into account the report of the examiner on questions of fact insofar as that report was rejected by the Board.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html#491"">340 U. S. 491</a></span>-497.</p>
<p>(a) A trial examiner's findings are not as unassailable as a master's, and may be reversed by the Board when when not clearly erroneous.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html#492"">340 U. S. 492</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) A reviewing court need not give a trial examiner's findings more weight than, in reason and in the light of judicial experience, they deserve, but they should be accorded the relevance that they reasonably command in answering the comprehensive question whether the evidence supporting the Board's order is substantial.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html#496"">340 U. S. 496</a></span>-497.</p>
<p>6. The cause is remanded to the Court of Appeals, which is left free to grant or deny enforcement as it thinks the principles expressed in the opinion, of this Court dictate.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html#497"">340 U. S. 497</a></span>.</p>
<p>179 F. 2d 749, vacated and remanded.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals decreed enforcement of an order of the National Labor Relations Board requiring petitioner to reinstate an employee with back pay and to cease and desist from discriminating against any employee who files charges or gives testimony under the National Labor Relations Act.  179 F.2d 749.  This Court granted certiorari.  339 U.S. 962.  <em>Judgment vacated and cause remanded,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html#497"">340 U. S. 497</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""476"">Page 340 U. S. 476</a></p><p></p>

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Labor Board v. Pittsburgh Steamship Co., 340 U.S.  498 (1951)</h3><p><b>National Labor Relations Board v. Pittsburgh Steamship Co.</p></b><p><b>No. 42</p></b><p><b>Argued November 6, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 498</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Prior to 1947, the National Labor Relations Board ordered respondent to reinstate a dismissed employee and to terminate what were found to be coercive and discriminatory labor practices.  After 1947, the Court of Appeals made a painstaking review of the record and unanimously concluded that the inferences on which the Board's findings were based were so overborne by evidence calling for contrary inferences that the findings of the Board could not, ""on the record considered as a whole,"" be deemed supported by ""substantial"" evidence within the meaning of &#167; 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.  Accordingly, it denied enforcement of the Board's order.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the judgment below is affirmed.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/498/case.html#499"">340 U. S. 499</a></span>-503.</p>
<p>1. The Court of Appeals correctly held that the amendments made by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, broadened the scope of judicial review of the Board's orders beyond that required by the original National Labor Relations Act.  <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, ante,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html"">340 U. S. 474</a></span>.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/498/case.html#500"">340 U. S. 500</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. The scope of the court's reviewing power was governed by the legislation in force at the time the power was exercised, even though the Board's order antedated such legislation.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/498/case.html#500"">340 U. S. 500</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. Congress has charged the courts of appeals, and not this Court, with the normal and primary responsibility for granting or denying enforcement of Labor Board orders.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/498/case.html#502"">340 U. S. 502</a></span>.</p>
<p>4. In reviewing a decision of a court of appeals on the question whether an order of the Board is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, this Court ought to do no more than decide whether the court of appeals has made a fair assessment of the record on the issue of substantiality.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/498/case.html#502"">340 U. S. 502</a></span>-503.</p>
<p>180 F.2d 731 affirmed.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals found an order of the National Labor Relations Board to be unsupported by substantial evidence within the meaning of &#167; 10(e) of the National </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""499"">Page 340 U. S. 499</a></p><p> Labor Relations Act, as amended, and denied enforcement.  180 F.2d 731.  This Court granted certiorari.  339 U.S. 951.  <em>Affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/498/case.html#503"">340 U. S. 503</a></span>.</p>

Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc.</p></b><p><b>No. 267</p></b><p><b>Argued December 7, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 504</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>A contractor, engaged in construction work for the Navy on the Island of Guam, maintained for its employees a recreation center adjoining a channel so dangerous that swimming was forbidden, and signs to that effect were erected.  After spending the afternoon at the center, an employee was drowned while attempting to swim the channel in order to rescue two men in distress.  Under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, extended to this employee by the Defense Bases Act, the Deputy Commissioner found as a ""fact"" that the employee's death arose out of and in the course of his employment, and awarded a death benefit to his mother.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the award is sustained.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/504/case.html#505"">340 U. S. 505</a></span>-509.</p>
<p>1. Such a rescue attempt is not necessarily excluded from the coverage of the Act.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/504/case.html#506"">340 U. S. 506</a></span>-507.</p>
<p>2. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Deputy Commissioner's findings should be accepted unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.  <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, ante</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html"">340 U. S. 474</a></span>.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/504/case.html#507"">340 U. S. 507</a></span>-508.</p>
<p>3. The evidence was sufficient to support the Deputy Commissioner's finding that the employee acted reasonably in attempting the rescue, and that his death may fairly be attributed to the risks of his employment.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/504/case.html#508"">340 U. S. 508</a></span>-509.</p>
<p>182 F.2d 772 reversed.</p>
<p>The District Court declined to set aside an award under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act of March 4, 1927, 44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 901 <em>et seq.</em>  The Court of Appeals reversed.  182 F.2d 772.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 849.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/504/case.html#509"">340 U. S. 509</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""505"">Page 340 U. S. 505</a></p><p></p>

Rogan</p></b><p><b>No. 96</p></b><p><b>Argued November 28-29, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 511</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Maryland imposes on railroads a franchise tax, measured by gross receipts, apportioned to the length of their lines within the State.  Appellant railroad operates, wholly in Baltimore, a marine terminal and rail lines connecting the terminal with trunkline railroads.  Its operating revenues are derived from switching freight cars; storage pending forwarding; wharfage; weighing loaded freight cars, and rentals paid by a stevedoring company for the use of a crane.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. The Import-Export Clause, Art. I, &#167; 10, cl. 2, of the Federal Constitution is not violated by the inclusion, in the gross receipts by which the tax is measured, of revenues derived by appellant from its handling of goods moving in foreign trade.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/511/case.html#512"">340 U. S. 512</a></span>-515.</p>
<p>(a) The tax in this case is not on the goods, but on the handling of them at the port.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/511/case.html#513"">340 U. S. 513</a></span>-515.</p>
<p>(b) Since appellant merely rents a crane for loading and unloading, and does not itself do the stevedoring, it is unnecessary to decide whether loading for export and unloading for import are immune from tax under the Import-Export Clause.

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 87</p></b><p><b>Argued January 2, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 523</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Petitioner, a messman on a ship owned by the United States, went ashore on leave while the vessel was at Naples.  He and two other members of the crew did some sightseeing, drank a bottle of wine together, and then spent an hour and a half at a dance hall.  A room adjoining the dance hall and overlooking the sea had French doors opening onto an unprotected ledge.  Petitioner stepped onto the ledge, grasped an iron rod which seemed to be attached to the building, and leaned forward to take a look.  The iron rod broke off, and petitioner lost his balance, fell, and broke his leg.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  petitioner was entitled to recover from the United States for maintenance and cure.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/523/case.html#524"">340 U. S. 524</a></span>-530.</p>
<p>1. The exceptions to the liability of shipowners, which the Shipowners' Liability Convention, Art. 2, par. 2, permits to be made by ""national laws or regulations"" are operative by virtue of the general maritime law, and no Act of Congress is necessary to give them force.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/523/case.html#525"">340 U. S. 525</a></span>-526.</p>
<p>(a) As used in Art. 2, par. 2 of the Convention, the term ""national laws or regulations"" includes the rules of court decisions, as well as legislative acts.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/523/case.html#526"">340 U. S. 526</a></span>-528.</p>
<p>(b) Both paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Convention state the standard of liability which legislative and decisional law define in particularity.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/523/case.html#527"">340 U. S. 527</a></span>-528.</p>
<p>2. Petitioner's injury was not due to his ""willful act, default or misbehaviour,"" within the meaning of Art. 2, par. 2(b) of the Convention, and recovery was not barred thereby.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/523/case.html#528"">340 U. S. 528</a></span>-529.</p>
<p>3. Petitioner's injury occurred ""in the service of the ship,"" within the meaning of that term as used in Art. 2, par. 2(a) of the Convention.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/523/case.html#529"">340 U. S. 529</a></span>-530.</p>
<p>179 F.2d 919, reversed.</p>
<p>In a suit by petitioner for maintenance and cure, the District Court awarded maintenance.  75 F.Supp. 210, 76 F.Supp. 735.  The Court of Appeals disallowed it.  179 F.2d 919.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 806.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/523/case.html#530"">340 U. S. 530</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""524"">Page 340 U. S. 524</a></p><p></p>

Department of Revenue</p></b><p><b>No. 133</p></b><p><b>Argued December 6, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 534</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Under the Illinois Retailers' Occupation Tax Act of June 28, 1933, Illinois levied a tax on the gross receipts from all sales to persons in Illinois by petitioner, a Massachusetts corporation with its factory and head office in Massachusetts and a branch office in Chicago.  At petitioner's head office are its general management, accounting, and credit offices, where it accepts all direct mail orders and orders forwarded by its Chicago office.  The Chicago office makes local sales at retail from a limited inventory carried there, receives orders and forwards them to the head office for action there, and acts as an intermediary to reduce freight charges on goods shipped from the head office.  The Supreme Court of Illinois found that the presence of petitioner's local retail outlet, in the circumstances of this case, was sufficient to attribute all income derived from Illinois sales to that outlet and render it taxable.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the tax is sustained on all sales to Illinois customers, except on orders sent directly by the customers to the head office and shipped directly to the customers from the head office.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/534/case.html#535"">340 U. S. 535</a></span>-539.</p>
<p>1. When a foreign corporation has gone into a state to do local business by state permission and has submitted itself to the taxing power of the state, it can avoid taxation on some sales to persons in that state only by sustaining the burden of showing that particular transactions are disassociated from the local business, and interstate in nature.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/534/case.html#537"">340 U. S. 537</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. By submitting itself to the taxing power of the state, it likewise submits itself to the state's judicial power to construe and apply its tax laws, insofar as it keeps within constitutional bounds.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/534/case.html#538"">340 U. S. 538</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. In the light of all the evidence, the judgment of the Illinois court attributing to petitioner's Chicago branch income from all sales that utilized it either in receiving the orders or distributing the goods was within the realm of permissible judgment.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/534/case.html#538"">340 U. S. 538</a></span>-539.</p>
<p>4. The only transactions here involved that are so clearly interstate in character that the State could not reasonably attribute their proceeds to the local business are orders sent directly to its </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""535"">Page 340 U. S. 535</a></p><p> head office by the customers and shipped directly to the customers from the head office, and such transactions are not subject to this tax.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/534/case.html#539"">340 U. S. 539</a></span></p>
<p>405 Ill. 314, 90 N.E.2d 737, judgment vacated and remanded.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Illinois sustained a state tax on the gross receipts from all sales by petitioner to persons in Illinois.  405 Ill. 314, 90 N.E.2d 737.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 807.  <em>Judgment vacated and cause remanded,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/534/case.html#539"">340 U. S. 539</a></span>.</p>

Yellow Cab Co.</p></b><p><b>Argued December 6, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951<L=|340 U.S. 543ast|>*</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 543</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>The Federal Tort Claims Act empowers a United States District Court to require the United States to be impleaded as a third-party defendant and to answer the claim of a joint tortfeasor for contribution as if the United States were a private individual.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/543/case.html#544"">340 U. S. 544</a></span>-557.</p>
<p>1. The Government has consented to be sued for contribution claimed by a joint tortfeasor in the circumstances of these cases.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/543/case.html#546"">340 U. S. 546</a></span>-552.</p>
<p>2. The Federal Tort Claims Act carries the Government's consent to be sued for contribution claimed by a joint tortfeasor not only in a separate proceeding, but also as a third-part defendant.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/543/case.html#552"">340 U. S. 552</a></span>-557.</p>
<p>3. A different result is not required by the fact that the Act requires claims against the United States to be tried without a jury, whereas the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution preserves to private individuals their right of trial by jury on such claims in a federal court.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/543/case.html#555"">340 U. S. 555</a></span>-557.</p>
<p>181 F.2d 967, affirmed.</p>
<p>87 U.S.App.D.C. ___, 183 F.2d 825, reversed.</p>
<p>The cases are stated in the opinion.  The judgment in No. 218 is <em>affirmed,</em> and that in No. 204 is <em>reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/543/case.html#557"">340 U. S. 557</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""544"">Page 340 U. S. 544</a></p><p></p>

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Emich Motors Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 340 U.S.  558 (1951)</h3><p><b>Emich Motors Corp. v. General Motors Corp.</p></b><p><b>No. 209</p></b><p><b>Argued January 3-4, 1951</p></b><p><b>Decided February 26, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 558</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. In this suit under &#167; 4 of the Clayton Act to recover treble damages for injuries sustained by reason of a conspiracy in restraint of trade, plaintiffs were entitled under &#167; 5 to introduce a prior criminal judgment based on a conviction of defendants for the same conspiracy in order to establish <em>prima facie</em> all matters of fact and law necessarily decided by the conviction and the verdict on which it was based.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/558/case.html#566"">340 U. S. 566</a></span>-569.</p>
<p>2. Where the criminal judgment rests on a general verdict of the jury, what was decided by that judgment must be determined by the trial judge hearing the treble damage suit, upon an examination of the record, including the pleadings, the evidence submitted, the instructions under which the jury arrived at its verdict, and any opinions of the court.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/558/case.html#569"">340 U. S. 569</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. The criminal judgment involved in this case was <em>prima facie</em> evidence of a general conspiracy for the purpose of monopolizing the financing of General Motors cars, and also of the effectuation of that conspiracy by coercing General Motors dealers to use its subsidiary finance company's services.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/558/case.html#570"">340 U. S. 570</a></span>-571.</p>
<p>4. In order to establish their <em>prima facie</em> case, it therefore was only necessary for plaintiffs to introduce, in addition to the criminal judgment, evidence of the impact of the conspiracy on them and evidence of any resulting damages.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/558/case.html#571"">340 U. S. 571</a></span>.</p>
<p>5. What issues were decided by the criminal conviction is a question of law on which the judge must instruct the jury.  He should (1) examine the record to determine the issues decided by that judgment; (2) in his instructions to the jury reconstruct that case in the manner and to the extent he deems necessary to acquaint the jury fully with the issues determined therein, and (3) explain the scope and effect of the former judgment on the case at trial.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/558/case.html#571"">340 U. S. 571</a></span>-572.</p>
<p>181 F.2d 70 modified. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""559"">Page 340 U. S. 559</a></p><p></p>
<p>The case is <em>remanded to the Court of Appeals with directions to modify its judgment,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/558/case.html#572"">340 U. S. 572</a></span>.</p>

Maryland</p></b><p><b>Argued October 17, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided January 15, 1951<L=|340 U.S. 268ast|>*</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 268</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Appellants' applications to a City Council for permits to use a city park for Bible talks were denied, for no apparent reason except the Council's dislike for appellants and disagreement with their views.  For attempting to hold public meetings and make speeches in the park without permits, they were convicted on charges of disorderly conduct, although there was no evidence of disorder, threat of violence or riot, and they had conducted themselves in a manner beyond reproach.  There was no ordinance prohibiting or regulating the use of the park, and there were no established standards for the granting of permits; but permits customarily had been granted for similar purposes, including meetings of religious and fraternal organizations.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  Appellants were denied equal protection of the laws, in the exercise of freedom of speech and religion, contrary to the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/268/case.html#269"">340 U. S. 269</a></span>-273.</p>
<p>(a) The right to equal protection of the laws, in the exercise of those freedoms of speech and religion protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, has a firmer foundation than the whims or personal opinions of a local governing body.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/268/case.html#272"">340 U. S. 272</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) A contention that state and city officials should have the power to exclude religious groups, as such, from the use of public parks was no justification when permits had always been issued for the use of the park by religious organizations.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/268/case.html#272"">340 U. S. 272</a></span>-273.</p>
<p>(c) A contention that the park was designated as a sanctuary for peace and quiet was no justification when its use for patriotic celebrations by fraternal organizations was permitted.

<p>(d) The lack of standards in the license-issuing ""practice"" renders that ""practice"" a prior restraint in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the completely arbitrary and discriminatory refusal to grant the permits was a denial of equal protection.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/268/case.html#273"">340 U. S. 273</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""269"">Page 340 U. S. 269</a></p><p></p>
<p>(e) Since the convictions were based upon the lack of permits which were denied unconstitutionally, the convictions cannot stand.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/268/case.html#273"">340 U. S. 273</a></span>.  ___ Md. ___, 71 A. 2d 9, reversed.</p>
<p>For attempts to hold religious meetings in a public park without permits, appellants were convicted of disorderly conduct under Flack's Md.Ann. Code, 1939 (1947 Supp.), Art. 27, &#167;131.  The Maryland Court of Appeals declined to review their convictions.  ___ Md. ___, 71 A.2d 9.

New York</p></b><p><b>No. 50</p></b><p><b>Argued October 17, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided January 15, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 290</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. A city ordinance which prescribes no appropriate standard for administrative action and gives an administrative official discretionary power to control in advance the right of citizens to speak on religious matters on the city streets is invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/290/case.html"">340 U. S. 290</a></span>-295.</p>
<p>2. In 1946, appellant obtained from the city Police Commissioner a permit to hold religious meetings on the streets of New York City during that year only.  It was revoked on evidence that he had ridiculed and denounced other religious beliefs, in violation of a criminal provision of the ordinance under which the permit was issued.  The ordinance contained no provision for revocation of such permits, and no standard to guide administrative actions in granting or denying permits.  In 1948, appellant's application for a similar permit was denied, and he was convicted for holding a religious meeting on the streets without a permit.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  The conviction is reversed.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/290/case.html"">340 U. S. 290</a></span>-295.</p>
<p>300 N.Y. 273, 90 N.E.2d 455, reversed.</p>
<p>Appellant was convicted for holding a religious meeting on the city streets without a permit in violation of Administrative Code of N. Y. City, c. 18, &#167; 435-7.0.  The Court of Appeals of New York affirmed.  300 N.Y. 273, 90 N.E.2d 455.  On appeal to this Court, <em>reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'>340 U. S. 295</span>.</p>

New York</p></b><p><b>No. 93</p></b><p><b>Argued October 17, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided January 15, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 315</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Petitioner made an inflammatory speech to a mixed crowd of 75 or 80 Negroes and white people on a city street.  He made derogatory remarks about President Truman, the American Legion, and local political officials, endeavored to arouse the Negroes against the whites, and urged that Negroes rise up in arms and fight for equal rights.  The crowd, which blocked the sidewalk and overflowed into the street, became restless; its feelings for and against the speaker were rising, and there was at least one threat of violence.  After observing the situation for some time without interference, police officers, in order to prevent a fight, thrice requested petitioner to get off the box and stop speaking.  After his third refusal, and after he had been speaking over 30 minutes, they arrested him, and he was convicted of violating &#167; 722 of the Penal Code of New York, which, in effect, forbids incitement of a breach of the peace.  The conviction was affirmed by two New York courts on review.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  The conviction is sustained against a claim that it violated petitioner's right of free speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/315/case.html#316"">340 U. S. 316</a></span>-321.</p>
<p>(a) Petitioner was neither arrested nor convicted for the making or the content of his speech, but for the reaction which it actually engendered.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/315/case.html#319"">340 U. S. 319</a></span>-320.</p>
<p>(b) The police cannot be used as an instrument for the suppression of unpopular views; but, when a speaker passes the bounds of argument or persuasion and undertakes incitement to riot, the police are not powerless to prevent a breach of the peace.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/315/case.html#321"">340 U. S. 321</a></span>.</p>
<p>300 N.Y. 391, 91 N.E.2d 316, affirmed.</p>
<p>The case is stated in the first paragraph of the opinion.  The decision below is <em>affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/315/case.html#321"">340 U.

		<h4>Primary Holding</h4>
		<div>
						
			The First Amendment permits the government to take action against speech when there is a clear and present danger that it will cause a disturbance of the peace.

		<h4>Facts</h4>		<div>
						
			A crowd of about 80 people attended an open-air meeting where Feiner gave a speech. Pedestrians in the area were forced to walk into the street, and two police officers came in response to a complaint about the meeting. Some of Feiner&#039;s remarks encouraged African-Americans to take up weapons and fight for their rights against white people. The crowd, which was racially mixed, responded with some emotion, and one person said that the police were unable to control the crowd. Another person threatened violence if the police failed to act, so the officers eventually intervened to forestall the prospect of a riot. After Feiner twice refused to stop his speech, they arrested him.

											<li>Tom C. Clark </li>
									</ul>
										<p>
					A sufficiently clear and present danger arose when the crowd threatened violence and the speaker refused to stop his speech in response to the police requests. As a result, his conviction for violating public peace, order, and authority is proper within the limits of the state police power. The conviction arose from the defendant&#039;s surrounding content rather than the content or composition of his speech. The state has a strong interest in maintaining order on public streets.

				<strong>Dissent</strong>

											<li>Hugo Lafayette Black (Author)</li>
									</ul>
										<p>
					No clear and present danger could be inferred from mere disagreements and objections by members of a crowd toward a speaker. Threats by one member of the audience to insult the speaker are insufficient evidence on which to base a belief that a riot is about to happen. The police should have focused on protecting the speaker&#039;s right to speech if they believed that he was in danger. Officers are not entitled to order someone making a lawful speech to stop, especially without providing an explanation. Minority views can be expected to encounter some resistance, and the police should not silence them when it inevitably arises.

		<h4>Case Commentary</h4>
		<div>
			As with other First Amendment cases from the mid-20th century, the Court had a somewhat sensitive understanding of what types of speech were likely to lead to imminent violence. It likely would be less willing to find this conduct unprotected now.

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 21</p></b><p><b>Argued November 7, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided January 15, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 332</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Petitioner, a witness before a federal grand jury in response to a summons, declined to answer questions concerning activities and records of the Communist Party in Colorado, claiming his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.  Asserting his privilege against disclosing confidential communications between husband and wife, he also refused to reveal the whereabouts of his wife, who was wanted by the grand jury as a witness in connection with the same investigation.  It was undisputed that he obtained his knowledge of his wife's whereabouts by communication from her.  The District Court overruled both claims of privilege and sentenced petitioner to imprisonment for contempt of court.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. Failure to sustain petitioner's claim of privilege against self-incrimination was error.  <em>Blau v. United States,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/159/case.html"">340 U. S. 159</a></span>.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/332/case.html#333"">340 U. S. 333</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. Petitioner was entitled to rely on his privilege against disclosing confidential communications between husband and wife because the Government failed to overcome the presumption that the communications were confidential.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/332/case.html#333"">340 U. S. 333</a></span>-334. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""333"">Page 340 U. S. 333</a></p><p></p>

Leventritt</p></b><p><b>No. 211</p></b><p><b>Argued December 5, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided January 15, 1951<L=|340 U.S. 336ast|>*</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 336</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a plan of reorganization as ""fair and equitable"" within the meaning of &#167; 11 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, although the plan made no provision for participation of outstanding stock option warrants relating to common stock of the company to be reorganized.  The warrants represented options to purchase at any time, for a specified price, shares of the company's common stock.  The Commission found that there was no reasonable expectation, within the foreseeable future, that the market price of the common stock would exceed the exercise price of the warrants, and that, upon consideration of all the circumstances, there was no justification for recognizing any present value in the warrants at the expense of the common stock.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>   the District Court properly ordered enforcement of the plan.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/336/case.html#338"">340 U. S. 338</a></span>-348.</p>

The fact that the plan provides for no participation by the outstanding warrants despite their conceded, but low, market value does not preclude the Commission, as a matter of law, from concluding that the plan is ""fair and equitable"" within the meaning of &#167; 11(e) of the Act when informed estimates of future earnings indicate that they have no investment value.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/336/case.html#340"">340 U. S. 340</a></span>-348.</p>
<p>2. The fact that the options in the warrants were exercisable ""at any time (without limit),"" and thus had a ""perpetual feature,"" did not require that the Commission, as a matter of law, recognize some present value in the warrants.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/336/case.html#344"">340 U. S. 344</a></span>-345.</p>
<p>3. The fact that a purchaser may be willing to pay a nominal price for a warrant which has no investment value, on the mere chance that it may be saleable in a rising market, is not an adequate basis for allowing a value to the warrants at the expense of the common stock, in a reorganization under the Act.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/336/case.html#345"">340 U. S. 345</a></span>-346.</p>
<p>4. In determining the fairness and equity of compensation to be allowed holders of warrants, the Commission is not bound as a matter of law, any more than in the case of other securities, to </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""337"">Page 340 U. S. 337</a></p><p> limit itself precisely to the values which the market recognizes.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/336/case.html#346"">340 U. S. 346</a></span>.</p>
<p>5. The informed judgment of the Commission, rather than that of the market, is the appropriate guide to fairness and equity under the Act, and that informed judgment looks for investment values on a going concern basis measured primarily by the Commission's estimate of earnings within the foreseeable future.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/336/case.html#346"">340 U. S. 346</a></span>-347.</p>
<p>6. In the absence of abuse of its discretion, the Commission's approval of  plan is as lawful and binding when it recognizes a value of zero for a security as when it selects any other figure.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/336/case.html#347"">340 U. S. 347</a></span>.</p>
<p>7. In this case, the Act does not require proof that the warrants are wholly worthless and without any market value in order to sustain the Commission's judgment that the plan is ""fair and equitable,"" though denying them participation.  It is enough that the Commission, within its discretion, has given the warrants careful consideration, and, under all the circumstances, including the market value of the warrants, has found the plan to be ""fair and equitable"" within the meaning of &#167; 11 of the Act.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/336/case.html#347"">340 U. S. 347</a></span>.</p>
<p>179 F.2d 615 reversed.</p>
<p>The District Court ordered enforced a plan of reorganization approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Pubic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. 86 F.Supp. 697.  The Court of Appeals reversed that part of the order relating to stock option warrants, and remanded the cause to the District Court for further proceedings.  179 F.2d 615.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 809.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/336/case.html#348"">340 U. S. 348</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""338"">Page 340 U. S. 338</a></p><p></p>

City of Madison</p></b><p><b>No. 258</p></b><p><b>Argued December 7, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided January 15, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 349</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. An ordinance of a Wisconsin municipality forbids the sale of milk in the city as pasteurized unless it has been pasteurized and bottled at an approved pasteurization plant within five miles of the center of the city.  Appellant, an Illinois corporation engaged in gathering and distributing milk from farms in Illinois and Wisconsin, was denied a license to sell its products within the city solely because its pasteurization plants were more than five miles away.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  The ordinance unjustifiably discriminates against interstate commerce, in violation of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/349/case.html#350"">340 U. S. 350</a></span>-357.</p>
<p>(a) Even in the exercise of its unquestioned power to protect the health and safety of its people, a municipality may not erect an economic barrier protecting a major local industry against competition from without the state if reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives, adequate to conserve legitimate local interests, are available.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/349/case.html#354"">340 U. S. 354</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) In view of the reasonable and adequate alternatives which are available for the protection of the health and safety of the people of the municipality, the discrimination against interstate commerce inherent in the ordinance violates the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/349/case.html#354"">340 U. S. 354</a></span>-356.</p>
<p>2. A second provision of the ordinance in question forbids the sale of milk, or the importation, receipt or storage of milk for sale, within the city except from a source of supply possessing a permit issued after inspection by city officials, and expressly relieves the city officials from any duty to inspect farms located beyond twenty-five miles from the city.  Appellant's attack on the constitutional validity of this provision was dismissed by the state court for want of a justiciable controversy.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  as to the issue thus presented, the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the principles announced in the opinion of this Court.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/349/case.html#350"">340 U. S. 350</a></span>-351,  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/349/case.html#356"">340 U. S. 356</a></span>-357.</p>
<p>257 Wis. 308, 43 N.W.2d 480, reversed.</p>
<p>An ordinance of a Wisconsin municipality regulating the sale of milk was sustained by the State Supreme Court </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""350"">Page 340 U. S. 350</a></p><p> over appellant's objections to its validity under the Federal Constitution.  257 Wis. 308, 43 N.W.2d 480.  On appeal to this Court, <em>reversed and remanded,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/349/case.html#357"">340 U. S. 357</a></span>.</p>

		<h4>Facts</h4>		<div>
						
			Madison, Wisconsin prohibited the sale of pasteurized milk that had not been processed and bottled at an approved plant within five miles of the city. Dean Milk Co., which was based in Illinois, sold milk products in Illinois and Wisconsin. It maintained pasteurization plants that were 65 and 85 miles from Madison. The city did not allow it to sell its milk products as pasteurized there, however, for the sole reason that it had failed to comply with the geographical requirement in the ordinance.

										<p>
					The ordinance openly undermines interstate commerce because it is an effort to protect a local industry from competitors outside the area. There are plenty of adequate alternatives that the city reasonably could use to safeguard the health and safety of its residents. For example, it could send inspectors to observe the processes at the distant plants, or it could lawfully prevent milk from being sold in the city that did not meet the standards enforced at its plants. The city could base such a rule on the local ratings provided by the U.S. Public Health Service. Cities and states are not allowed to economically isolate themselves from the rest of the nation.

		<h4>Case Commentary</h4>
		<div>
			Decided under the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine, this decision examined whether the city had a less restrictive alternative available. Importantly, the law also discriminated against other milk from Wisconsin, so its tightly exclusionary effect placed an especially substantial burden on interstate commerce, and the limited numbers of actors that were benefited by it did not justify that burden.

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Labor Board v. Gullett Gin Co., 340 U.S.  361 (1951)</h3><p><b>National Labor Relations Board v. Gullett Gin Co.</p></b><p><b>No. 122</p></b><p><b>Argued November 29, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided January 15, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 361</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>Under &#167; 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, the Board did not exceed its power or abuse its discretion in refusing to deduct sums paid to employees as unemployment compensation by a state agency when the Board found that they were discharged in violation of the Act and ordered their reinstatement with back pay.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/361/case.html#362"">340 U. S. 362</a></span>-366.</p>
<p>(a) Since no consideration is given to collateral losses in ordering reimbursement of wrongfully discharged employees for their lost earnings, no consideration need be given to collateral benefits which they may have received.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/361/case.html#364"">340 U. S. 364</a></span>.</p>
<p>(b) Unemployment compensation payments made by a state out of funds derived from taxation are collateral benefits, since they were not made to discharge any liability or obligation of the employer, but to carry out a policy of social betterment for the benefit of the entire state.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/361/case.html#364"">340 U. S. 364</a></span>-365.</p>
<p>(c) A different result is not required by the fact that, under the state law, the unemployment compensation payments incidentally affect adversely the employer's experience rating record, and prevent him from qualifying for a lower tax rate.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/361/case.html#365"">340 U. S. 365</a></span>.</p>
<p>(d) The conclusion here reached is supported by the fact that the Board had for many years been following the practice of disallowing deductions for collateral benefits such as unemployment compensation, and Congress did not require any change in that practice when it amended the National Labor Relations Act in 1947.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/361/case.html#365"">340 U. S. 365</a></span>-366.</p>
<p>179 F.2d 499, reversed.</p>
<p>The case is stated in the opinion.  The judgment below is <em>reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/361/case.html#366"">340 U. S. 366</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""362"">Page 340 U. S. 362</a></p><p></p>

Federal Trade Commission</p></b><p><b>No. 1</p></b><p><b>Argued January 9-10, 1950</p></b><p><b>Reargued October 9, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided January 8, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 231</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. Under &#167; 2(b) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 13(b), petitioner was justified in selling gasoline in interstate commerce to four comparatively large ""jobber"" customers in Detroit at l/2 cents per gallon less than it sold like gasoline to many comparatively small service station customers in the same area, if the lower price to the ""jobbers"" was made to retain each of them as a customer and in good faith to meet a lawful and equally low price of a competitor -- even though the effect of such price discrimination was to injure, destroy or prevent competition.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/231/case.html#233"">340 U. S. 233</a></span>-251.</p>
<p>(a) The amendments made by the Robinson-Patman Act restricted the scope of the defense now provided by &#167; 2(b) to a price reduction made to meet in good faith a lawful and equally low price of a competitor; but they did not deprive this defense of its character as an absolute defense, nor condition it upon the absence of any resulting injury to competition.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/231/case.html#240"">340 U. S. 240</a></span>-251.</p>
<p>(b) This conclusion is consistent with <em>Corn Products Refining Co. v. Federal Trade Commission,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/324/726/case.html"">324 U. S. 726</a></span>, and <em>Federal Trade Commission v. Staley Mfg. Co.,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/324/746/case.html"">324 U. S. 746</a></span>.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/231/case.html#243"">340 U. S. 243</a></span>-246.</p>
<p>(c) There has been a widespread understanding that, under the Robinson-Patman Act, it is a complete defense to a charge of price discrimination for the seller to show that its price differential has been made in good faith to meet a lawful and equally low price of a competitor, and this Court sees no reason to depart now from that interpretation.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/231/case.html#246"">340 U. S. 246</a></span>-250.</p>
<p>(d) Congress did not seek by the Robinson-Patman Act either to abolish competition or so radically to curtail it that a seller would have no substantial right of self-defense against a price raid by a competitor.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/231/case.html#249"">340 U. S. 249</a></span>.</p>
<p>(e) In a case where a seller sustains the burden of proof placed upon it to establish its defense under &#167; 2(b), this Court finds no reason to destroy that defense indirectly merely because it also appears that the beneficiaries of the seller's price reductions may </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""232"">Page 340 U. S. 232</a></p><p> derive a competitive advantage from them or may, in the natural course of events, reduce their own resale prices to their customers.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/231/case.html#250"">340 U. S. 250</a></span>.</p>
<p>(f) This Court rejects a construction of the proviso of &#167; 2(b) which would make the defense afforded thereby dependent upon the conclusion which the Commission might reach in weighing the potentially injurious effect of a seller's price reduction upon competition at all lower levels against its beneficial effect in permitting the seller to meet competition at its own level.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/231/case.html#251"">340 U. S. 251</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. Petitioner obtains gasoline from fields in Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming, refines it in Indiana, and distributes it in 14 middle western states.  Gasoline sold by it in the Detroit area is carried by tankers on the Great Lakes from Indiana to petitioner's marine terminal at River Rouge, Mich.  Enough is accumulated there during each navigation season so that a winter's supply is available from the terminal.  It remains there or in nearby bulk storage stations for varying periods.  While there, the gasoline is owned by petitioner, and en route from its refinery in Indiana to its market in Michigan.  Although the gasoline is not brought to River Rouge pursuant to orders already taken, the demands of the Michigan territory are fairly constant, and the demands of petitioner's customers can be estimated accurately.  Gasoline sold to customers in Detroit is taken from that at the terminal.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  such sales are in interstate commerce within the meaning of &#167;&#167; 1 and 2 of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12, 13, and are not deprived of their interstate character by such temporary storage of the gasoline in the Detroit area.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/231/case.html#236"">340 U. S. 236</a></span>-238.</p>
<p>3. The Federal Trade Commission instituted proceedings to challenge the right of petitioner, under &#167; 2 of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 13, to sell gasoline in interstate commerce to four comparatively large ""jobber"" customers in Detroit at 1 1/2 cents per gallon less than it sold like gasoline to many comparatively small service station customers in the same area.  Petitioner presented evidence tending to prove that its lower price to each ""jobber"" was made in order to retain that ""jobber"" as a customer and in good faith to meet an equally low price of one or more competitors.  The Commission held as a matter of law that such evidence was not material, and it made no finding of fact on this question.  It found that the effect of such price discriminations was to injure, destroy, and prevent competition, and it ordered petitioner to cease and desist from making such a price differential.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the Commission should have made a </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""233"">Page 340 U. S. 233</a></p><p> finding as tp whether or not petitioner's price reduction was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor within the meaning of &#167; 2(b) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 13(b).  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/231/case.html#233"">340 U. S. 233</a></span>-251.</p>
<p>173 F.2d 210 reversed.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission ordered petitioner to cease and desist from selling gasoline to four comparatively large ""jobber"" customers in Detroit at a lower price than it sold like gasoline to many comparatively smaller service station customers in the same area.  43 F.T.C. 56.  The Court of Appeals ordered enforcement of the order with a slight modification.  173 F.2d 210.  This Court granted certiorari.  338 U.S. 865.  <em>Reversed and remanded,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/231/case.html#251"">340 U. S. 251</a></span>.</p>

<p>In a habeas corpus proceeding brought by respondent in a Federal District Court in 1948, the court found that, in 1931 respondent was convicted of murder in an Indiana state court, sentenced to life imprisonment, and immediately confined in a state prison; that his timely appeal was prevented by the warden's suppression of his appeal papers pursuant to prison rules; that he sought unsuccessfully to have the state courts review his conviction by <em>coram nobis</em> in 1937 and by habeas corpus in 1947, and that, in 1946, his petition to the State Supreme Court for a delayed appeal was denied.  The District Court ordered respondent's discharge, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em></p>
<p>1. The prevention of respondent's original timely appeal by the warden's suppression of his appeal papers was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/206/case.html#207"">340 U. S. 207</a></span>-208.</p>
<p>2. Even if <em>res judicata</em> were applicable in habeas corpus proceedings, the 1946 litigation in the State Supreme Court was not <em>res judicata</em> of the issues in the present case.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/206/case.html#208"">340 U. S. 208</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. Respondent did not ""waive"" his right of appeal.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/206/case.html#208"">340 U. S. 208</a></span>-209.</p>
<p>4. In the circumstances of this case, nothing short of an actual appellate determination of the merits of the conviction will cure the original denial of equal protection of the law.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/206/case.html#209"">340 U. S. 209</a></span>.</p>
<p>5. The judgments of the Court of Appeals and the District Court are vacated, and the cause is remanded with directions to the District Court to enter such orders as are appropriate to allow the State a reasonable time in which to afford respondent the full appellate review he would have received but for the suppression of his appeal papers, in default whereof by the State, respondent shall be discharged.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/206/case.html#209"">340 U. S. 209</a></span>-210.</p>
<p>180 F.2d 212, judgment vacated. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""207"">Page 340 U. S. 207</a></p><p></p>
<p>In a habeas corpus proceeding seeking respondent's release from imprisonment under sentence of a state court, the District Court ordered respondent discharged.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  180 F.2d 212.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 849.  <em>Judgments vacated and cause remanded,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/206/case.html#210"">340 U. S. 210</a></span>.</p>

							<span class=""headertext""><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3>Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S.  211 (1951)</h3><p><b>Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc.</p></b><p><b>No. 297</p></b><p><b>Argued December 8, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided January 2, 1951</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 211</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>1. An agreement among competitors in interstate commerce to fix maximum resale prices of their products violates the Sherman Act.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/211/case.html#213"">340 U. S. 213</a></span>.</p>
<p>2. Under the Sherman Act, a combination formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce is illegal <em>per se.</em>  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/211/case.html#213"">340 U. S. 213</a></span>.</p>
<p>3. The evidence in this case was sufficient to support a finding by the jury that respondents had conspired to fix maximum resale prices.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/211/case.html#213"">340 U. S. 213</a></span>-214.</p>
<p>4. In an action under the Sherman Act for treble damages, brought by a complainant injured by a conspiracy of sellers of liquor in interstate commerce to fix maximum resale prices, it is no defense that the complainant had conspired with others to fix minimum prices for liquor in violation of the antitrust laws.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/211/case.html#214"">340 U. S. 214</a></span>.</p>
<p>5. The fact that corporations are under common ownership and control does not relieve them from liability under the antitrust laws, especially where they hold themselves out as competitors.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/211/case.html#215"">340 U. S. 215</a></span>.</p>
<p>6. Since the District Court's instructions to the jury submitted to them only the cause of action under the Sherman Act, it did not err in refusing a more formal withdrawal of an issue concerning a violation of the Clayton Act, which had been charged in the complaint but which was not proved.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/211/case.html#215"">340 U. S. 215</a></span>.</p>
<p>182 F.2d 228, reversed.</p>
<p>In an action under the Sherman Act for treble damages, the jury returned a verdict for petitioner, and damages were awarded.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  182 F.2d 228.  This Court granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 863.  <em>Reversed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/211/case.html#215"">340 U. S. 215</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""212"">Page 340 U. S. 212</a></p><p></p>

United States</p></b><p><b>No. 45</p></b><p><b>Argued November 8-9, 1950</p></b><p><b>Decided January 2, 1951<L=|340 U.S. 216ast|>*</p></b><p><b>340 U.S. 216</p></b><p><b></p></b><p><em><em>Syllabus</em></em></p>
<p>An order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, issued pursuant to &#167; 307(d) of the Transportation Act of 1940, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 907(d), required certain common carriers by railroad and certain interstate barge lines to establish joint through routes for the transportation of property, and to establish and apply to such through routes joint rates based on prescribed differentials from higher all-rail rates.  The differentials were absorbed by the barge lines, but the Commission made no finding that barge-rail costs were lower than all-rail costs.</p>
<p><em>Held:</em>  the order of the Commission is sustained.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/216/case.html#218"">340 U. S. 218</a></span>-229.</p>
<p>1. A finding of lesser cost of barge service is not indispensable to the validity of the Commission's order.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/216/case.html#223"">340 U. S. 223</a></span>-225.</p>
<p>(a) The barge-rail rates based on the prescribed differentials were considered by the Commission to be compensatory with respect to the barge lines.  P.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'>340 U. S. 224</span>.</p>
<p>(b) The judgment of the Commission that competition between barge and rail service was worth preserving was legitimately rested on relevant factors other than lesser cost of service.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'>340 U. S. 224</span>-225.</p>
<p>2. The Commission's determination that its order is in accordance with general expressions of congressional policy is not the sole basis of the order, since the Commission gave careful consideration to other relevant factors.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/216/case.html#225"">340 U. S. 225</a></span>-226.</p>
<p>3. The prescription of differentials in this proceeding does not deprive the appellant railroads of their inherent advantages contrary to the National Transportation Policy.  <em>ICC v. Mechling,</em> <span class='l-leftover'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/330/567/case.html"">330 U. S. 567</a></span>, distinguished.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/216/case.html#226"">340 U. S. 226</a></span>-227. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""217"">Page 340 U. S. 217</a></p><p></p>
<p>4. The basic findings essential to the statutory validity of the order are sufficiently disclosed in the written report of the Commission in this case.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/216/case.html#227"">340 U. S. 227</a></span>-228.</p>
<p>5. The order of the Commission is not invalid as giving a preference to the port of New Orleans over certain ports of Georgia and Texas, in violation of Art. I, &#167; 9, cl. 6 of the Federal Constitution, since that clause does not forbid discriminations as between ports, and since whatever preference there is results from geography, and not from any action of the Commission.  Pp.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'>340 U. S. 228</span>-229.</p>
<p>88 F.Supp. 982, affirmed.</p>
<p>In a suit to enjoin the enforcement of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the District Court of three judges denied the injunction and dismissed the complaint.  88 F.Supp. 982.  On direct appeals to this Court, <em>affirmed,</em> p.  <span class='l-normaldigitafter'><a href=""/cases/federal/us/340/216/case.html#229"">340 U. S. 229</a></span>. </p><p><a class=""page-number"" name=""218"">Page 340 U. S. 218</a></p><p></p>
