|364 u.s. 507|"Reina v. United States
No. 29
Argued November 7-8, 1960
Decided December 19, 1960
364 U.S. 507

Syllabus 
While serving a sentence for a federal narcotics offense, petitioner was summoned before a federal grand jury and asked questions concerning his crime, particularly as to the persons involved with him and their activities in smuggling narcotics into this country from Europe.  He invoked his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer.  Acting pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  1406, which grants immunity from prosecution to a witness compelled to testify before a grand jury, the United States Attorney, with the approval of the Attorney General, obtained a court order directing petitioner to testify.  He again refused to do so, and was adjudged guilty of criminal contempt.
Held:  the conviction is sustained.  Pp.  364 U. S. 508-515.
1. The immunity provided by  1406 covers state, as well as federal, prosecutions.  P.  364 U. S. 510.
2. As so construed,  1406 is constitutional, since the grant of immunity from state prosecution is necessary and proper to the more effective execution of the undoubted power of Congress to enact the narcotics laws.  Pp.  364 U. S. 510-512.
3. The grant of immunity from future state and federal prosecution was at least coextensive with petitioner's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, and it was not necessary that he be pardoned or granted amnesty covering the unserved portion of his sentence and his fine for the offense of which he had previously been convicted.  Pp.  364 U. S. 512-514.
4. Since the District Court provided that petitioner's sentence to two years' imprisonment for criminal contempt should be vacated if petitioner should purge himself of his contempt by appearing before the grand jury and answering the questions within 60 days from the date of the judgment, and this Court construes the 60-day period as running from the effective date of this Court's 
Page 364 U. S. 508
 mandate, it is not necessary to pass on the questions whether the sentence was excessive or whether the conviction was invalid because the District Court did not advise petitioner of the extent of the immunity conferred by  1406.  Pp.  364 U. S. 514-515.
273 F.2d 234, affirmed.

|364 u.s. 479|"Shelton v. Tucker
No. 14
Argued November 7, 1960
Decided December 12, 1960*
364 U.S. 479

Syllabus 
An Arkansas statute requires every teacher, as a condition of employment in a state supported school or college, to file annually an affidavit listing without limitation every organization to which he has belonged or regularly contributed within the preceding five years.  Teachers in state supported schools and colleges are not covered by a civil service system, they are hired on a year-to-year basis, and they have no job security beyond the end of each school year.  The contracts of the teachers here involved were not renewed, because they refused to file the required affidavits.
Held:  The statute is invalid, because it deprives teachers of their right of associational freedom protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action.  Pp.  364 U. S. 480-490.
(a) There can be no doubt of the right of a State to investigate the competence and fitness of those whom it hires to teach in its schools.  P.  364 U. S. 485.
(b) To compel a teacher to disclose his every associational tie is to impair his right of free association, a right closely allied to freedom of speech and a right which, like free speech, lies at the foundation of a free society.  Pp.  364 U. S. 485-487.
(c) The unlimited and indiscriminate sweep of the statute here involved and its comprehensive interference with associational freedom go far beyond what might be justified in the exercise of the State's legitimate inquiry into the fitness and competence of its teachers.  Pp.  364 U. S. 487-490.

Decided December 12, 1960*
364 U.S. 500

Syllabus 
A three-judge Federal District Court declared unconstitutional, and temporarily enjoined enforcement of, a series of enactments of the Louisiana Legislature designed to prevent partial desegregation of the races in certain public schools in New Orleans pursuant to an earlier federal court order.  It was contended, inter alia, that the State of Louisiana had ""interposed itself in the field of public education over which it has exclusive control,"" and motions were made for a stay of the injunction pending direct appeal to this Court.
Held:  this contention and others made in the motions are without substance, and the motions for stay are denied.

Argued November 9-10, 1960
Decided December 5, 1960
364 U.S. 446

Syllabus 
When the Small Business Administration, created by the Small Business Act of 1953, with authority, inter alia, to lend government funds to small businesses, has joined a private bank in making a loan and the borrower becomes a bankrupt, the Administration's interest in the unpaid balance of the loan is entitled to the priority provided for ""debts due to the United States"" under R.S.  3466 and  64 of the Bankruptcy Act -- even though the Administration has agreed to share with the bank any money collected on the loan.  Pp.  364 U. S. 447-453.
(a) The Small Business Administration is an integral part of the governmental mechanism -- not a separate legal entity -- and it is entitled to the priority of the United States in collecting loans made by it out of government funds.  Sloan Shipyards Corp. v. United States Fleet Corp., 258 U. S. 549, and Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Menihan Corp., 312 U. S. 81, distinguished.  United States v. Remund, 330 U. S. 539, followed.  Pp.  364 U. S. 448-450.
(b) Since the Administration participated in making the loan and acquired a beneficial interest in it prior to the petition in bankruptcy, it is immaterial that formal assignment to the Administration of the note evidencing the debt was not made by the bank until after the filing of the petition.  P.  364 U. S. 450.
(c) The Administration did not forfeit its right to priority by agreeing to turn over to the bank part of any distribution obtained because of its priority.  Pp.  364 U. S. 451-453.
(d) Governmental priority in bankruptcy proceedings is not inconsistent with the basic purposes and provisions of the Small Business Act.  P. 453.

No. 7
Argued October 12, 1960
Decided December 5, 1960
364 U.S. 454

Syllabus 
For refusing to leave the section reserved for white people in a restaurant in a bus terminal, petitioner, a Negro interstate bus passenger, was convicted in Virginia courts of violating a state statute making it a misdemeanor for any person ""without authority of law"" to remain upon the premises of another after having been forbidden to do so.  On appeal, he contended that his conviction violated the Interstate Commerce Act and the Equal Protection, Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Federal Constitution; but his conviction was sustained by the State Supreme Court.  On petition for certiorari to this Court, he raised only the constitutional questions.
Held:
1. Notwithstanding the fact that the petition for certiorari presented only the constitutional questions this Court will consider the statutory issue, which involves essentially the same problem -- racial discrimination in interstate commerce.  P.  364 U. S. 457.
2. Under  216(d) of the Interstate Commerce Act, which forbids any interstate common carrier by motor vehicle to subject any person to unjust discrimination, petitioner had a federal right to remain in the white portion of the restaurant, he was there ""under authority of law,"" and it was error to affirm his conviction.  Pp.  364 U. S. 457-463.
(a) When a bus carrier has volunteered to make terminal and restaurant facilities and services available to its interstate passengers as a regular part of their transportation, and the terminal and restaurant have acquiesced and cooperated in this undertaking, the terminal and restaurant must perform these services without discriminations prohibited by the Act.  Pp.  364 U. S. 457-461.
(b) Although the courts below made no findings of fact, the evidence in this case shows such a situation here.  Pp.  364 U. S. 461-463.

Appellant was convicted in a state court of murdering his wife.  The evidence against him was entirely circumstantial.  Proof of the corpus delicti, as well as proof of appellant's criminal agency, was to be inferred only from his wife's inexplicable disappearance coupled with appellant's unnatural behavior thereafter.  He did not take the stand in his own defense, and the trial judge instructed the jury that his failure to do so could be made the basis of inferences unfavorable to him.

He did not take the stand in his own defense, and the trial judge instructed the jury that his failure to do so could be made the basis of inferences unfavorable to him.  On appeal to this Court, appellant contended that his conviction violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:  Appeal dismissed and certiorari denied.

No. 13
Argued October 12, 1960
Decided November 21, 1960
364 U.S. 410

Syllabus 
The proceeds of two life insurance policies were made payable in monthly payments to the insured's wife for her lifetime, but, if she should die before the expiration of 20 years, his daughter was to receive the payments until the 20 years had elapsed.  When he died, he was survived by his wife and daughter, and each insurance company determined and set up on its books a sum representing the amount necessary to fund the 240 monthly payments for the 20 years and a separate sum representing the amount necessary to fund the monthly payments to the wife so long as she might live beyond the 240 months.
Held:  the decedent's estate was not entitled to a marital deduction under  812(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, even with respect to that portion of the proceeds necessary to fund the monthly payments to the wife so long as she might live beyond the 240 months, since the proceeds of each policy constituted a single ""property"" and the interest passing to the wife might ""terminate or fail"" and another person might ""possess or enjoy [a] part of such property after such termination or failure.""

No. 32
Argued October 18-19, 1960
Decided November 14, 1960
364 U.S. 339

Syllabus 
Negro citizens sued in a Federal District Court in Alabama for a declaratory judgment that an Act of the State Legislature changing the boundaries of the City of Tuskegee is unconstitutional and for an injunction against its enforcement.  They alleged that the Act alters the shape of Tuskegee from a square to an irregular 28-sided figure; that it would eliminate from the City all but four or five of its 400 Negro voters without eliminating any white voter; and that its effect was to deprive Negroes of their right to vote in Tuskegee elections on account of their race.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it had no authority to declare the Act invalid or to change any boundaries of municipal corporations fixed by the State Legislature.
Held:  It erred in doing so, since the allegations, if proven, would establish that the inevitable effect of the Act would be to deprive Negroes of their right to vote on account of their race, contrary to the Fifteenth Amendment.  Pp.  364 U. S. 340-348.
(a) Even the broad power of a State to fix the boundaries of its municipalities is limited by the Fifteenth Amendment, which forbids a State to deprive any citizen of the right to vote because of his race.  Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161, and related cases distinguished.  Pp.  364 U. S. 342-345.
(b) A state statute which is alleged to have the inevitable effect of depriving Negroes of their right to vote in Tuskegee because of their race is not immune to attack simply because the mechanism employed by the Legislature is a ""political"" redefinition of municipal boundaries.  Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, distinguished.  Pp.   364 U. S. 346-348.
270 F. 2d 594, reversed.

364 U.S. 350

Syllabus 
Under  340(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended, the United States sued to revoke the order admitting petitioner to citizenship, on the ground that it had been procured ""by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.""  The complaint alleged, and the District Court found, that petitioner had concealed membership in the Communist Party, a lack of intent to renounce foreign allegiance, and a record of arrests, and it revoked his citizenship.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, reaching only the question of concealment of the arrests, which occurred more than five years before petitioner's naturalization and were for distributing handbills, making a speech in a public park, and a breach of the peace.
Held:  on the record in this case concerning the arrests, the Government failed to show by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence either (1) that facts were suppressed which, if known, would have warranted denial of citizenship, or (2) that their disclosure might have been useful in an investigation possibly leading to the discovery of other facts warranting denial of citizenship.

Syllabus 
In 1953, a 60-year-old taxpayer purchased single-premium 30-year maturity deferred annuity savings bonds with an aggregate face value of $4,000,000 from a life insurance company, paying only a nominal sum in cash, giving nonrecourse notes secured by the bonds for the balance, and paying a substantial amount as ""interest"" in advance on that ""indebtedness.""  A few days later, he borrowed from the company nearly all of the excess of the cash surrender value which the bonds would have at the end of the first contract year over the amount of the existing ""indebtedness,"" and again paid in advance the ""interest"" on such additional ""indebtedness.""  These borrowings and ""interest"" payments were repeated in 1954 and 1955, and the bonds were surrendered and the indebtedness was cancelled in 1956.
Held:  the amounts paid as ""interest"" in 1953 and 1954 were not deductible from the gross income of the taxpayer and his wife in their joint income tax returns for those years as ""interest paid . . . on indebtedness,"" within the meaning of  23(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and 163(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.  Pp.  364 U. S. 362-370.
(a) On the record in this case, it is patent that the transaction between the taxpayer and the insurance company was a sham which created no ""indebtedness"" within the meaning of those sections of the Codes.  Pp.  364 U. S. 362-366.
(b) Congress did not authorize deduction of such payments by enacting  264(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which expressly denies a deduction for amounts paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry a single premium annuity contract, but only as to contracts purchased after March 1, 1954.

No. 33
Argued October 13, 1960
Decided November 14, 1960
364 U.S. 372

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted under 2 U.S.C.  192 for willful failure to comply with a subpoena of the House of Representatives commanding him to produce before one of its Subcommittees certain records of the Civil Rights Congress.  The evidence showed:  before issuance of the subpoena, the Subcommittee had reason to believe that the Civil Rights Congress was a subversive organization, and that petitioner was its Executive Secretary.  At the hearing, the Chairman of the Subcommittee explained that Detroit is a vital defense area and that the purpose of the hearing was to investigate Communist activities there.  When asked whether he would produce the documents called for by the subpoena, petitioner stated flatly that he would not.  Neither at the hearing nor at his trial did petitioner deny the existence of the records or his ability to produce them.  He based his refusal upon a claim of his privilege under the Fifth Amendment.
Held:  the conviction is sustained.  Pp.  364 U. S. 373-383.
(a) The Government's proof at the trial established a prima facie case of willful refusal to comply with the subpoena, and, inasmuch as petitioner neither advised the Subcommittee that he was unable to produce the records nor attempted to introduce at his trial any evidence of his inability to produce them, the trial court was justified in concluding and in charging the jury that the records called for by the subpoena were in existence and under petitioner's control at the time the subpoena was served upon him.  Pp.  364 U. S. 373-380.
(b) The Fifth Amendment did not excuse petitioner from producing the records, since records held in a representative, rather than in a personal, capacity cannot be the subject of the personal privilege against self-incrimination.  P.  364 U. S. 380.
(c) The evidence was sufficient to show that the records called for by the subpoena were pertinent to the inquiry.  Pp.  364 U. S. 380-382.
(d) The subpoena was not so broad as to constitute an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  364 U. S. 382-383.

For refusing to comply with a state court order to produce the names of persons attending his summer camp during 1954 and 1955 for use in an investigation by the Attorney General of New Hampshire on behalf of the State Legislature to determine whether ""subversive persons"" were then in the State, petitioner was adjudged guilty of civil contempt and ordered committed to jail until he complied.

364 U.S. 310

Syllabus 
The Government sued respondents to recover civil damages under  26(b)(1) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 for obtaining surplus government property by fraud.  Later it moved to file an amended complaint seeking instead to recover damages under  26(b)(2).  That motion was withdrawn, and the Government filed a second amended complaint again seeking damages under  26(b)(1).  After trial, the District Court awarded the Government damages under  26(b)(1).  Both sides appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  While the appeal was pending, the Government accepted from respondents promissory notes totalling the amount of the judgment, and it released only its judgment liens in two counties.
Held:
1. By accepting payment of an amount equal to the judgment appealed from as inadequate and releasing only its judgment liens in two counties in the circumstances of this case, the Government did not lose its right to press its claim for the full amount of the damages it believed to be due.  Pp.  364 U. S. 312-313.
2. Recoveries under  26(b) are not penalties, and the claims asserted by the Government were not barred by the statute of limitations.  P.  364 U. S. 313.
3. In the circumstances of this case, in which the issue was preserved in a pretrial order pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Government did not waive its contention that it was entitled to change its election of remedies and to recover under  26(b)(2), instead of  26(b)(1).  Pp.  364 U. S. 313-316.
4. The Government's original complaint seeking damages under  26(b)(1) did not constitute an irrevocable election of remedies, and, in the circumstances of this case, the Government had a right to amend its pleadings so as to seek damages under  26(b)(2).  Pp.  364 U. S. 316-317.
5. Section 26(b) did not empower the District Court to determine according to the evidence which of the three subsections would

Pp.  364 U. S. 313-316.
4. The Government's original complaint seeking damages under  26(b)(1) did not constitute an irrevocable election of remedies, and, in the circumstances of this case, the Government had a right to amend its pleadings so as to seek damages under  26(b)(2).  Pp.  364 U. S. 316-317.
5. Section 26(b) did not empower the District Court to determine according to the evidence which of the three subsections would

Decided June 27, 1960
364 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
1. In this proceeding under  209(b) of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Commission exceeded its statutory authority by granting to a motor carrier subsidiary of a railroad permits to act as a contract carrier for a single shipper from points on the railroad's line in California to points on its line in certain other States, since the Commission neither (1) imposed conditions upon the permits sufficient to assure that the service to be rendered would be truly auxiliary to, and supplemental of, the rail service, nor (2) made findings sufficient to establish the existence of ""special circumstances"" justifying the waiver of such restrictions.  Pp.  364 U. S. 3-15.
(a) The general policy under  5(2)(b) and the National Transportation Policy of restricting the services of motor carrier subsidiaries of railroads to those which are auxiliary to, or supplemental of, the parent railroad's services is applicable to permits under  209(b).  Pp.  364 U. S. 6-7.
(b) If a trucking service can fairly be characterized as auxiliary to, or supplemental of, train service, there is compliance with the mandate of  5(2)(b) that the railroad should be able to ""use service by motor vehicle to public advantage in its operations""; but, if the motor transportation is essentially unrelated to the rail service, the parent railroad is invading the field of trucking, and, 
Page 364 U. S. 2
 under normal circumstances, the National Transportation Policy is thereby offended.  Pp.  364 U. S. 7-9.
(c) When there are ""special circumstances"" sufficient to justify such action in the public interest, however, the Commission may sometimes refrain from imposing the condition that the trucking service be auxiliary to, or supplemental of, the rail service.  American Trucking Associations v. United States, 355 U. S. 141.  Pp.  364 U. S. 10-11.
(d) The conditions imposed upon the permits in this case were not sufficient to restrict the motor carrier to operations truly auxiliary to, or supplemental of, the rail service.  Pp.  364 U. S. 11-13.
(e) The Commission's findings in this case were not sufficient to establish the existence of ""special circumstances"" justifying the waiver of such restrictions.  Pp.  364 U. S. 13-15.
2. Insofar as it pertains to the permits to serve points on the railroad's lines, the judgment of the District Court denying relief is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Commission for such further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion, as may be appropriate.  Pp.  364 U. S. 15-17.
3. The reversal and remand, however, do not apply to the Commission's grant of authority to provide contract carrier service to three nonrail points in Nevada.  P.  364 U. S. 17.
4. Appellants, six motor carriers and three associations of motor carriers, had standing to maintain their action to set aside the Commission's order, under the ""party in interest"" criterion of  205(g) of the Interstate Commerce Act and under the ""person suffering legal wrong . . . or adversely affected or aggrieved"" criterion of 10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act.

No. 229
Argued April 20, 1960
Decided June 27, 1960
364 U.S. 19

Syllabus 
While a barge was being loaded at Memphis, it sank, with resulting damage to both the barge and the cargo.  The barge owner sued the cargo owner in a Tennessee State Court for damages alleged to have resulted from negligence in loading it, and that case was removed to the Federal District Court at Memphis.  The cargo owner then brought this action in the Federal District Court at New Orleans against the barge and its owner, claiming damages to the cargo resulting from unseaworthiness.  The barge owner then moved under 28 U.S.C.  1404(a) for transfer of this case to the Federal District Court at Memphis, alleging that such transfer was ""necessary for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice.""  Finding these allegations to be true, the District Court at New Orleans transferred the case to the District Court at Memphis.
Held:  it did not err in doing so.  Pp.  364 U. S. 20-27.
(a) Insofar as this is a ""civil action"" against the barge owner, it clearly was transferable to the District Court at Memphis, since the plaintiff could have brought this action in that court.  Hoffman v. Blaski, 363 U. S. 335, distinguished.  P.  364 U. S. 22.
(b) Transfer of this action to the District Court at Memphis is not barred by the fact that fictionally it is also an in rem proceeding against the barge itself, which was not within the jurisdiction of the District Court at Memphis when this action was brought.  Pp.  364 U. S. 22-27.

(a) Insofar as this is a ""civil action"" against the barge owner, it clearly was transferable to the District Court at Memphis, since the plaintiff could have brought this action in that court.  Hoffman v. Blaski, 363 U. S. 335, distinguished.  P.  364 U. S. 22.
(b) Transfer of this action to the District Court at Memphis is not barred by the fact that fictionally it is also an in rem proceeding against the barge itself, which was not within the jurisdiction of the District Court at Memphis when this action was brought.  Pp.  364 U. S. 22-27.

No. 270
Argued March 28, 1960
Decided June 27, 1960
364 U.S. 40

Syllabus 
Upon default by a shipbuilder on its contract to construct certain boats for the United States, the Government, exercising an option under the contract, required the shipbuilder to transfer to the Government title to the uncompleted boats and the materials on hand for their construction.  This made it impossible for petitioners to enforce their materialmen's liens which had attached under state law to the boats and materials when the materials were furnished to the shipbuilder.  Petitioners sued in the Court of Claims for compensation for the taking of their liens by the Government.
Held:  Petitioners are entitled to recover whatever value their liens had when the Government took title to the boats and materials.  Pp.  364 U. S. 41-49.
(a) Under the terms of the contract here involved, title to the property was in the shipbuilder when the materials were furnished, and the mere fact that it was contemplated that title eventually would vest in the Government did not prevent the materialmen's liens from attaching.  Pp.  364 U. S. 42-44.
(b) On the record in this case, petitioners had compensable property interests within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment in their liens on the boats and materials prior to transfer of title to the Government.  Pp.  364 U. S. 44-46.
(c) Since the Government's action destroyed the value of petitioners' liens, there was, under the circumstances of this case, a ""taking"" of these liens by the Government, for which compensation is due under the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  364 U. S. 46-49.

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Code of 1939 permitted taxpayers to deduct as a depletion allowance a percentage of ""gross income from mining,"" and defined ""mining"" as including the
""ordinary treatment processes normally applied by mine owners . . . to obtain the commercially marketable mineral product or products.""
Respondent mines fire clay and shale for which there is a market, but which it utilizes to manufacture sewer pipe and other vitrified articles.  It claims that it could not profitably market its raw fire clay and shale without processing them into finished products.
Held:  Respondent's depletion allowance must be based, not upon the value of the sewer pipe and other vitrified products which it manufactures, but upon the value of its raw fire clay and shale after application of ordinary treatment processes normally applied in the recovery of those materials by miners not engaged in the manufacture of finished products.  Pp.  364 U. S. 77-90.
(a) Congress intended to grant miners a depletion allowance based on the constructive income from the raw mineral product, if marketable in that form, and not on the value of finished articles.  Pp.  364 U. S. 81-86.
(b) A depletion allowance is an allowance for the exhaustion of capital assets -- not a subsidy to manufacturers or to high-cost mine operators.  P.  364 U. S. 86.
(c) That respondent is both a miner and a manufacturer does not entitle it to treatment different from that accorded miners of the same raw materials who are not manufacturers.  Pp.  364 U. S. 86-88.
(d) That respondent's underground method of mining prevents it from selling its raw fire clay and shale does not entitle it to treatment different from that accorded to the other miners of the same raw materials.  Pp.  364 U. S. 88-89.

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Code of 1939,  23(1), permitted the deduction for income tax purposes of a ""reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear . . . of property used in the trade or business.""  The applicable Treasury Regulations 111,  29.23 (1)-1, defined such allowance to be

Held:  as applied to automobiles leased by the owner-taxpayers to others or (in the case of dealers) used by them or their employees in their business, and later sold as second-hand cars (not junk), the depreciation allowance is to be calculated on a base of the cost of the cars to the taxpayers less their resale value at the estimated time of sale, spread over the estimated time they actually will be employed by the taxpayers in their business.

The Internal Revenue Code of 1954,  167(b)(2), provides an accelerated method of depreciation, known as the ""declining balance method"" of computing depreciation deductions for income tax purposes; but  167(c) limits the use of this method to property ""with a useful life of 3 years or more.""

Held.

364 U.S. 137

Syllabus 
An independent producer of natural gas contracted to sell to an interstate pipeline company from specified reserves a specified amount of gas each year at specified prices for a term of 20 years, and it applied to the Federal Power Commission under the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of convenience and necessity authorizing it to make such sales for a term of 20 years only.  Instead, the Commission tendered a certificate without any time limitation.  The producer accepted it, reserving the right to object, on review, to the unlimited nature of the certificate.
Held:  the Commission did not exceed its authority in issuing a certificate unlimited as to time.  Pp.  364 U. S. 138-158.
(a) To hold that the Commission must place a time limitation upon such a certificate (1) would greatly impair its control under  7(b) over the abandonment by natural gas companies of their facilities and services subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and (2) would make unavailable the procedural safeguards under  4(d) and 4(e) which are applicable to rate changes.  Pp.  364 U. S. 141-147.
(b) A different conclusion is not required by the language of  7(e) authorizing the Commission to issue a certificate ""authorizing the whole or any part of the operation, sale, service, construction, extension, or acquisition covered by the application.""  Pp.  364 U. S. 147-151.
(c) The authority of the Commission to issue a certificate unlimited as to time should not be denied on the theory that it could accomplish the same result indirectly, either (1) by denying all application for limited certificates or (2) by prescribing conditions under  7(c) that the certificates be permanent.  Pp.  364 U. S. 151-152.
(d) The conclusion here reached is supported by the consistent administrative practice of the Commission in making a clear distinction between the underlying ""service"" to the public and the contractual means by which it is implemented.  Pp.  364 U. S. 152-154. 
Page 364 U. S. 138

(e) The conclusion here reached is not inconsistent with that reached in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332.  Pp. 364 U. S. 154-156.
(f) An initial application of an independent producer to sell natural gas in interstate commerce leads to a certificate of public convenience and necessity under which the Commission controls the basis on which the gas may be initially dedicated to interstate use, Atlantic Refining Co. v. Public Service Commission, 360 U. S. 378; and, once so dedicated, there can be no withdrawal of that supply from continued interstate movement without Commission approval.  P.  364 U. S. 156.

(a) To hold that the Commission must place a time limitation upon such a certificate (1) would greatly impair its control under  7(b) over the abandonment by natural gas companies of their facilities and services subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and (2) would make unavailable the procedural safeguards under  4(d) and 4(e) which are applicable to rate changes.  Pp.  364 U. S. 141-147.
(b) A different conclusion is not required by the language of  7(e) authorizing the Commission to issue a certificate ""authorizing the whole or any part of the operation, sale, service, construction, extension, or acquisition covered by the application.""  Pp.  364 U. S. 147-151.
(c) The authority of the Commission to issue a certificate unlimited as to time should not be denied on the theory that it could accomplish the same result indirectly, either (1) by denying all application for limited certificates or (2) by prescribing conditions under  7(c) that the certificates be permanent.  Pp.  364 U. S. 151-152.
(d) The conclusion here reached is supported by the consistent administrative practice of the Commission in making a clear distinction between the underlying ""service"" to the public and the contractual means by which it is implemented.  Pp.  364 U. S. 152-154. 
Page 364 U. S. 138

(e) The conclusion here reached is not inconsistent with that reached in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332.  Pp. 364 U. S. 154-156.
(f) An initial application of an independent producer to sell natural gas in interstate commerce leads to a certificate of public convenience and necessity under which the Commission controls the basis on which the gas may be initially dedicated to interstate use, Atlantic Refining Co. v. Public Service Commission, 360 U. S. 378; and, once so dedicated, there can be no withdrawal of that supply from continued interstate movement without Commission approval.  P.  364 U. S. 156.
(g) Other objections to the Commission's order either are not properly before this Court or are without merit.  Pp.  364 U. S. 156-158.

No. 321
Argued April 26, 1960
Decided June 27, 1960
364 U.S. 170

Syllabus 
In 1947, petitioner, an independent producer of natural gas, contracted to sell gas from a specified field to an interstate pipeline company at a specified price for a term of 10 years.  Subsequently petitioner applied for, and obtained from, the Federal Power Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing such sales, and its contract rate schedule was accepted as its rate schedule under the Natural Gas Act.  Upon expiration of its 10-year contract, petitioner contracted with the same pipeline company for the sale of gas from the same field for a new 20-year term, but at a higher rate.  Petitioner then applied for a new certificate covering the new contract and filed the new contract as an initial rate schedule under the new certificate pursuant to  5 of the Act.  The Commission rejected the certificate application as duplicative of petitioner's existing certificate to make sales from the field in question, and rejected the rate schedule filing on the ground that the purported initial rate schedule was actually a change in petitioner's existing rate schedule.  Petitioner then filed under protest, as rate changes pursuant to  4(d), the rates in its new contract, and the Commission ordered those rates suspended under  4(e).
Held:  the Commission's orders are sustained.  Pp.  364 U. S. 171-176.
(a) In acting upon petitioner's 1947 application, based on its 10-year contract, the Commission was authorized to issue a certificate unlimited as to time.  Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Co. v. Federal Power Commission, ante, p.  364 U. S. 137.  P.  364 U. S. 174.

364 U.S. 177

Syllabus 
Appellants and other Negroes obtained from a Federal District Court an injunction against the operation on a racially discriminatory basis of a golf course owned by a North Carolina City but leased and operated by a club.  Appellants had previously been charged with, and were subsequently tried in a state court for, violating a state criminal trespass statute by persisting in playing on the course after having been denied permission to do so and after having been ordered to leave.  The jury was clearly instructed that appellants could not be found guilty if they were excluded because of their race; but they were convicted.  At this trial, the unpublished findings and judgment of the Federal Court were offered in evidence, but were excluded.  Appellants omitted these facts from the record on appeal to the State Supreme Court, wherein they contended that, notwithstanding the jury's verdict, the Supremacy Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment required a holding that the findings and judgment of the Federal Court conclusively established that the criminal trespass statute was used to enforce a practice of racial discrimination by a state agency.  The State Supreme Court declined to rule on that contention on the ground that, under state law, the findings and judgment of the Federal Court were not before it,.and it affirmed the convictions.
Held:  an appeal to this Court is dismissed, and certiorari is denied for want of a substantial federal question, since the judgment of the State Supreme Court was independently and adequately supported on state procedural grounds.  Pp.  364 U. S. 178-196.
(a) Even if the judgment and findings of the Federal Court were offered in evidence and excluded by the trial judge, these facts did not appear in the record filed by appellants in the State Supreme Court and, therefore, were not properly cognizable by that Court under state practice.  Pp.  364 U. S. 185-187.
(b) In declining to go outside the record in order to ascertain the true facts, the State Supreme Court did not discriminate against appellants; it acted in accordance with a practice which it had followed consistently for many years in considering appeals in criminal cases.  Pp.  364 U. S. 187-192. 
Page 364 U. S. 178

(c) The Federal Court's findings and judgment in the civil case were not properly brought before the state courts by appellants' motion to quash at the outset of the trial, which allege the effect of the Federal Court's proceedings and requested leave to offer the record of that Court in evidence in support of the motion, since the settled state practice does not permit consideration of extraneous evidence in passing upon such a motion.  Pp.  364 U. S. 192-193.
(d) Under established state practice, the Federal Court's findings and judgment in the civil case were not properly brought before the state courts by appellants' motion at the end of the trial to set aside the verdict.  Pp.  364 U. S. 193-194.

2. Without probable cause for arrest and without a warrant for search or arrest, state police officers followed a taxicab in which petitioner was riding and approached it when it stopped at a traffic light.  The record is unclear as to the sequence of the events which followed, but the cab door was opened, petitioner dropped a recognizable package of narcotics to the floor of the vehicle, and one officer grabbed the petitioner as he alighted from the cab and another officer retrieved the package.  In a state prosecution for unlawful possession of narcotics, the evidence was suppressed on the ground that it had been unlawfully seized, and petitioner was acquitted.  Later, in a federal prosecution under 21 U.S.C.  174 for unlawful receipt and concealment of narcotics, the Federal District Court denied a timely motion to suppress and admitted the package of narcotics in evidence, and petitioner was convicted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  the case is remanded to the District Court for determination as to the lawfulness of the state officers' conduct, in accordance with the basic principles governing the validity of searches and seizures by federal officers under the Fourth Amendment, and for other proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Pp.  364 U. S. 255-262.

No. 549
Argued January 18-19, 1960
Decided June 20, 1960*
363 U.S. 420

Syllabus 
The Civil Rights Act of 1957 created in the Executive Branch of the Government a Commission on Civil Rights to investigate written, sworn allegations that persons have been discriminatorily deprived of their right to vote on account of their color, race, religion, or national origin, to study and collect information ""concerning legal developments constituting a denial of equal protection of the laws,"" and to report to the President and Congress.  The Commission is authorized to subpoena witnesses and documents and to conduct hearings.  The Act prescribes certain rules of procedure; but nothing in the Act requires the Commission to afford persons accused of discrimination the right to be apprised as to the specific charges against them or as to the identity of their accusers, or the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses appearing at Commission hearings; and the Commission prescribed supplementary rules of procedure which deny such rights in hearings conducted by it.
Held:
1. In the light of the legislative history of the Act, the Commission was authorized by Congress to adopt such rules of procedure.  Pp.  363 U. S. 430-439.
2. Since the Commission makes no adjudications, but acts solely as an investigative and factfinding agency, these rules of procedure do not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Morgan v. United States, 304 U. S. 1; Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U. S. 123; Greene v. McElroy, 360 U. S. 474, distinguished.  Pp.  363 U. S. 440-452.
3. Such rules of procedure do not violate the Sixth Amendment, since that Amendment is specifically limited to ""criminal prosecutions,"" and the proceedings of the Commission do not fall in that category.  P.  363 U. S. 440 n. 16.

4. The Civil Rights Act of 1957 is appropriate legislation under the Fifteenth Amendment.  P.  363 U. S. 452.

Syllabus 
A general contractor having defaulted both on the payment of federal taxes and on the payment of amounts due to subcontractors who had supplied labor and materials on a construction job in New York State, and the subcontractors having sued to foreclose their mechanics' liens, the owner of the real estate paid into court the amount remaining due under the construction contract.  Under  3670 and 3671 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the United States claimed priority for its tax lien on the ""property and rights to property"" of the defaulting general contractor.  The subcontractors claimed that, under  36-a of the New York Lien Law, the amounts due to the general contractor from the owner constituted ""trust funds"" in the hands of the general contractor for the benefit of subcontractors, laborers and materialmen, to the extent of their unpaid claims, and that, therefore, the general contractor had no ""property"" or ""rights to property"" in the fund to which the Government's tax lien could attach.  Without clearly determining what property rights, if any, the general contractor had in the fund under state law, the Court of Appeals of New York decided in favor of the United States.
Held:  the judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals of New York so that it may ascertain the property interests of the taxpayer under state law and then dispose of the case in accordance with established federal law.  Pp.  363 U. S. 510-516.

No. 23

363 U.S. 522

Syllabus 
Certain general contractors were adjudicated bankrupts after having defaulted both on the payment of federal taxes and on the payment of amounts due to certain subcontractors on the construction of buildings in North Carolina.  The owners of the buildings paid to the trustee in bankruptcy the amount remaining due under the contract, and it was agreed that the subcontractors could assert the same rights against the trustee as they could have asserted against the owners.  Under  6321 and 6322 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the United States claimed priority for its tax lien on the ""property and rights to property"" belonging to the general contractors.  The Federal Court of Appeals held that, under North Carolina law, the general contractors had no property interest in the amount due under the general construction contract, except to the extent that such amount exceeded the aggregate of all amounts due to subcontractors, and that, therefore, the Government could recover only so much of the construction price as would remain unpaid after deduction of a sum sufficient to pay the subcontractors.
Held:  since the Court of Appeals is much closer to North Carolina law than is this Court, and since this Court cannot say that the Court of Appeals' characterization of the taxpayers' property interests under that law is clearly erroneous or unreasonable, the judgment is affirmed.

Syllabus 
After changing from short-range steam locomotives to longer-range diesel locomotives, respondent railroads issued general orders doubling the length of their way-freight runs, thereby eliminating the jobs of two of their five-man way-freight crews and changing the home or away-from-home terminals of the remaining crews.  After unsuccessfully invoking the services of the National Mediation Board, the unions representing the members of these crews called a strike.

363 U.S. 536

Syllabus 
The Federal Trade Commission found that respondent, a leading national brewer which sells a so-called premium beer at higher prices than the beers of regional and local breweries in the great majority of markets, had reduced its prices only to those customers in the St. Louis area, while maintaining higher prices to all purchasers outside the St. Louis area, and thereby had ""discriminated in price"" as between purchasers differently located, and that this had diverted substantial business from respondent's St. Louis competitors, had substantially lessened competition and tended to create a monopoly, in violation of  2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, and it ordered respondent to cease and desist.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the statutory element of price discrimination had not been established, and it set aside the Commission's order on this ground alone.
Held:  the Court of Appeals erred in its construction of  2(a); the evidence warranted the Commission's finding of price discrimination, and the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.  Pp.  363 U. S. 537-554.
(a) Section 2(a) is violated when there is a price discrimination which deals the requisite injury to sellers' or ""primary line"" competition, even though buyers' or ""secondary line"" and ""tertiary line"" competition are unaffected.  Pp.  363 U. S. 542-545.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that, since all competing purchasers paid respondent the same price, so far as the record disclosed, respondent's price cuts were not discriminatory.  Pp.  363 U. S. 545-546.
(c) A price discrimination within the meaning of the portion of  2(a) here involved is merely a price difference; and, in order to establish such a price discrimination, it is not necessary to show that the lower price is below cost or unreasonably low for the purpose or design to eliminate competition, and thereby obtain a monopoly.  Pp.  363 U. S. 546-553.

The Federal Trade Commission found that respondent, a leading national brewer which sells a so-called premium beer at higher prices than the beers of regional and local breweries in the great majority of markets, had reduced its prices only to those customers in the St. Louis area, while maintaining higher prices to all purchasers outside the St. Louis area, and thereby had ""discriminated in price"" as between purchasers differently located, and that this had diverted substantial business from respondent's St. Louis competitors, had substantially lessened competition and tended to create a monopoly, in violation of  2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, and it ordered respondent to cease and desist.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the statutory element of price discrimination had not been established, and it set aside the Commission's order on this ground alone.
Held:  the Court of Appeals erred in its construction of  2(a); the evidence warranted the Commission's finding of price discrimination, and the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.  Pp.  363 U. S. 537-554.
(a) Section 2(a) is violated when there is a price discrimination which deals the requisite injury to sellers' or ""primary line"" competition, even though buyers' or ""secondary line"" and ""tertiary line"" competition are unaffected.  Pp.  363 U. S. 542-545.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that, since all competing purchasers paid respondent the same price, so far as the record disclosed, respondent's price cuts were not discriminatory.  Pp.  363 U. S. 545-546.
(c) A price discrimination within the meaning of the portion of  2(a) here involved is merely a price difference; and, in order to establish such a price discrimination, it is not necessary to show that the lower price is below cost or unreasonably low for the purpose or design to eliminate competition, and thereby obtain a monopoly.  Pp.  363 U. S. 546-553.

Syllabus 
After Alaska achieved statehood, these suits to enjoin enforcement of a statute of the State on the ground that it conflicted with applicable federal law were instituted in the District Court for Alaska, which, by the Constitution of the new State, and by state and federal statutes, was designated the successor of the former Territorial District Court in the interim until the organization of the new state courts and the Federal District Court for the District of Alaska.  The District Court for Alaska held the statute constitutional and entered orders denying the injunctions and dismissing the complaints.  Notices of direct appeals to this Court were filed after the Justices of the new Alaska Supreme Court had been designated, but before that Court was in actual operation.
Held:
1. The District Court for Alaska was the ""highest court of a State in which a decision could be had,"" and the appeals are within the jurisdiction of this Court under 28 U.S. C.  1257(2).  Pp.  363 U. S. 557-560.
2. Since the question of the constitutionality of the Alaska statute raises the issue of its justification under the so-called police power and is entangled with questions of state law which the Supreme Court of Alaska might construe so as to avoid conflict with federal law, this Court refrains at this stage from deciding the issues presented on the merits of these appeals so as to afford the Supreme Court of Alaska an opportunity to rule on the questions presented.

Syllabus 
This suit under  301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, was brought by a labor union to compel arbitration of a grievance based upon the employer's practice of contracting out work while laying off employees who could have performed such work.  The collective bargaining agreement between the parties contained ""no strike"" and ""no lock-out"" provisions, and set up a grievance procedure culminating in arbitration.  It provided that ""matters which are strictly a function of management shall not be subject to arbitration,"" but it also provided that,
""Should differences arise . . . as to the meaning and application of the provisions of this Agreement, or should any local trouble of any kind arise,""
the grievance procedure should be followed.  The Court of Appeals ruled that deciding whether to contract out work was ""strictly a function of management"" within the meaning of the agreement, and it sustained a judgment of the District Court dismissing the complaint.
Held:  It erred in doing so, and the judgment is reversed.  Pp. 363 U. S. 575-585.
(a) In a suit under 301(a), judicial inquiry must be strictly confined to the question whether the reluctant party did agree to arbitrate the grievance or to give the arbitrator power to make the award he made; an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute; and doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.  Pp.  363 U. S. 582-583.
(b) In the absence of any express provision excluding a particular grievance from arbitration, only the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration can prevail, particularly where, as here, the exclusion clause is vague, and the arbitration clause quite broad.  Pp.  363 U. S. 583-585.
(c) Since, in this case, the parties had agreed that any dispute ""as to the meaning of this Agreement"" would be determined by

Syllabus 
Employees were discharged during the term of a collective bargaining agreement containing a provision for arbitration of disputes, including differences ""as to the meaning and application"" of the agreement, and a provision for reinstatement with back pay of employees discharged in violation of the agreement.  The discharges were arbitrated after the agreement had expired, and the arbitrator found that they were in violation of the agreement and that the agreement required reinstatement with back pay, minus pay for a ten-day suspension and such sums as the employees had received from other employment.  Respondent refused to comply with the award, and the District Court directed it to do so.  The Court of Appeals held that (a) failure of the award to specify the amounts to be deducted from the back pay rendered the award unenforceable, though that defect could be remedied by requiring the parties to complete the arbitration, (b) an award for back pay subsequent to the date of expiration of the collective bargaining agreement could not be enforced, and (c) the requirement for reinstatement of the discharged employees was unenforceable because the collective bargaining agreement had expired.

Appellee, an alien who had become eligible for old-age benefits in 1955, was deported in 1956, pursuant to  241(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, for having been a member of the Communist Party from 1933 to 1939.

Held:  judicial review of that administrative determination was precluded by  7 (c) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, which provides that,
""The sole relief and remedy of any person having any claim to any money or other property heretofore or hereafter . . . transferred . . . to the Alien Property Custodian . . . shall be that provided by the terms of this Act,""

Argued May 16, 1960
Decided June 20, 1960
363 U.S. 697

Syllabus 
Petitioner and two others were tried before a jury in a North Carolina state court on an indictment jointly charging them with robbery.  Petitioner, who was 18 years old, asked the judge to appoint a lawyer to help him in his defense, stating that he was without funds to employ counsel and was incapable of defending himself; but this request was denied.  Counsel for one of petitioner's codefendants volunteered to help petitioner and the third defendant, but, in the midst of the trial and in the presence of the jury, his client pleaded guilty to petit larceny, that plea was accepted, and the lawyer withdrew from the proceedings.  No steps were taken to protect petitioner from the potential prejudice resulting from the guilty plea of his codefendant in the presence of the jury, and petitioner and his other codefendant were convicted of larceny from the person, a felony under North Carolina law.
Held:  the prejudicial position in which petitioner found himself when his codefendant pleaded guilty before the jury raised problems requiring professional knowledge and experience beyond a layman's ken, and petitioner's conviction in these circumstances without the benefit of counsel deprived him of the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  363 U. S. 697-704.

The Internal Revenue Codes of 1939,  3405 (c), and 1954,  4111, placed a 10% excise tax on sales of ""self-contained air conditioning units"" and gave the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, power to prescribe needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of the provisions relating to such taxes.

Held:
1. These rulings were valid.  Pp.  363 U. S. 711-712.

In 1936, respondent's decedent divested himself of his rights in certain insurance policies on his own life by assigning them to his wife, but he continued to pay the premiums on them until he died in 1954.

While a citizen and resident of Illinois, petitioner purchased there from respondent, an insurance company licensed to do business in Illinois and Florida, an insurance policy covering ""all risks"" of loss or damage to certain personal property having no fixed situs.  After moving to Florida, petitioner sustained losses there on which respondent denied liability.  More than 12 months after discovery of the losses, petitioner sued respondent in a Federal District Court in Florida, basing jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship.  That Court awarded a judgment to petitioner after ruling that, (1) under Florida law, the losses were not excluded from ""all risks"" coverage if they were caused by deliberate acts of petitioner's wife, and (2) the suit was not barred by a provision in the policy that suit on any claim for loss must be brought within 12 months of discovery of the loss, apparently because a Florida statute forbade enforcement of such a clause.  Without passing on these issues of local law, the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that Florida could not, consistently with the requirements of due process, apply its statute to the ""suits clause"" of this contract made in Illinois, where such a clause is valid.

Decided June 13, 1960
363 U.S. 229

Syllabus 
Respondent is an agency of the State of Oklahoma created to develop hydroelectric power on the Grand River, a nonnavigable tributary of the navigable Arkansas River.  It proposed a river development plan at Pensacola, Markham Ferry, and Ft. Gibson, all sites on the Grand River, and, under license from the Federal Power Commission, completed a project at Pensacola in 1940.  Subsequently, by the Flood Control Act of 1941, Congress incorporated the Grand River plan into a comprehensive plan for regulation of navigation, control of floods and production of power on the Arkansas River and its tributaries, and the United States constructed a project at Ft. Gibson, in connection with which it compensated respondent for a condemned tract of land, flowage rights over its lands, and relocation of its transmission lines.  Respondent sued in the Court of Claims for additional compensation for the ""taking"" of its water power rights at Ft. Gibson and its franchise to develop electric power and energy at that site.
Held:  Respondent is not entitled to recover.  It failed to show that it had any rights in the flow of the river.  The United States had the superior right under the Commerce Clause to build the Ft. Gibson project itself to protect the navigable capacity of the Arkansas River, and the frustration of respondent's plans and expectations which resulted when the United States chose to do so did not take property from respondent in the sense of the Fifth Amendment.

Held:  Respondent is not entitled to recover.  It failed to show that it had any rights in the flow of the river.  The United States had the superior right under the Commerce Clause to build the Ft. Gibson project itself to protect the navigable capacity of the Arkansas River, and the frustration of respondent's plans and expectations which resulted when the United States chose to do so did not take property from respondent in the sense of the Fifth Amendment.

Syllabus 
1. Federal tax liens on real estate which are junior to defaulted mortgages held on the same properties by other parties may be effectively extinguished by state proceedings to which the United States is not, and is not required under state law to be, a party.  Pp.  363 U. S. 238-252.
(a) Since federal tax liens are wholly creatures of federal statute, matters directly affecting their nature or operation are federal questions, regardless of whether or not the federal statutory scheme deals with them specifically.  Pp.  363 U. S. 240-241.
(b) Nevertheless, it is believed desirable to adopt as federal law state law governing divestiture of junior federal tax liens (except to the extent that Congress may have entered the field), since this will avoid the severe dislocation of local property relationships which would result from disregarding state procedures.  Pp.  363 U. S. 241-242.
(c) By the enactment of 26 U.S. C.  7424 and 28 U.S. C.  2410, Congress did not intend to make the proceedings under those sections the only means by which a junior federal tax lien could be extinguished; it did not intend to exclude the application of all state procedures, whatever their existence or effectiveness might be.  Pp.  363 U. S. 242-250.
2. Under Pennsylvania law, mortgagees of a tract of Pennsylvania land on which the United States held a junior federal tax lien proceeded under a confession of judgment provision of the mortgage bond to obtain an in personam judgment against the mortgagor taxpayer, pursuant to which the property was sold under a writ of fieri facias.  Subsequently, the United States sued under 26 U.S.C.  7403 to enforce its junior tax lien on the same land by foreclosure and sale.
Held:  under Pennsylvania law, the sheriff's sale under a writ of fieri facias was a judicial sale; but the doctrine of sovereign immunity from unconsented suits has not yet been

3. California real estate and personal properties subject to a deed of trust and two chattel mortgages were sold by the trustee-mortgagee pursuant to powers of sale contained in the respective instruments.  The United States, which had junior tax liens on the properties, received no actual notice of the sale.  Thereafter the mortgagee, which had bought in at the sale, brought suit against the United States under 28 U.S.C.  2410 to quiet its title.
Held:  the doctrine of sovereign immunity from unconsented suits does not apply to such private sales without judicial proceedings.  Therefore, the exercise under California law of the powers of sale conferred by the deed of trust and chattel mortgages effectively extinguished the junior federal tax liens.  Pp.  363 U.

Syllabus 
The ""favored-nation"" clause of a contract for the sale of natural gas by respondent to a pipeline company provided that respondent would be entitled to a price increase should the pipeline company thereafter ""enter into a contract providing for the purchase by it of gas"" at a higher price.  Thereafter, the pipeline company agreed to a higher price under a preexisting, long-term contract with another producer, which required that the price be redetermined every five years, either by agreement of the parties or by arbitration.  In proceedings under the Natural Gas Act to determine its effective rate as of June 7, 1954, respondent filed its contract with the Federal Power Commission as a rate schedule.  The Commission held that the price redetermination under the pipeline company's preexisting contract with the other producer was not a contract for the purchase of gas within the meaning of the ""favored nation"" clause in respondent's contract, and that, therefore, the price payable by the pipeline company to respondent had not been increased.  The Court of Appeals vacated the Commission's order.
Held:
1. Since the Commission disposed of the case solely upon its view of the result called for by the application of ordinary rules of contract construction employed by the courts, and did not rely on matters within its own special competence, the Court of Appeals was justified in making its own independent determination of the correct application of the governing principles.  Pp.  363 U. S. 268-270.
2. In the circumstances, consideration of the scope of judicial review of administrative determinations need not deter this Court from reviewing the decision of the Court of Appeals and deciding the proper construction of the ""favored-nation"" clause.  P.  363 U. S. 270.
3. The Commission correctly construed the ""favored-nation"" clause as not effecting an increase in respondent's price by reason of 
Page 363 U. S. 264
 the increased price agreed upon between the pipeline company and the other producer under their preexisting agreement.  Pp.  363 U. S. 270-276.
4. The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings, including consideration of the question whether the enforceability of the contract between the pipeline company and the other producer is material to the decision of this case, and, if so, whether that contract was enforceable.

1. This Court rejects the Government's suggestion that it promulgate a new ""test"" to serve as a standard to be applied by the lower courts and by the Tax Court in dealing with numerous cases involving the question what is a ""gift"" excludable from income under the Internal Revenue Code, since the governing principles are necessarily general, and have already been spelled out in the opinions of this Court.

2. The conclusion whether a transfer amounts to a ""gift"" is one that must be reached on consideration of all the factors.  While the principles urged by the Government may, in nonabsolute form as crystallizations of experience, prove persuasive to the trier of facts in a particular case, they cannot be laid down as a matter of law.  Pp.  363 U. S. 287-289.
3. Determination in each individual case as to whether the transaction in question was a ""gift"" must be based ultimately on the application of the factfinding tribunal's experience with the mainsprings of human conduct to the totality of the facts in the case, and appellate review of the conclusion reached by the fact-finding tribunal must be quite restricted.

4. In No. 376, Duberstein, an individual taxpayer, gave to a business corporation, upon request, the names of potential customers.  The information proved valuable, and the corporation reciprocated by giving Duberstein a Cadillac automobile, charging the cost thereof as a business expense on its own corporate income tax return.  The Tax Court concluded that the car was not a ""gift"" excludable from income under  22(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
Held:  on the record in this case, it cannot be said

5.

Petitioners were indicted on 20 counts in a Federal District Court for using the mails to defraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1341, and conspiring to do so, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  371.  The indictment charged that together they controlled a School District and its depository bank, the assessment and collection of school taxes, and the expenditure of school funds, and that they entered into and carried out a scheme to defraud the School District, the State, and the taxpayers of each by misappropriating and embezzling funds and property of the School District.  The specific offense charged in each of the first 19 counts was that, for the purpose of executing the scheme, petitioners caused a particular letter, check, tax statement, tax receipt, or invoice to be placed in, or received from, an authorized depository for United States mail.  Count 20 charged that petitioners conspired to commit the offense set out in the first count and committed specific overt acts to that end.  They were convicted, and the convictions were sustained by the Court of Appeals.
Held:  although the indictment charged, and the evidence tended to show, that petitioners devised and practiced a scheme to defraud the School District by misappropriating and embezzling its money and property, neither the indictment nor the evidence supports the judgments, because the indictment did not charge, and the evidence did not show, any use of the mails ""for the purpose of executing such scheme,"" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.  1341.
Pp.  363 U. S. 371-394.
(a) The indictment did not expressly or impliedly charge, and there was no evidence tending to show, that the taxes assessed were excessive, ""padded"" or in any way illegal; nor did the Court submit any such issue to the jury.  Pp.  363 U. S. 385-388.
(b) In the light of the particular circumstances of this case, and especially of the facts that (1) the School Board was legally required to collect and assess taxes, (2) the indictment did not charge, nor the proofs show, that the taxes assessed and collected were excessive, ""padded"" or in any way unlawful, (3) no such issue was submitted to, or determined by, the jury, (4) the Board was compelled by state law to collect and receipt for the taxes, and 
Page 363 U. S. 371
 (5) it was legally compelled to use the mails in doing so, it must be concluded that the legally compelled mailings complained of in the first 16 counts of the indictment were not shown to have been made ""for the purpose of executing such scheme,""within the meaning of  1341.  Pp.  363 U. S. 388-391.
(c) On the record in this case, it cannot be said that the mailings complained of in the first 16 counts of the indictment constituted false pretenses and misrepresentations to obtain money.  Pp.  363 U. S. 391-392.
(d) As to the charges in Counts 17, 18, and 19 that two of the petitioners fraudulently obtained gasoline and other filling station products and services for themselves upon the credit card and at the expense of the School District, knowing that the oil company would use the mails in billing the School District for these things, it cannot be said that the mailings in question were ""for the purpose of executing"" the scheme to defraud, since the scheme had reached fruition when these two petitioners received the goods and services complained of and before the mailings occurred.  Pp.  363 U. S. 392-393.
(e) Inasmuch as Count 20 charged petitioners with conspiring to commit the offense complained of in Count 1, and inasmuch as, on this record, that count cannot be sustained, it follows that petitioners' convictions upon Count 20 cannot stand.  P.  363 U. S. 393.

(b) In the light of the particular circumstances of this case, and especially of the facts that (1) the School Board was legally required to collect and assess taxes, (2) the indictment did not charge, nor the proofs show, that the taxes assessed and collected were excessive, ""padded"" or in any way unlawful, (3) no such issue was submitted to, or determined by, the jury, (4) the Board was compelled by state law to collect and receipt for the taxes, and 
Page 363 U. S. 371
 (5) it was legally compelled to use the mails in doing so, it must be concluded that the legally compelled mailings complained of in the first 16 counts of the indictment were not shown to have been made ""for the purpose of executing such scheme,""within the meaning of  1341.  Pp.  363 U. S. 388-391.
(c) On the record in this case, it cannot be said that the mailings complained of in the first 16 counts of the indictment constituted false pretenses and misrepresentations to obtain money.  Pp.  363 U. S. 391-392.
(d) As to the charges in Counts 17, 18, and 19 that two of the petitioners fraudulently obtained gasoline and other filling station products and services for themselves upon the credit card and at the expense of the School District, knowing that the oil company would use the mails in billing the School District for these things, it cannot be said that the mailings in question were ""for the purpose of executing"" the scheme to defraud, since the scheme had reached fruition when these two petitioners received the goods and services complained of and before the mailings occurred.  Pp.  363 U. S. 392-393.
(e) Inasmuch as Count 20 charged petitioners with conspiring to commit the offense complained of in Count 1, and inasmuch as, on this record, that count cannot be sustained, it follows that petitioners' convictions upon Count 20 cannot stand.  P.  363 U. S. 393.

No. 139
Argued May 16-17, 1960
Decided June 13, 1960
363 U.S. 405

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an alien whose deportation had been ordered, applied under  19(c) of the Immigration Act of 1917, as amended, for an order suspending his deportation or permitting his voluntary departure.  In an administrative hearing on his application, he was asked whether he was a member of the Communist Party.  He refused to answer, claiming the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  His application was denied on the ground that he had failed to prove his eligibility under  19 and the Internal Security Act of 1950.
Held:  denial of his application is sustained, since 19(d) and the Internal Security Act of 1950 make Communists ineligible for suspension of deportation, and the burden was on petitioner to show that he was eligible for such suspension.  Pp.  363 U. S. 405-408.

|363 u.s. 1|"United States v. Louisiana
No. 10, Original
Argued October 12-15, 1959
Decided May 31, 1960
363 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Invoking the original jurisdiction of this Court under Art. III,  2 of the Constitution, the United States brought suit against the States of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, seeking a declaration that it is entitled to exclusive possession of, and full dominion and power over, the lands, minerals, and other natural resources underlying the waters of the Gulf of Mexico more than three geographical miles seaward from the coast of each State and extending to the edge of the Continental Shelf.  It also asked that the States be enjoined from interfering with the rights of the United States in that area, and that they be required to account for all sums of money derived by them therefrom since June 5, 1950.
Held:
1. The Submerged Lands Act grants to each coastal State the ownership of submerged lands within three geographical miles from its coast, but no boundary in excess of three miles was fixed ipso facto for any State.  Pp.  363 U. S. 13,  363 U. S. 20-25.
2. The Act preserved the right of each Gulf State to prove boundaries extending more than three geographical miles (but not more than three marine leagues) into the Gulf, but each State must establish the existence of such a boundary in judicial proceedings.  Pp.  363 U. S. 25-26.
3. To satisfy the requirements of the Act, a State's seaward boundary beyond three geographical miles from its coast must be one which, by virtue of congressional action, would have been 
Page 363 U. S. 2
 legally effective to carry, as between the State and the Nation, submerged land rights under the doctrine of Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, as Congress conceived that rule to have been prior to this Court's decision in United States v. California, 332 U. S. 19.  The mere existence of such a boundary prior to the time the State was admitted to the Union is not alone sufficient.  Pp.  363 U. S. 24-36.
4. The fact that, in the field of foreign relations, the policy of the Executive Branch of the Government may have been to refuse to assert territorial jurisdiction more than three miles from shore would not impair the effectiveness of a State's seaward boundary fixed by Congress more than three miles from shore, so far as the purely domestic purposes of the Submerged Lands Act are concerned.  Pp.  363 U. S. 30-36.
5. Texas having claimed a maritime boundary at three marine leagues from her coast when she was an independent republic prior to admission to the Union, and this boundary having been confirmed pursuant to the Annexation Resolution of 1845, Texas is entitled, under the Submerged Lands Act, to a grant of three marine leagues from her coast for domestic purposes.

			"|"United States v. Louisiana
No. 10, Original
Argued October 12-15, 1959
Decided May 31, 1960
363 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Invoking the original jurisdiction of this Court under Art. III,  2 of the Constitution, the United States brought suit against the States of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, seeking a declaration that it is entitled to exclusive possession of, and full dominion and power over, the lands, minerals, and other natural resources underlying the waters of the Gulf of Mexico more than three geographical miles seaward from the coast of each State and extending to the edge of the Continental Shelf.  It also asked that the States be enjoined from interfering with the rights of the United States in that area, and that they be required to account for all sums of money derived by them therefrom since June 5, 1950.
Held:
1. The Submerged Lands Act grants to each coastal State the ownership of submerged lands within three geographical miles from its coast, but no boundary in excess of three miles was fixed ipso facto for any State.  Pp.  363 U. S. 13,  363 U. S. 20-25.
2. The Act preserved the right of each Gulf State to prove boundaries extending more than three geographical miles (but not more than three marine leagues) into the Gulf, but each State must establish the existence of such a boundary in judicial proceedings.  Pp.  363 U. S. 25-26.
3. To satisfy the requirements of the Act, a State's seaward boundary beyond three geographical miles from its coast must be one which, by virtue of congressional action, would have been 
Page 363 U. S. 2
 legally effective to carry, as between the State and the Nation, submerged land rights under the doctrine of Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, as Congress conceived that rule to have been prior to this Court's decision in United States v. California, 332 U. S. 19.  The mere existence of such a boundary prior to the time the State was admitted to the Union is not alone sufficient.  Pp.  363 U. S. 24-36.
4. The fact that, in the field of foreign relations, the policy of the Executive Branch of the Government may have been to refuse to assert territorial jurisdiction more than three miles from shore would not impair the effectiveness of a State's seaward boundary fixed by Congress more than three miles from shore, so far as the purely domestic purposes of the Submerged Lands Act are concerned.  Pp.  363 U. S. 30-36.
5. Texas having claimed a maritime boundary at three marine leagues from her coast when she was an independent republic prior to admission to the Union, and this boundary having been confirmed pursuant to the Annexation Resolution of 1845, Texas is entitled, under the Submerged Lands Act, to a grant of three marine leagues from her coast for domestic purposes.  Pp.  363 U. S. 36-65.
6. Louisiana is entitled to submerged land rights to a distance no greater than three geographical miles from its coastlines, wherever those lines may ultimately be shown to be.  Pp.  363 U. S. 66-79.
7. Mississippi is not entitled to rights in submerged lands lying beyond three geographical miles from its coast.  Pp.  363 U. S. 79-82.
8. Alabama is not entitled to rights in submerged lands lying beyond three geographical miles from its coast.  P.  363 U. S. 82.
9. As to the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, a decree will be entered (1) declaring that the United States is entitled, as against these States, to all the lands, minerals and other natural resources underlying the Gulf of Mexico more than three geographical miles from the coast of each such State, that is, from the line of ordinary low-water mark and outer limit of inland waters, and extending seaward to the edge of the Continental Shelf; (2) declaring that none of these States is entitled to any interest in such lands, minerals and resources; (3) enjoining these States from interfering with the rights of the United States therein; (4) directing each such State appropriately to account to the United States for all sums of money derived therefrom subsequent to June 5, 1950; and (5) dismissing Alabama's cross-bill.  P.  363 U. S. 83. 
Page 363 U. S. 3

10. As to the State of Texas, a decree will be entered (1) declaring that the State is entitled, as against the United States, to the lands, minerals and other natural resources underlying the Gulf of Mexico to a distance of three marine leagues from Texas' coast, that is, from the line of ordinary low-water mark and outer limit of inland waters; (2) declaring that the United States is entitled, as against Texas, to no interest therein; (3) declaring that the United States is entitled, as against Texas, to all such lands, minerals and resources lying beyond that area and extending to the edge of the Continental Shelf; (4) enjoining the State from interfering with the rights of the United States therein; and (5) directing Texas appropriately to account to the United States for all sums of money derived since June 5, 1950, from the area to which the United States is declared to be entitled.  P.  363 U. S. 84.
11. Jurisdiction is retained for such further proceedings as may be necessary to effectuate the rights herein adjudicated.  P.  363 U. S. 84.
12. The motions of Louisiana and Mississippi to take depositions are denied, without prejudice to their renewal in such further proceedings as may be had in connection with matters left open by this opinion.  Pp.  363 U. S. 84-85.
13. The same disposition is made of the similar averment in Alabama's answer.  P.  363 U. S. 84, n. 142.
14. Texas' motion for similar relief and for a severance is rendered moot by the decision as to it.  P.  363 U. S. 84, n. 142.
15. The alternative motion of Louisiana, contained in its answer to the original complaint, to transfer the case as to it to the United States District Court in Louisiana is denied.  P.  363 U. S. 85, n. 143.

Syllabus 
Subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury, petitioner refused, on grounds of possible self-incrimination, to answer questions relevant to the grand jury's inquiry.  The grand jury sought the aid of the district judge, who heard arguments on the subject, ruled that petitioner would be accorded immunity as extensive as the privilege he had asserted, and ordered him to answer the questions.  After returning to the grand jury room, petitioner persisted in his refusal, and he was again brought before the district judge, who addressed the same questions to him in the presence of the grand jury, explicitly directed him to answer them, and, upon his refusal to do so, adjudged him guilty of criminal contempt and sentenced him to imprisonment for one year.  During these proceedings, everyone was excluded from the courtroom except petitioner, his counsel, the grand jury, government counsel, the judge and the court reporter, but no objection to the exclusion of the general public was made at any stage of the proceedings.
Held:  in the circumstances of this case, exclusion of the public from the courtroom when petitioner was adjudged guilty of criminal contempt and sentenced did not invalidate his conviction.  Pp.  362 U. S. 611-620.
(a) A proceeding for criminal contempt under Rule 42 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is not a ""criminal prosecution"" within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, which explicitly guarantees the right to a ""public trial"" only for ""criminal prosecutions.""  P.  362 U. S. 616.
(b) It was not error for the judge to clear the courtroom initially when the grand jury appeared before him for the second time seeking his assistance in compelling petitioner to testify, and, in light of the presence of petitioner's counsel and his failure to object to the continued exclusion of the public, failure of the judge to reopen the courtroom to the general public on his own motion before adjudging petitioner in contempt and sentencing him did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  362 U. S. 616-620.
267 F.2d 335 affirmed. 
Page 362 U. S. 611

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a prosecution for contempt arising from petitioner's refusal to answer a series of questions propounded to him by a federal grand jury.  In every respect but one, this case is a replica of Brown v. United States, 359 U. S. 41, and, as to all common issues, it is controlled by that case.  In Brown, however, we expressly declined to decide the effect of claimed ""secrecy"" upon proceedings culminating in the petitioner's sentencing for contempt, ""because the record does not show this to be the fact.""  359 U.S. at  359 U. S. 51, note 11.  Here, it appears that the contemptuous conduct, the adjudication of guilt, and the imposition of sentence all took place after the public had been excluded from the courtroom in what began and was continued as ""a Grand Jury proceeding.""  The effect of this continuing exclusion in the circumstances of the case is the sole question presented.
On the morning of April 18, 1957, pursuant to a subpoena, petitioner appeared as a witness before a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York engaged in investigating violations of the Interstate Commerce Act.  He was asked six questions relevant to the grand jury's investigation.  After consultation with his attorney, who was in an anteroom, he refused to answer them on the ground that they might tend to incriminate him.  He persisted in this refusal after having been directed to answer by the foreman of the grand jury and advised by 
Page 362 U. S. 612
 government counsel that applicable statutes gave him complete immunity from prosecution concerning any matter as to which he might testify.  See 49 U.S.C.  305(d).
Later that day the grand jury, government counsel, petitioner, and his attorney appeared before Judge Levet, sitting in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, the grand jury having sought
""the aid and assistance of the Court, in a direction to a witness, Morry Levine, who has this morning appeared before the Grand Jury and declined to answer certain questions that have been put to him.""
The record of the morning's proceedings before the grand jury was read.  After argument by counsel, the judge ruled that the adequate immunity conferred by statute deprived petitioner of the right to refuse to answer the questions put to him.  Petitioner was ordered to appear before the grand jury on April 22, and was directed by the court then to answer the questions.
On the morning of April 22, petitioner appeared before the grand jury.  The questions were again put to him, and he again refused to answer.  Once again, the grand jury, government counsel, petitioner and his counsel went before Judge Levet, for ""the assistance of the Court in regard to the witness Morry Levine.""  At this time, the record shows the following:
""The Court:  Will those who have no other business in the courtroom please leave now?  I have a Grand Jury proceeding.""
""The Clerk:  The Marshal will clear the court room.""
""(Court room cleared by the Marshals.)""
Petitioner, his counsel, the grand jury, government counsel, and the court reporter remained.  Petitioner objected to further participation by the court in the process of 
Page 362 U. S. 613
 compelling his testimony, except according to the procedures prescribed by Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  That provision, which relates to contempts generally, excluding those ""committed in the actual presence of the court"" as to which the judge certifies ""that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt,"" provides in effect for a conventional trial.  In petitioner's view, the court was compelled to regard his contempt, if any, as having already been committed out of the presence of the court, through petitioner's disobedience before the grand jury that morning of the court's order of April 18.
The judge, however, did not treat petitioner's renewed refusal to answer the grand jury's questions as a definitive contempt.  He chose to proceed just as he had two weeks earlier in the case of Brown, reviewed here as Brown v. United States, supra, 359 U. S. 41.  The morning's grand jury proceedings, showing petitioner's refusals to answer, were read, and petitioner was ordered by the judge to take the stand.  The court indicated it was proceeding as ""[t]he Court and the Grand Jury"" ""in accordance with Rule 42(a),"" which relates to the procedure in cases of contempt ""committed in the actual presence of the court.""  Over objection, the court then put to petitioner the six questions which he had refused to answer when propounded by the grand jury.  Petitioner again refused to answer these questions on the claim of the privilege against self-incrimination.  In answer to a question by the court, he stated that he would continue to refuse on that ground should the grand jury again put the questions to him.  Government counsel asked that petitioner be adjudged in contempt ""committed in the physical presence of the Judge.""  The court asked for reasons ""why I should not so adjudicate this witness in contempt.""  Petitioner's counsel made three 
Page 362 U. S. 614
 points:  (1) that the procedures had not been in accordance with ""the requirements of due process""; (2) that the procedures had not followed the requirements of Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; and (3) that, on the merits of the charge, the statutory immunity was not sufficiently extensive to deprive petitioner of his privilege not to answer.  No reference was made to the exclusion of the general public from the proceedings.  Petitioner was adjudicated in contempt and, after submission by counsel of views regarding sentence, one year's imprisonment was imposed.  The conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 267 F.2d 335, and we granted certiorari, 361 U.S. 860, limiting our grant to the question left open in Brown v. United States, namely, whether the ""secrecy"" of the proceedings offended either the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution or the public trial requirement of the Sixth Amendment.
The course of proceeding followed by the District Court in this case for compelling petitioner's testimony was the one approved in Brown.  Specifically, it was established by that case that, after petitioner had disobeyed the court's direction to answer the grand jury's questions before that body, it was proper for the court, upon application of the grand jury, (1) to disregard any contempt committed outside its presence; (2) to put the questions directly to petitioner in the court's presence as well as in the presence of the grand jury; and (3) to punish summarily under Rule 42(a) as a contempt committed ""in the actual presence of the court"" petitioner's refusal thereupon to answer.
It was surely not error for the judge initially to have cleared the courtroom on April 22 when the grand jury appeared before him for the second time seeking his ""assistance . . . in regard to the witness Morry Levine.""  
Page 362 U. S. 615
 The Secrecy of grand jury proceedings is enjoined by statute (see 18 U.S.C.  1508, and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 6(d) and (e)), and a necessary initial step in the proceedings was to read the record of the morning's grand jury proceedings.  The precise question involved in this case, therefore, is whether it was error, once the courtroom had been properly, indeed necessarily, cleared, for petitioner's contempt, summary conviction, and sentencing to occur without inviting the general public back into the courtroom.
From the very beginning of this Nation and throughout its history, the power to convict for criminal contempt has been deemed an essential and inherent aspect of the very existence of our courts.  The First Congress, out of whose 95 members 20, among them some of the most distinguished lawyers, had been members of the Philadelphia Convention, explicitly conferred the power of contempt upon the federal courts.  Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 83.  That power was recognized by this Court as early as 1812, in a striking way.  United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32,  11 U. S. 34.  As zealous a guardian of the procedural safeguards of the Bill of Rights as the first Mr. Justice Harlan, in sustaining the power summarily to punish contempts committed in the face of the court, described the power in this way:
""the offender may, in [the court's] discretion, be instantly apprehended and immediately imprisoned, without trial or issue, and without other proof than its actual knowledge of what occurred; . . . such power, although arbitrary in its nature and liable to abuse, is absolutely essential to the protection of the courts in the discharge of their functions.""
Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S. 289,  128 U. S. 313 (1888).  It is a particular exercise of this power of summary punishment of contempt committed in the court's presence which is at issue in this case.  This Court has not been wanting in 
Page 362 U. S. 616
 effective alertness to check abusive exercises of that power by federal judges.  See Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517; Offutt v. United States, 348 U. S. 11.  It would, however, be throwing the baby out with the bath to find it necessary, in the name of the Constitution, to strangle a power ""absolutely essential"" for the functioning of an independent judiciary, which is the ultimate reliance of citizens in safeguarding rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Procedural safeguards for criminal contempts do not derive from the Sixth Amendment.  Criminal contempt proceedings are not within ""all criminal prosecutions"" to which that Amendment applies.  Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S. 289,  128 U. S. 306-310; Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517,  267 U. S. 534-535; Offutt v. United States, 348 U. S. 11,  348 U. S. 14.  But while the right to a ""public trial"" is explicitly guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment only for ""criminal prosecutions,"" that provision is a reflection of the notion, deeply rooted in the common law, that ""justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.""  Offutt v. United States, 348 U. S. 11, at  348 U. S. 14.  Accordingly, due process demands appropriate regard for the requirements of a public proceeding in cases of criminal contempt, see In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, as it does for all adjudications through the exercise of the judicial power, barring narrowly limited categories of exceptions such as may be required by the exigencies of war, see Amendment to Rule 46 of the Admiralty Rules, June 8, 1942, 316 U.S. 717, revoked May 6, 1946, 328 U.S. 882, or for the protection of children, see 18 U.S.C.  5033.
Inasmuch as the petitioner's claim thus derives from the Due Process Clause, and not from one of the explicitly defined procedural safeguards of the Constitution, decision must turn on the particular circumstances of the case, and not upon a question-begging because abstract and 
Page 362 U. S. 617
 absolute right to a ""public trial.""  Cf. Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97,  291 U. S. 114-117.  The narrow question is whether, in light of the facts that the grand jury, petitioner, and his counsel were present throughout, and that petitioner never specifically made objection to the continuing so-called ""secrecy"" of the proceedings or requested that the judge open the courtroom, he was denied due process because the general public remained excluded from the courtroom.
The grand jury is an arm of the court, and its in camera proceedings constitute ""a judicial inquiry.""  Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43,  201 U. S. 66.
""The Constitution itself makes the grand jury a part of the judicial process.  It must initiate prosecution for the most important federal crimes.  It does so under general instructions from the court to which it is attached and to which, from time to time, it reports its findings.""
Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S. 323,  309 U. S. 327.  Unlike an ordinary judicial inquiry, where publicity is the rule, grand jury proceedings are secret.  In the ordinary course, therefore, contempt of the court committed through a refusal to answer questions put before the grand jury does not occur in a public proceeding.  Publicity fully satisfying the requirements of due process is achieved in such a case when a public trial upon notice is held on the charge of contempt under Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
Brown v. United States, supra, established that a grand jury as an arm of the court has available to it another course to vindicate its authority over a lawlessly recalcitrant witness.  Appeal may be made to the court under whose aegis the grand jury sits to have the witness ordered to answer the grand jury's inquiries in the judge's physical presence, so that the court's persuasive exertion to induce obedience, and its power summarily to commit for contempt should its authority be ignored, may be brought 
Page 362 U. S. 618
 to bear upon him.  Since such a summary adjudication of contempt occurs in the midst of a grand jury proceeding, a clash may arise between the interest, sanctioned by history and statute, in preserving the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, and the interest, deriving from the Due Process Clause, in preserving the public nature of court proceedings.
In the present case, grand jury secrecy freely gave way insofar as petitioner's counsel was present and was permitted to be fully active in behalf of his client throughout the proceedings before Judge Levet.  Petitioner had ample notice of the court's intention to put the grand jury's questions directly to him, and to proceed against him summarily should he persist in his refusal to answer.  Had petitioner requested, and the court denied his wish, that the courtroom be opened to the public before the final stage of these proceedings, we would have a different case.  Petitioner had no right to have the general public present while the grand jury's questions were being read.  However, after the record of the morning's grand jury proceedings had been read, and the six questions put to petitioner with a direction that he answer them in the court's presence, there was no further cause for enforcing secrecy in the sense of excluding the general public.  Having refused to answer each question in turn, and having resolved not to answer at all, petitioner then might well have insisted that, as summary punishment was to be imposed, the courtroom be opened so that the act of contempt, that is, his definitive refusal to comply with the court's direction to answer the previously propounded questions, and the consequent adjudication and sentence, might occur in public.  See Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517,  267 U. S. 534-536.  To repeat, such a claim evidently was not in petitioner's thought, and no request to open the courtroom was made at any stage of the proceedings. 
Page 362 U. S. 619

The continuing exclusion of the public in this case is not to deemed contrary to the requirements of the Due Process Clause without a request having been made to the trial judge to open the courtroom at the final stage of the proceeding, thereby giving notice of the claim now made and affording the judge an opportunity to avoid reliance on it.  This was not a case of the kind of secrecy that deprived petitioner of effective legal assistance and rendered irrelevant his failure to insist upon the claim he now makes.  Counsel was present throughout, and it is not claimed that he was not fully aware of the exclusion of the general public.  The proceedings properly began out of the public's presence, and one stage of them flowed naturally into the next.  There was no obvious point at which, in light of the presence of counsel, it can be said that the onus was imperatively upon the trial judge to interrupt the course of proceedings upon his own motion and establish a conventional public trial.  We cannot view petitioner's untenable general objection to the nature of the proceedings by invoking Rule 42(b) as constituting appropriate notice of an objection to the exclusion of the general public in the circumstances of this proceeding under Rule 42(a).
This case is wholly unlike In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257.  This is not a case where it is or could be charged that the judge deliberately enforced secrecy in order to be free of the safeguards of the public's scrutiny; nor is it urged that publicity would in the slightest have affected the conduct of the proceedings or their result.  Nor are we dealing with a situation where prejudice, attributable to secrecy, is found to be sufficiently impressive to render irrelevant failure to make a timely objection at proceedings like these.  This is obviously not such a case.  Due regard generally for the public nature of the judicial process does not require disregard of the solid demands of the fair 
Page 362 U. S. 620
 administration of justice in favor of a party who, at the appropriate time and acting under advice of counsel, saw no disregard of a right, but raises an abstract claim only as an afterthought on appeal.
Affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a prosecution for contempt arising from petitioner's refusal to answer a series of questions propounded to him by a federal grand jury.  In every respect but one, this case is a replica of Brown v. United States, 359 U. S. 41, and, as to all common issues, it is controlled by that case.  In Brown, however, we expressly declined to decide the effect of claimed ""secrecy"" upon proceedings culminating in the petitioner's sentencing for contempt, ""because the record does not show this to be the fact.""  359 U.S. at  359 U. S. 51, note 11.  Here, it appears that the contemptuous conduct, the adjudication of guilt, and the imposition of sentence all took place after the public had been excluded from the courtroom in what began and was continued as ""a Grand Jury proceeding.""  The effect of this continuing exclusion in the circumstances of the case is the sole question presented.
On the morning of April 18, 1957, pursuant to a subpoena, petitioner appeared as a witness before a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York engaged in investigating violations of the Interstate Commerce Act.  He was asked six questions relevant to the grand jury's investigation.  After consultation with his attorney, who was in an anteroom, he refused to answer them on the ground that they might tend to incriminate him.  He persisted in this refusal after having been directed to answer by the foreman of the grand jury and advised by 
Page 362 U. S. 612
 government counsel that applicable statutes gave him complete immunity from prosecution concerning any matter as to which he might testify.  See 49 U.S.C.  305(d).
Later that day the grand jury, government counsel, petitioner, and his attorney appeared before Judge Levet, sitting in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, the grand jury having sought
""the aid and assistance of the Court, in a direction to a witness, Morry Levine, who has this morning appeared before the Grand Jury and declined to answer certain questions that have been put to him.""
The record of the morning's proceedings before the grand jury was read.  After argument by counsel, the judge ruled that the adequate immunity conferred by statute deprived petitioner of the right to refuse to answer the questions put to him.  Petitioner was ordered to appear before the grand jury on April 22, and was directed by the court then to answer the questions.
On the morning of April 22, petitioner appeared before the grand jury.  The questions were again put to him, and he again refused to answer.  Once again, the grand jury, government counsel, petitioner and his counsel went before Judge Levet, for ""the assistance of the Court in regard to the witness Morry Levine.""  At this time, the record shows the following:
""The Court:  Will those who have no other business in the courtroom please leave now?  I have a Grand Jury proceeding.""
""The Clerk:  The Marshal will clear the court room.""
""(Court room cleared by the Marshals.)""
Petitioner, his counsel, the grand jury, government counsel, and the court reporter remained.  Petitioner objected to further participation by the court in the process of 
Page 362 U. S. 613
 compelling his testimony, except according to the procedures prescribed by Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  That provision, which relates to contempts generally, excluding those ""committed in the actual presence of the court"" as to which the judge certifies ""that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt,"" provides in effect for a conventional trial.  In petitioner's view, the court was compelled to regard his contempt, if any, as having already been committed out of the presence of the court, through petitioner's disobedience before the grand jury that morning of the court's order of April 18.
The judge, however, did not treat petitioner's renewed refusal to answer the grand jury's questions as a definitive contempt.  He chose to proceed just as he had two weeks earlier in the case of Brown, reviewed here as Brown v. United States, supra, 359 U. S. 41.  The morning's grand jury proceedings, showing petitioner's refusals to answer, were read, and petitioner was ordered by the judge to take the stand.  The court indicated it was proceeding as ""[t]he Court and the Grand Jury"" ""in accordance with Rule 42(a),"" which relates to the procedure in cases of contempt ""committed in the actual presence of the court.""  Over objection, the court then put to petitioner the six questions which he had refused to answer when propounded by the grand jury.  Petitioner again refused to answer these questions on the claim of the privilege against self-incrimination.  In answer to a question by the court, he stated that he would continue to refuse on that ground should the grand jury again put the questions to him.  Government counsel asked that petitioner be adjudged in contempt ""committed in the physical presence of the Judge.""  The court asked for reasons ""why I should not so adjudicate this witness in contempt.""  Petitioner's counsel made three 
Page 362 U. S. 614
 points:  (1) that the procedures had not been in accordance with ""the requirements of due process""; (2) that the procedures had not followed the requirements of Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; and (3) that, on the merits of the charge, the statutory immunity was not sufficiently extensive to deprive petitioner of his privilege not to answer.  No reference was made to the exclusion of the general public from the proceedings.  Petitioner was adjudicated in contempt and, after submission by counsel of views regarding sentence, one year's imprisonment was imposed.  The conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 267 F.2d 335, and we granted certiorari, 361 U.S. 860, limiting our grant to the question left open in Brown v. United States, namely, whether the ""secrecy"" of the proceedings offended either the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution or the public trial requirement of the Sixth Amendment.
The course of proceeding followed by the District Court in this case for compelling petitioner's testimony was the one approved in Brown.  Specifically, it was established by that case that, after petitioner had disobeyed the court's direction to answer the grand jury's questions before that body, it was proper for the court, upon application of the grand jury, (1) to disregard any contempt committed outside its presence; (2) to put the questions directly to petitioner in the court's presence as well as in the presence of the grand jury; and (3) to punish summarily under Rule 42(a) as a contempt committed ""in the actual presence of the court"" petitioner's refusal thereupon to answer.
It was surely not error for the judge initially to have cleared the courtroom on April 22 when the grand jury appeared before him for the second time seeking his ""assistance . . . in regard to the witness Morry Levine.""  
Page 362 U. S. 615
 The Secrecy of grand jury proceedings is enjoined by statute (see 18 U.S.C.  1508, and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 6(d) and (e)), and a necessary initial step in the proceedings was to read the record of the morning's grand jury proceedings.  The precise question involved in this case, therefore, is whether it was error, once the courtroom had been properly, indeed necessarily, cleared, for petitioner's contempt, summary conviction, and sentencing to occur without inviting the general public back into the courtroom.
From the very beginning of this Nation and throughout its history, the power to convict for criminal contempt has been deemed an essential and inherent aspect of the very existence of our courts.  The First Congress, out of whose 95 members 20, among them some of the most distinguished lawyers, had been members of the Philadelphia Convention, explicitly conferred the power of contempt upon the federal courts.  Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 83.  That power was recognized by this Court as early as 1812, in a striking way.  United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32,  11 U. S. 34.  As zealous a guardian of the procedural safeguards of the Bill of Rights as the first Mr. Justice Harlan, in sustaining the power summarily to punish contempts committed in the face of the court, described the power in this way:
""the offender may, in [the court's] discretion, be instantly apprehended and immediately imprisoned, without trial or issue, and without other proof than its actual knowledge of what occurred; . . . such power, although arbitrary in its nature and liable to abuse, is absolutely essential to the protection of the courts in the discharge of their functions.""
Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S. 289,  128 U. S. 313 (1888).  It is a particular exercise of this power of summary punishment of contempt committed in the court's presence which is at issue in this case.  This Court has not been wanting in 
Page 362 U. S. 616
 effective alertness to check abusive exercises of that power by federal judges.  See Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517; Offutt v. United States, 348 U. S. 11.  It would, however, be throwing the baby out with the bath to find it necessary, in the name of the Constitution, to strangle a power ""absolutely essential"" for the functioning of an independent judiciary, which is the ultimate reliance of citizens in safeguarding rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Procedural safeguards for criminal contempts do not derive from the Sixth Amendment.  Criminal contempt proceedings are not within ""all criminal prosecutions"" to which that Amendment applies.  Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S. 289,  128 U. S. 306-310; Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517,  267 U. S. 534-535; Offutt v. United States, 348 U. S. 11,  348 U. S. 14.  But while the right to a ""public trial"" is explicitly guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment only for ""criminal prosecutions,"" that provision is a reflection of the notion, deeply rooted in the common law, that ""justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.""  Offutt v. United States, 348 U. S. 11, at  348 U. S. 14.  Accordingly, due process demands appropriate regard for the requirements of a public proceeding in cases of criminal contempt, see In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, as it does for all adjudications through the exercise of the judicial power, barring narrowly limited categories of exceptions such as may be required by the exigencies of war, see Amendment to Rule 46 of the Admiralty Rules, June 8, 1942, 316 U.S. 717, revoked May 6, 1946, 328 U.S. 882, or for the protection of children, see 18 U.S.C.  5033.
Inasmuch as the petitioner's claim thus derives from the Due Process Clause, and not from one of the explicitly defined procedural safeguards of the Constitution, decision must turn on the particular circumstances of the case, and not upon a question-begging because abstract and 
Page 362 U. S. 617
 absolute right to a ""public trial.""  Cf. Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97,  291 U. S. 114-117.  The narrow question is whether, in light of the facts that the grand jury, petitioner, and his counsel were present throughout, and that petitioner never specifically made objection to the continuing so-called ""secrecy"" of the proceedings or requested that the judge open the courtroom, he was denied due process because the general public remained excluded from the courtroom.
The grand jury is an arm of the court, and its in camera proceedings constitute ""a judicial inquiry.""  Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43,  201 U. S. 66.
""The Constitution itself makes the grand jury a part of the judicial process.  It must initiate prosecution for the most important federal crimes.  It does so under general instructions from the court to which it is attached and to which, from time to time, it reports its findings.""
Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S. 323,  309 U. S. 327.  Unlike an ordinary judicial inquiry, where publicity is the rule, grand jury proceedings are secret.  In the ordinary course, therefore, contempt of the court committed through a refusal to answer questions put before the grand jury does not occur in a public proceeding.  Publicity fully satisfying the requirements of due process is achieved in such a case when a public trial upon notice is held on the charge of contempt under Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
Brown v. United States, supra, established that a grand jury as an arm of the court has available to it another course to vindicate its authority over a lawlessly recalcitrant witness.  Appeal may be made to the court under whose aegis the grand jury sits to have the witness ordered to answer the grand jury's inquiries in the judge's physical presence, so that the court's persuasive exertion to induce obedience, and its power summarily to commit for contempt should its authority be ignored, may be brought 
Page 362 U. S. 618
 to bear upon him.  Since such a summary adjudication of contempt occurs in the midst of a grand jury proceeding, a clash may arise between the interest, sanctioned by history and statute, in preserving the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, and the interest, deriving from the Due Process Clause, in preserving the public nature of court proceedings.
In the present case, grand jury secrecy freely gave way insofar as petitioner's counsel was present and was permitted to be fully active in behalf of his client throughout the proceedings before Judge Levet.  Petitioner had ample notice of the court's intention to put the grand jury's questions directly to him, and to proceed against him summarily should he persist in his refusal to answer.  Had petitioner requested, and the court denied his wish, that the courtroom be opened to the public before the final stage of these proceedings, we would have a different case.  Petitioner had no right to have the general public present while the grand jury's questions were being read.  However, after the record of the morning's grand jury proceedings had been read, and the six questions put to petitioner with a direction that he answer them in the court's presence, there was no further cause for enforcing secrecy in the sense of excluding the general public.  Having refused to answer each question in turn, and having resolved not to answer at all, petitioner then might well have insisted that, as summary punishment was to be imposed, the courtroom be opened so that the act of contempt, that is, his definitive refusal to comply with the court's direction to answer the previously propounded questions, and the consequent adjudication and sentence, might occur in public.  See Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517,  267 U. S. 534-536.  To repeat, such a claim evidently was not in petitioner's thought, and no request to open the courtroom was made at any stage of the proceedings. 
Page 362 U. S. 619

The continuing exclusion of the public in this case is not to deemed contrary to the requirements of the Due Process Clause without a request having been made to the trial judge to open the courtroom at the final stage of the proceeding, thereby giving notice of the claim now made and affording the judge an opportunity to avoid reliance on it.  This was not a case of the kind of secrecy that deprived petitioner of effective legal assistance and rendered irrelevant his failure to insist upon the claim he now makes.  Counsel was present throughout, and it is not claimed that he was not fully aware of the exclusion of the general public.  The proceedings properly began out of the public's presence, and one stage of them flowed naturally into the next.  There was no obvious point at which, in light of the presence of counsel, it can be said that the onus was imperatively upon the trial judge to interrupt the course of proceedings upon his own motion and establish a conventional public trial.  We cannot view petitioner's untenable general objection to the nature of the proceedings by invoking Rule 42(b) as constituting appropriate notice of an objection to the exclusion of the general public in the circumstances of this proceeding under Rule 42(a).
This case is wholly unlike In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257.  This is not a case where it is or could be charged that the judge deliberately enforced secrecy in order to be free of the safeguards of the public's scrutiny; nor is it urged that publicity would in the slightest have affected the conduct of the proceedings or their result.  Nor are we dealing with a situation where prejudice, attributable to secrecy, is found to be sufficiently impressive to render irrelevant failure to make a timely objection at proceedings like these.  This is obviously not such a case.  Due regard generally for the public nature of the judicial process does not require disregard of the solid demands of the fair 
Page 362 U. S. 620
 administration of justice in favor of a party who, at the appropriate time and acting under advice of counsel, saw no disregard of a right, but raises an abstract claim only as an afterthought on appeal.

In a suit by the United States, the District Court found that respondents, who operate mills for the production of iron and related products, had, without first obtaining permits from the Chief of Engineers of the Army providing conditions for their removal, discharged through sewers into a navigable river of the United States industrial waste solids which, on settling out, had substantially reduced the depth of the channel; and it enjoined them from continuing to do so and ordered them to restore the depth of the channel by removing the deposits.
Held:  on the findings of the District Court, the deposit of industrial solids in the river by respondents created an ""obstruction"" to the ""navigable capacity"" of the river forbidden by  10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899; they were discharges forbidden by, and not exempt under,  13 ; and the District Court was authorized to grant injunctive relief.

Under 18 U.S.C.  2314, three persons named Stracuzza, who admittedly were the common center of a scheme to transport stolen goods, were indicted in a single indictment with the four petitioners for transporting in interstate commerce goods known to have been stolen and having a value in excess of $5,000.  Count 1 charged two of the petitioners and the Stracuzzas with transporting stolen goods from New York to Pennsylvania; Count 2 charged another petitioner and the Stracuzzas with transporting stolen goods from New York to West Virginia; Count 3 charged another petitioner and the Stracuzzas with transporting stolen goods from New York to Massachusetts; and Count 4 charged all the defendants with a conspiracy to commit the substantive offenses.  On motion of petitioners for acquittal at the close of the Government's case, the court dismissed the conspiracy count for failure of proof; but it found that no prejudice would result from a joint trial, and submitted the substantive counts to the jury under careful detailed instructions.  Petitioners were convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that no prejudice resulted from the joint trial.
Held:   the judgments are affirmed.  Pp.  362 U. S. 512-518.
(a) The joinder of all the defendants in the original indictment was proper under Rule 8(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; even after dismissal of the conspiracy count, severance was not required under Rule 14 unless the joinder prejudiced the defendants; and, on the record, this Court cannot say that both the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in finding that petitioners were not prejudiced by a joint trial.

 Herbert A. Warren, Jr. argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Hilton R. Carr, Jr. and A. C. Dressler.

 PER CURIAM.
 
 After hearing oral argument, and further study of the record, we conclude that the record does not adequately present the questions tendered in the petition. Accordingly the writ is dismissed as improvidently granted.

 Considering the volume of cases which invoke the Court's discretionary jurisdiction - as of today 1,091 such cases have been passed on during this Term - it would be indeed surprising if in each Term there were not two or three instances of petitions which, after passing through the preliminary sifting process, did not survive the scrutiny of oral argument.

The specific questions which were presented by the petition for certiorari are not now found to be frivolous nor do they raise disputed questions of fact, nor does the record otherwise appropriately preclude answers to them. In my view they call for answers against the claims of the petitioner and I would therefore affirm the judgment. In view of the disposition of the case elaboration is not called for.

Argued May 2, 1960
Decided May 16, 1960
362 U.S. 602

Syllabus 
Alleging a course of racially discriminatory practices calculated to deprive Negro citizens of their voting rights, the United States brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief under the Civil Rights Act of 1957 against the Board of Registrars of an Alabama county, the individual members thereof and the State of Alabama.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, holding, inter alia, that the Civil Rights Act of 1957 did not authorize the action against the State.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari.  Before the case was heard in this Court, the Civil Rights Act of 1957 was amended so as expressly to authorize such actions to be brought against a State.
Held:  by virtue of that amendment, which is to be applied to this case, the District Court now has jurisdiction to entertain this action against the State.

No. 62
Argued January 19-20, 1960
Decided May 2, 1960*
362 U.S. 458

Syllabus 
The United States brought a civil antitrust action against an agricultural cooperative marketing association composed of about 2,000 Maryland and Virginia dairy farmers supplying about 86% of the milk purchased by all milk dealers in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.  The complaint charged that the association had (1) monopolized and attempted to monopolize interstate trade and commerce in fluid milk in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, in violation of  2 of the Sherman Act; (2) through contracts and agreements combined and conspired with Embassy Dairy and others to eliminate and foreclose competition in the same milk market area, in violation of  3 of the Sherman Act; and (3) bought all assets of Embassy Dairy (the largest milk dealer in the area which competed with the association's dealers), the effect of which might be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of  7 of the Clayton Act.  The District Court dismissed the charge under  2 of the Sherman Act, but it found for the Government on the charges under  3 of the Sherman Act and  7 of the Clayton Act and granted part, but not all, of the relief sought by the Government with respect to those charges.
Held:
1. Section 2 of the Capper-Volstead Act, which authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a cease and desist order upon finding that a cooperative has monopolized or restrained trade to such an extent that the price of an agricultural commodity has been ""unduly enhanced,"" does not exclude all prosecutions under the Sherman Act.  United States v. Borden Co., 308 U. S. 188.  Pp.  362 U. S. 462-463.
2. Neither  6 of the Clayton Act nor  1 of the Capper-Volstead Act leaves agricultural cooperatives free to engage in practices against others which are designed to monopolize trade or to restrain and suppress competition.  Pp.  362 U. S. 463-468. 
Page 362 U. S. 459

3. The allegations of the complaint and the statement of particulars in this case charge anticompetitive activities which are so far outside the legitimate objects of a cooperative that, if proved, they would constitute clear violations of  2 of the Sherman Act; and the District Court erred in dismissing the charge of violating  2.  P.  362 U. S. 468.
4. On the record in this case, the District Court properly found that the acquisition of Embassy Dairy by the association tended to create a monopoly or to substantially lessen competition, in violation of  7 of the Clayton Act.  Pp.  362 U. S. 468-469.
5. The acquisition of Embassy Dairy by the association was not exempted from the provisions of  7 of the Clayton Act by the last paragraph of that section, since there is no ""statutory provision"" that vests power in the Secretary of Agriculture to approve a transaction, and thereby exempt a cooperative from the antitrust laws under the circumstances of this case, which involves no agricultural marketing agreement with the Secretary.  Pp.  362 U. S. 469-470.
6. The privilege the Capper-Volstead Act grants producers to conduct their affairs collectively does not include a privilege to combine with competitors so as to use a monopoly position as a lever further to suppress competition by and among independent producers and processors, and the record sustains the District Court's finding that the association had violated  3 of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  362 U. S. 470-472.
7. Having entered a decree ordering the association to divest itself of all assets acquired from Embassy Dairy and to cancel all contracts ancillary to their acquisition, and having retained jurisdiction to grant such further relief as might be appropriate, the District Court did not err in denying part of the relief sought by the Government.  Pp.  362 U. S. 472-473.

Acting under statutory authority to levy, distrain or seize property or rights to property belonging to a delinquent taxpayer, a District Director of Internal Revenue served notices of levy on a city demanding that it pay to him money alleged to be due from the city to a contractor for construction work.  The surety on the contractor's performance and payment bonds then instituted a summary proceeding in a Federal District Court to have the levy quashed, claiming that the money was due to it, instead of to the contractor, since the surety had been compelled to complete performance of the contract when the contractor defaulted.
Held:   the District Court was without jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties in a summary proceeding.  Pp.  362 U. S. 405-410.
(a) Especially when a controversy like this is begun by peremptory seizure without an initial determination of the taxpayer's liability, there is neither justification nor authority for carving out an exception to the uniform and regular civil procedure laid down by the Federal Rules, either for the benefit of the party from whom the property was seized or for any other claimant.  Pp.  362 U. S. 406-408.

362 U.S. 404

Syllabus 
Acting under statutory authority to levy, distrain or seize property or rights to property belonging to a delinquent taxpayer, a District Director of Internal Revenue served notices of levy on a city demanding that it pay to him money alleged to be due from the city to a contractor for construction work.  The surety on the contractor's performance and payment bonds then instituted a summary proceeding in a Federal District Court to have the levy quashed, claiming that the money was due to it, instead of to the contractor, since the surety had been compelled to complete performance of the contract when the contractor defaulted.
Held:   the District Court was without jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties in a summary proceeding.  Pp.  362 U. S. 405-410.

Syllabus 
An interstate railroad applied to the public utility commissions of four States for permission to abolish or consolidate many of its little-used stations.  The labor union which was the bargaining agent of the station agents and telegraphers whose jobs would be abolished notified the railroad under  6 of the Railway Labor Act of a desire to negotiate for an amendment to its current bargaining agreement which would prevent the railroad from abolishing any position without the union's consent, and it threatened to strike if the railroad refused to negotiate about the amendment.  The railroad sued in a Federal District Court to enjoin such a strike.
Held:  the case involves or grows out of a ""labor dispute"" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, and the District Court was without jurisdiction to enjoin the strike permanently.  Pp.  362 U. S. 331-343.
(a) This controversy was a ""labor dispute,"" as defined in  13(c) of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  Pp.  362 U. S. 335-338.
(b) The strike here involved could not be enjoined on the theory that it was unlawful for the union to seek to bargain about the consolidation or abandonment of railroad stations, which are within the control of state regulatory commissions.  Pp.  362 U. S. 338-341.

Syllabus 
1. While petitioner was in an apartment which he testified later was not his, but that of a friend who permitted him to use it, the apartment was searched by federal officers armed with a search warrant, narcotics were found and seized, and petitioner was arrested and charged with violating the narcotics laws.  He moved to suppress the evidence so seized on the ground that the search was illegal.  Held:  Petitioner was a ""person aggrieved"" within the meaning of Rule 41 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and he had standing to make the motion under that Rule.  Pp.  362 U. S. 260-267.
2. Issuance of the search warrant here involved was based solely on an affidavit by a federal narcotics officer reciting that:  (1) he had received information from an unnamed informer that petitioner and another person were involved in illicit narcotics traffic and kept a supply of heroin on hand in the apartment and that the informer had purchased narcotics from them in the apartment; (2) information previously received from this informer had been correct; (3) the same information had been received from other sources; (4) petitioner and his associate were known to be drug addicts; and (5) the affiant believed that illicit drugs were being secreted in the apartment by petitioner and another person.  Held:  This was sufficient evidence of probable cause to justify issuance of the search warrant.  Pp.  362 U. S. 267-272.
3. Without having done so in the District Court, petitioner attacked in the Court of Appeals the legality of the search, on the ground that the warrant was not executed in conformity with 18 U.S.C.  3109.  The Court of Appeals fully considered the claim, and rejected it.  The Government did not contend that the issue was not properly before this Court.  Held:  The question is open to decision by this Court, but it cannot be resolved satisfactorily on the record.

 March 28, 1960
 Messrs. Roger Hinds and Frank C. Mebane, Jr., for petitioners. 
 Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Doub and Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal for respondent Butler. Messrs. Louis J. Lefkowitz, Atty. Gen. of New York, and Paxton Blair, Sol. Gen. for respondent Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of State of New York. 
 The motion to substitute a party respondent is withdrawn pursuant to stipulation of counsel. Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS dissenting: 
 In my view the issues involved in this case are of such great public importance that I record my dissent to the denial of certiorari. The petitioners in this case are residents of a heavily populated suburban area in Long Island, New York, who brought an action in 1957 to enjoin respondents, federal and state officials, from carrying out a threatened program of aerial spraying of their lands, homes, gardens, and orchards with a mixture of DDT and kerosene designed to eradicate the gypsy moth, an insect injurious to forests. The program is part of a campaign embarked in 1956 by the Department of Agriculture to spray more than 3,000,000 acres of land in 10 States. 
 Petitioners alleged in their complaint that the threatened spraying was unauthorized by statute and so injurious to health and property as to violate the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. 
 The District Court denied a motion for preliminary injunction on May 24, 1957. 151 F.Supp. 786. Pending trial petitioners' homes, persons and lands received the spray. Respondents then contended that, because 
Page 362 U.S. 929 , 930
 they had completed the spraying, the request for an injunction had become moot. 
 At the trial numerous experts testified to the public need for the spraying and the feasible methods available for the eradication of the gypsy moth. petitioners attempted to adduce evidence that the use of multi- engine airplanes was unnecessary, that their property had not been infested with the moths, and that the use of ground spraying equipment and helicopters was a feasible means of avoiding uninfested areas with the spray. 
 Expert witnesses testified that the spraying of pastures with the mixture, which consisted of one pound of DDT in one gallon of kerosene base solvent, applied at the rate of one gallon per acre, inevitably produce measurable quantities of DDT in milk from cattle which feed on the pastures, and that crops1 which have been sprayed by DDT should not be fed to cattle. Nevertheless, dairy farms, pastures, homes, gardens, orchards, swimming pools, and fish ponds received the spray; and in some cases, it seems, they received substantially more than the planned one gallon per acre. 
 There was evidence that one of the petitioners who sells milk from her dairy had measurable contamination in the milk as late as five months after the spraying, which made its sale illegal under both federal and state regulations. 
 There was evidence that the vegetables grown by one of the petitioners for family use were rendered inedible and the leaves on some of his vines turned brown, rotted and fell off as a result of the spraying. Another petitioner, who spent $13,000 developing her land for chemical- free food production, testified that after the planes came over her plants were damaged and the fruit was withered, making it inedible. Several other petitioners complained that their fruits, vegetables, and berries were made unfit to eat. [362 U.S. 929 , 931]

362 U.S. 145

Syllabus 
Under 28 U.S.C.  1346(a)(1), a Federal District Court does not have jurisdiction of an action by a taxpayer for refund of a part payment made by him on an assessment for an alleged deficiency in his income tax.  The taxpayer must pay the full amount of the assessment before he may challenge its validity in an action under 1346(a)(1).  Flora v. United States, 357 U. S. 63, reaffirmed.  Pp.  362 U. S. 146-177.
(a) The language of  1346(a)(1) can more readily be construed to require payment of the full tax before suit than to permit suit for recovery of a part payment.  Pp.  362 U. S. 148-151.
(b) The legislative history of  1346(a)(1) is barren of any clue to the congressional intent on this issue; but that section is a jurisdictional provision which is a keystone in a carefully articulated and quite complicated structure of tax laws; since enactment of its precursor in 1921, Congress has several times acted upon the assumption that  1346(a)(1) requires full payment before suit; and any evidence of a contrary intent is too weak and insubstantial to justify destroying the existing harmony of the tax statutes.  Pp.  362 U. S. 151-158.
(c) In establishing the Board of Tax Appeals (now the Tax Court), Congress acted upon the assumption that full payment of the tax assessed was a condition precedent for bringing suit for refund in a District Court, and it chose to establish the Board as a different forum where the validity of an assessment could be litigated without prior payment in full.  Pp.  362 U. S. 158-163.
(d) To permit such a suit in a District Court would be inconsistent with the purpose of  405 of the Revenue Act of 1935, which amended the Declaratory Judgment Act so as to except disputes ""with respect to Federal taxes.""  Pp.  362 U. S. 164-165.
(e) To permit such a suit in a District Court would generate the very problems which Congress believed it had solved by  7422(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.  Pp.  362 U. S. 165-167.
(f) A different conclusion is not required by the administrative practice prior to 1940, nor by a few inconsequential exceptions to 
Page 362 U. S. 146
 the otherwise uniform belief prior to 1940 that full payment had to precede suit in a District Court for refund.  Pp.  362 U. S. 167-175.
(g) Requiring taxpayers to pay assessments in full before suing in a District Court will not necessarily subject them to undue hardships, since they may appeal to the Tax Court without first paying anything.  Pp.  362 U. S. 175-177.

 PER CURIAM.
 
 The writ of certiorari was improvidently granted and must be dismissed. When the case was brought here, on the meager documentation which so often is all that is presented by indigent prisoners seeking review on their own behalf, we assumed that a question involving the construction of 28 U.S.C. 2255 called for adjudication. After argument, it became clear that the question of construction is not appropriately presented by the record because petitioner's claim upon the merits was fully considered and decided below, and we find his challenge of that action to be so insubstantial as not to have warranted bringing the case here.

Argued December 9-10, 1959
Decided March 7, 1960
362 U.S. 73

Syllabus 
Appellants who are engaged in the business of growing, packing and marketing Florida avocados in interstate commerce, sued in a Federal District Court to enjoin appellees, state officers of California, from enforcing  792 of the California Agricultural Code, which prohibits the importation or sale in California of avocados containing less than 8% of oil by weight.  Appellants claimed that  792 violated the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal Constitution, as well as the Federal Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and Florida Avocado Order No. 69 issued thereunder.  A three-judge District Court convened to hear the case dismissed the action, and a direct appeal was taken to this Court.
Held:
1. Since the complaint sought an injunction against enforcement of the state statute on grounds of federal unconstitutionality, the action was required to be heard by a three-judge District Court under 28 U.S.C.  2281, and this Court has jurisdiction of this direct appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1253 -- notwithstanding the fact that the complaint also alleged that the state statute conflicted with the federal Act.  Pp.  362 U. S. 75-85.
2. In view of the allegation of the complaint that appellants have made more than a score of shipments of Florida avocados to California and that appellees have consistently condemned them for failure to contain 8% or more of oil by weight, thus forcing appellants to reship them and sell them in other States to prevent their destruction and complete loss, there is an existing dispute between the parties as to present legal rights amounting to a justiciable controversy; and the fact that appellants did not contest the validity of  792 or seek abatement of appellees' condemnation of the avocados in California state courts does not bar their right

 to seek an injunction in the federal courts against its enforcement on the ground that it violates both the Federal Constitution and the Federal Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.  Pp.  362 U. S. 85-86.

Syllabus 
Petitioners, when employees of a California County, were subpoenaed by and appeared before a Subcommittee of the House Un-American Activities Committee, but, in violation of specific orders of the County Board of Supervisors and the requirements of 1028.1 of the Government Code of California, refused to answer certain questions concerning subversion.  The County discharged them on grounds of insubordination and violation of 1028.1.  Nelson, a permanent employee, was given a Civil Service Commission hearing, which resulted in confirmation of his discharge.  Globe, a temporary employee, was denied a hearing, since he was not entitled to it under the applicable rules.  Both sued for reinstatement, contending that 1028.1 and their discharges violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but their discharges were affirmed by a California State Court.
Held:
1. In Nelson's case, the judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court.  P.  362 U. S. 4.
2. Globe's discharge did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the judgment in his case is affirmed.  Pp.  362 U. S. 4-9.

Syllabus 
Under authority of R.S.  2004, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the Attorney General brought this civil action on behalf of the United States in a Federal District Court to enjoin certain public officials of the State of Georgia from discriminating against Negro citizens who desired to register to vote in elections in Georgia.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that subsection (c), which authorizes the Attorney General to bring such an action, is unconstitutional.  Although the complaint involved only official actions, the Court construed subsection (c) as authorizing suits to enjoin purely private actions, and held that this went beyond the permissible scope of the Fifteenth Amendment, and that the Act must be considered unconstitutional in all its applications.  On direct appeal to this Court, held:  the judgment is reversed.  Pp.  362 U. S. 19-28.
1. The case is properly here on direct appeal under 28 U.S. C. 1252, since the basis of the decision below was that the Act of Congress was unconstitutional, no matter what the contentions of the parties might be as to what its proper basis should have been.  P.  362 U. S. 20.
2. The District Court erred in dismissing the complaint on the theory that the Act would exceed the permissible limits of the Fifteenth Amendment if applied to purely private actions by private persons, since that question was not properly before that Court on the record in this case.  Pp.  362 U. S. 20-24.
(a) One to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack it on the ground that it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional.  P.  362 U. S. 21.
(b) The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases.  P.  362 U. S. 22.
(c) In this case, there are no countervailing considerations sufficient to warrant the District Court's action in considering the 
Page 362 U. S. 18
 constitutionality of this Act in applications not presented by the facts before it.  Pp.  362 U. S. 22-24.
(d) To the extent that United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, depended on an approach inconsistent with what this Court considers the better one and the one established by the weightiest of the subsequent cases, it cannot be followed here.  P.  362 U. S. 24.
3. Insofar as it authorizes the Attorney General to bring this action to enjoin racial discrimination by public officials in the performance of their official duties pertaining to elections, the Act is clearly constitutional.  Pp.  362 U. S. 24-28.
(a) Whatever precisely may be the reach of the Fifteenth Amendment, the conduct charged here -- discrimination by state officials, within the course of their official duties, against the voting rights of citizens, on grounds of race or color -- is certainly subject to the ban of that Amendment, and legislation designed to deal with such discrimination is ""appropriate legislation"" under it.  P.  362 U. S. 25.
(b) It cannot be said that appellees' action was not ""state action"" merely because the aggrieved parties had not exhausted their administrative or other remedies under state law, since Congress has power to provide for the correction of the constitutional violations of every state official, high and low, without regard to the presence of other authority in the State that might possibly revise their actions.

362 U.S. 29

Syllabus 
In a civil suit under  4 of the Sherman Act charging appellee with combining and conspiring to maintain resale prices of its products in areas which have no ""fair trade"" laws, the Government introduced evidence showing that appellee had (1) announced a policy of refusing to deal with retailers who failed to observe appellee's suggested minimum resale prices or who advertised discount prices on. appellee's products, (2) discontinued direct sales to those retailers who failed to abide by the announced policy, (3) induced wholesale distributors to stop selling appellee's products to the offending retailers, (4) secured unanimous adherence by informing a number of the retailers that, if each of them would adhere to the announced policy, one of their principal competitors would also do so, and (5) permitted the retailers to resume purchasing its products after they had indicated willingness to observe the policy.  The evidence further established that appellee had terminated these practices after becoming aware that the Department of Justice had begun an investigation of its price maintenance activities.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the Government had not shown a right to relief.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case remanded with directions to enter an appropriate judgment enjoining appellee from further violations of the Sherman Act, unless it elects to submit evidence in defense and refutes the Government's right to injunctive relief established by the present record.  Pp.  362 U. S. 30-49.
(a) The District Court erred in holding that these practices constituted only unilateral action by appellee in selecting its customers, as permitted by United States v. Colgate  Co., 250 U. S. 300.  Appellee did not merely announce its policy and then decline to have further dealings with retailers who failed to abide by it, but, by utilizing wholesalers and other retailers, it actively induced unwilling retailers to comply with the policy.  The resulting concerted action to maintain the resale prices constituted a conspiracy or combination in violation of the Sherman Act, although it was not based on any contract, express or implied . Pp.  362 U. S. 36-47. 
Page 362 U. S. 30

(b) Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not require affirmance of the District Court's ultimate finding that respondent did not violate the Sherman Act, because that conclusion was based on an erroneous interpretation of the law.  Pp.  362 U. S. 43-45.
(e) The District Court's alternative holding that dismissal of the complaint was warranted because there was no reasonable probability that appellee would resume its attempts to maintain resale prices is erroneous, because it is not supported by the evidence.  Pp.  362 U. S. 47-48.

In a civil suit under  4 of the Sherman Act charging appellee with combining and conspiring to maintain resale prices of its products in areas which have no ""fair trade"" laws, the Government introduced evidence showing that appellee had (1) announced a policy of refusing to deal with retailers who failed to observe appellee's suggested minimum resale prices or who advertised discount prices on. appellee's products, (2) discontinued direct sales to those retailers who failed to abide by the announced policy, (3) induced wholesale distributors to stop selling appellee's products to the offending retailers, (4) secured unanimous adherence by informing a number of the retailers that, if each of them would adhere to the announced policy, one of their principal competitors would also do so, and (5) permitted the retailers to resume purchasing its products after they had indicated willingness to observe the policy.  The evidence further established that appellee had terminated these practices after becoming aware that the Department of Justice had begun an investigation of its price maintenance activities.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the Government had not shown a right to relief.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case remanded with directions to enter an appropriate judgment enjoining appellee from further violations of the Sherman Act, unless it elects to submit evidence in defense and refutes the Government's right to injunctive relief established by the present record.  Pp.  362 U. S. 30-49.
(a) The District Court erred in holding that these practices constituted only unilateral action by appellee in selecting its customers, as permitted by United States v. Colgate  Co., 250 U. S. 300.  Appellee did not merely announce its policy and then decline to have further dealings with retailers who failed to abide by it, but, by utilizing wholesalers and other retailers, it actively induced unwilling retailers to comply with the policy.  The resulting concerted action to maintain the resale prices constituted a conspiracy or combination in violation of the Sherman Act, although it was not based on any contract, express or implied . Pp.  362 U. S. 36-47. 
Page 362 U. S. 30

(b) Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not require affirmance of the District Court's ultimate finding that respondent did not violate the Sherman Act, because that conclusion was based on an erroneous interpretation of the law.  Pp.  362 U. S. 43-45.
(e) The District Court's alternative holding that dismissal of the complaint was warranted because there was no reasonable probability that appellee would resume its attempts to maintain resale prices is erroneous, because it is not supported by the evidence.  Pp.  362 U. S. 47-48.

Syllabus 
Under authority of R.S.  2004, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the Attorney General brought a civil action on behalf of the United States in a United States District Court to enjoin certain individuals from challenging, on a racially discriminatory basis, the right of certain Negro citizens to remain on the registration rolls of a Louisiana parish as qualified voters, and to enjoin respondent, the official Registrar of Voters, from giving effect to such racially discriminatory challenges and removing their names from the rolls.  The District Court denied defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint; found that the challenges were ""massively discriminatory in purpose and effect"" and in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment and of 42 U.S.C.  1971(a); enjoined the individual defendants from making further racially discriminatory challenges; enjoined respondent from giving legal effect to any of said challenges; and ordered respondent to restore to the registration rolls those so illegally removed.  Upon appeal by respondent, the Court of Appeals granted a stay of the injunction pending appeal.  The Solicitor General then applied to this Court to vacate the stay and for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the District Court.
Held:  certiorari is granted, and, upon the opinion, findings of fact and conclusions of law of the District Court and the decision of this Court today in United States v. Raines, ante, p.  362 U.

361 U.S. 376

Syllabus 
Under Art. 5248 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, as amended in 1950, which pertains to taxation of private users of property of the United States, a Texas School District assessed against appellant a tax measured by the full value of real property owned by the United States but leased to appellant for use in its private manufacturing business under a lease subject to termination at the option of the United States in the event of a national emergency or a sale of the property.  The Texas Supreme Court construed Art. 5248 as authorizing this assessment against appellant, but it had construed Art. 7173, which governs taxation of private lessees of real property owned by the State and its political subdivisions, as not authorizing taxation of a lessee under a lease subject to termination at the lessor's option in the event of a sale.
Held:  as construed and applied in this case, Art. 5248 discriminates unconstitutionally against the United States and its lessees, and the tax levied against appellant is invalid. Pp. 377-387.
(a) Since Texas law authorizes taxation of lessees of federal property, but not lessees of property of the State or one of its political subdivisions, when the leases are subject to termination at the option of the lessors, it discriminates against the United States and its lessees.  Pp.  361 U. S. 379-382.
(b) Such discrimination between lessees of federal property and lessees of state property is not justified by any significant difference between them.  United States v. City of Detroit, 355 U. S. 466, distinguished.  Pp.  361 U. S. 383-387.

Syllabus 
The National Labor Relations Board petitioned the Court of Appeals to adjudge respondents in civil contempt for refusing to pay certain amounts of backpay due to various employees as a result of their discriminatory discharge by respondent, Deena Artware, which is one of several subsidiaries wholly owned, except for qualifying shares, by a parent corporation which, in turn, is wholly owned, except for qualifying shares, by an individual who serves as president and treasurer.  He and his wife, son, and secretary, constitute all of the officers and directors of the parent corporation and each of the subsidiaries.  The Board alleged that, (1) between the date of entry of a decree of the Court of Appeals enforcing the Board's original backpay order and the Court's entry of a supplemental decree approving the Board's determination of the specific amounts of backpay due, respondents had siphoned off the assets of Deena Artware for the purpose of avoiding payment of any backpay found to be due and owing, and (2) that respondents are integral parts of a single enterprise, and, as such, were and are answerable to the Court's decrees, which explicitly run against Deena Artware and its officers, agents, successors and assigns.  The Board also moved for discovery, inspection and depositions.  Without considering the Board's contention that the various corporate respondents were in fact ""a single enterprise,"" the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition and denied the Board's motion for discovery, inspection, and depositions on the ground that, at the time of the alleged siphoning of assets, its decree was not sufficiently definite and mandatory to serve as a basis for contempt proceedings.

In 1953, petitioner and one Seijas were indicted for conspiring from 1942 to 1953 to attempt to evade income taxes of Seijas and his wife for the years 1942 through 1945.  Petitioner contended that the conspiracy was consummated in 1946, when the return for 1945 was filed, and that prosecution was barred by the 6-year statute of limitations, and he requested and obtained instructions that the jury must acquit him unless it found that there was a subsidiary conspiracy, continuing to within 6 years of the indictment, to conceal the first conspiracy.  He was convicted.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that a subsidiary conspiracy cannot extend the statute of limitations which had run against the main conspiracy, and it ordered the case remanded with directions to enter a judgment of acquittal.  On rehearing, however, it decided that petitioner might have been tried on the theory that the original conspiracy continued until 1952, and it ordered the case remanded for a new trial.
Held:  this did not subject petitioner to double jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  361 U. S. 417-426.
(a) The theory on which the case was tried and upon which an instruction should have been given was that there was a continuing conspiracy from 1942 to 1953 to evade income taxes by concealing income, and that this objective was not consummated in 1946 when the 1945 return was filed.  Pp.  361 U. S. 422-424.
(b) The fact that the Court of Appeals had originally ordered entry of a judgment of acquittal did not deprive it of the power to amend that direction on rehearing and order a new trial, in the exercise of its power under 28 U.S.C.  2106 to ""require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.""

Syllabus 
An information filed in a Federal District Court charged appellees with having violated 19 U.S.C.  1304 by removing from ten violins imported from the Soviet Zone of Germany, after their importation but prior to their sale to ultimate purchasers, labels reading ""Germany/USSR Occupied,"" with intent to conceal the identity of the country of origin.  The District Court dismissed the information on the ground that removal of the labels did not violate  1304, because the applicable regulation appeared to require the Soviet Zone marking for tariff purposes only, rather than to apprise the ultimate purchasers of the place of origin, and also that the regulation was not sufficiently clear and unambiguous to justify a criminal prosecution.  The Government appealed to the Court of Appeals, which held that the order of dismissal was appealable directly to this Court under 18 U.S.C.  3731 because (a) the District Court's interpretation of the regulation was tantamount to a construction of the statute upon which the information was founded, and (b) the effect of the dismissal was to sustain a motion in bar.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals certified the case to this Court.
Held:
1. The charges in the information are founded on  1304 and the regulations thereunder; the information was dismissed solely because its allegations did not state an offense under  1304, as amplified by the regulations; the statute and regulations are so inextricably intertwined that an interpretation of the regulations necessarily is a construction of the statute, and the case was properly certified to this Court by the Court of Appeals under 18 U.S.C.  3731.  Pp.  361 U. S. 434-438.
2. The regulation here involved appears to be aimed at the collection of duties, rather than the protection of ultimate purchasers in the United States; it is not sufficiently clear and unambiguous to furnish a basis for a criminal prosecution for violation of 19 U.S.C.  1304; and the information was properly dismissed.

Respondent withheld royalties in an amount claimed to equal damages which it had sustained as a result of strikes alleged to be in violation of the same agreement, and the trustees sued to recover such royalties.  Respondent defended on the ground that performance of its duty to pay the royalties to the trustees, as third-party beneficiaries of the agreement, was excused when the union violated the agreement, and it cross-claimed against the union for damages resulting from the strikes.  The District Court awarded respondent a judgment on its claim against the union and awarded the trustees a judgment for the unpaid royalties, but provided that the trustees' judgment should be paid only out of the proceeds of respondent's judgment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed except as to the amount of the damages awarded respondent.
Held:
1. So far as it sustains the holding of the District Court that the union violated the collective bargaining agreement, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed by an equally divided Court.  P.  361 U. S. 464.
2. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is modified to provide that the District Court shall amend the judgment in favor of the trustees to allow immediate and unconditional execution, and interest, on the full amount of the trustees' judgment against respondent.  Pp.  361 U. S. 464-471. 
Page 361 U. S. 460

(a) The collective bargaining agreement here involved is not to be construed as making performance by the union of its promises a condition precedent to respondent's promise to pay royalties to the trustees, notwithstanding a provision to the effect that the agreement ""is an integrated instrument and its provisions are interdependent.""  Pp.  361 U. S. 464-466.
(b) Regardless of the inferences which may be drawn from other third-party beneficiary contracts, the parties to a collective bargaining agreement must express their meaning in unequivocal words before they can be said to have agreed that the union's breaches of its promises should give rise to a defense against the duty assumed by an employer to contribute to a welfare fund meeting the requirements of  302(c)(5), and the agreement here involved contains no such words.

No. 15

Decided February 23, 1960
361 U.S. 477

Syllabus 
On a complaint before the National Labor Relations Board charging that a union had refused to bargain in good faith with an employer in violation of  8(b)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, it appeared that the union had conferred with the employer at the bargaining table for the purpose and with the desire of reaching an agreement on contract terms, but that, during the negotiations, it had sponsored concerted on-the-job activities by its members of a harassing nature designed to interfere with the conduct of the employer's business, for the avowed purpose of putting economic pressure on the employer to accede to the union's bargaining demands.
Held:  Such tactics would not support a finding by the Board that the union had failed to bargain in good faith as required by  8(b)(3).  Pp.  361 U. S. 478-500.
(1) The basic premise of the duty of collective bargaining required in the Act is that it is a process in which the parties deal with each other in a serious, good-faith desire to reach agreement and to enter into a contract ordering their industrial relationship.  Congress did not intend that the Board control the substantive terms of collective bargaining contracts through the administration of this requirement, and it added  8(d) in the Taft-Hartley Act to make the proper construction of the duty clear.  Pp.  361 U. S. 483-487.
(2) By adding  8(b)(3) to the Act through the Taft-Hartley amendments, Congress intended to require of unions the same standard of good faith in collective bargaining that it had already required of employers.  P.  361 U. S. 487.
(3) Section 8(b)(3) does not authorize the Board to infer a lack of good faith in bargaining on the part of a union solely because the union resorts to tactics designed to exert economic pressure during the negotiations.  Pp.  361 U. S. 488-490.
(4) The use of economic pressure is not inconsistent with the duty of bargaining in good faith, and the Board is not empowered under  8(b)(3) to distinguish among various union economic 
Page 361 U. S. 478
 weapons and to brand those here involved inconsistent with good faith collective bargaining.  Pp.  361 U. S. 490-496.
(a) A different conclusion is not required on the theory that a total strike is a concerted activity protected against employer interference by  7 and 8(a)(1) of the Act, whereas the activity here involved is not a protected concerted activity.  Even if an activity is not protected against disciplinary action, that does not necessarily mean that it amounts to a refusal to bargain in good faith.  Pp.  361 U. S. 492-495.
(b) A different conclusion is not required on the theory that, because an orthodox ""total"" strike is ""traditional,"" its use must be taken as being consistent with  8(b)(3); whereas the tactics here involved are not ""traditional"" or ""normal,"" and therefore need not be so viewed.  Pp.  361 U. S. 495-496.
(5) To construe  8(b)(3) as authorizing the Board to act as an arbiter of the sort of economic weapons the parties can use in seeking to gain acceptance of their bargaining demands would inject the Board into the substantive aspects of the bargaining process to an extent that Congress did not intend and has not authorized.  Pp.  361 U. S. 496-500.

Petitioners, custodians of the records of local branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, were tried, convicted and fined for violating identical occupational license tax ordinances of two Arkansas cities by refusing to furnish the city officials with lists of the names of the members of the local branches of the Association.
Held:  On the record in this case, compulsory disclosure of the membership lists would work unjustified interference with the members' freedom of association, which is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by the States; and the convictions are reversed.  Pp.  361 U. S. 517-527.
(a) It is now beyond dispute that freedom of association for the purpose of advancing ideas and airing grievances is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by the States.  Pp.  361 U. S. 522-523.
(b) On the record in this case, it sufficiently appears that compulsory disclosure of the membership lists of the local branches of the Association would work a significant interference with the freedom of association of their members.  Pp.  361 U. S. 523-524.
(c) The cities here, as instrumentalities of the State, have not demonstrated so cogent an interest in obtaining and making public the membership lists of these organizations as to justify the substantial abridgment of associational freedom which such disclosures would effect, since the record discloses no relevant correlation between the power of the municipalities to impose occupational license taxes and the compulsory disclosure and publication of these membership lists.

361 U.S. 363

Syllabus 
Proceeding under a Missouri statute, the Governor of Missouri found that the public interest, health, and welfare were jeopardized by an existing strike against a public utility in the State, and issued executive orders taking possession of the company and directing that it continue operations.  Pursuant to the statute, a state court enjoined continuation of the strike.  The strike was then terminated, a new labor agreement was entered into between the unions and the company, and the Governor ended the seizure.  On appeal from the injunction decree, the Supreme Court of Missouri noted that the injunction had ""expired by its own terms,"" but it proceeded to sustain the constitutionality of those sections of the statute authorizing the seizure, forbidding continuation of a strike after seizure, and authorizing the state courts to enjoin violations of the Act.  On appeal to this Court,
Held:  since the injunction has long since expired by its own terms, the cause has become moot.  Pp.  361 U. S. 364-371.
(a) Because the injunction has long since ""expired by its own terms,"" there remains for this Court no actual matter in controversy essential to a decision of this case.  Harris v. Battle, 348 U.S. 803.  Pp.  361 U. S. 367-369.
(b) Life is not given to this appeal by the fact that the statute contains provisions which impose (1) monetary penalties upon labor unions which continue a strike after seizure, and (2) loss of seniority for employees participating in such a strike; since the Supreme Court of Missouri found that those separable provisions of the Act were not involved in this case, it carefully refrained from passing on their validity, and they are not properly before this Court in this case.  Pp.  361 U. S. 369-371.

Argued November 16, 1959

361 U.S. 288

Syllabus 
In an action by the Secretary of Labor under  17 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, to restrain violations of  15(a)(3), a district court has jurisdiction to order an employer to reimburse employees unlawfully discharged or otherwise discriminated against for wages lost because of that discharge or discrimination.  Pp.  361 U. S. 289-296.
(a) The jurisdiction conferred by  17 is not to be narrowly construed as including only the powers expressly conferred or necessarily implied from its language.  The jurisdiction is equitable, and includes the power to provide complete relief in the light of the statutory purpose.  Pp.  361 U. S. 290-292.
(b) By the proscription of retaliatory acts set forth in  15(a)(3) and its enforcement in equity by the Secretary under  17, Congress sought to foster a climate in which compliance with the Act would be enhanced.  P.  361 U. S. 292.
(c) The Act should not be construed as enabling employees to resort to statutory remedies to obtain restitution of partial deficiencies in wages due for past work, only at the risk of irremediable loss of entire pay for an unpredictable future period.  Pp.  361 U. S. 292-293.
(d) The proviso added to  17 by the 1949 amendment, which disabled courts in actions under  17 from awarding ""unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation or an additional equal amount as liquidated damages,"" was not intended to apply to reimbursement of lost wages incident to wrongful discharge.

Pp.  361 U. S. 289-296.
(a) The jurisdiction conferred by  17 is not to be narrowly construed as including only the powers expressly conferred or necessarily implied from its language.  The jurisdiction is equitable, and includes the power to provide complete relief in the light of the statutory purpose.  Pp.  361 U. S. 290-292.
(b) By the proscription of retaliatory acts set forth in  15(a)(3) and its enforcement in equity by the Secretary under  17, Congress sought to foster a climate in which compliance with the Act would be enhanced.  P.  361 U. S. 292.
(c) The Act should not be construed as enabling employees to resort to statutory remedies to obtain restitution of partial deficiencies in wages due for past work, only at the risk of irremediable loss of entire pay for an unpredictable future period.  Pp.  361 U. S. 292-293.
(d) The proviso added to  17 by the 1949 amendment, which disabled courts in actions under  17 from awarding ""unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation or an additional equal amount as liquidated damages,"" was not intended to apply to reimbursement of lost wages incident to wrongful discharge.  Pp.  361 U. S. 293-296.
260 F.2d 929 reversed.

Argued November 12, 1959

361 U.S. 340

Syllabus 
Basing her claim alternatively on unseaworthiness and on negligence, petitioner brought this libel in admiralty to recover under the West Virginia Wrongful Death Act from the owner of a river barge for the death of an employee of an independent contractor engaged in repairing the barge, who fell off the barge and drowned in navigable waters in West Virginia.  The District Court found that the vessel was unseaworthy and that the barge owner was negligent.  Basing liability on negligence, it awarded petitioner the maximum amount of damages allowable under the West Virginia Wrongful Death Act.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's finding of negligence and held that the vessel was not unseaworthy and that the decedent was not a person to whom the warranty of seaworthiness was owed; but it did not pass on the question whether unseaworthiness would, in any event, be available as a ground for recovery in a West Virginia wrongful death action involving a maritime tort.
Held:  The judgment is vacated, and the cause is remanded to the Court of Appeals to determine:  (a) whether the West Virginia Wrongful Death Act, as to this maritime tort, employs the West Virginia or the general maritime law concept of negligence; (b) whether, in the light of that determination, the District Court's finding as to negligence is correct under the proper substantive law, and (c) whether the West Virginia Wrongful Death Act incorporates the doctrine of unseaworthiness in death actions involving maritime torts.

No. 50
Argued December 10, 1959
Decided January 11, 1960
361 U.S. 199

Syllabus 
After having been discharged from the Armed Forces because of permanent mental disability, and during an unauthorized absence from a Veterans' hospital where he had been classified as 100% ""incompetent,"" petitioner was arrested on a charge of robbery.  After eight or nine hours of sustained interrogation in a small room which was at times filled with police officers, he signed a confession written for him by a Deputy Sheriff.  Shortly thereafter, he exhibited symptoms of insanity and, after proceedings prescribed by state law, he was found insane and committed to a state mental hospital.  Over four years later, he was declared mentally competent to stand trial, and was tried in a state court on the robbery charge.  His confession was admitted in evidence over his objection, and he was convicted.
Held:  the record clearly establishes that the confession most probably was not the product of any meaningful act of volition, and its use in obtaining petitioner's conviction deprived him of his liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  361 U. S. 200-211.
(a) Though it is possible that petitioner confessed during a period of complete mental competence, the evidence here establishes the strongest probability that he was insane and incompetent at the time he allegedly confessed.  Pp.  361 U. S. 207-208.
(b) On the record in this case, there was not such a conflict in the evidence as to require this Court to accept the trial judge's conclusion that the confession was voluntary.  Pp.  361 U. S. 208-209.
(c) Where the involuntariness of a confession is conclusively demonstrated at any stage of a trial, the defendant is deprived of due process by its use in obtaining his conviction -- even though important evidence concerning the involuntariness of the confession was not introduced until after admission of the confession into evidence and the defendant's counsel did not request reconsideration of that ruling.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was indicted and convicted in a Federal District Court for interfering with interstate commerce by extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C.  1951.  The only interstate commerce mentioned in the indictment was the importation into Pennsylvania of sand to be used in building a steel plant there, but the trial judge permitted the introduction of evidence to show interference also with the exportation from Pennsylvania of steel to be manufactured in the new plant, and he instructed the jury that it could base a conviction upon interference with either the importation of sand or the exportation of steel.
Held:  The conviction is reversed.  Pp.  361 U. S. 213-219.
(a) Since the indictment did not charge interference with the exportation of steel from the State, it was prejudicial error to submit to the jury the question whether the extortion interfered with the exportation of steel.  Pp.  361 U. S. 215-219.
(b) The variance between pleading and proof here involved was not insignificant, and may not be dismissed as harmless error, because it deprived petitioner of his substantial right to be tried for a felony only on charges presented in an indictment returned by a grand jury.  Pp.  361 U. S. 217-218.
(c) Since the jury might have based the conviction on a finding of interference with the exportation of steel, the conviction must be reversed. P.  361 U. S. 219.

 Junius Irving SCALES, petitioner,v. UNITED STATES of America.No. 8. 
 John Francis NOTO, petitioner,v. UNITED STATES.No. 464. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 5, 1960
 Messrs. Telford Taylor and McNeill Smith, for petitioner in No. 8. 
 Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Yeagley, Messrs. Kevin T. Maroney and John F. Davis, for the United States in No. 8. 
 Mr. John J. Abt, for petitioner in No. 464. 
 Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Yeagley and Mr. Kevin T. Maroney, for the United States in No. 464. 
 These two cases were set for argument on February 23 next. In the meantime there intervened the filing of the petition in No. 537, which we have just granted. Nos. 8 and 464 arose under the Smith Act (Act of June 25, 1948, c. 645, 2385, 62 Stat. 808, 18 U.S.C.A. 2385) and No. 537 under Title I of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (Act of September 23, 1950, c. 1024, 64 Stat. 987, 50 U.S.C.A. 783(f)). However, some of the constitutional and statutory issues raised by these two enactments are clearly interrelated and their determination in the two former cases may affect their determination in the latter case and vice versa. Accordingly, the Court deems it important that these three cases be heard and considered together. Since the Court's calendar for the remainder of the Term precludes this, Nos. 8 and 464 are reset for argument on Monday, October 10, 1960, to be followed immediately by the argument in No. 537.

 Mr. Justice CLARK, dissenting. 
 This order, coming as it does in mid-Term with five months of sessions yet remaining, is without precedent. It delays for another year decisions on two important acts of the Congress-the Smith Act and the Internal Security Act of 1950. 
 Scales' case has already been on our active docket for five successive Terms and has twice been fully argued. Petition for certiorari was first granted during the October Term 1955, 350 U.S. 992, and the first oral argument was on October 10, 1956 ( October Term 1956). The case was held under advisement until June 3, 1957, when it was put over to the October Term 1957 for reargument. At that time, on motion of the Solicitor General, it was remanded on a subsidiary issue in the light of our opinion in Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S. Ct. 1007, decided in the interim. 355 U.S. 1. On retrial, Scales was convicted again and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 4 Cir., 260 F.2d 21. We granted certiorari again on December 15, 1958, in our October Term 1958. 358 U.S. 917. It was argued the second time in 1959, and in June, over my objection, 360 U.S. 925, was reset for the October Term 1959. It was then set for November 19, but was put over to February 23, 1960, when certiorari was granted in Noto, 361 U.S. 813, 4 L. Ed.2d 60. The argument in the October Term 1960 will be the third argument. I have found no appellate case in the history of the Court that has been carried on the active docket so many consecutive Terms or argued so often. Ten hours argument time here will have been given to it alone. Noto admittedly involves the same issue as Scales. It has already been here two successive Terms and this order will make the third, placing it next to the unprecedented position occupied by Scales. 
 Likewise the Communist Party case, No. 537, has been argued here on the merits once before. [Footnote 1] This case seeks [361 U.S. 952 , 954]
