||"Oregon v. Mitchell
No. 43, Orig.
Argued October 19, 1970
Decided December 21, 1970*
400 U.S. 112

Syllabus 
These original actions involve the constitutionality of three provisions of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970 which (1) lower the minimum age of voters in both state and federal elections from 21 to 18, (2) bar the use of literacy tests (and similar voting eligibility requirements) for a five-year period in state and federal elections in any area where such tests are not already proscribed by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and (3) forbid States from disqualifying voters in presidential and vice-presidential elections for failure to meet state residency requirements and provide uniform national rules for absentee voting in such elections.
Held:  (1) The 18-year-old minimum-age requirement of the Voting Rights Act Amendments is valid for national elections.  (2) That requirement is not valid for state and local elections.  (3) The literacy test provision is valid.  (4) The residency and absentee balloting provisions are valid.  Pp.  400 U. S. 117-296.
Relief granted in part and denied in part.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK concluded that:
1. Congress has the authority to permit 18-year-old citizens to vote in national elections, under Art. I,  4, Art. II,  1, and the Necessary and Proper Clause, of the Constitution, since those provisions fully empower Congress to make or alter regulations in national elections, to supervise such elections, and to set the qualifications for voters therein.  Pp.  400 U. S. 117,  400 U. S. 119-124.
2. But under Art I,  2, the States have the power to set qualifications to vote in state and local elections, and the whole Constitution reserves that power to the States except as it has been curtailed by specific constitutional amendments.  No amendment (including the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the other Civil War Amendments) authorizes Congress' attempt to lower the voting age in state and local elections.  Pp.  400 U. S. 118,  400 U. S. 124-131. 
Page 400 U. S. 113

3. The literacy test ban is constitutional under the Enforcement Clauses of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, in view of the evidence of racial discrimination that Congress found in various parts of the Nation:  racial discrimination resulting from literacy tests, the educational inequality stemming from the ""separate but equal"" rule, and other racially discriminatory practices.  Pp.  400 U. S. 118,  400 U. S. 131-134.
4. The provisions forbidding States from disqualifying voters in national elections for presidential and vice-presidential electors because they have not met state residency requirements and establishing absentee balloting rules are valid under Congress' broad powers to regulate federal elections and maintain a national government.*  Pp.  400 U. S. 118,  400 U. S. 134.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concluded that:*
1. The authority of Congress to fix at 18 the minimum age for the civil right of voting in national elections derives from the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the power to ""enforce"" granted by  5 of that Amendment.  Congress had an adequate basis for concluding that 18-year-olds are mature enough to vote and that to deprive them of the franchise would be a denial of equal protection.  Pp.  400 U. S. 135-144.
3. The bar against a State's denying the right to vote in any federal, state, or local election because of a literacy test is sustainable as appropriate legislation to enforce the Equal Protection Clause, Congress having concluded that such tests have been used to discriminate against the voting rights of minority groups and that the tests are not necessary to ensure that voters be well informed.  Pp.  400 U. S. 144-147.
4. The right to vote in national elections is a privilege and immunity of national citizenship and the congressional judgment to ban durational residency requirements in presidential and vice-presidential elections is a manifestly permissible means of enforcing that privilege and immunity under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  400 U. S. 147-150.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concluded that:*
2. The Fourteenth Amendment was not intended to restrict the authority of the States to allocate their political power as they see 
Page 400 U. S. 114
 fit and neither that Amendment nor any other provision of the Constitution authorizes Congress to set voter qualifications in state or local elections.  Pp.  400 U. S. 154-213.
3. The literacy requirement can be deemed an appropriate means of enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment since Congress could have determined that racial prejudice is prevalent throughout the Nation and that literacy tests unduly lend themselves to discriminatory application.  Pp.  400 U. S. 216-217.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL concluded that:*
1. Congress has the power to forbid the disenfranchisement in national elections of persons over the age of 18 because of their age, in order to enforce the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  There was ample evidence to support Congress' conclusion that the exclusion of citizens 18 to 21 years of age from the franchise is unnecessary to promote any legitimate interest the States may have in assuring intelligent and responsible voting.  Pp.  400 U. S. 239-281.
3. The congressional determination that a nationwide ban on literacy tests was necessary to prevent racial discrimination in voting is amply supported by the legislative record, and the proscription of literacy tests is well within the power of Congress granted by  2 of the Fifteenth Amendment.  Pp.  400 U. S. 231-236.
4. There is adequate constitutional basis for the residency provisions of the Act in  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, as there is ample justification for the congressional findings that durational residence requirements abridge the right of free interstate migration and that such requirements are not reasonably related to any compelling state interests.  Pp.  400 U. S. 236-239.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that:*
2. Congress has no power to confer the right to vote in state or local elections on citizens from the ages of 18 to 21, since under the Constitution only the States have the power to set voting qualifications.  Pp.  400 U. S. 293-296.
3. The literacy test ban is constitutional under the Enforcement Clause of the Fifteenth Amendment.  Pp.  400 U. S. 282-284.
4. The residency provisions of the Act are constitutional because Congress, while it does not have general authority to establish qualifications for voting in congressional or presidential elections, 
Page 400 U. S. 115
 does have the power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to protect the privileges of United States citizenship, including the freedom to travel and to change one's residence.  Pp.  400 U. S. 285-292.

 Named Individual Members of the SAN ANTONIO CONSERVATION SOCIETYv. The TEXAS HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT et al., and the U.S. Department of Transportation.No. 1101. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 21, 1970
 Rehearing Denied Feb. 22, 1971. 
 See 401 U.S. 926. 
 On petition for a writ of certiorari, before judgment, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 
 Mr. Justice BLACK, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN join, dissenting. This case disturbs me greatly. On December 7, 1970, this Court stayed the construction of two federally funded highways in order to save two public parks. One park serves the people of Memphis, Tennessee. [Footnote 1] The park in this case is for the rest and recreation of the the people of San Antonio, Texas. Both cases involve important and timely problems of interpretation of 138 of the Federal Aid Highway Act, passed by Congress to stem the destruction of our Nation's parks by highway builders. These cases give this Court an opportunity to insure that lower courts and certain federal agencies administer this vital environment-saving legislation in the way that Congrees intended. The Tennessee case is still scheduled for oral argument at the earliest possible date-January 11, 1971. Yet, the Court now dissolves the stay previously entered in the San Antonio case, 400 U.S. 961, and denies certiorari. I respectfully dissent from these orders. The San Antonio park has two golf courses, a zoo, a sunken garden, an open air theater and many acres of open space, covered with trees, flowers, and running brooks. It is a lovely place for people to retreat from the frantic pace of bustling urban life to enjoy the simple pleasures of open space, quiet solitude, and clean air. It is a refuge for young and old alike-the kind of a park where a family man can take his wife and children or lovers can while away a sunny Sunday afternoon to- 
Page 400 U.S. 968 , 969
 gether. After today's decision, the people of San Antonio and the birds and animals that make their home in the park will share their quiet retreat with an ugly, smelly stream of traffic pouring down a super six- lane 'North Expressway.' Trees, shrubs, and flowers will be mown down. The cars will spew forth air and noise pollution contaminating those acres not buried under concrete. Mothers will grow anxious and desert the park lest their children be crushed beneath the massive wheels of interstate trucks. 
 The San Antonio Conservation Society and its individual members filed suit to block federal approval and funding of this expressway. The United States District Court held that the Secretary of Transportation and state officials were free to proceed with federal funding and construction of two segments of the road coming into the park from north and south. It retained jurisdiction to review any later decision on the design and routing of the connecting middle section, which had not been formally approved by the Secretary. 
 In addition to substantial questions under the Federal Aid Highway Act, 23 U.S.C. 138, this case involves the newly enacted National Environmental Policy Act, Pub.L. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852. The latter requires a detailed study of the probable effects before approval of 'major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.' 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). Even the respondent appears to concede that the decision to fund this expressway is a 'major federal action' requiring careful study because he has promised that a study will be made before the middle section is approved. However, the approval of the two end segments took place in August 1970, eight months after the effective date of the Act. It is undisputed that no environmental study has been made with respect to these two segments, [400 U.S. 968 , 970]

 Edna WEEDv. Owen BILBREY et al.No. 1109. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 21, 1970. 
 On Motion for Leave to File Third Petition for Rehearing. The motion for leave to file a third petition for rehearing is denied.

 This suit grows out of the death of Mrs. Weed's husband in Florida. He was killed while on navigable waters within the State. She recovered nothing in her action for wrongful death because the trial court found her husband had been negligent and applied the Florida doctrine of contributory negligence. She contended that the maritime rule of comparative negligence should apply. She lost. Meanwhile a similar suit was progressing through the federal courts in Florida. Mrs. Moragne had also lost her husband on the navigable waters of that State. She contended that the maritime principle of unseaworthiness should apply. The Florida Supreme Court asked whether the State law incorporated the principle, ruled that it did not, and that she was not entitled to recover under Florida law. Moragne v. State Marine Lines, 211 So.2d 161, Fla.1968. 
 THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice BLACKMUN took no part in the consideration or decision of this motion. 
 The District Court of Appeal of Florida ruled, in the Weed case, that Florida law did incorporate the federal maritime doctrine of comparative negligence. Fla.App.1967, 201 So. 
Page 400 U.S. 982 , 983
 2d 771. The defendants appealed to the Florida Supreme Court. That court, considering the claim of Mrs. Weed indistinguishable from that of Mrs. Moragne, denied three weeks earlier, reversed the Appellate Court. 215 So. 2d 479, Fla.1968. 
 Mrs. Weed preceded Mrs. Moragne to this Court. She claimed that she had a cause of action under federal maritime law even though it was not statutorily authorized. She asked this Court to overrule its decision in The Harrisburg, 119 U.S. 199, that maritime law did not afford a cause of action for wrongful death. Her petition for certiorari was denied in May 1969, over three dissents. 394 U.S. 1018. Three weeks later, Mrs. Moragne filed a petition for certiorari in this Court, raising the same claim. Mrs. Weed filed a petition for rehearing, asking that her claim be heard with that of Mrs. Moragne. Mrs. Weed's request was denied in June 1969. 395 U.S. 971. In November 1969, certiorari was granted in the Moragne case. 396 U.S. 900. 
 Mrs. Weed again asked that her case be considered with that of Mrs. Moragne. This request was also denied. 397 U.S. 930d 108. 
 In June 1970, this Court vindicated theclaim of Mrs. Moragne.* 398 U.S. 375. Mrs. Weed now presents a compelling argument. She is one of two widows from the State of Florida who lost their husbands on navigable waters. One has recovered and one has not, because a different law was ultimately applied. Though both parties challenged the same rule, at nearly the 
 * This Court overruled The Harrisburg, 119 U.S. 199, and held that an action does lie under general maritime law for death caused by violation of maritime duties. Had Mrs. Weed's petition been granted, or had she been allowed to join with Mrs. Moragne before this Court, this holding would have meant that she was entitled to recovery, diminished by the doctrine of comparative negligence, rather than barred by the doctrine of contributory negligence.

Syllabus 
Appellee was convicted of first-degree murder following a trial in which one Shaw testified, over objection, concerning a statement Williams (an alleged accomplice) had made in the prison where both were incarcerated, after Williams' return there from his arraignment, that, had it not been for appellee, ""we wouldn't be in this now.""  There were 19 other prosecution witnesses, one of whom (another alleged accomplice) gave detailed eyewitness testimony of the crime and the participation of the appellee and Williams therein.  Shaw's testimony was admitted under a Georgia statute which, as construed by the Georgia Supreme Court, allows into evidence a coconspirator's out-of-court statement made during the concealment phase of the conspiracy.  Following affirmance of the conviction by the Georgia Supreme Court, appellee brought this habeas corpus proceeding in federal court.  The District Court denied the writ, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Georgia statute violated appellee's right to confrontation secured by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Appellee contends that the Georgia hearsay exception is unconstitutional, since it differs from the hearsay exception applicable to conspiracy trials in the federal courts, which applies only if the out-of-court statement of a coconspirator was made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  400 U. S. 80-90;  400 U. S. 93-100.
400 F.2d 826, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that:
1. The coconspirator hearsay exception applied by Georgia is not invalid under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, as applied to the States by the Fourteenth, merely because it does not coincide with the narrower exception applicable in 
Page 400 U. S. 75
 federal conspiracy trials, which results not from the Sixth Amendment, but from the exercise of this Court's rulemaking power respecting the federal law of evidence.  Pp.  400 U. S. 80-83.
2. In the circumstances of this case, the admission into evidence of Williams' statement did not result in any denial of appellee's confrontation right, since the out-of-court statement bore indicia of reliability that fully warranted its being placed before the jury.  Pp.  400 U. S. 83-90.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concluded that exceptions to the rule against hearsay must be evaluated not by the Confrontation Clause (which is not designed to cope with the many factors involved in passing on evidentiary rules), but by the due process standards of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Thus evaluated, the Georgia statute is constitutional as applied in this case, since the out-of-court declaration against interest involved here evinces some likelihood of trustworthiness, and its exclusion from evidence is therefore not essential to a fair trial.

400 U.S. 48

Syllabus 
The General Mining Act of 1872 provided that, until a patent issued for a mineral location on lands belonging to the United States ""not less than $100 worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made during each year,"" and that a patent could issue on a showing that the claimant had expended $500 of labor or improvements on the claim.  Failure to do the assessment work generally entitled others to relocate the claim.  Under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, lands theretofore open to location and acquisition of title became available only on a lease basis, but a Saving Clause covered valid claims existent on February 25, 1920, ""and thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated.""  All the claims involved in this suit were canceled by the Secretary of the Interior in the early 1930's because the annual assessment work, required by the 1872 Act, had not been performed.  In attempting to establish their oil shale claims in Colorado under the 1872 Act, respondents brought this action in the District Court to require the Secretary of the Interior to patent the claims or to expunge his rulings canceling the claims for lack of annual assessment work and to enjoin him from enforcing them.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals, ruling in favor of respondents, held that the Department of the Interior had no jurisdiction to cancel the claims.  The courts relied on Wilbur v. Krushnic, 280 U. S. 306, and Ickes v. Virginia-Colorado Development Corp., 295 U. S. 639, where this Court declined to interpret the Mineral Leasing Act as requiring the return to the Government of full possessory rights to lands subject to oil shale claims for defaults in assessment work.  The decisions indicated that failure to perform such work made the claims subject to relocation by others but not forfeiture to the Government.
Held:  The Saving Clause of the Mineral Leasing Act makes the United States the beneficiary of all claims that are invalid for lack of assessment work or otherwise, and the Department of the Interior had subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether respondents' claims were ""maintained"" within the meaning of that clause, including the performance

No. 99
Argued October 22, 1970
Decided December 8, 1970
400 U.S. 62

Syllabus 
Petitioner Terminal Association, a maritime terminal operators conference operating under an agreement approved by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), pursuant to  15 of the Shipping Act, 1916, revised a tariff on file with the agency by shifting the incidence of a wharf demurrage charge from consignees to carriers.  When several carriers refused to pay the revised charge, which had not previously been approved by the FMC, the Terminal Association sued the association that represented them and their agents (Shipping Association).  The District Court stayed the proceedings to allow the Shipping Association to obtain from the FMC a ruling on the validity of the change.  After a hearing, the FMC concluded, on June 23, 1967, that its prior approval of the revised tariff was not necessary under  15 of the Act.  On September 19, 1967, the Shipping Association filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for review which that court dismissed for lateness.  On September 4, 1968, respondent, a carrier that had been assessed charges, made application to the FMC for reconsideration (on the basis of a decision this Court rendered after the FMC's ruling), which the FMC returned as untimely filed under its rules.  Thereupon respondent, contending that its agent had inadequately represented it in the proceeding brought by the Shipping Association, sought and was allowed to intervene in the still-pending action in the District Court.  That court, concluding that the FMC had primary jurisdiction of the subject matter of the dispute and that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to review the FMC's decision, rendered judgment against the Shipping Association and respondent. Respondent appealed.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the merits, after concluding that respondent was not a party to the FMC proceeding and was therefore free to seek independent collateral review in the District Court of that agency's order.
Held:
1. The FMC, the agency responsible under the Shipping Act for supervising conferences of marine terminal operators and 
Page 400 U. S. 63
 uniquely qualified to consider disputes involving overall conference policies, had primary jurisdiction over the question whether prior administrative approval of the tariff amendment was required.  Pp.  400 U. S. 68-69.
2. The District Court correctly concluded that it had no authority to review the FMC's decision, which constituted a final order and as such, under the Administrative Orders Review Act, was exclusively reviewable by the Court of Appeals.  Pp.  400 U. S. 69-71.
3. Respondent, having been represented by its agent in the administrative hearing and having also had every opportunity to participate before the FMC and to seek timely review in the Court of Appeals, cannot collaterally attack the FMC's order.  Pp.  400 U. S. 71-72.
4. When the case returned to the District Court, the time for review by the Court of Appeals had expired, precluding any judicial review of the FMC decision on the merits.  P.  400 U. S. 72.

 The judgment is affirmed.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 The Court today affirms the District Court in a case involving the relationship of various factors in determining a 'just and reasonable' charge under 15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act. [Footnote 1] Because I think the court below was clearly in error, I would reverse and remand the case to the Interstate Commerce Commission for further consideration. 
 The appellants, various railroads operating in the southern United States, submitted to the ICC in 1967 a tariff proposing a $22 per car transit charge for cotton and molasses. [Footnote 2] The Commission, on protests from shippers, ordered appellants to refrain from imposing 
Page 400 U.S. 932 , 933
 the new charges pending a hearing under 15(7) to determine if the new charge was 'just and reasonable.' 
 A hearing was held in 1968, and after receiving testimony from appellants and the protesting shippers the Examiner concluded that (a) the appellants had the burden of proving the charge was just and reasonable by 'clear and convincing' evidence, (b) the $22 charge was not shown to approximate the actual costs involved in transiting a freight car, (c) the existing line haul rates returned more than out-of-pocket costs for all services performed, including transit, and made a contribution to overhead as well, (d) the likely effect of the charge would be to divert traffic to motor carriers and thus reduce the railroads' overall revenue. 'All things considered,' the Examiner concluded, appellants had failed to show that the charge was just and reasonable. The Commission adopted the findings and conclusions of the Examiner without change. Transit Charges, Southern Territory, 332 I.C.C. 664 (1968). 
 On review, the three-judge District Court3 found that the Examiner and thus the Commission had misstated the law in holding that the carriers had a burden of showing the charge was just and reasonable by 'clear and convincing evidence.' Had the court stopped there and simply remanded the proceedings to the Commission with directions to apply what the court deemed to be the proper standard of proof, there would be no need to review this case. However, the court went on to discuss the Commission's findings on the merits. It concluded that the Commission had not justified its conclusions that (a) the $22 charge was not shown to approximate transit costs and (b) the line haul rate was sufficient to cover the costs involved.

 The petition for a writ of certiorari, insofar as it seeks review of the affirmance by the Court of Appeals of count 5 (possession count) of the convictions of petitioners, Stanley, Thomas, and Massey, is granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals as to these three individuals is vacated insofar as that count is concerned and the case is remanded to that Court so that it may consider the suggestions contained in the memorandum the Solicitor General has filed here. By this remand this Court intimates no view as to the merits of the Solicitor General's petition. In all other respects the petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 The statute at the time of conviction made manufacture a crime, 21 U. S.C. 360a. It also made 'possession' a crime in the following words-'No person ... shall possess* any depressant or stimulant drug otherwise than (1) for the personal use of himself or of a member of his household, or (2) for administration to an animal owned by him or a member of his household.' 21 U.S.C. 360a(c). 
 As stated by the Court of Appeals, the 1965 law did not make possession for personal use a crime but it did make possession for sale an offense; and here the evidence is clear that possession was for sale. 
 * Amendments in 1968 made all possession criminal-possession for sale and 'other possession,' 82 Stat. 1361. While petitioners were tried after the enactment of the 1968 amendments, their offenses were committed earlier. The 1968 amendments apply 'only with respect to violations ... committed after the date of the enactment of this Act.'

 Beginning in November 1966 government agents commenced an investigation into suspected illegal drug activities in the San Francisco Bay area. Petitioners and others were placed under extensive surveillance. During the period of surveillance one Krusko, a government undercover agent, became acquainted with petitioner Spires, twice purchased LSD from him (once for $3400), and had frequent conversations with him. These conversations revealed that petitioner Stanley was engaged in manufacturing and distributing various drugs including LSD. A frequent topic of these conversations pertained to the purchase of LSD. 
 On November 15, 1967, during a conversation, Spires informed Krusko that 'some of the boys' were going to set up a laboratory and had found a location 'way out in the sticks.' Spires also informed him that of the 100 grams of LSD which Stanley had previously possessed, 10 had been distributed in the form of tablets. Spires said that Stanley normally sold large quantities for $2500 per gram. 
 On December 19 Spires stated he was going to the laboratory and would attempt to get some LSD for Krusko, saying that Stanley intended to produce 25 grams of LSD before Christmas. 
 The officers thereupon obtained a search warrant of the premises which was executed on December 21. They found a small factory for the manufacture of LSD.

No. 14
Argued November 17, 1969
Reargued October 14, 1970
Decided November 23, 1970
400 U.S. 25

Syllabus 
Appellee was indicted for the capital crime of first-degree murder.  At that time, North Carolina law provided for the penalty of life imprisonment when a plea of guilty was accepted to a first-degree murder charge; for the death penalty following a jury verdict of guilty, unless the jury recommended life imprisonment; and for a penalty of from two to 30 years' imprisonment for second-degree murder.  Appellee's attorney, in the face of strong evidence of guilt, recommended a guilty plea, but left the decision to appellee.  The prosecutor agreed to accept a plea of guilty to second-degree murder.  The trial court heard damaging evidence from certain witnesses before accepting a plea.  Appellee pleaded guilty, although disclaiming guilt, because of the threat of the death penalty, and was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment.  The Court of Appeals, on an appeal from a denial of a writ of habeas corpus, found that appellee's guilty plea was involuntary because it was motivated principally by fear of the death penalty.
Held:  The trial judge did not commit constitutional error in accepting appellee's guilty plea.  Pp.  400 U. S. 31-39.
(a) A guilty plea that represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternatives available to a defendant, especially one represented by competent counsel, is not compelled within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment because it was entered to avoid the possibility of the death penalty.  Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742.  P.  400 U. S. 31.
(b) Hudson v. United States, 272 U. S. 451, which held that a federal court may impose a prison sentence after accepting a plea of nolo contendere, implicitly recognized that there is no constitutional bar to imposing a prison sentence upon an accused who is unwilling to admit guilt but who is willing to waive trial and accept the sentence.  Pp.  400 U. S. 35-36.
(c) An accused may voluntarily, knowingly, and understandingly consent to the imposition of a prison sentence even though he is unwilling to admit participation in the crime, or even if his 
Page 400 U. S. 26
 guilty plea contains a protestation of innocence, when, as here, he intelligently conclude that his interests require a guilty plea and the record strongly evidences guilt.  Pp.  400 U. S. 37-38.
(d) The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights do not prohibit the States from accepting pleas to lesser included offenses.  P.  400 U. S. 39.

 COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS, plaintiff,v. Melvin R. LAIRD, Secretary of Defense.No. 42 Orig.-. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October Term, 1970. 
 November 9, 1970
 On Motion for Leave to File Bill of Complaint. 
 The motion of The Constitutional Lawyers' Committee on Undeclared War for leave to file a supplemental brief, as amicus curiae, is granted. 
 The motion of John M. Wells et al. for leave to file a brief, as amici curiae, to participate in oral argument, or alternative motion to be named as parties, is denied. 
 The motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 This motion was filed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts against the Secretary of Defense, a citizen of another State. It is brought pursuant to a mandate contained in an act of the Massachusetts Legislature. 1970 Laws, c. 174. Massachusetts seeks to obtain an adjudication of the constitutionality of the United States' participation in the Indochina war. It requests that the United States' participation be declared 'unconstitutional in that it was not initially authorized or subsequently ratified by Congressional declaration'; it asks that the Secretary of Defense be enjoined 'from carrying out, issuing, or causing to be issued any further orders which would increase the present level of United States troops in Indochina'; and it asks that, if appropriate congressional action is not forthcoming within 90 days of this Court's decree, that the Secretary of Defense be enjoined 'from carrying out, issuing, or causing to be issued any further order directing any inhabitant of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to Indochina for the purpose of participating in combat or supporting combat troops in the Vietnam war.' Today this Court denies leave to file the complaint. I dissent. 
Page 400 U.S. 886 , 887
 The threshold issues for granting leave to file a complaint in this case are standing and justiciability. I believe that Massachusetts has standing and the controversy is justiciable. At the very least, however, it is apparent that the issues are not so clearly foreclosed as to justify a summary denial of leave to file. 
 STANDING  
 In Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, the Court held a State lacked standing to challenge, as parens patriae, a federal grant-in-aid program under which the Federal Government was allegedly usurping powers reserved to the States. It was said in Mellon: 
 The Solicitor General argues that Mellon stands as a bar to this suit. 
 Yet the ruling of the Court in that case is not dispositive of this one. The opinion states 'We need not go so far as to say that a state may never intervene by [400 U.S. 886 , 888]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 19, 1970
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 I dissent. I think we should take this case and decide the important question it presents of the res judicata effect of a federal habeas court's determination that evidence used to obtain a state court conviction was improperly admitted because it was the fruit of an unconstitutional search and seizure. 
 Petitioner was convicted in Virginia state court of unlawful possession of narcotics seized from his person after his arrest when he entered the apartment of another during a lawful police search of the apartment for narcotics. After exhausting state remedies, he sought federal habeas relief, contending that his mere entry into the apartment provided no probable cause for his arrest and the subsequent search of his person. The parties declined the District Court's offer of a hearing to augment the trial record and stipulated that it contained all the 'necessary' facts. The District Court determined on the state record that the police did not have probable cause for petitioner's arrest, and therefore that the narcotics seized from his person had been improperly admitted in evidence. The court ordered petitioner discharged if not retried by the State within 30 days. 
 Virginia took no appeal from this judgment. Instead, it proceeded to retry petitioner. Over petitioner's objection, the State was allowed to repair the deficiency in its probable cause case by introducing other evidence available to it but not offered at the first state trial. With the State's case thus buttressed, the Virginia trial court once again found probable cause for petitioner's arrest, and admitted the seized narcotics in evidence. When the Supreme Court of Virginia declined to hear his appeal, petitioner filed the present ap- 
Page 400 U.S. 870 , 871
 plication for federal habeas corpus, contending that the earlier federal habeas judgment was res judicata on the issue of probable cause. The District Court, however, viewed the sole question before it as 'whether the retrial ... produced additional evidence weighing on probable cause to lend propriety to the arrest and subsequent search.' Answering that question in the affirmative, the District Court denied the application in an unreported opinion and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 19, 1970 Rehearing Denied Nov. 16, 1970. See 400 U.S. 920. 
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the District Court of Appeal of Florida, Third District. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
 Mr. Justice BLACK, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN join, dissenting. 
 I would grant certiorari in this case to hold that Florida cannot enforce a mere procedural rule by denying a criminal defendant his constitutional right to present witnesses on his own behalf. In this assault trial, the defendant asked the judge to invoke the 'Witness Rule,' directing prospective witnesses 'not to permit anyone to discuss ... [ the case] in your presence.' The judge invoked the rule but instructed only those witnesses who were then present. A defense witness who arrived late missed the instruction, and, unknown to the defendant or his counsel, heard some of the prosecution's evidence. When the defense later attempted to call this witness to support the defendant's testimony that the alleged assault was an act of self-defense, the prosecutor objected to the competency of the witness because he had violated the 'Witness Rule.' Over the defendant's objection that the witness would give material testimony in the defendant's favor, the judge refused to permit the witness to testify. 
 While the 'Witness Rule' has a valid purpose and can contribute to the search for truth, a breach of the rule cannot be used to deny a criminal defendant his constitutional right to obtain and present witnesses in his favor. U.S.Const. Amend. VI; cf. Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14 (1967). A simple rule of courtroom 'fairness' has been misused to destroy a sacred constitutional right. 
 I would grant certiorari in this case and reverse the conviction below so that the defendant might have the right to present his side of the story.[ Braswell v. Florida 400 U.S. 873 (1970) ]

No. 595
Argued March 31, 1970
Decided June 29, 1970
399 U.S. 224

Syllabus 
Respondent, who is serving a sentence under a California conviction, was tried, convicted, and sentenced in North Carolina, and a detainer, requested by North Carolina, was noted by petitioner California warden.  Respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus from a Federal District Court in California, attacking his North Carolina conviction.  His application was denied, and, in his petition for rehearing, he argued that the detainer acted as a form of constructive custody as it adversely affected his parole potential and the degree of security in which he was detained.  Rehearing was denied on the basis of McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131, and respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals.  The intervening decision in Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54, overruled McNally v. Hill, and held that a state prisoner serving consecutive sentences in the forum State is ""in custody"" for purposes of jurisdiction for collateral attack.  The Court of Appeals held that the District Court had jurisdiction to consider respondent's claims concerning the impact of the detainer.
Held:
1. Since the California courts, which are not required to enforce a foreign penal judgment, have not been presented with the question of what effect, if any, they will give the North Carolina detainer in terms of respondent's present ""custody,"" respondent has not exhausted his California remedies.  P.  399 U. S. 229.
2. The Federal District Court should retain jurisdiction of the petition for writ of habeas corpus pending respondent's application to the California courts for appropriate relief if he establishes his claim that the detainer interferes with relief that California might grant in the absence of the detainer.  Pp.  399 U. S. 229-230.

His application was denied, and, in his petition for rehearing, he argued that the detainer acted as a form of constructive custody as it adversely affected his parole potential and the degree of security in which he was detained.  Rehearing was denied on the basis of McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131, and respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals.  The intervening decision in Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54, overruled McNally v. Hill, and held that a state prisoner serving consecutive sentences in the forum State is ""in custody"" for purposes of jurisdiction for collateral attack.  The Court of Appeals held that the District Court had jurisdiction to consider respondent's claims concerning the impact of the detainer.
Held:
1. Since the California courts, which are not required to enforce a foreign penal judgment, have not been presented with the question of what effect, if any, they will give the North Carolina detainer in terms of respondent's present ""custody,"" respondent has not exhausted his California remedies.  P.  399 U. S. 229.
2. The Federal District Court should retain jurisdiction of the petition for writ of habeas corpus pending respondent's application to the California courts for appropriate relief if he establishes his claim that the detainer interferes with relief that California might grant in the absence of the detainer.  Pp.  399 U. S. 229-230.
410 F.2d 1179, affirmed.

No 1089
Argued April 22, 1970
Decided June 29, 1970
399 U.S. 235

Syllabus 
Appellant was given the maximum sentence for petty theft under Illinois law of one year' imprisonment and a $500 fine, plus $5 in court costs.  The judgment, as permitted by statute, provided that, if, when the one-year sentence expired, he did not pay the monetary obligation, he had to remain in jail to work them off at the rate of $5 a day.  While in jail, appellant, alleging indigency, unsuccessfully petitioned the sentencing judge to vacate that portion of the order confining him to jail after the sentence expired, because of nonpayment of the fine and cost.  The Illinois Supreme Court rejected appellant's claim that the State statutory provision constituted discriminatory treatment against those unable to pay a fine and court costs, and affirmed the lower court's dismissal of appellant's petition, holding that ""there is no denial of equal protection of the law when an indigent defendant is imprisoned to satisfy payment of the fine.""
Held:  Though a State has considerable latitude in fixing the punishment for state crime, and may impose alternative sanction, it may not, under the Equal Protection Clause, subject a certain class of convicted defendants to a period of Imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum solely by reason of their indigency.  Pp.  399 U. S. 239-245.

No. 305
Argued January 20-21, 1970
Decided June 29, 1970
399 U.S. 267

Syllabus 
Appellee was indicted for willfully failing to report for induction as ordered by his local draft board.  He moved to dismiss the indictment because (1) the involvement in Vietnam violated international law, (2) he ""reasonably believed the government's involvement in Vietnam to be illegal,"" (3) the Selective Service Act and its regulations were unconstitutional, as the local boards' procedures lacked due process, and (4) compulsory conscription in peacetime was unnecessary, and stifled fundamental liberties.  The District Judge dismissed the motion, and the case proceeded to trial.  The instructions to the jury made no reference to a conscientious objector claim, or to whether the appellee was ""sincere"" in his beliefs, but advised the jury that the crux of the case was whether appellee's refusal was ""unlawful, knowingly, and willfully"" done.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty.  Thereafter, appellee made a motion under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 34 to arrest the judgment on the ground that the District Court lacked jurisdiction.  The District Court, in granting what it termed a motion in arrest of judgment, ruled not on the jurisdictional contention, but on appellee's ""older contention"" that the indictment could not charge an offense based on the Establishment, Free Exercise, and Due Process Clause arguments relating to conscientious objections to the Vietnam conflict.  The court stated the facts of the case and described how appellee's demeanor on the stand convinced the judge of his sincerity.  The court held that the Free Exercise and Due Process Clauses prohibited application of the Draft Act to appellee to require him to fight in Vietnam because, as a ""sincerely conscientious man,"" his interest in not killing in Vietnam outweighed ""the country's present need for him to be so employed.""  The court also ruled that  6(j) of the Selective Service Act violates the Establishment Clause.  The Government bases its claim that this Court has jurisdiction to review the case on the ""arresting judgment"" provision of 18 U.S.C.  3731, which provides that an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court from a decision (1) arresting a judgment of conviction, (2) for insufficiency of the indictment or information, (3) where such decision 
Page 399 U. S. 268
 is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment or information is founded.
Held:
1. The decision below was not one ""arresting a judgment of conviction.""  Pp.  399 U. S. 280-287.
(a) In granting a motion in arrest of judgment under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 34, which preserves the common law requirement, a district court must not look beyond the face of the record, and thus a decision based on evidence adduced at trial cannot be one arresting judgment.  Pp.  399 U. S. 280-282.
(b) The District Court clearly went beyond the ""face of the record"" in reaching its decision, as the court's factual findings concerning appellee's sincerity and opposition to fighting in Vietnam are essential to its disposition of the case.  Pp.  399 U. S. 283-284.
(c) Even assuming, arguendo, that the parties could secure review under the ""motion in arrest"" provisions of  3731 on the basis of a stipulation, there certainly was no formal stipulation here, and the most that can be said is that, after the lower court's decision, the Government chose to accept the opinion's findings of fact.  Pp.  399 U. S. 284-287.
2. The indictment here was not insufficient, as it recited the necessary elements of an offense, and did not allege facts that themselves demonstrate the availability of a constitutional privilege.  Pp.  399 U. S. 287-288.
3. Since the disposition below was based on factual conclusions not found in the indictment, but resulting from evidence adduced at trial, the decision was, in fact, an acquittal rendered after the jury's verdict of guilty, and not, as characterized by the trial judge, an arrest of judgment.  Pp.  399 U. S. 288-290.
4. The legislative history of the Criminal Appeals Act, rather than manifesting a broad congressional directive to this Court to review important legal issues, shows a legislative policy to provide review in only certain cases and to restrict it to those instances.  A primary concern of the Act is that no appeal be taken by the Government from an acquittal, no matter how erroneous the underlying legal theory.  Pp.  399 U. S. 291-299.
5. This Court does not have jurisdiction in this case under the ""motion in bar"" provision of  3731.  Pp.  399 U. S. 299-307.
(a) A motion in bar cannot be granted on the basis of facts that would necessarily be tried with the general issue in the case, and, here, the District Judge based his findings on evidence presented in the trial of the general issue.  Pp.  399 U. S. 301-302. 
Page 399 U. S. 269

(b) An appeal from a motion in bar cannot be granted after jeopardy attaches, and, in light of the compromise origins of the Criminal Appeals Act, the concern of some Senators over retrial of a defendant whose trial ended after the jury was impaneled, and the long-time consistent interpretation by the Government, jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn.

No. 1093
Argued April 28, 1970
Decided June 29, 1970
399 U.S. 350

Syllabus 
Phillipsburg National Bank (PNB) and Second National Bank (SNB) are the two largest of the three commercial banks in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, whose 1960 population (including suburbs) was 28,500.  Easton, Pennsylvania, across the river, whose 1960 population (including suburbs) was 60,000, has four commercial banks.  The proposed merger of PNB and SNB, direct competitors, would produce a bank with assets of more than $41,100,000, placing it second among the six banks remaining in the Phillipsburg-Easton area, and would give the two largest banks in the area 54.8% of the banking assets, 64.8% of total deposits, 63% of total loans, and 10 of the 16 banking offices.  PNB and SNB are oriented toward the needs of small depositors and small borrowers in the Phillipsburg-Easton area, as over 90% of their depositors and about 80% of their borrowers reside there, with the vast majority residing in Phillipsburg.  Despite the views of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Attorney General that the proposed merger involved commercial banking in Phillipsburg-Easton and that the merger would significantly harm competition in that area, the Comptroller of the Currency, pursuant to the Bank Merger Act, approved the merger, treating most of the Lehigh Valley as the geographic area, and evaluating competition from finance companies, savings and loan institutions, and the more than 30 commercial banks in that area.  The District Court rejected Phillipsburg-Easton as the geographic area and selected an area about four times as large, with a 1960 population of 216,000 and 18 banks.  Although, in its actual analysis of competitive effect, that court looked to commercial banking as the relevant product market, it emphasized competition between PNB-SNB and other types of financial institutions, and stated that PNB-SNB's activities ""really make them much more . . . like savings institutions than like so many of the larger commercial banks.""  The District Court held that the United States had not established that the merger would have any anticompetitive effect, and that, even if 
Page 399 U. S. 351
 there were de minimis anticompetitive effect in the Government's narrowly drawn market, such effect would be clearly outweighed by the convenience and needs of the community.
Held:
1. Commercial banking is the relevant product market.  Pp.  399 U. S. 359-362.
(a) It is the cluster of products and services offered by full-service banks that makes commercial banking a distinct line of commerce.  United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U. S. 321.  Pp.  399 U. S. 359-360.
(b) While submarkets such as the District Court defined would be relevant in analyzing the effect on competition between a commercial bank and another type of financial institution, they cannot be the basis for disregarding the broader line of commerce that has economic significance, with respect to small as well as large banks.  Pp.  399 U. S. 360-362.
2. The Phillipsburg-Easton area is the relevant geographic market.  Pp.  399 U. S. 362-365.
(a) Commercial realities in the banking industry make clear that banks generally have a very localized business, and such localization is particularly pronounced when small customers are involved.  Pp.  399 U. S. 362-364.
(b) The area is a geographic market in which the merger's effect would be ""direct and immediate,"" and where the merging banks' customers must, or will, do their banking.  Pp.  399 U. S. 364-365.
(c) The area, with a 1960 population of nearly 90,000, and with seven competing banks, is a market that is clearly an economically significant section of the country for the purposes of  7 of the Clayton Act.  P.  399 U. S. 365.
3. On the record in this case the proposed merger would be ""inherently likely to lessen competition substantially.""  Pp.  399 U. S. 365-369.
4. The District Court's errors require reexamination of its conclusion under the Bank Merger Act that any anticompetitive effects of the merger would be outweighed by the merger's contribution to the community's convenience and needs.  Such reexamination must be in terms of the Phillipsburg-Easton area as a whole, and should specifically explore alternative methods of serving the convenience and needs of the area, and consider whether the merger will benefit all banking customers, small and large, in the community.

|399 u.s. 392|"New Haven Inclusion Cases*
Argued March 30, 1970
Decided June 29, 1970.
399 U.S. 392

Syllabus 
When this Court sustained the Penn Central merger (389 U.S. 486), it upheld the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in conditioning its approval of the merger on inclusion as an operating entity of the New York, New Haven & Hartford R. Co. (New Haven), whose continued operation the ICC had found to be essential.  Since 1961, the New Haven had been under reorganization proceedings under  77 of the Bankruptcy Act, and was close to financial collapse.  The basic issue in these cases concerns the propriety of the financial terms for the inclusion.  The ICC had remitted the parties to negotiate the terms of the inclusion, and, after considering their appraisals issued its inclusion report, in which it concluded that the net liquidation value of New Haven's assets (after deducting liquidation expenses and making a discount to present worth on the basis of hypothesized receipts over the six-year period anticipated for liquidation) was $125,000,000, a figure that the ICC found ""just and reasonable"" as a condition of the merger under  5 of the Interstate Commerce Act and ""fair and equitable"" as part of a plan of reorganization under  77 of the Bankruptcy Act.  The New Haven bondholders thereupon commenced litigation for review of the inclusion report (in its aspect as a condition of the merger) in the three-judge District Court for the Southern District of New York, 
Page 399 U. S. 393
 which was called upon to review the order under  5 of the Interstate Commerce Act.  The ICC certified to the reorganization court in Connecticut the sale of New Haven's assets to Penn Central, and the New Haven bondholders filed their objections in that court.  The bondholders' group and the United States each tried to avoid duplicate litigation -- the bondholders by an application in the three-judge court to enjoin the ICC's certification of its plan to the reorganization court (which was denied), and the United States by a motion to dismiss the complaints in the three-judge court (which was also denied).  Each court, after hearings, concluded that New Haven's assets had been substantially undervalued, and remanded the case to the ICC.  The ICC then revalued New Haven's assets at a higher figure than that first reached, which, after deductions for certain factors not previously considered (""the added deductions""), came to $140,600,000.  In addition, the ICC directed Penn Central to pay $5,000,000 toward New Haven's interim operating expenses.  The
brk:
reorganization court ordered New Haven's assets transferred to Penn Central, which was done on December 31, 1968.  The bondholders filed objections to the revised evaluation with the reorganization court, and brought actions against the United States and the ICC in the three-judge court.  The reorganization court rejected the plan, though it accepted some of the ICC's determinations.  The three-judge court sustained the plan with modifications.  Though the two courts agreed on many substantial issues, the total evaluation reached by the reorganization court exceeded that reached by the three-judge court by $28,000,000.  The bondholders appealed directly to this Court from the three-judge court's judgment, and this Court noted probable jurisdiction.  The bondholders appealed to the Court of Appeals from the order of the reorganization court; the United States, the ICC, and Penn Central cross-appealed, and this Court granted certiorari in advance of judgment.  The disputed items of valuation, plus one issue affecting the consideration given by Penn Central, are as follows:  (1) Though the parties have agreed that New Haven, as Penn Central's partner in the development of the Grand Central Terminal Properties, is entitled to the capitalized value of 50% of the ""excess income"" from those properties, the bondholders claim that no recognition has been given to New Haven's right to have its share of basic Terminal income, used to defray its share of Terminal expenses, for purposes of determining the fair price Penn Central should pay.(2)  The New Haven owned two 
Page 399 U. S. 394
 large freight yards in the Bronx, which service important industrial enterprises in a 160-acre area and a vital municipal food market installation.  The reorganization court ruled that the ICC had erred in rejecting an appraisal by a witness premised upon the yards' availability for continued industrial occupancy with existing trackage and electrical facilities, in favor of a lower appraisal based on his assumption that, on New Haven's liquidation, the yards would be stripped of those facilities, depressing the value of the land and necessitating substantial removal expenses.  The three-judge court approved the ICC's valuation.  (3) The reorganization court rejected, but the three-judge court approved, the added deductions, one made by the ICC in the net liquidation value as an adjustment for the assumed effect of a year's anticipated delay in securing a certificate of abandonment,
brk:
the other that the ICC made on the basis of a hypothetical sale of all New Haven's land assets at a bulk discount.  (4) The reorganization court found that the ICC had overstated the discount for the projected six-year liquidation.  (5) The ICC ordered Penn Central to assume interim losses during the actual 1 l-month period from merger to inclusion to the extent of a ceiling of $5,000,000 (which constituted about 61% of the total loss).  The reorganization court upheld the ICC and dismissed the bondholders' contention that Penn Central bear all operating losses.  (6) The bondholders attack the ICC's order that New Haven transfer to Penn Central its ownership of stock, which the ICC found worthless, in two concerns.  (7) The bondholders urge that Penn Central should pay an added amount to reflect New Haven's ""going concern"" value as a supplement to the liquidation value.  (8) The New Haven received, in partial payment for the assets transferred to Penn Central, 950,000 shares of Penn Central common stock which were valued at $87.50 per share at the time of the valuation date used by the ICC, but which had declined to $63.38 as of the inclusion date.  To remedy
""the unfairness [arising from] the fact that the purchaser is getting assets of sure present value, while the seller is asked to gamble on the future of Penn Central,""
the reorganization court provided for (and the three-judge court adopted) an ""underwriting"" formula under which Penn Central would be called upon to make up in cash the difference between the market price of Penn Central stock in 1978 and $87.50 per share, unless, before that time, the market price had attained $87.50 for a five-day period.  The bondholders contend that this formula fails 
Page 399 U. S. 395
 to cure the overvaluation.  The bondholders also urge that the continued deficit operation of the New Haven from the inception of the reorganization proceeding in 1961 to the inclusion in Penn Central in 1968 resulted in their being deprived of property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment.
Held:
1. The three-judge court erred in not granting the Government's motion to dismiss to the extent of deferring to the reorganization court in proceedings ultimately involving only the price to be paid for the assets of the debtor's estate.  Pp.  399 U. S. 419-430.
(a) The reorganization court, under  77 of the Bankruptcy Act, and the ICC had full power over the debtor and its property, including the power to formulate and confirm a reorganization plan providing for sale of the debtor's property, and it would have disrupted that plan for the three-judge court to have enjoined certification of the plan by the ICC to the reorganization court.  Pp.  399 U. S. 419-421.
(b) Though transfer of the New Haven assets was also a part of the merger under  5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, and neither court had ""complete"" jurisdiction when the litigation started, the statutory interrelationship between  5 and  77 and the ability of the reorganization court to adjudicate all the inclusion issues made it advisable for the three-judge court to have yielded to the reorganization court, in which primary jurisdiction had vested.  Pp.  399 U. S. 423-427.
(c) When the merger occurred and no question remained of Penn Central's obligation to assume the assets of New Haven, the jurisdiction of the reorganization court became ""complete,"" and the three-judge court had virtually nothing to decide.  Pp.  399 U. S. 427-428.
2. The reorganization court is empowered by Congress to review the plan to determine whether the ICC has followed the statutory mandate that the plan be ""fair and equitable"" and whether there was material evidence to support the agency's conclusion.  Pp.  399 U. S. 431-435.
3. There was no error in the finding of the reorganization court that, under the contractual arrangements, only after Terminal income had been applied to meeting Terminal expenses would the residue be distributed to the two railroads, and thus the basic income could not be ""freed up"" from the obligation to meet Terminal expenses.  Nor did that court err in concluding 
Page 399 U. S. 396
 that New Haven's access rights to the Terminal under the agreements were not entitled to recognition in evaluating New Haven's assets, since those rights were more than offset by New Haven's deficit operations which Penn Central assumed.  Pp.  399 U. S. 438-451.
4. The ICC's adherence to the lower of an expert witness' two estimates of the valuation of the Bronx freight yards was clearly erroneous, as it was based on the premise that New Haven would dismantle the yards upon liquidation of the rest of the railroad even though Penn Central already had a link by which service to the yards would continue, and implied that a common carrier could deny service to industrial and public activities simply because ownership of adjoining trackage had changed hands.  Pp.  399 U. S. 451-457.
5. The reorganization court did not err in disallowing the added deductions.  Pp.  399 U. S. 457-473.
(a) The ICC should not have made a deduction for costs that New Haven would incur during the year's period anticipated to obtain approval for abandonment of train operations, since the valuation date (December 31, 1966) represented not the date on which New Haven would have sought a certificate of abandonment, but the date on which it would have commenced its six-year liquidation sale.  Moreover, since the interested public bodies have not arranged to continue New Haven's transportation system during the long period New Haven has been in reorganization, there is no justification for assuming that, if confronted with an abandonment application, they would do so now, and that a delay would be necessary for the ICC to hear from those communities.  Pp.  399 U. S. 459-466.
(b) The ICC's deduction from the estate's liquidation value, based on a hypothetical sale of all New Haven's land assets in bulk, was properly rejected by the reorganization court, as the ICC had concluded that only its power to compel the sale of the real estate to a single buyer for continued operation justified the bulk sale discount, and there is no evidence in the record that a bulk buyer would agree to take over New Haven properties for continued service at any price.  Pp.  399 U. S. 468-473.
6. The adjustment made by the reorganization court in the ICC's erroneous computation of the discount to present values of New Haven's liquidation proceeds over the six-year liquidation period is affirmed as being substantially free from error.  Pp.  399 U. S. 473-476. 
Page 399 U. S. 397

7. The payment made by Penn Central for New Haven's interim operating losses between the effective date of the merger and the date of inclusion was in accordance with a formula devised by the ICC in its inclusion report that constituted a pragmatic compromise between the competing interests of the Penn Central and the bondholders.  The reorganization court's acceptance of that disposition is affirmed.  Pp.  399 U. S. 476-479.
8. The argument of the Bondholders Committee that the ICC erred in ordering the transfer to Penn Central of stocks that New Haven held in two concerns, which the ICC found were valueless, is foreclosed by res judicata, since the bondholders had not appealed the order of the reorganization court directing the transfer of New Haven assets.  Pp.  399 U. S. 479-481.
9. The bondholders' contention that Penn Central should pay an added amount for New Haven's ""going concern"" value is without merit, being entirely at odds with the liquidation hypothesis on which appraisal of New Haven's assets was predicated.  Pp.  399 U. S. 481-482.
10. The ""underwriting plan"" of the reorganization court added to the assessment of present worth of the Penn Central stock both a reasonable assurance of realization of such worth and the opportunity of additional gain, and, on the basis of the record before that court at the time of its order, the package constituted full compensation for the assets transferred to Penn Central.  In view, however, of the impact of recent events, which make it possible that this aspect of the decree is not realistic, further proceedings will be needed to reassess the consideration that Penn Central must give in exchange for the New Haven properties.  Pp.  399 U. S. 483-489.
11. The substantial losses to the bondholders that occurred during the course of the reorganization proceedings did not result in any unconstitutional taking of the property of the bondholders, whose rights are not absolute and who will be receiving the highest and best price for the debtor's assets as of the valuation date.  Moreover, the bondholders did not petition the reorganization court to dismiss the proceedings, and thereby permit foreclosure on the mortgage liens, until well after the valuation date.  Nor is the price Penn Central must pay unfair in view of the benefits that were anticipated from the merger.  Pp.  399 U. S. 489-495.
Nos. 914, 916, 920, 1038, and 1057, 304 F.Supp. 793 and 1136, affirmed in part and vacated and remanded in part; Nos. 915, 917, and 921, 305 F.Supp. 1049, vacated and remanded.

			"|"New Haven Inclusion Cases*
Argued March 30, 1970
Decided June 29, 1970.
399 U.S. 392

Syllabus 
When this Court sustained the Penn Central merger (389 U.S. 486), it upheld the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in conditioning its approval of the merger on inclusion as an operating entity of the New York, New Haven & Hartford R. Co. (New Haven), whose continued operation the ICC had found to be essential.  Since 1961, the New Haven had been under reorganization proceedings under  77 of the Bankruptcy Act, and was close to financial collapse.  The basic issue in these cases concerns the propriety of the financial terms for the inclusion.  The ICC had remitted the parties to negotiate the terms of the inclusion, and, after considering their appraisals issued its inclusion report, in which it concluded that the net liquidation value of New Haven's assets (after deducting liquidation expenses and making a discount to present worth on the basis of hypothesized receipts over the six-year period anticipated for liquidation) was $125,000,000, a figure that the ICC found ""just and reasonable"" as a condition of the merger under  5 of the Interstate Commerce Act and ""fair and equitable"" as part of a plan of reorganization under  77 of the Bankruptcy Act.  The New Haven bondholders thereupon commenced litigation for review of the inclusion report (in its aspect as a condition of the merger) in the three-judge District Court for the Southern District of New York,

 PER CURIAM.
 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted and the judgment is reversed, Redrup v. New York, 386 U.S. 767.
 MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.
 I am not persuaded that the First and Fourteenth Amendments necessarily prescribe a national and uniform measure - rather than one capable of some flexibility and resting on concepts of reasonableness - of what each of our several States constitutionally may do to regulate obscene products within its borders.
 Here a Minnesota trial court (just as the Ohio trial court did in Walker v. Ohio, 398 U.S. 434 (1970)), endeavored to apply standards articulated by this Court in prior cases, and embodied in a precisely worded Minnesota statute, and reached the conclusion that the materials in question were obscene within the meaning of that statutory definition. Six of the seven Justices of the Supreme Court of that State, citing Redrup v. New York, 386 U.S. 767 (1967), and other decisions of this Court, have identified the offending material ""for what it is,"" have described it as dealing ""with filth for the sake of filth,"" and have held it obscene as a matter of law. 286 Minn. 92, 95, 174 N. W. 2d 700, 702. I cannot agree that the Minnesota trial court and those six justices are so obviously misguided in their holding that 
Page 399 U.S. 524, 525
 they are to be summarily reversed on the authority of Redrup.
 At this still, for me, unsettled stage in the development of state law of obscenity in the federal constitutional context I find myself generally in accord with the views expressed by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 496, 500-503 (1957); Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 203-204 (1964); and Memoirs v.

 Ralph RUSSELLv. Martin P. CATHERWOOD.No. 1978, Misc. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October Term, 1969. 
 June 29, 1970
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Appellate Division, Supreme Court, New York, Third Judicial Department. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Mr. Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS joins, dissenting. 
 The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court has interpreted 593 of the New York Unemployment Insurance Law as requiring an applicant for unemployment benefits, as a condition to receiving those benefits, to stand ready to accept suitable employment when tendered, even though acceptance of the employment would compel him to join a union as to which he has 'conscientious objections.' The decision of the New York courts places a burden on the petitioner's freedom of association-a freedom we have placed on a high, if indeed not a 'preferred' plane. See NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958). Consequently, this case may well present important issues that ought to be decided, particularly if the result of the New York holding is that a worker must decide between a deeply felt belief which falls in the First Amendment area, and crucial unemployment benefits. 
 The Industrial Commissioner, if we are to place any weight on his response here, has shown that he considers the petitioner bound to accept a job tender even when his acceptance requires union membership that is repugnant to him. It may be that on plenary consideration we would conclude that the Constitution requires the respondent to provide employment that does not conflict with the worker's freedom of association, as might be indicated under Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963). In that case we held unemployment benefits could not be denied because of refusal to accept employment that required a member of the Seventh 
Page 399 U.S. 936 , 937
 Day Adventists to work on her Sabbath. See also NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 438 (1963). 
 I would grant the writ because I believe that the petitioner has presented a substantial question and possibly one of important constitutional dimensions that warrants plenary-not summary-consideration.

|399 u.s. 149|"California v. Green
No. 387
Argued April 20, 1970
Decided June 23, 1970
399 U.S. 149

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of furnishing marihuana to a minor in violation of California law, chiefly on the basis of evidence consisting of prior inconsistent statements made by the minor (Porter) (1) at respondent's preliminary hearing and (2) to a police officer.  These statements were admitted under California Evidence Code  1235 to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein.  The District Court of Appeal reversed.  The California Supreme Court affirmed, and held  1235 unconstitutional insofar as it permitted the substantive use of a witness' prior inconsistent Statements even though such statements were subject to cross-examination at a prior hearing.
Held:
1. The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, is not violated by admitting a declarant's out-of-court statements as long as he is testifying as a witness at trial and is subject to full cross-examination.  The purposes of the Amendment are satisfied at the time of trial, even if not before, since the witness is under oath, is subject to cross-examination, and his demeanor can be observed by the trier of fact.  Pp.  399 U. S. 153-164.
2. Even in the absence of an opportunity for full cross-examination at trial, the admission into evidence of the preliminary hearing testimony would not violate the Constitution.  For the preliminary hearing in this case (where Porter was under oath, and where respondent was represented by counsel and had full opportunity for cross-examination) was not significantly different from an actual trial as far as the purposes of the Confrontation Clause are concerned, and it has long been held that admitting the prior trial testimony of an unavailable witness does not violate that clause.  A different result should not follow where, as in this case, the witness was actually produced.  Pp.  399 U. S. 165-168.
3. The question whether Porter's claimed lapse of memory at the trial about important events described in his earlier statement to the officer so affected respondent's right to cross-examine as 
Page 399 U. S. 150
 to make a critical difference in the application of the Confrontation Clause is an issue that should first be resolved by the state court.  Pp.  399 U. S. 168-170.

Argued April 20, 1970
Decided June 23, 1970
399 U.S. 149

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of furnishing marihuana to a minor in violation of California law, chiefly on the basis of evidence consisting of prior inconsistent statements made by the minor (Porter) (1) at respondent's preliminary hearing and (2) to a police officer.  These statements were admitted under California Evidence Code  1235 to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein.  The District Court of Appeal reversed.  The California Supreme Court affirmed, and held  1235 unconstitutional insofar as it permitted the substantive use of a witness' prior inconsistent Statements even though such statements were subject to cross-examination at a prior hearing.
Held:
1. The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, is not violated by admitting a declarant's out-of-court statements as long as he is testifying as a witness at trial and is subject to full cross-examination.  The purposes of the Amendment are satisfied at the time of trial, even if not before, since the witness is under oath, is subject to cross-examination, and his demeanor can be observed by the trier of fact.  Pp.  399 U. S. 153-164.
2. Even in the absence of an opportunity for full cross-examination at trial, the admission into evidence of the preliminary hearing testimony would not violate the Constitution.  For the preliminary hearing in this case (where Porter was under oath, and where respondent was represented by counsel and had full opportunity for cross-examination) was not significantly different from an actual trial as far as the purposes of the Confrontation Clause are concerned, and it has long been held that admitting the prior trial testimony of an unavailable witness does not violate that clause.  A different result should not follow where, as in this case, the witness was actually produced.  Pp.  399 U. S. 165-168.
3. The question whether Porter's claimed lapse of memory at the trial about important events described in his earlier statement to the officer so affected respondent's right to cross-examine as

 to make a critical difference in the application of the Confrontation Clause is an issue that should first be resolved by the state court.  Pp.  399 U. S. 168-170.

No. 1066
Argued March 31, 1970
Decided June 23, 1970
399 U.S. 204

Syllabus 
The City of Phoenix held an election in June, 1969 ,at which the issuance of general obligation bonds to finance various municipal improvements was approved.  Under Arizona law, only real property taxpayers were permitted to vote.  Six days after the election, this Court held, in Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701, that restricting the franchise to property taxpayers in elections on revenue bonds violated the Equal Protection Clause.  In August, 1969, appellee, who owned no realty, challenged the franchise restriction and attacked the validity of the June election.  The District Court, finding no significant difference between revenue bonds and general obligation bonds, held the nonproperty owner exclusion unconstitutional.  It declared the June bond election invalid, since the authorization for the issuance of the bonds was not final on the date of the Cipriano decision.
Held:
1. The Equal Protection Clause does not permit a State to restrict the franchise to real property taxpayers in elections to approve the issuance of general obligation bonds, as the differences between the interests of property owners and nonproperty owners are not sufficiently substantial to justify excluding the latter from voting.  Pp.  399 U. S. 207-213.
2. This decision will apply only to authorizations for general obligation bonds that are not final as of the date of this decision.  Pp.  399 U. S. 213-215.

399 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Petitioners were convicted of assault with intent to murder and the Alabama Court of Appeals affirmed.  They argue that (1) the in-court identifications that were made of them were fatally tainted by a prejudicial station house lineup (which occurred prior to United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, and Gilbert v. California, 388 U. S. 263, requiring the exclusion of such tainted in-court identification evidence), and (2) that Alabama's failure to provide them with appointed counsel at the preliminary hearing, a ""critical stage"" of the prosecution, unconstitutionally denied them the assistance of counsel.  The victim testified that, ""in the car lights,"" while ""looking straight at him,"" he saw the petitioner who shot him, and saw the other petitioner ""face to face.""  He also stated that he identified the gunman at the station house before the formal lineup began, and identified the other before he spoke the words used by the assailants.  The sole purposes of a preliminary hearing under Alabama law are to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant presenting the case to a grand jury, and to fix bail for bailable offenses.  The trial court scrupulously followed Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, which prohibits the use of testimony given at a pretrial proceeding where the accused did not have the benefit of cross-examination by and through counsel.
Held:  The convictions are vacated, and the case is remanded to determine whether the denial of counsel at the preliminary hearing was harmless error.  Pp.  399 U. S. 3-20.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, for the three points enumerated directly below, and by MR. JUSTICE BLACK, for the third point, concluded that:
1. On this record, the trial court did not err in finding that the victim's in-court identifications did not stem from a lineup procedure ""so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.""  Pp.  399 U. S. 3.
2. The preliminary hearing is a ""critical stage"" of Alabama's criminal process at which the indigent accused is ""as much entitled to such aid [of counsel] . . . as at the trial itself.""  Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45,  287 U. S. 57.  Pp.  399 U. S. 7-10.
3. Although nothing that occurred at the preliminary hearing was used at the trial, the record does not reveal whether petitioners were otherwise prejudiced by absence of counsel at the hearing, and the question whether the denial of counsel was harmless error should be answered in the first instance by the Alabama courts.  Pp.  399 U. S. 10-11.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK concluded that:
1.

Syllabus 
Police officers, possessing warrants for appellant's arrest, were watching the house where he resided.  They observed what they suspected was an exchange of narcotics between a known addict and appellant outside the house, after appellant had gone into the house and brought something out to the addict.  They arrested appellant at the front steps and announced that they would search the house.  A search of the then-unoccupied house disclosed narcotics in a bedroom.

No. 830
Argued April 27, 1970
Decided June 22, 1970
399 U.S. 42

Syllabus 
Petitioner was one of four men arrested after the auto in which they were riding was stopped by police shortly after an armed robbery of a service station.  The arrests resulted from information supplied by the service station attendant and bystanders.  The car was driven to a police station, where a search disclosed two revolvers, one loaded with dumdum bullets, and cards bearing the name of an attendant at another service station who had been robbed at gunpoint a week earlier.  In a warrant-authorized search of petitioner's home the next day, police found and seized ammunition, including dumdum bullets similar to those found in one of the guns in the car.  At his first trial, which ended in a mistrial, petitioner was represented by a Legal Aid Society attorney.  Another Legal Aid Society attorney, who represented him at the second trial, did not confer with petitioner until a few minutes before that trial began.  The materials taken from the car and the bullets seized from petitioner's home were introduced in evidence, and petitioner was convicted of robbery of both service stations.  Petitioner did not take a direct appeal, but sought, unsuccessfully, a writ of habeas corpus in the Pennsylvania courts and in the federal courts, challenging the admissibility of the materials taken from the car and the ammunition seized in his home, and claiming that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.  The Court of Appeals dealt with the claim that the attorney's lack of preparation resulted in the failure to exclude the guns and ammunition by finding harmless error in the admission of the bullets and ruling that the materials seized from the car were admissible in evidence, and concluded that the claim of prejudice from substitution of counsel was without substantial basis.
Held:
1. The warrantless search of the automobile was valid, and the materials seized therefrom were properly introduced in evidence.  Pp.  399 U. S. 46-52.
(a) The search, made at the police station some time after the arrest, cannot be justified as incident to the arrest.  Pp.  399 U. S. 46-47.

(b) Just as there was probable cause to arrest the occupants of the car, there was probable cause to search the car for guns and stolen money.  Pp.  399 U. S. 47-48.
(c) If there is probable cause, an automobile, because of its mobility, may be searched without a warrant in circumstances that would not justify a warrantless search of a house or office.  Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132.  Pp.  399 U. S. 48-51.
(d) Given probable cause, there is no difference under the Fourth Amendment between (1) seizing and holding a car before presenting the issue of probable cause to a magistrate, and (2) carrying out an immediate warrantless search.  Pp.  399 U. S. 51-52.
2. The findings of the District Court and the Court of Appeals that, if there was error in admitting in evidence the ammunition seized from petitioner's house, it was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt, are affirmed on the basis of the Court's review of the record.  Pp.  399 U. S. 52-53.

|399 u.s. 78|"Williams v. Florida
No. 927
Argued March 4, 1970
Decided June 22, 1970
399 U.S. 78

Syllabus 
Florida has a rule of criminal procedure requiring a defendant who intends to rely on an alibi to disclose to the prosecution the names of his alibi witnesses; the prosecution must, in turn, disclose to the defense the names of witnesses to rebut the alibi.  Failure to comply can result in exclusion of alibi evidence at trial (except for the defendant's own testimony) or, in the case of the State, exclusion of the rebuttal evidence.  Petitioner, who was charged with robbery, complied with the rule after failing to be relieved of its requirements.  His pretrial motion to impanel a 12-man jury, instead of the six-man jury Florida law provides for noncapital cases, was denied.  At trial, the State used a deposition of petitioner's alibi witness to impeach the witness.  Petitioner was convicted, and the appellate court affirmed.  Petitioner claims that his Fifth Amendment rights were violated, on the ground that the notice-of-alibi rule required him to furnish the State with information useful in convicting him, and that his Sixth Amendment right was violated on the ground that the six-man jury deprived him of the right to ""trial by jury"" under the Sixth Amendment.
Held:
1. Florida's notice-of-alibi rule does not violate the Fifth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  399 U. S. 80-86.
(a) This discovery rule is designed to enhance the search for truth in criminal trials by giving both the accused and the State opportunity to investigate certain facts crucial to the issue of guilt or innocence, and comports with requirements for due process and a fair trial.  Pp.  399 U. S. 81 82.
(b) The rule, at most, accelerated the timing of petitioner's disclosure of an alibi defense, and thus did not violate the privilege against compelled self-incrimination.  Pp.  399 U. S. 82-86.
2. The constitutional guarantee of a trial by jury does not require that jury membership be fixed at 12, a historically accidental figure.  Although accepted at common law, the Framers did not explicitly intend to forever codify as a constitutional requirement a feature not essential to the Sixth Amendment's purpose of interposing 
Page 399 U. S. 79
 between the defendant and the prosecution the common sense judgment of his peers.  Pp.  399 U. S. 86-103.

 Nos. 188, 927. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 22, 1970
 
 Mr. Justice HARLAN, dissenting in No. 188, and concurring in the result in No. 927. 
 In Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 ( 1968), the Court held, over my dissent, joined by Mr. Justice Stewart, that a state criminal defendant is entitled to a jury trial in any case which, if brought in a federal court, would require a jury under the Sixth Amendment. Today the Court concludes, in No. 188, Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, that New York cannot constitutionally provide that misdemeanors carrying sentences up to one year shall be tried in New York City without a jury. [Footnote 1] At 
Page 399 U.S. 117 , 118
 the same time the Court holds in No. 927, Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, that Florida's six-member-jury statute satisfies the Sixth Amendment as carried to the States by the Duncan holding. [Footnote 2] The necessary consequence of this decision is that 12-member juries are not constitutionally required in federal criminal trials either. 
 The historical argument by which the Court undertakes to justify its view that the Sixth Amendment does not require 12-member juries is, in my opinion, much too thin to mask the true thrust of this decision. The decision evinces, I think, a recognition that the 'incorporationist' view of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which underlay Duncan and is now carried forward into Baldwin, must be tempered to allow the States more elbow room in ordering their own criminal systems. With that much I agree. But to accomplish this by diluting constitutional protections within the federal system itself is something to which I cannot possibly subscribe. Tempering the rigor of Duncan should be done forthrightly, by facing up to the fact that at least in this area the 'incorporation' doctrine does not fit well with our federal structure, and by the same token that Duncan was wrongly decided. 
 I would sustain both the Florida and New York statutes on the constitutional premises discussed in my dissenting opinion in Duncan, 391 U.S., at 161, 88 S.Ct. at 1453-1454 et seq. In taking that course in Baldwin, I cannot, in a matter that goes to the very pulse of sound constitutional adjudication, consider myself constricted by stare decisis. 3 [399 U.S. 117 , 119]

 Marietta NORTON et al.v. The DISCIPLINE COMMITTEE OF EAST TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY et al.No. 1011. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 22, 1970
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN join, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were suspended as students at East Tennessee State University for distributing leaflets critical of the university administration. They brought an action in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. 1983 seeking reinstatement and expungement of the records of their suspension, claiming that their rights to freedom of speech and procedural due process had been violated. The District Court denied the requested relief after holding a full evidentiary hearing, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, Judge Celebrezze dissenting. 419 F.2d 195 (C.A. 6th Cir. 1969). I would grant certiorari. 
 The pamphlets involved in this case were published and distributed by students angered by what they regarded as the backward policies of the university administration and the apathy of their fellow students toward these policies. They criticize, often in a crude and sarcastic tone, the positions of the administration on such matters as dress, social regulations, ROTC, campus police behavior, and censorship of the college newspaper. They go on to draw unfavorable comparisons between the response of students at East Tennessee and the response of other students in Czechoslovakia, France, and elsewhere in this country, and call upon students to 'stand up and fight' for their 'constitutional right to protest, demostrate and demand their rights.'* 
Page 399 U.S. 906 , 907
 No charges were brought against these students that the time, place, or manner of distribution were in any way improper. The sole charge was based squarely on the content of the pamphlets-namely, that they were 'of a false, seditious and inflammatory nature.' There is no evidence that the pamphlets created any disturbance on campus, nor is there any concrete evidence from which one could infer any substantial danger that they would. Rather there is only the conclusory testimony of university officials that the pamphlets 'could conceivably' have caused an eruption, and reference to 'fears that we might have serious consequences.' The only support given to these assertions is the description of an incident in which some 25 students visited the Dean after the pamphlets were circulated and stated that they 'wanted to get rid of this group of agitators.' 
 It seems to me altogether too late in the constitutional history of this country to argue that individuals can properly be punished for pamphleteering in these circumstances. These pamphlets are similar in some ways to the broadsides circulated by popular writers in England and the Colonies, official suppression of which helped lead to adoption of the First Amendment; to the writings of Republican polemicists, against which the Sedition Act prosecutions were aimed-prosecutions this Court has said violated the First Amendment, New York Times Co. v.

No. 269
Argued April 27, 1970
Decided June 15, 1970
398 U.S. 323

Syllabus 
Petitioner was tried for murder, found guilty of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter, and sentenced to 10 to 15 years' imprisonment.  Following reversal of that conviction on appeal, he was retried for murder, despite his double jeopardy claim, again found guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.  The Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the second conviction, rejecting, on the authority of Brantley v. State, 132 Ga. 573, 64 S.E. 676, aff'd, 217 U. S. 284, petitioner's contention that his retrial for murder constituted double jeopardy.  The Georgia Supreme Court denied certiorari.
Held:
1. Though under the continuing jeopardy principle (see Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184,  355 U. S. 189), petitioner could be retried for voluntary manslaughter, the lesser included offense, he could not, under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, be retried and subjected to the hazard of conviction for murder, of which he had been impliedly acquitted when the jury returned a verdict on the lesser included offense but refused to return a guilty verdict on that greater offense.  Brantley, supra, is deemed overruled by this Court's subsequent decisions.  Pp.  398 U. S. 326-330.
2. In view of the hazard of conviction of murder in the second trial and the possible effect upon the jury of the murder charge, the second jeopardy was not harmless error.  Pp.  398 U. S. 331-332.
3. The issue whether petitioner can be retried for voluntary manslaughter under Georgia law is to be resolved on remand.  P.  398 U. S. 332.
118 Ga.App. 207, 163 S.E.2d 243, reversed and remanded.

Following reversal of that conviction on appeal, he was retried for murder, despite his double jeopardy claim, again found guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.  The Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the second conviction, rejecting, on the authority of Brantley v. State, 132 Ga. 573, 64 S.E. 676, aff'd, 217 U. S. 284, petitioner's contention that his retrial for murder constituted double jeopardy.  The Georgia Supreme Court denied certiorari.
Held:
1. Though under the continuing jeopardy principle (see Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184,  355 U. S. 189), petitioner could be retried for voluntary manslaughter, the lesser included offense, he could not, under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, be retried and subjected to the hazard of conviction for murder, of which he had been impliedly acquitted when the jury returned a verdict on the lesser included offense but refused to return a guilty verdict on that greater offense.  Brantley, supra, is deemed overruled by this Court's subsequent decisions.  Pp.  398 U. S. 326-330.
2. In view of the hazard of conviction of murder in the second trial and the possible effect upon the jury of the murder charge, the second jeopardy was not harmless error.  Pp.  398 U. S. 331-332.
3. The issue whether petitioner can be retried for voluntary manslaughter under Georgia law is to be resolved on remand.  P.  398 U. S. 332.
118 Ga.App. 207, 163 S.E.2d 243, reversed and remanded.

No. 76
Argued January 20, 1970
Decided June 15, 1970
398 U.S. 333

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of refusing to submit to induction into the Armed Forces despite his claim for conscientious objector status under  6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act.  That provision exempts from military service persons who by reason of ""religious training and belief"" are conscientiously opposed to war in any form, that term being defined in the Act as ""belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation"" but not including ""essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal code.""  In his exemption application, petitioner stated that he could not affirm or deny belief in a ""Supreme Being,"" and struck the words ""my religious training and"" from the form.  He affirmed that he held deep conscientious scruples against participating in wars where people were killed.  The Court of Appeals, while noting that petitioner's ""beliefs are held with the strength of more traditional religious convictions,"" concluded that those beliefs were not sufficiently ""religious"" to meet the terms of  6(j), and affirmed the conviction.  Petitioner contends that the Act violates the First Amendment prohibition of establishment of religion, and that his conviction should be set aside on the basis of United States v. Seeger, 380 U. S. 163, which held that the test of religious belief under  6(j) is whether it is a sincere and meaningful belief occupying in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualified for the exemption.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  398 U. S. 335-367.
404 F.2d 1078, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, joined by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded that:
This case is controlled by United States v. Seeger, supra, to which it is factually similar.  Under Seeger,  6(j) is not limited to those whose opposition to war is prompted by orthodox or parochial religious beliefs.  A registrant's conscientious objection to all war is ""religious"" within the meaning of  6(j) if this 
Page 398 U. S. 334
 opposition stems from the registrant's moral, ethical, or religious beliefs about what is right and wrong and these beliefs are held with the strength of traditional religious convictions.  In view of the broad scope of the word ""religious,"" a registrant's characterization of his beliefs as ""nonreligious"" is not a reliable guide to those administering the exemption.  Pp.  398 U. S. 335-344.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concluded that:
1. The language of  6(j) cannot be construed (as it was in United States v. Seeger, supra, and as it is in the prevailing opinion) to exempt from military service all individuals who in good faith oppose all war, it being clear from both the legislative history and textual analysis of that provision that Congress used the words ""by reason of religious training and belief"" to limit religion to its theistic sense, and to confine it to formal, organized worship or shared beliefs by a recognizable and cohesive group.  Pp. 348-354.
2. The question of the constitutionality of  6(j) cannot be avoided by a construction of that provision that is contrary to its intended meaning.  Pp.  398 U. S. 354-356.
3. Section 6(j) contravenes the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by exempting those whose conscientious objection claims are founded on a theistic belief, while not exempting those whose claims are based on a secular belief.  To comport with that clause, an exemption must be ""neutral"" and include those whose belief emanates from a purely moral, ethical, or philosophical source.  Pp.  398 U. S. 356-361.
4. In view of the broad discretion conferred by the Act's severability clause and the longstanding policy of exempting religious conscientious objectors, the Court, rather than nullifying the exemption entirely, should extend its coverage to those like petitioner who have been unconstitutionally excluded from its coverage.  Pp.  398 U. S. 361-367.

No. 655
Argued April 20, 1970

398 U.S. 410

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who had been classified I-A, applied to his local Selective Service Board for a I-O classification as a conscientious objector, filing the appropriate form with detailed answers.  Letters were submitted by five persons attesting to the sincerity of petitioner's belief.  At petitioner's request, the board granted him a personal appearance.  He was notified that the classification had not been reopened and that the interview was a matter of courtesy.  Under Selective Service regulations, reopening would have entitled petitioner to an administrative appeal from the rejection of his conscientious objector claim.  Petitioner then refused to submit to induction, and was tried and convicted for violating 50 U.S.C. App  462(a).
Held:  Where a registrant makes nonfrivolous allegations of facts not previously considered by his board, that, if true, would be sufficient under the regulations to warrant granting a reclassification, the board must reopen the classification, unless the truth of the new allegations is conclusively refuted by other reliable information in registrant's file, thus affording the registrant an administrative appeal from an adverse determination on the merits.

||"Atlantic Coast L. R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers
No. 477
Argued March 2-3, 1970
Decided June 8, 1970
398 U.S. 281

Syllabus 
As part of its dispute with the Florida East Coast railroad (FEC) respondent Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) in 1967 began picketing a switching yard owned and operated by Atlantic Coast Line railroad (ACL).  ACL's request for an injunction to halt the picketing was denied by the Federal District Court, which held that the BLE was ""free to engage in self-help,"" and that the Norris-LaGuardia Act and  20 of the Clayton Act were applicable.  ACL then obtained an injunction from a Florida court.  After the decision in Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U. S. 369 (1969), holding that unions had a federally protected right to picket the terminal without interference by state court injunctions, respondent union moved in state court to dissolve the injunction, but the state judge held that Jacksonville Terminal was not controlling, and denied the motion.  The union then returned to the District Court and requested an injunction against the enforcement of the state injunction, which the District Court granted. The Court of Appeals affirmed.  The union contends that the federal injunction was proper under 28 U.S.C.  2283 either ""to protect or effectuate"" the District Court's 1967 denial of an injunction, or as ""necessary in aid of"" that court's jurisdiction.
Held:  The federal injunction was not justified under the exceptions in  2283, and thus was improperly issued in this case.  Pp.  398 U. S. 285-297.
(a) A federal injunction against state court proceedings otherwise proper under general equitable principles must be based on one of the specific statutory exceptions to  2283.  Amalgamated Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros., 348 U. S. 511,  348 U. S. 515-516.  Pp.  398 U. S. 286-287.
(b) The District Court's determination in 1967 that the union had a right to ""engage in self-help"" under federal law, was not a decision that federal law precluded an injunction based on state law.  Pp.  398 U. S. 289-291. 
Page 398 U. S. 282

(c) In 1969, the union, in effect, was attempting to get the District Court to decide that the state court erred in distinguishing Jacksonville Terminal, but such attempt to seek federal appellate review of a state decision cannot be justified as necessary ""to protect or effectuate"" the 1967 order.  Pp.  398 U. S. 291-293.
(d) Since the state and federal courts had concurrent jurisdiction in this case neither court could prevent a party from simultaneously pursuing claims in both courts, and an injunction was not ""necessary in aid of"" the District Court's jurisdiction because the state court may have acted improperly in light of Jacksonville Terminal, as the state court's assumption of jurisdiction over the state law claims did not hinder the federal court's jurisdiction.  Pp.  398 U. S. 294-296.
(e) While the union cannot obtain direct review of the state court decision in the lower federal courts, it can, if adversely affected by the decision or if faced with immediate irreparable injury, seek relief in the Florida appellate courts, and possibly in this Court.  P.  398 U. S. 296.

No. 477
Argued March 2-3, 1970
Decided June 8, 1970
398 U.S. 281

Syllabus 
As part of its dispute with the Florida East Coast railroad (FEC) respondent Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) in 1967 began picketing a switching yard owned and operated by Atlantic Coast Line railroad (ACL).  ACL's request for an injunction to halt the picketing was denied by the Federal District Court, which held that the BLE was ""free to engage in self-help,"" and that the Norris-LaGuardia Act and  20 of the Clayton Act were applicable.  ACL then obtained an injunction from a Florida court.  After the decision in Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U. S. 369 (1969), holding that unions had a federally protected right to picket the terminal without interference by state court injunctions, respondent union moved in state court to dissolve the injunction, but the state judge held that Jacksonville Terminal was not controlling, and denied the motion.  The union then returned to the District Court and requested an injunction against the enforcement of the state injunction, which the District Court granted. The Court of Appeals affirmed.  The union contends that the federal injunction was proper under 28 U.S.C.  2283 either ""to protect or effectuate"" the District Court's 1967 denial of an injunction, or as ""necessary in aid of"" that court's jurisdiction.

398 U.S. 74

Syllabus 
On December 13, 1965, respondent, the Judicial Council of the Tenth Circuit, acting under 28 U.S.C.  332, issued an order finding that petitioner was unable or unwilling to discharge his duties efficiently as a district judge for the Western District of Oklahoma (hereafter the district) and directing that he should not act in any case then or thereafter pending therein, that, until the Council's further order, no cases filed in the district were to be assigned to petitioner, and that, if all the active judges in the district could not agree upon the division of business and case assignments necessitated by the order, the Council, acting under 28 U.S.C.  137, would make such division and assignments as it deemed proper.  Petitioner filed with this Court a motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of prohibition and/or mandamus directed to the Council and sought a stay of its order.  The Court denied a stay on the ground that the order was interlocutory and that petitioner would be permitted to appear at further proceedings before the Council.  A hearing, scheduled for February 10, 1966, was not held, the Council having been advised that no district judge, including petitioner, desired a hearing.  On February 4 the Council, acting under  137 and 332, issued an order, which superseded its previous orders dealing with petitioner, authorizing petitioner to sit on cases assigned to him before December 28, 1965, and assigning to other judges of the district cases filed thereafter.  On September 1, 1967, those judges and petitioner (who had previously expressed disagreement with the February 4 Order and the Council's ""illegal effort"" to create a situation in which it could assign cases under 28 U.S.C.  137) advised the Council that ""the current order for the division of business in this district is agreeable under the circumstances.""  The Council, which had considered modifying the February 4, 1966, Order in view of the small number of cases petitioner had then pending, thereupon let the February 4 Order stand.  Petitioner contends that the Council's orders relating to the assignment of cases in 
Page 398 U. S. 75
 the district impose unlawful conditions on the exercise of his constitutional powers as a judge and usurp the impeachment powers vested in Congress.  He claims that his acquiescence in the division of the business of the district resulted from ""duress"" of the December 13 Order, and that it was also a matter of ""strategy"" to avoid the appearance of the absence of agreement among the district judges as to a division of work which would enable the Council to act under  137.  The Council contends, inter alia, that its action was solely administrative, and cannot be reviewed as an original proceeding by this Court.
Held:  Whether or not the Council's action is reviewable here, petitioner, in the present posture of this case, is not entitled to the extraordinary remedy that he seeks, since, after expressly acquiescing in the division of business in the district, following revocation of the Order of December 13 1965, by the Order of February 4, 1966, he has not sought relief either from the Council or other tribunal, and such relief may yet be open to him.

398 U.S. 144

Syllabus 
Petitioner is a white school teacher who was refused service in respondent's lunchroom when she was accompanied by six Negro students, and who was arrested for vagrancy by the Hattiesburg, Mississippi, police when she left respondent's premises.  She filed a complaint in the Federal District Court to recover damages alleging deprivation of her right under the Equal Protection Clause not to be discriminated against on the basis of race.  The complaint had two counts, each based on 42 U.S.C.  1983:  (1) that she had been refused service because she was a ""Caucasian in the company of Negroes"" (under which she sought to prove that the refusal to serve her was pursuant to a ""custom of the community to segregate races in public eating places"") and (2) that the refusal of service and the arrest were the product of a conspiracy between respondent and the police (under which she alleged that the policeman who arrested her was in the store at the time of the refusal of service).  The District Court ruled that, to recover under the first count, petitioner would have to prove a specific ""custom of refusing service to whites who were in the company of Negroes"" that was ""enforced by the State"" under its criminal trespass statute.  The court directed a verdict for respondent on this count because petitioner failed to prove other instances of whites having been refused service while in company of Negroes in Hattiesburg.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that  1983 requires the discriminatory custom be proved to exist in the locale where the discrimination took place and in the State generally, and that petitioner's proof was deficient on both points.  The second count was dismissed before trial by the District Court on a motion for summary judgment, since petitioner ""failed to allege any facts from which a conspiracy might be inferred.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed this determination.
Held:
1. The District Court, on the basis of this record, erred in granting summary judgment on the conspiracy count.  Pp.  398 U. S. 149-161. 
Page 398 U. S. 145

(a) The involvement of a policeman, a state official, whether or not his actions were lawful or authorized, in the alleged conspiracy would plainly provide the state action needed to show a direct violation of petitioner's Fourteenth Amendment rights entitling her to relief under  1983, and private persons involved in such a conspiracy are acting ""under color"" of law, and can be liable under  1983.  Pp.  398 U. S. 150-152.
(b) Respondent did not carry out its burden, as the party moving for summary judgment of showing the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact, as it did not foreclose the possibility that there was a policeman in the store while the petitioner was awaiting service (from which the jury could infer an understanding between the officer and an employee of respondent that petitioner not be served), and its failure to meet that burden requires reversal.  Pp.  398 U. S. 153-159.
(c) Because respondent failed to meet its initial burden as the party moving for summary judgment, petitioner was not required to come forward with suitable opposing affidavits under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 56(e).  Pp.  398 U. S. 159-161.
2. Petitioner will have established a claim under  1983 for violation of her equal protection rights if she proves that she was refused service by respondent because of a state-enforced custom requiring racial segregation in Hattiesburg restaurants.  Pp.  398 U. S. 161-174.
(a) Based upon the language of the statute legislative history, and judicial decisions, the words ""under color of a . . . custom or usage, of [a] State,"" in  1983, mean that the ""custom or usage"" must have the force of law by virtue of the persistent practices of state officials.  Pp.  398 U. S. 162-169.
(b) Petitioner would have shown an abridgment of her constitutional right of equal protection if she proved that respondent refused her service because of a state-enforced custom of racial segregation in public restaurants.  Pp.  398 U. S. 169-171.
(c) The District Court erred in its implicit assumption that a custom can have the force of law only if it is enforced by a state statute.  Pp.  398 U. S. 171-172.
(d) The District Court's ruling that proving a ""custom"" in this case required demonstrating a specific practice of not serving white persons in the company of Negroes in public restaurants was too narrow as the relevant inquiry is whether there was a longstanding and still prevailing state-enforced custom of segregating the races in public eating places.  P.  398 U. S. 173.

Syllabus 
Petitioner company and respondent union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement containing a provision that all controversies concerning its interpretation or application should be resolved by arbitration and that there should be no work stoppage, lockout, picketing, or boycotts during the life of the contract.  A dispute arose and, when petitioner did not accede to respondent's demand, a strike was called and the union began to picket petitioner's establishment.  Petitioner's effort to invoke the contract's arbitration procedures being unsuccessful, it sought injunctive relief in the state court, which issued a temporary restraining order.  The union removed the case to the Federal District Court, which ordered arbitration and enjoined the strike and the picketing.  The Court of Appeals reversed, considering itself bound by Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, 370 U. S. 195 (1962), which held that  4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act bars a federal district court from enjoining a strike in breach of a no-strike clause in a collective bargaining agreement, even though that agreement contains binding arbitration provisions enforceable under  301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act.
Held:  In the circumstances of this case -- where the grievance was subject to arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement, petitioner was ready for arbitration when the strike was enjoined, and the District Court concluded that respondent's violations of the no-strike clause were causing petitioner irreparable injury -- the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not bar the granting of injunctive relief.

(d) This Court's holding in Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge 75, 390 U. S. 557 (1968), that  301(a) suits initially brought in state courts are removable to federal courts (a decision which, in conjunction with Sinclair, had the effect of ousting state courts of jurisdiction in such cases where injunctive relief is sought for breach of a no-strike obligation), contravenes the congressional purpose embodied in  301(a) to supplement, and not encroach upon, the preexisting jurisdiction of state courts.

(f) Extending Sinclair to the States would be an unacceptable resolution of the dilemma created by Sinclair and Avco because it would substantially lessen the employers' incentive to agree to submit grievances to arbitration in exchange for the unions' undertakings to refrain from striking and would totally eliminate, contrary to congressional intent, the injunction as the most effective device to enforce no-strike obligations.

No. 768
Argued April 21-22, 1970
Decided June 1, 1970
398 U.S. 235

Syllabus 
Petitioner company and respondent union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement containing a provision that all controversies concerning its interpretation or application should be resolved by arbitration and that there should be no work stoppage, lockout, picketing, or boycotts during the life of the contract.  A dispute arose and, when petitioner did not accede to respondent's demand, a strike was called and the union began to picket petitioner's establishment.  Petitioner's effort to invoke the contract's arbitration procedures being unsuccessful, it sought injunctive relief in the state court, which issued a temporary restraining order.  The union removed the case to the Federal District Court, which ordered arbitration and enjoined the strike and the picketing.  The Court of Appeals reversed, considering itself bound by Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, 370 U. S. 195 (1962), which held that  4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act bars a federal district court from enjoining a strike in breach of a no-strike clause in a collective bargaining agreement, even though that agreement contains binding arbitration provisions enforceable under  301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act.

Decided June 1, 1970
398 U.S. 262

Syllabus 
Petitioner challenged his jury conviction for rape and the sentence of death imposed pursuant to Arkansas law on the grounds that (1) the jury had determined the issues of guilt and sentencing in a single proceeding, thus precluding him from presenting evidence on the penalty issue without subjecting himself to self-incrimination on the guilt issue, and (2) the jury had been given no standards to guide it in sentencing.  The District Court denied a writ of habeas corpus, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Several prospective jurors had been removed for cause from the panel ""because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction,"" which this Court held impermissible in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, decided after petitioner's trial.

Syllabus 
During a period of over seven years while petitioner was in federal custody and available to the State of Florida, which had issued a warrant for his arrest on a state criminal charge, petitioner made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to secure a prompt trial in the state court.  During that period, two witnesses died, another potential defense witness allegedly became unavailable, and possibly relevant police records were lost or destroyed.  Thereafter, the State filed an information against petitioner and, following denial of petitioner's motion to quash on the ground that he had been denied his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, petitioner was convicted and the appellate court affirmed.
Held:  On the record in this case, where petitioner was at all times available to the State and there was no valid excuse for the prejudicial delay, the judgment against petitioner must be vacated by the trial court.  Pp.  398 U. S. 36-38.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who participated in a skit performed several times in front of an Armed Forces induction center demonstrating opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam conflict, was convicted by a jury of violating 18 U.S.C.  702, which makes criminal the unauthorized wearing of an American military uniform or part thereof.  Petitioner alleged that he was authorized to wear the uniform by 10 U.S.C.  772(f), which permits wearing of a uniform while one is portraying a member of an armed force in a theatrical or motion picture production ""if the portrayal does not tend to discredit that armed force.""  His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, and he filed a petition for certiorari after the time specified in Supreme Court Rule 22(2) had expired.
Held:
1. The street skit in which petitioner participated was a ""theatrical production"" within the meaning of  772(f).  Pp.  398 U. S. 61-62.
2. The words ""if the portrayal does not tend to discredit that armed force"" in  772(f) impose an unconstitutional restraint on freedom of speech, and must be stricken from the section to preserve its constitutionality.  Pp.  398 U. S. 62-63.

The further claim advanced by petitioner's appointed counsel in this Court respecting the alleged unconstitutional application of N.J.Stat.Ann.  2A:4-37(b) has been raised for the first time upon this writ, and the state courts have had no opportunity to pass upon it."|

 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 In August 1967, the City Council of Philadelphia passed an ordinance authorizing the mayor to declare a state of emergency in the city, 'if he finds that the City or any part thereof is suffering or is in imminent danger of suffering civil disturbance, disorder, riot or other occurrence which will seriously endanger the health, safety and property of the citizens.' When a state of emergency is declared, the mayor is authorized to 'prohibit or limit the number of persons who may gather or congregate ... in any outdoor place, except persons who are awaiting transportation, engaging in recreational activities at a usual and customary place, or peaceably entering or leaving buildings.' The ordinance provides that the state of emergency shall exist 'not in 
Page 398 U.S. 916 , 917
 excess of two weeks,' but that it may be 'extended for additional periods of two weeks.' There are no provisions for review of the mayor's decision to declare a state of emergency. 
 On April 4, 1968, the Reverend Martin Luther King., Jr., was assassinated. On April 5, 1968, at 9 p.m., the mayor proclaimed a limited state of emergency, effective until 6 a.m. on April 10, 1968, 'unless further extended,' and prohibited groups of 12 or more from gathering or congregating in any outdoor place, except in those situations authorized by the ordinance. The proclamation contained no specific factual findings to support the conclusion that a threat of 'civil disturbance,' 'disorder,' or 'riot' existed. The courts below, however, found that the proclamation was supported by various scattered acts of disorder occurring in the City of Philadelphia between the assassination and the proclamation, such as window breaking, damage to automobiles, false alarms of fire, and jostling of pedestrians, some of which occurred incident to demonstrations. There had been disorders in other cities after the assassination. 
 Appellants were arrested for peaceful, nonviolent participation in outdoor gatherings of 12 or more persons in violation of the proclamation. Three separate gatherings were involved. 
 1. Several weeks prior to the issuance of the proclamation, the Philadelphia Committee for Non-Violent Action made plans to protest the recommissioning of a battleship, which as to take place on April 6, 1968. A group of approximately 100 gathered at a park near the site of the recommissioning on April 6, planted a tree, and then sat around the tree holding hands and singing. A permit for this demonstration had been issued by the park commission. There were some speakers, but none of them advocated violence. There was no threat of hostility between the demonstrators and any spectators. [398 U.S. 916 , 918]

 The appeal is dismissed. 
 THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Appellants brought this suit as a class action, claiming to represent a class 'designated as Indo-Hispano, also called Mexican, Mexican-American and Spanish American, [which is] generally characterized by Spanish surnames, mixed Indian and Spanish ancestry and ... Spanish as a primary or maternal language.'1 The District Court dismissed the complaint as a class action, holding that appellants' definition of the class was 'too vague to be meaningful.'2 
Page 398 U.S. 922 , 923
 Class actions are controlled by Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That Rule does not in terms define a 'class', other than by stating that the class must be 'so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable' and that there must be 'questions of law or fact common to the class.' Certainly those two prerequisites were satisfied in this case. In addition, however, federal courts have required that '[t]he members of a class must be capable of definite identification as being either in or out of it.' Chaffee v. Johnson, D.C., 229 F.Supp. 445, 448. See also Dolgow v. Anderson, D.C., 43 F.R.D. 472, 491; Weisman v. MCA Inc., D.C., 45 F.R.D. 258, 261; 3B J. Moore, Federal Practice 23.04 (1969). 
 In my view, the District Court clearly erred in holding that the members of the class were not sufficiently identifiable. The court relied, for example, on the fact that 'the complaint is silent as to whether people with some Spanish or Mexican and Indian ancestors, as well as ancestors who are of some other extraction, i. e., French, English, Danish, etc., would be included as members of the class.

|398 u.s. 1|"Nash v. United States
No. 678
Argued April 21, 1970
Decided May 18, 1970
398 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Petitioners were members of a partnership that reported its income on the accrual method and used the reserve method of accounting for bad debts provided in  166(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, permitting a taxpayer to take a current deduction for the amount of accounts receivable that it is estimated will become worthless in later years.  Petitioners formed corporations and transferred partnership assets, including the net worth of the accounts receivable (the face value less the amount of the reserve), to the corporations in exchange for the corporations' stock.  The transfer was within the terms of  351 of the Code, which provides that no gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a corporation in exchange for stock, if after the exchange the transferors are in control of the corporation.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the partnership should have included in income the amount of the bad debt reserve because the partnership no longer needed the reserve account.  Petitioners paid the deficiencies assessed and sued for refunds.  The District Court allowed recovery, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The so-called tax benefit rule, that recovery of an item that has produced an income tax benefit in a prior year is to be added to income in the year of recovery, is not applicable here, as the partnership, although its business 
Page 398 U. S. 2

At public meetings before the Greenbelt, Maryland, City Council, the efforts of respondent, a prominent real estate developer and state legislator, to secure zoning variances for certain land he owned while the city was trying to acquire other land of his on which to build a school were vigorously discussed.  In publishing in their newspaper full accounts of the meetings, petitioners reported that various citizens had characterized respondent's negotiating position as ""blackmail.""

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 18, 1970
 Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 Denied.
 Mr. Justice BLACK, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS joins, dissenting. 
 This personal injury suit arose out of a farming accident. Petitioner Donald Warner, a 12-year-old boy, was working with other young men on a farm gathering hay. They were using a machine manufactured by the respondent corporation which carried bales of hay up from a wagon into the hayloft at the top of a barn. This machine consisted of a belt with step- like paddles on which the bales were placed. The power for the elevator was supplied by a tractor, and the operating controls were located on the tractor. Donald was at first working at the bottom of the elevator, but when it became necessary for him to change places with another boy at the top of the elevator the power was shut off and Donald proceeded to climb up the elevator, using the paddles as a ladder. As Donald neared the top, but before he had stepped off the machine, another boy, who could not see the top of the elevator, started it up again. Donald had unfortunately caught his foot in the mechanism and when the power was applied his leg was mangled. As a result he lost the lower part of his leg by amputation. Donald and his father brought suit, claiming that the respondent had breached its duty to warn of the potential dangers involved in using the machine as a substitute ladder and the duty to design a safe machine. At trial the Warners introduced testimonial evidence that other hay elevators were designed so that the operator could see the top, and that warnings of possible danger were given with other farm machinery. At the close of this evidence respondent moved for a directed verdict, the motion was denied, and evidence 
Page 398 U.S. 906 , 907
 for the defense was submitted. At the conclusion of all the evidence the jury retired, deliberated fully, and returned with a verdict for $75,000 in favor of the Warners. 
 On appeal the Court of Appeals proceeded to consider the sufficiency of the evidence, even though it also held that since the defendant had not renewed its motion for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence the court could not consider sufficiency of the evidence on appeal. [Footnote 1] The court then concluded that petitioner had failed to produce sufficient evidence to warrant submitting the case to the jury and therefore set the jury's verdict aside. 
 In my opinion this action was a flagrant disregard of the command of the Seventh Amendment that '[i]n Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.'

|397 u.s. 664|"Walz v. Tax Comm'n of the City of New York
No. 135
Argued November 19, 1969
Decided May 4, 1970
397 U.S. 664

Syllabus 
Appellant property owner unsuccessfully sought an injunction in the New York courts to prevent the New York City Tax Commission from granting property tax exemptions to religious organizations for properties used solely for religious worship, as authorized by the state constitution and the implementing statute providing for tax exemptions for property used exclusively for religious, educational, or charitable purposes.  Appellant contended that the exemptions, as applied to religious bodies, violated provisions prohibiting establishment of religion under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held:
1. The First Amendment tolerates neither governmentally established religion nor governmental interference with religion.  Pp.  397 U. S. 667-672.
2. The legislative purpose of tax exemptions is not aimed at establishing, sponsoring, or supporting religion, and New York's legislation simply spares the exercise of religion from the burden of property taxation levied on private profit institutions.  Pp.  397 U. S. 672-674.
3. The tax exemption creates only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state, far less than taxation of churches would entail, and it restricts the fiscal relationship between them, thus tending to complement and reinforce the desired separation insulating each from the other.  Pp.  397 U. S. 674-676.
4. Freedom from taxation for two centuries has not led to an established church or religion, and, on the contrary, has helped to guarantee the free exercise of all forms of religious belief.  Pp.  397 U. S. 676-680.

No. 399
Argued January 22, 1970
Decided May 4, 1970
397 U.S. 728

Syllabus 
Appellants, who are in the mail-order business, brought suit to enjoin the operation of 39 U.S.C.  4009, challenging its constitutionality.  That section provides that a person who has received by mail
""a pandering advertisement which offers for sale matter which the addressee in his sole discretion believes to be erotically arousing or sexually provocative,""
may request the Postmaster General to issue an order ""directing the sender and his agents or assigns to refrain from further mailings to the named addressee.""  Such order would also require the sender to delete the addressee's name from his mailing lists, and would prohibit him from trading in lists from which the deletion has not been made.  If the Postmaster General believes that his order has been violated, he may notify the sender of his belief and the reasons therefor, and must grant him an opportunity to respond and to have an administrative hearing on whether a violation has occurred.  If the Postmaster General thereafter determines that the order has been violated, he may request the Attorney General to seek an order from a district court directing compliance with the prohibitory order.  A three-judge court found that  4009 was constitutional when interpreted to prohibit advertisements similar to those initially mailed to the addressee.
Held:
1. The statute allows the addressee unreviewable discretion to decide whether he wishes to receive any further material from a particular sender.  Pp.  397 U. S. 731-735.
2. A vendor does not have a constitutional right to send unwanted material into someone's home, and a mailer's right to communicate must stop at the mailbox of an unreceptive addressee.  Pp.  397 U. S. 735-738.
3. The statute comports with the Due Process Clause, as it provides for an administrative hearing if the sender violates the Postmaster General's prohibitory order, and a judicial hearing prior to issuance of any compliance order by a district court.  Pp.  397 U. S. 738-739. 
Page 397 U. S. 729

4. The statute doe not violate due process by requiring that the sender remove the complaining addressee' name from his mailing lists, nor is the statute unconstitutionally vague, as the sender knows precisely what he must do when he receives  a prohibitory order.  P.  397 U. S. 740.

||"Brady v. United States
No. 270
Argued November 18, 1969
Decided May 4, 1970
397 U.S. 742

Syllabus 
Petitioner was indicted in 1959 for kidnaping and not liberating the victim unharmed in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1201(a), which imposed a maximum penalty of death if the jury's verdict so recommended.  Upon learning that his codefendant, who had confessed, would plead guilty and testify against him, petitioner changed his plea from not guilty to guilty.  The trial judge accepted the plea after twice questioning petitioner (who was represented throughout by competent counsel) as to the voluntariness of his plea, and imposed sentence.  In 1967, petitioner sought post-conviction relief, in part on the ground that  1201(a) operated to coerce his plea.  The District Court, after hearing, denied relief, concluding that petitioner's plea was voluntary and had been induced not by that statute, but by the development concerning his confederate.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Petitioner claims that United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S. 570 (1968), requires reversal of that holding.
Held:  On the record in this case, there is no basis for disturbing the judgment of the courts below that petitioner's guilty plea was voluntary.  Pp.  397 U. S. 745-758.
(a) Though United States v. Jackson, supra, prohibits imposition of the death penalty under  1201(a), it does not hold that all guilty pleas encouraged by the fear of possible death are involuntary, nor does it invalidate such pleas, whether involuntary or not.  Pp.  397 U. S. 745-748.
(b) A plea of guilty is not invalid merely because entered to avoid the possibility of the death penalty, and here, petitioner's plea of guilty met the standard of voluntariness, as it was made ""by one fully aware of the direct consequences"" of that plea.  Pp.  397 U. S. 749-755.
(c) Petitioner's plea, made after advice by competent counsel, was intelligently made, and the fact that petitioner did not anticipate United States v. Jackson, supra, does not impugn the truth or reliability of that plea.  Pp.  397 U. S. 756-758.

No. 153

397 U.S. 759

Syllabus 
Respondents were convicted in state court of felonies, following their pleas of guilty, entered on advice of counsel, which in petitions for collateral relief they claimed, inter alia, were the illegal product of coerced confessions.  Following denial of relief in the state courts, the District Courts, without evidentiary hearings, denied the petitions.  The Court of Appeals reversed in each case, holding that a guilty plea (1) effectively waives pretrial irregularities only if voluntary; (2) is not voluntary if it results from an involuntary confession, and (3) is vulnerable (at least in New York cases like these) where entered prior to Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964).
Held:
1. A competently counseled defendant who alleges that he pleaded guilty because of a prior coerced confession is not, without more, entitled to a hearing on his petition for habeas corpus.  Pp.  397 U. S. 768-771.
(a) A defendant who pleads guilty despite his feeling that the evidence against him is weak, apart from a confession he deems inadmissible, is merely refusing to present his federal claims regarding the confession to the state court in the first instance.  Such a defendant cannot claim that his bypass of state remedies was not an intelligent act absent incompetent advice by counsel.  Pp.  397 U. S. 768-769.
(b) A defendant's plea of guilty based on reasonably competent advice is an intelligent plea not open to attack as being involuntary on the ground that his counsel may have misjudged the admissibility of the defendant's confession.  Pp.  397 U. S. 769-771.
2. A defendant who pleads guilty, thereby waiving his state court remedies, does so under the law then existing and assumes the risk of ordinary error in either his or his attorney's assessment of the law and facts, and, in this case, the fact that respondents' counsel did not anticipate this Court's decision in Jackson v. Denno, supra, and did not consider invalid the New York procedures existing at the time their clients pleaded guilty does not mean that respondents were incompetently advised.  Pp.  397 U.

No. 268
Argued November 17, 1969
Decided May 4, 1970
397 U.S. 790

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a 15-year-old Negro, was arrested for burglary and rape, and later made a confession to police, which he advised his retained counsel had not been prompted by threats, promises, or fear.  After being indicted for first-degree burglary (a capital offense in North Carolina), petitioner and his mother, after consulting counsel, authorized the entry of a guilty plea with the understanding that its acceptance would mandate a sentence of life imprisonment.  That sentence was imposed after petitioner had assured the trial judge that his plea was freely made.  Thereafter, petitioner sought post-conviction relief, claiming that his guilty plea was the product of a coerced confession and that the indictment was invalid because Negroes had been systematically excluded from the grand jury that returned the indictment.  A State court, after hearing, denied post-conviction relief.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that petitioner's plea of guilty was intelligent, and rejecting the claim, additionally asserted by petitioner, that his guilty plea was involuntary because North Carolina statutes at that time allowed a defendant to escape the possibility of a death penalty on a capital charge by pleading guilty to that charge.  The court refused to consider petitioner's claim concerning the composition of the grand jury, since petitioner had failed to comply with a state law requiring that such a contention must, before entry of a guilty plea, be raised by a motion to quash the indictment.
Held:
1. On the basis of the record in this case, petitioner's guilty plea was voluntary.  Pp.  397 U. S. 794-796.
(a) An otherwise valid plea is not involuntary because induced by a defendant's desire to limit the possible maximum penalty to less than that authorized if there is a jury trial.  Brady v. United States, ante, p.  397 U. S. 742.  Pp.  397 U. S. 794-795.
(b) Even if (despite abundant evidence to the contrary) petitioner's confession should have been found involuntary, the connection between his confession and the guilty plea, entered over a month later, had ""become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.""  Pp.  397 U. S. 795-796.

2. On the record in this case, petitioner's guilty plea was an intelligent plea not open to attack on the ground that his counsel misjudged the admissibility of petitioner's confession.  McMann v. Richardson, ante, p.  397 U. S. 759.  Pp.  397 U. S. 796-798.

Syllabus 
Testator, a Comanche Indian, left his estate consisting of interests in three Comanche allotments under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs, to a niece and her children.  Decedent was survived by a putative married daughter, with whom he had not been close.  Pursuant to 25 U.S.C.  373, which requires approval by the Secretary of the Interior of a will of an Indian devising allotments, a hearing was held before an Examiner of Inheritance.  He found that the daughter was decedent's sole heir, but concluded that the will should be approved, as it was properly executed, statements of the draftsman and witnesses showed that testator possessed testamentary capacity, and failure to provide for the daughter was not unnatural, since there had been no close relationship.  The Regional Solicitor, acting for the Secretary, under a standard to ""most nearly achieve just and equitable treatment of the beneficiaries [under the will] and the decedent's heirs at law,"" set aside the Examiner's action, and ordered distribution to the daughter.  The beneficiaries brought suit in the District Court, contending that the Regional Solicitor's action exceeded his authority under  373.  That court held that the Administrative Procedure Act does not preclude judicial review and that the Regional Solicitor erred in viewing the Secretary's powers as authorizing disapproval of any will thought unwise or inequitable.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding the Secretary's action under  373 unreviewable.
Held:
1. The Secretary's disapproval is subject to judicial review, as there is no language in  373 (enacted as  2 of the Act of June 25, 1910) evincing an intention to make the Secretary's action unreviewable, and the finality language of  1 of the 1910 Act cannot be carried over to the other sections of that Act.  Pp.  397 U. S. 605-607.
2. Whatever may be the scope of the Secretary's power under  373, there is nothing in the statute, its history, or purpose that vests in a government official the power to revoke or rewrite a 
Page 397 U. S. 599
 will that reflects a rational testamentary scheme simply because of a subjective feeling that the disposition was not ""just and equitable.""  On this record, the disapproval was arbitrary and capricious.  Pp.  397 U. S. 607-610.

Syllabus 
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) Regional Director, after investigating petitioner's charge that respondent union was violating  8(b)(4)(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, issued an unfair labor practice complaint with the NLRB and petitioned the District Court for injunctive relief under  10(l) of the Act, which directs him to apply for such temporary relief ""pending the final adjudication of the Board with respect to such matter.""  The Regional Director did not appeal the denial of an injunction, but petitioner (which had not formally intervened at the District Court hearing) sought to do so.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on the ground that only the Regional Director could appeal.  The NLRB thereafter found that the union had violated  8(b)(4)(b) and ordered it to cease and desist from its unlawful conduct.
Held:  Since any injunctive relief to which petitioner might have been entitled under  10(l) terminated upon final action by the NLRB, albeit respondent union is seeking judicial review of the order, the question whether petitioner could appeal the denial of an injunction is moot.

No. 369
Argued February 25, 1970
Decided April 20, 1970*
397 U.S. 532

Syllabus 
Appellant American Farm Lines (AFL) filed an application for temporary operating authority under  210a of the Interstate Commerce Act, which allows the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to grant such authority without hearings for ""service for which there is an immediate and urgent need"" and where there is ""no carrier service capable of meeting such need.""  ICC rules require that the application be supported by shippers' statements containing 11 items of information, including ""(8) Whether efforts have been made to obtain the services from existing . . . carriers, and the dates and results of such efforts,"" and
""(9) Names and addresses of existing carriers who have either failed or refused to provide the service, and the reasons given for any such failure or refusal.""
AFL's application, which was accompanied by a statement from the Department of Defense (DOD), was approved by the ICC.  Protesting carriers sought review in the Federal District Court, where a single judge temporarily restrained the operation of the ICC's order.  The ICC, not barred by the stay order from doing so, then granted petitions for reconsideration and reopened the proceeding to receive a further supporting statement from DOD.  Based upon this statement, the ICC issued a new order granting AFL's application, and a single District Judge restrained the operation of this new order.  Thereafter a three-judge court conducted a full hearing on the merits and set aside both ICC orders on the grounds that the agency failed to require strict compliance with its own rules and that the pendency of the review proceedings deprived the ICC of jurisdiction to reopen the administrative record.
Held:
1. These ICC rules are mere aids to the exercise of the agency's independent discretion, and the District Court exacted a standard of compliance with these procedural rules that was wholly unnecessary 
Page 397 U. S. 533
 to provide a adequate record to review the ICC's decision.  Pp.  397 U. S. 537-539.
2. The ICC's statutory jurisdiction to pas on petition for rehearing may be exercised to add to it findings or to buttress them as it seems desirable, absent any interference with or injunction from the District Court.  Here, the ICC honored the District Court's stay order and reopened the record merely to remedy a deficiency before any judicial review of the merits had begun, and acted in full harmony with that court's jurisdiction.  Pp.  397 U. S. 539-542.

""(9) Names and addresses of existing carriers who have either failed or refused to provide the service, and the reasons given for any such failure or refusal.""
AFL's application, which was accompanied by a statement from the Department of Defense (DOD), was approved by the ICC.  Protesting carriers sought review in the Federal District Court, where a single judge temporarily restrained the operation of the ICC's order.  The ICC, not barred by the stay order from doing so, then granted petitions for reconsideration and reopened the proceeding to receive a further supporting statement from DOD.  Based upon this statement, the ICC issued a new order granting AFL's application, and a single District Judge restrained the operation of this new order.  Thereafter a three-judge court conducted a full hearing on the merits and set aside both ICC orders on the grounds that the agency failed to require strict compliance with its own rules and that the pendency of the review proceedings deprived the ICC of jurisdiction to reopen the administrative record.
Held:
1. These ICC rules are mere aids to the exercise of the agency's independent discretion, and the District Court exacted a standard of compliance with these procedural rules that was wholly unnecessary 
Page 397 U. S. 533
 to provide a adequate record to review the ICC's decision.  Pp.  397 U. S. 537-539.
2. The ICC's statutory jurisdiction to pas on petition for rehearing may be exercised to add to it findings or to buttress them as it seems desirable, absent any interference with or injunction from the District Court.  Here, the ICC honored the District Court's stay order and reopened the record merely to remedy a deficiency before any judicial review of the merits had begun, and acted in full harmony with that court's jurisdiction.  Pp.  397 U. S. 539-542.

No. 829
Argued March 3, 1970
Decided April 20, 1970
397 U.S. 552

Syllabus 
Appellants, recipients of Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) assistance, brought this suit challenging the validity of a California law and regulations that conclusively presume that the income of a nonadoptive stepfather or a man assuming the role of a spouse (MARS) is available to the children in computing the AFDC assistance to which they are entitled.  Appellants contend that the state provisions conflict with the Social Security Act and Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) regulations thereunder providing that income from a nonadoptive stepfather without legal obligation of support or a MARS may not be treated as available to the children absent proof of actual contributions.  A three-judge District Court, holding the HEW regulations invalid, dismissed the complaint.
Held:
1. AFDC aid can be granted under the Social Security Act only if ""a parent"" of the needy child is continually absent from the home, the term ""parent"" including only a person with a legal duty of support.  King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309,  392 U. S. 313,  392 U. S. 327.  Pp.  397 U. S. 557-558.
2. The HEW regulation validly implements the Act, since HEW could reasonably conclude that only a person as near as a real or adoptive father would be has the consensual relation to the family that makes it reliably certain that his income is actually available for support of the children in the household.  Pp.  397 U. S. 558-560.
3. The State, which is foreclosed from arguing that the ""assumption of income"" provisions comport with the Act as applied to MARS, may seek to show on remand only that those provisions may be retained under the Act as applied to nonadoptive stepfathers if it can demonstrate that their legal obligation under state law is consistent with that under federal law.  P.  397 U. S. 560.

No. 412
Argued February 26, 1970
Decided April 20, 1970
397 U.S. 572

Syllabus 
Petitioner taxpayers, majority stockholders of an Iowa corporation, voted for perpetual extension of the corporate charter, and, under Iowa law, became obliged to purchase at its ""real value"" the stock of a minority shareholder who had voted against the extension.  On the parties' failure to agree on the ""real value"" of the minority interest, petitioners brought an appraisal action in state court, and thereafter bought the minority stock at a value fixed by the court.  In their federal income tax returns, petitioners claimed deductions as ""ordinary . . . expenses paid . . . for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income"" for attorneys', accountants', and appraisers' fees in connection with the appraisal litigation.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deductions ""because the fees represent capital expenditures in connection with the acquisition of capital stock of a corporation,"" a determination sustained by the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals.  Petitioners contend that current deductibility is justified on the ground that the ""primary purpose"" of the litigation was not for defense or perfection of title (a nondeductible capital expenditure) but to determine the stock's value.
Held:  The expenses incurred by petitioners must be treated as part of their cost in acquiring the stock, rather than as ordinary expenses, since the appraisal proceeding was merely the substitute provided by state law for the process of negotiation to fix the price at which the stock was to be purchased.  The appropriate standard here is the origin of the claim litigated, rather than the taxpayers' ""primary purpose"" in incurring the appraisal litigation expenses.  Pp.  397 U. S. 575-579.

No. 528
Argued February 26, 1970
Decided April 20, 1970
397 U.S. 580

Syllabus 
Respondent corporation (Hilton), which owned close to 90% of the stock of Waldorf, determined to merge the two companies.  The merger was formally opposed by the holders of about 6% of Waldorf shares, title to whose stock under New York law thereupon passed to Waldorf, the dissenters becoming Waldorf's creditors for its fair value.  On December 28, 1953, Hilton voted its Waldorf stock approving the merger, which was consummated in accordance with New York law on December 31.  The dissenting Waldorf shareowners thereafter rejected a Hilton cash offer and began appraisal proceedings in the New York courts.  Hilton retained a consultant to value the Waldorf stock as of the day before the Waldorf shareholders' merger vote, and also obtained legal and other services in connection with the appraisal litigation, which ultimately ended in a settlement.  Hilton deducted the consulting and other professional fees on its income tax return as ordinary and necessary business expenses, which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed on the ground that the payments were capital expenditures.  Hilton paid the tax and brought this refund suit in District Court, which held that the payments related to the appraisal proceeding were deductible.  The Court of Appeals, applying the ""primary purpose"" test, affirmed, noting that the proceeding was not necessary to effect the merger, but that its paramount purpose was to determine the fair value of the dissenting shareholders' share in Waldorf.
Held:
1. Litigation costs arising out of the acquisition of a capital asset are capital expenses whether or not the taxpayer incurred them for the purpose of defending or perfecting title to property, Woodward v. Commissioner, ante, p.  397 U. S. 572, and the functional nature of the appraisal remedy as a forced purchase of the dissenters' stock is the same, regardless of whether title passed before or after the price of their stock was determined.  Pp.  397 U. S. 583-584. 
Page 397 U. S. 581

2. The debt that Hilton inherited from Waldorf of paying the dissenter for their share retained its capital character through the merger, as did the expenditure for fixing the amount of that debt.  Pp.  397 U. S. 584-585.

No. 24
Argued November 13, 1969
Decided April 6, 1970
397 U.S. 387

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted by the St. Petersburg municipal court of violating two ordinances, destruction of city property and disorderly breach of the peace, and sentenced to 180 days in jail.  Thereafter, an information, concededly based on the same acts that led to the previous convictions, was filed by the State of Florida charging petitioner with grand larceny.  The State Supreme Court denied a writ of prohibition to prevent the second trial on petitioner's claim of double jeopardy.  Petitioner was tried and convicted of grand larceny.  The District Court of Appeal, holding that there would be no bar to the prosecution in the state court. ""even if a person has been tried in a municipal court for the identical offense with which he is charged in a state court,"" affirmed the grand larceny conviction.
Held:  The State of Florida and is municipalities are not separate sovereign entities each entitled to impose punishment for the same alleged crime, as the judicial power of the municipal courts and the state courts of general jurisdiction springs from the same organic law, and the District Court of Appeal erred in holding that a second trial in a state court for the identical offense for which a person was tried in a municipal court did not constitute double jeopardy.

No. 540
Argued November 19, 1969
Decided April 6, 1970
397 U.S. 397

Syllabus 
The Social Security Amendments of 1967 added  402(a)(23), which reads:
""[The States shall] provide that, by July 1, 1969, the amounts used by the State to determine needs of individuals will have been adjusted to reflect fully changes in living costs since such amounts were established and any maximums that the State imposes on the amount of aid paid to families will have been proportionately adjusted.""
In 1969, New York, by  131-a of its Social Services Law, altered its standard of need computation under the federally supported Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program, and adopted a system fixing maximum allowances per family based on the number of persons in the family and the age of the oldest child, and eliminated a ""special grants"" program.  The state statute resulted in decreased benefits to many New York City recipients.  This controversy involving the compatibility of the two statutes arose out of a pendent claim included in petitioners' complaint bringing a class action challenging  131-a as violative of the Equal Protection Clause by virtue of its provision for lesser payments to AFDC recipients in Nassau County than those allowed for New York City residents.  A three-judge court was convened, but, before a decision was rendered,  131-a was amended to permit Nassau County grants equal to those in New York City.  The three-judge court concluded that the equal protection issue was ""no longer justiciable,"" dissolved itself, and remanded the matter to the single District Judge.  The District Judge issued an injunction prohibiting the reduction or discontinuance of ""regular and recurring grants and special grants"" payable under the predecessor welfare law.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the three-judge court had properly dissolved itself, but that the District Judge should no have ruled on tho merits of petitioners' statutory claim.
Held:
1. The District Judge had jurisdiction to decide this federal statutory challenge to the New York welfare law.  Pp.  397 U. S. 402-407.
(a)Jurisdiction over the primary claim at all stages of the litigation is not a prerequisite to resolution of the pendent 
Page 397 U. S. 398
 claim, and the mootness of the equal protection claim does not eliminate the jurisdiction of the District Judge over the pendent statutory claim.  Pp.  397 U. S. 402-405.
(b) The District Judge properly did not decline jurisdiction to allow the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to resolve the controversy, as neither the ""exhaustion of administrative remedies"" nor the ""primary jurisdiction"" doctrine is applicable here.  Petitioners do not seek review of an administrative ruling, nor could they have obtained such a ruling, since HEW does not permit welfare recipients to trigger or participate in its review of state welfare programs.  Pp.  397 U. S. 405-407.
2. New York's program is incompatible with  402(a)(23), and petitioners are entitled to an injunction by the District Court against payment of federal monies according to the State's new schedules, should New York not develop a conforming plan within a reasonable time.  Pp.  397 U. S. 407-420.
(a) Congress, in  402(a)(23), required the States to face up to the magnitude of the public assistance requirement, prodded them more equitably to apportion their payments, and spoke in favor of increases in AFDC payments.  Pp.  397 U. S. 412-414.
(b) The evidence supports the District Judge's finding that New York has, in effect, impermissibly lowered its standard of need by deleting items that were previously included.  Pp.  397 U. S. 415-417.
(c) While  402(a)(23) does not prevent New York from pursuing a goal of administrative efficiency, it does foreclose the State from achieving this purpose by reducing significantly the content of its standard of need.  Pp.  397 U. S. 417-419.
(d) Section 402(a)(23) invalidates any state program that decreases the content of the standard of need unless the State can demonstrate that the items formerly included (here, the system of special grants, not the system of maximum grants based upon average age of the oldest child) no longer constituted part of the reality of existence for the majority of welfare recipients.  Pp.  397 U. S. 419-420.
3. Congress has not foreclosed judicial review to welfare recipients who are most directly affected by the administration of the program, and it is the duty of the federal courts to resolve disputes as to whether federal funds allocated to the States for welfare programs are properly expended.  Pp.  397 U. S. 420-423.

Decided April 6, 1970
397 U.S. 436

Syllabus 
Three or four men robbed six poker players.  Petitioner was separately charged with having robbed one of the players, Knight, who, along with three others, testified for the prosecution that each had been robbed.  The State's evidence that petitioner had been one of the robbers was weak.  The defense offered no testimony.  The trial judge instructed the jury that, if it found that petitioner participated in the robbery, the theft of any money from Knight would sustain a conviction, and that, if petitioner was one of the robbers, he was guilty even though he had not personally robbed Knight.  The jury found petitioner ""not guilty due to insufficient evidence.""  Thereafter petitioner, following denial of his motion for dismissal based on the previous acquittal, was tried for having robbed another poker player, Roberts, and was convicted.  Following affirmance by the Missouri Supreme Court and unsuccessful collateral attack in the state courts, petitioner brought this habeas corpus action in the District Court, claiming that the second prosecution had violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The District Court denied the writ, relying on Hoag v. New Jersey, 356 U. S. 464, which, on virtually identical facts, held that there was no violation of due process.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Thereafter, this Court, in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, a decision which had fully ""retroactive"" effect, North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711.
Held:
1. The Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy, applicable here through the Fourteenth Amendment by virtue of Benton v. Maryland, supra, embodies collateral estoppel as a constitutional requirement.  Pp.  397 U. S. 437-444.
2. Since, on the record in this case, the jury in the first trial had determined by its verdict that petitioner was not one of the robbers, the State, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, was constitutionally foreclosed from relitigating that issue in another trial.  Pp.  397 U. S. 445-447.

No. 131
Argued December 9, 1969
Decided April 6, 1970
397 U.S. 471

Syllabus 
Appellees, large-family recipients of benefits under the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program, brought this suit to enjoin the application of Maryland's maximum grant regulation as contravening the Social Security Act of 1935 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Under the program, which is jointly financed by the Federal and State Governments, a State computes the ""standard of need"" of eligible family units.  Under the Maryland regulation, though most families are provided aid in accordance with the standard of need, a ceiling of about $250 per month is imposed on an AFDC grant regardless of the size of the family and its actual need.  The District Court held the regulation ""invalid on its face for overreaching,"" and thus violative of the Equal Protection Clause.
Held:
1. The Maryland regulation is not prohibited by the Social Security Act.  Pp.  397 U. S. 476-483.
(a) A State has great latitude in dispensing its available funds, King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309,  392 U. S. 318-319, and, given Maryland's finite resources available for public welfare demands, it is not prevented by the Act from sustaining as many families as it can and providing the largest families with somewhat less than their ascertained per capita standard of need.  Pp.  397 U. S. 478-480.
(b) The statutory standard in  402(a)(10) of the Act that aid ""shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible indiiduals,"" is not violated by the regulation, which does not deprive children of the largest families of aid, but reduces the family grant as a whole, and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare has approved the Maryland scheme.  Pp.  397 U. S. 480-482.
(c) In its Social Security Amendments of 1967, Congress fully recognized that maximum grant regulations are permissible.  Pp.  397 U. S. 482-483. 
Page 397 U. S. 472

2. The regulation does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  397 U. S. 483-487.
(a) The concept of overbreadth, though relevant where First Amendment considerations are involved, is not pertinent to state regulation in the social and economic field.  Pp.  397 U. S. 484-485.
(b) The regulation is rationally supportable and free from invidious discrimination, since it furthers the State's legitimate interest in encouraging employment and in maintaining an equitable balance between welfare families and the families of the working poor.  Pp.  397 U. S. 486-487.

No. 606
Argued February 24, 1970
Decided March 31, 1970
397 U.S. 337

Syllabus 
Respondent, who was on trial for robbery, was removed from the courtroom for repeated disruptive behavior and the use of vile and abusive language directed at the trial judge, notwithstanding the judge's prior warning that removal would follow another outburst.  Appointed counsel represented respondent during the period respondent was not allowed in the courtroom, principally the presentation of the State's case.  Having given some assurances of good conduct, respondent was allowed to return to the courtroom while appointed counsel presented his defense.  Respondent was convicted.  Following the State Supreme Court's affirmance, respondent filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, contending that he had been deprived of his right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to confront the witnesses against him.  The District Court declined to issue the writ.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to attend his own trial was so ""absolute"" that, regardless of how unruly his conduct, he could never be held to have lost that right so long as he insisted on it, as respondent had.
Held:
1. A defendant can lose his right to be present at trial if, following the judge's warning that he will be removed if his disruptive behavior continues, he nevertheless insists on conducting himself in such a disruptive manner that his trial cannot proceed if he remains in the courtroom.  He can reclaim the right to be present as soon as he is willing to comport himself with decorum and respect.  Pp.  397 U. S. 342-343.
2. A trial judge confronted by a defendant's disruptive conduct can exercise discretion to meet the circumstances of the case, and though no single formula is best for all situations, there are at least three constitutionally permissible approaches for the court's handling of an obstreperous defendant:  (1) bind and gag him as a last resort, thereby keeping him present; (2) cite him for criminal or civil contempt; or (3) remove him from the courtroom, while the trial continues, until he promises to conduct himself properly.  Pp.  397 U. S. 343-346. 
Page 397 U. S. 338

3. On the facts of this case, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion, respondent, through his disruptive behavior, having lost his right to confrontation under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  397 U. S. 345-347.

PER CURIAM. 
 
 The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. 
 Upon consideration of the suggestion of the Solicitor General and upon an examination of the entire record, the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is vacated and the case is remanded to that court. 
 The Solicitor General concedes that the administrative remedies that the Court of Appeals held should first be exhausted by the petitioner, have either been exhausted or are nonexistent. The sole remaining question therefore seems to be whether petitioner's failure to seek relief in the Court of Military Appeals precludes consideration of petitioner's claims by the federal courts. While the Solicitor General concedes that resort to that judicial remedy does not preclude consideration of petitioner's claim by the federal courts, there is a conflict among the circuits. It is for consideration of that question, or alternatively the merits, that the case is remanded.[ Craycroft v. Ferrall 397 U.S. 335 (1970) ]

Appellees are New York City residents receiving financial aid under the federally assisted Aid to Families with Dependent Children program or under New York State's general Home Relief program who allege that officials administering these programs terminated, or were about to terminate, such aid without prior notice and hearing, thereby denying them due process of law.  The District Court held that only a pre-termination evidentiary hearing would satisfy the constitutional command, and rejected the argument of the welfare officials that the combination of the existing post-termination ""fair hearing"" and informal pre-termination review was sufficient.
Held:
1. Welfare benefits are a matter of statutory entitlement for persons qualified to receive them, and procedural due process is applicable to their termination.  Pp.  397 U. S. 261-263.
2. The interest of the eligible recipient in the uninterrupted receipt of public assistance, which provides him with essential food, clothing, housing, and medical care, coupled with the State's interest that his payments not be erroneously terminated, clearly outweighs the State's competing concern to prevent any increase in its fiscal and administrative burdens.

No. 282
Argued January 12, 1970
Decided March 23, 1970
397 U.S. 301

Syllabus 
Taxpayer organized a corporation with one Bradley, who received 500 shares of common stock (later sold to taxpayer and divided between two of his children), taxpayer and his wife each receiving 250 shares.  To increase the company's working capital and qualify for an RFC loan, taxpayer bought 1,000 shares of preferred stock, at a par value of $25 per share, which the company (in accordance with the original understanding) redeemed when the loan was paid.  Taxpayer treated the transaction for income tax purposes as a sale of preferred stock, resulting in no gain to him, since the stock's basis was $25,000.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the distribution of that sum was essentially equivalent to a dividend, and reportable as ordinary income under  301 and 316 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.  That determination was premised on the Commissioner's finding that, by reason of the rules of attribution in  318(a) of the Code (under which a taxpayer is considered to own the stock owned by his spouse and children), the taxpayer here must be deemed the owner of all the company's stock immediately before and after the redemption.  The taxpayer paid the resulting deficiency and brought this suit for a refund.  The District Court ruled in the taxpayer's favor.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the $25,000 received by the taxpayer was the final step in a course of action with a legitimate business purpose, and thus ""not essentially equivalent to a dividend"" within the meaning of  302(b)(1) of the Code, which qualified the distribution as a ""payment in exchange for the stock"" and entitled it to capital gains, rather than ordinary income, treatment under  302(a).  Taxpayer contends that the attribution rules do not apply for the purpose of  302(b)(1); that he should be considered to own only 25 percent of the corporation's common stock, and that the distribution would qualify under  302(b)(1), since it was not proportionate to his stock interest, the fundamental test of dividend equivalency.
Held:
1. The attribution rules of  318(a) apply to all of  302, and, for the purpose of deciding whether the distribution here is 
Page 397 U. S. 302
 ""not essentially equivalent to a dividend"" under  302(b)(1), taxpayer must be deemed the owner of all 1,000 shares of the company's common stock.  Pp.  397 U. S. 304-307.
2. Regardless of business purpose, a redemption is always ""essentially equivalent to a dividend"" within the meaning of  302(b)(1) if it does not change the shareholder's proportionate interest in the corporation.  Since taxpayer here (after application of the attribution rules) was the corporation's sole shareholder both before and after the redemption, he did not qualify for capital gains treatment under that test.  Pp.  397 U. S. 307-313.

To increase the company's working capital and qualify for an RFC loan, taxpayer bought 1,000 shares of preferred stock, at a par value of $25 per share, which the company (in accordance with the original understanding) redeemed when the loan was paid.  Taxpayer treated the transaction for income tax purposes as a sale of preferred stock, resulting in no gain to him, since the stock's basis was $25,000.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the distribution of that sum was essentially equivalent to a dividend, and reportable as ordinary income under  301 and 316 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.  That determination was premised on the Commissioner's finding that, by reason of the rules of attribution in  318(a) of the Code (under which a taxpayer is considered to own the stock owned by his spouse and children), the taxpayer here must be deemed the owner of all the company's stock immediately before and after the redemption.  The taxpayer paid the resulting deficiency and brought this suit for a refund.  The District Court ruled in the taxpayer's favor.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the $25,000 received by the taxpayer was the final step in a course of action with a legitimate business purpose, and thus ""not essentially equivalent to a dividend"" within the meaning of  302(b)(1) of the Code, which qualified the distribution as a ""payment in exchange for the stock"" and entitled it to capital gains, rather than ordinary income, treatment under  302(a).  Taxpayer contends that the attribution rules do not apply for the purpose of  302(b)(1); that he should be considered to own only 25 percent of the corporation's common stock, and that the distribution would qualify under  302(b)(1), since it was not proportionate to his stock interest, the fundamental test of dividend equivalency.
Held:
1. The attribution rules of  318(a) apply to all of  302, and, for the purpose of deciding whether the distribution here is 
Page 397 U. S. 302
 ""not essentially equivalent to a dividend"" under  302(b)(1), taxpayer must be deemed the owner of all 1,000 shares of the company's common stock.  Pp.  397 U. S. 304-307.
2. Regardless of business purpose, a redemption is always ""essentially equivalent to a dividend"" within the meaning of  302(b)(1) if it does not change the shareholder's proportionate interest in the corporation.  Since taxpayer here (after application of the attribution rules) was the corporation's sole shareholder both before and after the redemption, he did not qualify for capital gains treatment under that test.  Pp.  397 U. S. 307-313.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 23, 1973
 Rehearing Denied Dec. 10, 1973. 
 See 414 U.S. 1104. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice POWELL, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, join dissenting. 
 The five petitioners in this case own virtually all the outstanding stock of a small corporation, A & Transportation Company (A & S). The company operates a barge. The barge fell into such disrepair as to require replacement, but A & lacked the necessary resources and credit. A & requested the Federal Maritime Commission to guarantee, as it is empowered by law to do, 
Page 414 U.S. 982 , 983
 a proposed first mortgage loan from a bank. Before the Commission would extend its guarantee, it required to A & at least $150,000 of additional private capital. The Commission presented A & B with two options. A & could resort either to subordinated debt or to the issuance of nonvoting, nondividend paying, noncumulative preferred stock unredeemable until full payment of the desired loan. 
 A & chose the latter course. In proportion to their holdings of A & common, petitioners in 1959 purchased $150,000 of preferred stock possessing all the attributes required by the Commission. The loan was then consummated with the Commission's guarantee, and A & purchased a replacement vessel. By 1964 the loan was paid off in full. Having no further need for the $150,000, and in accord with the wishes of petitioners,1 A & redeemed the preferred stock in 1965 and 1966 in two equal installments. No premium was paid and petitioners received precisely the amount each had previously invested. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue treated the redemptions as the receipt of ordinary income, taking the view that they were 'essentially equivalent to a dividend' within the meaning of 302(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 29 U.S.C. 302(b)(1).

v. Ariadne Shipping Co., Ltd.
No. 231
Argued January 13, 1970
Decided March 9, 1970
397 U.S. 195

Syllabus 
Respondents, a Liberian corporation and a Panamanian corporation, employed foreign crews to operate cruise ships to the Caribbean from Florida.  When the vessels berthed at Florida ports, the ships' crews in part and outside labor in part performed the loading, which the petitioner union picketed, protesting that the longshore work was being done at substandard wage rates.  Respondents obtained injunctive relief against the picketing from the Florida courts, which held that the picketing was beyond the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and could be enjoined as violative of Florida law.
Held:  Since this dispute centered on wages to be paid American longshoremen working on American docks, and did not concern the ships' ""internal discipline and order,"" it was not within the scope of ""maritime operations of foreign-flag ships,"" which are outside the jurisdiction of the NLRB.  Petitioner's peaceful primary picketing arguably constituted protected activity under  7 of the National Labor Relations Act, and, thus, the NLRB's jurisdiction was exclusive, and preempted that of the Florida courts.  Pp.  397 U. S. 198-201.

Syllabus 
In May, 1969, the District Court ordered the Memphis Board of Education to file a revised desegregation plan, and, by January 1, 1970, to file a map of proposed zone boundaries and enrollment figures by race within the revised zones, so as to enable the court to reconsider the adequacy of a transfer provision.  The court found that the existing and supplemental plans did ""not have real prospects for dismantling the state-imposed dual system at the earliest practicable date.'""  The Court of Appeals denied petitioners' request, based on Alexander v. Holmes County Board, 396 U. S. 19, for an injunction requiring the Board to file, by January 5, 1970, a plan for the operation of the schools as a unitary system for the current school year, on the ground that Alexander was inapplicable because the Board had converted the ""dual system into a unitary system.""
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred (1) in substituting its finding that the Board is not now operating a dual system for the District Court's contrary findings, which were based on substantial evidence; (2) in ruling prematurely that the Board had converted to a unitary system, since neither the revised plan nor the school zones and enrollment figures ordered to be filed by January 1, 1970, were properly before it for review, and (3) in holding that Alexander is inapplicable to this case.
Certiorari granted; Court of Appeals' remand of December 19, 1969, affirmed as modified; Court of Appeals' order of January 12, 1970, denying injunctive relief, affirmed; motion for injunction pending certiorari denied.

Syllabus 
Respondents owned commercial fishing boats, the fishing being done through oral contractual arrangements with boat captains who staffed and provisioned the boats and managed their day-to-day operation.  The captains, without an earnings guarantee if they failed to catch fish, agreed to make fishing trips for the season and to return the catches to plants designated by respondents.  The plants paid respondents according to the volume of the catch, and respondents paid the captains and crews on the same basis, according to previously negotiated terms.  Respondents filed tax returns as employers under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), and paid the employer's share of the taxes due on the earnings of the captains and crews.  Those statutes define ""employee"" as any individual who has employee status under ""the usual common law rules"" applicable to a determination of the master-servant relationship.  Respondents, after making refund claims, sued for refunds in the District Court, which determined that the captains and crews were not respondents' employees under those statutes, holding that the statutes' prescription of ""common law rules"" barred application of maritime standards.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Syllabus 
Following protracted collective bargaining negotiations between respondent union and the petitioner revolving mainly around the union's desire to have the company ""check-off"" the dues owed to the union by its members, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) made a finding, which the Court of Appeals approved, that the company's refusal to bargain about the check-off was not made in good faith, but solely to frustrate the making of a collective bargaining agreement.  Thereafter, the NLRB ordered the petitioner to grant the union a contract check-off clause.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the order, concluding that  8(d) of the National Labor Relations Act did not forbid the NLRB to compel agreement.
Held:  Though the NLRB has power under the Act to require employers and employees to negotiate, it does not have the power to compel either to agree to any substantive contractual provision of a collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  397 U. S. 102-109.

			"|"H. K. Porter Co., Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board
No. 230
Argued January 15, 1970
Decided March 2, 1970
397 U.S. 99

Syllabus 
Following protracted collective bargaining negotiations between respondent union and the petitioner revolving mainly around the union's desire to have the company ""check-off"" the dues owed to the union by its members, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) made a finding, which the Court of Appeals approved, that the company's refusal to bargain about the check-off was not made in good faith, but solely to frustrate the making of a collective bargaining agreement.  Thereafter, the NLRB ordered the petitioner to grant the union a contract check-off clause.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the order, concluding that  8(d) of the National Labor Relations Act did not forbid the NLRB to compel agreement.
Held:  Though the NLRB has power under the Act to require employers and employees to negotiate, it does not have the power to compel either to agree to any substantive contractual provision of a collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  397 U. S. 102-109.
134 U.S.App.D.C. 227, 414 F.2d 1123, reversed and remanded.

No. 441
Argued January 14, 1970
Decided March 2, 1970
397 U.S. 112

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who was required to register for the draft between June 23 (his 18th birthday) and June 28, 1959, in accordance with a presidential proclamation issued pursuant to  3 of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, did not register at. any time.  Section 3 make it
""the duty of every male citizen . . . who, on the day or days fixed for the first or any subsequent registration, is between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six, to present himself for and submit to registration""
at the time and place and in such manner ""as shall be determined by proclamation of the President and by rules and regulations prescribed thereunder.""  Petitioner was indicted in May, 1967, for failing to register, and was convicted.  The District Court held that the Act imposes a continuing duty to register which lasts until age 26, and thus the prosecution was not barred by the five-year statute of limitations in 18 U.S.C.  3282.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The offense is not a continuing one, but was committed by petitioner's failure to register in 1959, when the statute of limitations began to run.  P.   397 U. S. 114-124.

||"Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.
No. 301
Argued January 13, 1970
Decided March 2, 1970
397 U.S. 137

Syllabus 
Appellee company grows cantaloupes of superior quality in Parker, Arizona.  Since the company lacks packing sheds in Parker, it transports the cantaloupes to its nearby facilities in California, where they are sorted, inspected, packed, and shipped in containers that bear the name of the California packer.  Appellant official, acting under the Arizona Fruit and Vegetable Standardization Act, which is designed to prevent deceptive packaging, entered an order prohibiting the company from shipping its cantaloupes outside the State unless they were packed in containers in a manner approved by appellant.  Appellant contends that his order is necessary to ensure that the cantaloupes be identified as of Arizona origin.  Appellee brought this suit for injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of the order, which would have the effect of requiring appellee to build packing facilities in or near Parker at a cost of about $200,000.  A three-judge District Court issued an injunction holding that the order constituted an unlawful burden on interstate commerce.
Held:
1. Appellant's order burdens interstate commerce, since the cantaloupes were destined to be shipped from Arizona to an ascertainable location in California immediately after harvest, and application of the challenged statute would require an operation now conducted outside the State to be performed within the State so it can be regulated there.  Pp.  397 U. S. 140-142.
2. The burden on interstate commerce imposed by appellant's order is unconstitutional, since Arizona's minimal interest in identifying the origin of appellee's cantaloupes to enhance the reputation of Arizona producers cannot justify subjecting appellee to the substantial capital expenditure of building and operating in Arizona a packing plant that it does not need.  Pp.  397 U. S. 142-146.
Affirmed.

No. 37
Argued November 10, 1969
Decided February 25, 1970
397 U.S. 50

Syllabus 
Appellants, residents and taxpayers of the Kansas City School District, one of eight school districts constituting the Junior College District of Metropolitan Kansas City, brought this suit claiming that their right to vote for trustees of the district was unconstitutionally diluted in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment since their separate district contains approximately 60% of the total apportionment basis of the entire junior college district, but the state statutory formula results in the election of only 50% of the trustees from their district.  The trial court's dismissal of the suit was upheld by the Missouri Supreme Court, which held the ""one man, one vote"" principle inapplicable.
Held:  Whenever a state or local government by popular election selects persons to perform public functions, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that each qualified voter have an equal opportunity to participate in the election, and when members of an elected body are chosen from separate districts, each district must be established on a basis that, as far as practicable, will insure that equal numbers of voters can vote for proportionally equal numbers of officials.

Syllabus 
Appellees brought this action challenging, under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and under certain provisions of the Alaska Constitution relating to fish resources, the constitutionality of an Alaska statute and regulations limiting commercial salmon fishing licensees to defined groups of persons.  Appellants' motion to dismiss or alternatively to stay the proceedings pending state court determination with respect to the Alaska constitutional provisions (which have never been interpreted by an Alaska court) was denied, and appellees' motion for summary judgment was granted, the three-judge District Court holding the Act and regulations invalid under both the Federal and State Constitutions.
Held:  The District Court should have abstained from deciding the case on the merits pending resolution of the state constitutional questions by the state courts, a procedure that could conceivably avoid any decision under the Fourteenth Amendment and any possible irritant in the federal-state relationship.

Decided February 24, 1970
397 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Respondents are corporate officers who, with the corporation, were convicted of violating the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  An in rem action against two corporate products had been begun in June, 1960, and interrogatories routinely prepared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were submitted to the corporation in January, 1961.  Later that month, the corporation and respondents were notified, pursuant to  305 of the Act, that the FDA contemplated a criminal proceeding against them respecting the transactions that were the subject of the civil action.  In June, 1961, the District Court denied the corporation's motion to stay further proceedings in the civil action or to extend the time for answering the interrogatories until after disposition of any criminal proceeding.  The FDA recommended criminal prosecution prior to the September answer to the interrogatories by the corporation through respondent Feldten.  No one associated with the corporation asserted his privilege against self-incrimination.  The Court of Appeals reversed respondents' convictions on the ground that use of interrogatories to obtain evidence in a nearly contemporaneous civil condemnation proceeding operated to violate their Fifth Amendment privilege.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the answers to the interrogatories were involuntarily given.  Pp.  397 U. S. 6-11. 
Page 397 U. S. 2

(a) Respondent Feldten, who was not barred from asserting his privilege against self-incrimination because the corporation had no privilege of its own or because the proceeding was civil, rather than criminal, failed to assert his privilege, and cannot now complain that he was forced to testify against himself.  Pp.  397 U. S. 7-10.
(b) Respondent Kordel, who answered no interrogatories and did not assert the privilege, can hardly claim compulsory self-incrimination, and Kordel cannot claim that his right to confrontation was violated by use in the criminal case against him of his codefendant Feldten's admissions, which were never introduced in evidence.  Pp.  397 U. S. 10-11.
2. On the record here the respondents have not established a violation of due process or a departure from proper standards in the administration of justice requiring the exercise of the Court's supervisory power.  Pp.  397 U. S. 11-13.

No. 234
Argued January 13, 1970
Decided February 24, 1970
397 U.S. 25

Syllabus 
Employees of the Erie Lackawanna Railroad Co., who were furloughed and never recalled, filed suit against the railroad, their union, and subordinate organizations and officers of the union, alleging that the railroad had wrongfully discharged them and that the union defendants had been ""guilty of gross nonfeasance and hostile discrimination"" in refusing to process their claims.  They sought damages from the railroad, the union defendants, or both.  The District Court dismissed the complaint against the railroad for failure to exhaust the Railway Labor Act's administrative remedies and for lack of diversity jurisdiction, and against the union for failure adequately to allege a breach of duty and because the plaintiffs could have processed their own grievances.  The Court of Appeals reversed with respect to the action against the union defendants, holding that the complaint adequately alleged a breach of the union's duty of fair representation.  It affirmed dismissal of the complaint against the railroad, but held that, on remand, the employees could maintain their action against the railroad if they amended the complaint to allege that the employer was implicated in the union's discrimination.
Held:
1. The complaint against the union was sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.  The claim for breach of the union's duty of fair representation is a discrete claim, being distinct from the right of individual employees under the Railway Labor Act to pursue their employer before the Adjustment Board.  Pp.  397 U. S. 27-28.
2. The union can be sued alone for breach of its duty, and it cannot complain if separate actions are brought against it and the employer for the portion of the total damages caused by each where the union and the employer have independently caused damage to the employees.  Pp.  397 U. S. 28-29.

|396 u.s. 491|"United States v. Interstate Commerce Commission
No. 28
Argued October 21, 1969
Decided February 2, 1970*
396 U.S. 491

Syllabus 
In 1967, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) approved a merger plan filed by the Great Northern Railway Co. (GN) and the Northern Pacific Railway Co. (NP) (collectively the Northern Lines), and three of their subsidiaries, the Pacific Coast Railroad Co., the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co. (Burlington), and the Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway Co. (SP&S).  The Northern Lines operate largely west from St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Duluth, across the Northern Tier of States to Spokane, Tacoma, and Portland. NP, with about 6,200 miles of track, runs generally to the south of GN, which operates about 8,200 miles of track.  The Northern Lines jointly own and control the Burlington and the SP&S.  The Burlington has 8,648 miles of track extending from Chicago to the Twin Cities and southwesterly to Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, and Montana, and, by its subsidiaries, reaches Houston and Galveston.  The SP&S has more than 500 miles of mainline road in Oregon and Washington which provides the most direct route from Spokane to Portland and is of strategic importance to the Northern Lines.  Rail competition in the Northern Lines' area is provided by GN and NP (the principal competitors), and the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Co. (Milwaukee), which has not been an effective long-haul competitor, never having had adequate access to the Pacific Northwest gateways.  Truck competition, present in the area for some time, is growing.  GN's and NP's merger efforts span three-quarters of a century.  The present merger plan was disapproved by the ICC in 1966 by a vote of 6 to 5, the ICC finding that:  although the estimated annual savings would approximate $25 million by the tenth year after merger, a significant source of 
Page 396 U. S. 492
 the savings would be the elimination of jobs; the merger would eliminate substantial competition between GN and NP; even with protective conditions for the benefit of the Milwaukee, it would remain a weak competitor, and the plan did not afford benefits of such scope and importance as to outweigh the lessening of rail competition in the Northern Tier.  The ICC reopened the proceedings in 1967 and considered new evidence on savings to be realized from the merger, and the additional evidence resulting in the changed position of some of the major objectors to the plan.  The ICC found that:  the savings would be more than $40 million a year by the tenth year; agreements with the employees had removed union objections to the merger and provided that no jobs would be eliminated except by attrition, and the applicants had accepted all protective conditions sought by Milwaukee, and acknowledged that it had failed to give appropriate weight to  5 of the Interstate Commerce Act to facilitate rail mergers ""consistent with the public interest.""  The ICC then reexamined the anticompetitive effects of the merger, weighing them against the savings and benefits to the public, shippers, and the roads, and, emphasizing the strengthened position of the Milwaukee, approved the plan because its benefits outweighed its anticompetitive effects.  The three-judge District Court sustained the ICC, holding that the ICC was guided by the applicable legal principles and that its findings were supported by substantial evidence.  Four appeals were taken:  (1) the United States, through the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, argues that the ICC did not properly apply the standard of  5 in determining that the merger was consistent with the public interest.  It contends that, when a merger will substantially diminish competition between two financially healthy, competing roads, the anticompetitive effects should preclude approval absent a clear showing that a serious transportation need will be met or important public benefits will be provided beyond the normal savings and efficiencies deriving from a merger; (2) the Northern Pacific Stockholders' Protective Committee challenges the exchange ratios agreed upon by the companies for their stock on the basis that NP's land holdings were insufficiently valued; (3) the City of Auburn, Washington (the western terminus for NP's transcontinental trains whose yard would be closed if the merger were approved), supports the Department of Justice's brief, and contends that the ICC failed to assess adequately the impact of the merger on affected communities, and (4) the Livingston Anti-Merger Committee urges that the ICC had no authority to 
Page 396 U. S. 493
 approve the merger because the NP, the successor by purchase in 1896 to the Northern Pacific Railroad Co. (Railroad) does not own the franchise and right of way involved in the merger, as Congress did not authorize the sale, as required by Railroad's charter, and Railroad is not a party to the merger, and that, if it is held that NP does own the franchise, no merger can take place without approval of Congress.
Held:
1. The ICC's conclusion that the merger, as conditioned, comported with the public interest under the standards of  5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1940, is supported by the findings which the ICC made on the basis of substantial evidence after measuring the competitive consequences of the merger against its resulting benefits.  Pp.  396 U. S. 506-516.
(a) Congress intended by the 1940 amendments ""to facilitate merger and consolidation in the national transportation system,"" and that the industry ""proceed toward an integrated transportation system"" (County of Marin v. United States, 356 U. S. 412,  356 U. S. 416, 418), and the congressional objective is not to be read as confining mergers to situations where weak carriers are preserved by combining with those that are strong.  Pp.  396 U. S. 508-511.
(b) Congress vested in the ICC the task of
""apprais[ing] the effects of the curtailment of competition which will result from [a] proposed consolidation and consider them along with the advantages of improved service, safer operation, lower costs, etc., to determine whether the consolidation will assist in effectuating the over-all transportation policy.""
McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, 321 U. S. 67,  321 U. S. 87.  Pp.  396 U. S. 511-513.
(c) The ICC's determination that the conditions agreed to by the applicants, the attrition agreements with the employees, the enhanced savings, and manifold service improvements to shippers and the public, outweighed the loss of competition between the Northern Lines, is supported by substantial evidence.  Pp.  396 U. S. 513-516.
2. The ICC's determination that the stock exchange ratio applicable to Northern Pacific stockholders and Great Northern stockholders, which was established, after protracted arm's-length negotiations, with the approval of the companies and the large majority of their stockholders, is just and reasonable, is supported by substantial evidence, and the ICC's refusal to reopen the record for evidence to update it was not an abuse of discretion.  Pp.  396 U. S. 516-522. 
Page 396 U. S. 494

3. The ICC found on the basis of substantial evidence that the merger's long-run effect would benefit the Northern Tier communities, including Auburn, even if that city's yard closed if the merger was approved.  Since it now appears that the Auburn yard will remain open, the anticipated principal harm to the city because of the merger has disappeared, and, a fortiori, the ICC's refusal to take further evidence on the merger's impact on the city was not an abuse of its discretion.  Pp.  396 U. S. 522-524.
4. The ICC did not err in refusing to disapprove the merger because of the Livingston Anti-Merger Committee's contention that acquisition by NP of its railroad property resulted from invalid foreclosure proceedings, as the ICC could, for purposes of the merger proceeding, properly rely on ""existing judicial records supplemented by opinions of two Attorneys General"" on the title question which were adverse to the Committee's challenge; nor do the charter provisions of NP's predecessor in interest foreclose the ICC's approval of the merger.  Pp.  396 U. S. 524-530.
296 F.Supp. 853, affirmed.

 the savings would be the elimination of jobs; the merger would eliminate substantial competition between GN and NP; even with protective conditions for the benefit of the Milwaukee, it would remain a weak competitor, and the plan did not afford benefits of such scope and importance as to outweigh the lessening of rail competition in the Northern Tier.  The ICC reopened the proceedings in 1967 and considered new evidence on savings to be realized from the merger, and the additional evidence resulting in the changed position of some of the major objectors to the plan.  The ICC found that:  the savings would be more than $40 million a year by the tenth year; agreements with the employees had removed union objections to the merger and provided that no jobs would be eliminated except by attrition, and the applicants had accepted all protective conditions sought by Milwaukee, and acknowledged that it had failed to give appropriate weight to  5 of the Interstate Commerce Act to facilitate rail mergers ""consistent with the public interest.""  The ICC then reexamined the anticompetitive effects of the merger, weighing them against the savings and benefits to the public, shippers, and the roads, and, emphasizing the strengthened position of the Milwaukee, approved the plan because its benefits outweighed its anticompetitive effects.  The three-judge District Court sustained the ICC, holding that the ICC was guided by the applicable legal principles and that its findings were supported by substantial evidence.  Four appeals were taken:  (1) the United States, through the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, argues that the ICC did not properly apply the standard of  5 in determining that the merger was consistent with the public interest.  It contends that, when a merger will substantially diminish competition between two financially healthy, competing roads, the anticompetitive effects should preclude approval absent a clear showing that a serious transportation need will be met or important public benefits will be provided beyond the normal savings and efficiencies deriving from a merger; (2) the Northern Pacific Stockholders' Protective Committee challenges the exchange ratios agreed upon by the companies for their stock on the basis that NP's land holdings were insufficiently valued; (3) the City of Auburn, Washington (the western terminus for NP's transcontinental trains whose yard would be closed if the merger were approved), supports the Department of Justice's brief, and contends that the ICC failed to assess adequately the impact of the merger on affected communities, and (4) the Livingston Anti-Merger Committee urges that the ICC had no authority to 
Page 396 U. S. 493
 approve the merger because the NP, the successor by purchase in 1896 to the Northern Pacific Railroad Co. (Railroad) does not own the franchise and right of way involved in the merger, as Congress did not authorize the sale, as required by Railroad's charter, and Railroad is not a party to the merger, and that, if it is held that NP does own the franchise, no merger can take place without approval of Congress.
Held:
1. The ICC's conclusion that the merger, as conditioned, comported with the public interest under the standards of  5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the Transportation Act of 1940, is supported by the findings which the ICC made on the basis of substantial evidence after measuring the competitive consequences of the merger against its resulting benefits.  Pp.  396 U. S. 506-516.
(a) Congress intended by the 1940 amendments ""to facilitate merger and consolidation in the national transportation system,"" and that the industry ""proceed toward an integrated transportation system"" (County of Marin v. United States, 356 U. S. 412,  356 U. S. 416, 418), and the congressional objective is not to be read as confining mergers to situations where weak carriers are preserved by combining with those that are strong.  Pp.  396 U. S. 508-511.
(b) Congress vested in the ICC the task of
""apprais[ing] the effects of the curtailment of competition which will result from [a] proposed consolidation and consider them along with the advantages of improved service, safer operation, lower costs, etc., to determine whether the consolidation will assist in effectuating the over-all transportation policy.""
McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, 321 U. S. 67,  321 U. S. 87.  Pp.  396 U. S. 511-513.
(c) The ICC's determination that the conditions agreed to by the applicants, the attrition agreements with the employees, the enhanced savings, and manifold service improvements to shippers and the public, outweighed the loss of competition between the Northern Lines, is supported by substantial evidence.  Pp.  396 U. S. 513-516.
2. The ICC's determination that the stock exchange ratio applicable to Northern Pacific stockholders and Great Northern stockholders, which was established, after protracted arm's-length negotiations, with the approval of the companies and the large majority of their stockholders, is just and reasonable, is supported by substantial evidence, and the ICC's refusal to reopen the record for evidence to update it was not an abuse of discretion.  Pp.  396 U. S. 516-522. 
Page 396 U. S. 494

3. The ICC found on the basis of substantial evidence that the merger's long-run effect would benefit the Northern Tier communities, including Auburn, even if that city's yard closed if the merger was approved.  Since it now appears that the Auburn yard will remain open, the anticipated principal harm to the city because of the merger has disappeared, and, a fortiori, the ICC's refusal to take further evidence on the merger's impact on the city was not an abuse of its discretion.  Pp.  396 U. S. 522-524.
4. The ICC did not err in refusing to disapprove the merger because of the Livingston Anti-Merger Committee's contention that acquisition by NP of its railroad property resulted from invalid foreclosure proceedings, as the ICC could, for purposes of the merger proceeding, properly rely on ""existing judicial records supplemented by opinions of two Attorneys General"" on the title question which were adverse to the Committee's challenge; nor do the charter provisions of NP's predecessor in interest foreclose the ICC's approval of the merger.  Pp.  396 U. S. 524-530.
296 F.Supp. 853, affirmed.

|396 u.s. 435|"Evans v. Abney
No. 60
Argued November 12-13, 1969
Decided January 26, 1970
396 U.S. 435

Syllabus 
By his 1911 will, Senator Bacon conveyed a trust of land in Macon to the city for the creation of a park for the exclusive use of white people.  This Court held, in Evans v. Newton, 382 U. S. 296, that the park could not continue to be operated on a racially discriminatory basis.  The Georgia Supreme Court then held ""that the sole purpose for which the trust was created has become impossible of accomplishment, and has been terminated,"" and remanded the case to the trial court, which held the doctrine of cy pres to be inapplicable, since the park's segregated character was an essential and inseparable part of the testator's plan.  The trial court ruled that the trust failed, and that the property reverted to Senator Bacon's heirs, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. The state courts did no more than apply well settled principles of Georgia law to determine the meaning and effect of a Georgia will.  Pp. 439-443.
2. The Georgia Supreme Court's action declaring the trust terminated did not violate any constitutionally protected rights.  Pp.  396 U. S. 443-446.
(a) The termination of the trust was not the imposition of a drastic ""penalty,"" the ""forfeiture"" of the park merely because of the city's compliance with the constitutional mandate of Evans v. Newton, supra, but was the result of the construction of Senator Bacon's will to the effect that Senator Bacon would rather have had the trust terminated than have had the park integrated.  P.  396 U. S. 444.
(b) This is a case where the racial restrictions were solely the product of the testator's social philosophy, not that of the State or its agent.  The decision below eliminated discrimination against Negroes in the park by eliminating the park, a loss shared equally by both races.  Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, distinguished.  P.  396 U. S. 445.
(c) There is no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment where a state court applies, without any racial animus, its normal 
Page 396 U. S. 436
 principles of construction to determine the testator's true intent in establishing a charitable trust and concludes, because of neutral and nondiscriminatory state trust laws, that everyone is to be deprived of the benefits of the trust.  Pp.  396 U. S. 445-446.
(d) The trust ""failed"" under Georgia law not because of the unspoken premise that the presence of Negroes would destroy the desirability of the park for whites, but because the testator intended that the park remain forever for the exclusive use of white people.  P.  396 U. S. 447.
224 Ga. 826, 165 S.E.2d 160, affirmed.

1. The state courts did no more than apply well settled principles of Georgia law to determine the meaning and effect of a Georgia will.  Pp. 439-443.
2. The Georgia Supreme Court's action declaring the trust terminated did not violate any constitutionally protected rights.  Pp.  396 U. S. 443-446.
(a) The termination of the trust was not the imposition of a drastic ""penalty,"" the ""forfeiture"" of the park merely because of the city's compliance with the constitutional mandate of Evans v. Newton, supra, but was the result of the construction of Senator Bacon's will to the effect that Senator Bacon would rather have had the trust terminated than have had the park integrated.  P.  396 U. S. 444.
(b) This is a case where the racial restrictions were solely the product of the testator's social philosophy, not that of the State or its agent.  The decision below eliminated discrimination against Negroes in the park by eliminating the park, a loss shared equally by both races.  Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, distinguished.  P.  396 U. S. 445.
(c) There is no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment where a state court applies, without any racial animus, its normal 
Page 396 U. S. 436
 principles of construction to determine the testator's true intent in establishing a charitable trust and concludes, because of neutral and nondiscriminatory state trust laws, that everyone is to be deprived of the benefits of the trust.  Pp.  396 U. S. 445-446.
(d) The trust ""failed"" under Georgia law not because of the unspoken premise that the presence of Negroes would destroy the desirability of the park for whites, but because the testator intended that the park remain forever for the exclusive use of white people.  P.  396 U. S. 447.

No. 65
Argued November 19, 1969
Decided January 26, 1970
396 U.S. 460

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an undergraduate student with a student deferment, surrendered his draft registration card, solely to protest the war in Vietnam, at a public gathering.  His local draft board declared him ""delinquent"" for failing to have the card in his possession, and reclassified him I-A (available for military service).  He filed this suit in the District Court seeking to enjoin possible induction into the Armed Forces, on the ground that his delinquency reclassification was invalid.  The respondent local board moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, relying on  10(b)(3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, which provides that there shall be no pre-induction judicial review of a registrant's classification or processing, such review being limited to a defense in a criminal prosecution.  The District Court granted the motion to dismiss, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Section 10(b)(3) of the Act does not bar pre-induction judicial review of petitioner's delinquency reclassification which deprived him of a deferment to which he was entitled under the Act.  Oestereich v. Selective Service Board, 393 U. S. 233.  Pp.  396 U. S. 463-468.
2. Section 6(h)(1) of the Act makes undergraduate student deferments mandatory where the student, as here, has met the statutory criteria, and the reference in that section to ""rules and regulations"" only authorizes such additional administrative procedures as necessary to ensure that qualified students are given deferment.  P.  396 U. S. 464.
3. Congress did not authorize induction by local boards as a penalty for violations of administrative regulations.  Gutknecht v. United States, ante, p.  396 U. S. 295.  Pp.  396 U. S. 465-466.
4. In the context of this case, there is no meaningful distinction between ""exemption"" and ""deferment,"" and a registrant with either type of classification cannot be inducted.  Pp.  396 U. S. 466-467.  406 F.2d 636, reversed and remanded.

Argued November 17, 1969
Decided January 26, 1970
396 U.S. 471

Syllabus 
Section 2218 of the New York Surrogate's Court Procedure Act authorizes the surrogate to order an alien's share of a New York estate paid into court when it appears that the alien ""would not have the benefit or use or control of the money or property"" constituting the share.  Appellants, who live in Romania and are beneficiaries of New York decedents' estates and whose shares were paid into court for their benefit under  2218, filed a complaint challenging its constitutionality and seeking temporary and permanent injunctive relief against its operation.  In the three-judge District Court which was convened, appellants moved for summary judgment, contending that, under Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U. S. 429,  2218 is unconstitutional on its face and as applied, and requesting ""the relief prayed for in the complaint.""  Appellants filed no separate application for a preliminary injunction, and have not urged the appropriateness of temporary relief for the release of the court-held funds.  The District Court denied summary judgment, but did not dismiss the complaint as urged by appellees, surrogates of several New York counties.  Appellants appealed to this Court from the order denying summary judgment, claiming that this Court has jurisdiction by virtue of 28 U.S.C.  1253, which, in pertinent part, provides for an appeal
""to the Supreme Court from an order granting or denying . . . an interlocutory or permanent injunction in any civil action . . . required by an Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges.""
Held:  The only interlocutory orders that this Court has power to review under  1253 are those granting or denying preliminary injunctions, and therefore this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the District Court's interlocutory order, which involved no question of preliminary injunctive relief.  Pp.  396 U. S. 475-479.

Syllabus 
Respondent, who was convicted of murder in 1956 in a Nebraska state court, petitioned the federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus.  That court, relying on state court findings in a 1965 post-conviction proceeding, concluded that respondent's confessions were voluntary and dismissed the petition.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the trial judge had not found the confessions voluntary before admitting them into evidence, contrary to Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.

 Rehearing Denied March 9, 1970. 
 See 397 U.S. 978. 
 Harold E. Kohn and David H. Marion, for petitioners. John J. Wilson, for respondent. 
 Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Denied. The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this petition.
 Mr. Justice BLACK, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS joins, dissenting. Shortly before the 1964 Presidential election, Fact magazine published an issue entitled 'The Unconscious of a Conservative: A special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater.' The thrust of the two main articles in this issue of Fact was that Senator Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican nominee for the Presidency, had a severely paranoid personality and was psychologically unift for the high office to which he aspired. The articles in the magazine attempted to support the thesis that Senator Goldwater was mentally ill by citing allegedly factual incidents from his public and private life and by reporting the results of a 'poll' of 12,356 psychiatrists, together with a 'sampling' of the comments made by the 2, 417 psychiatrists who responded to the poll questionnaire which the magazine mailed out. Shortly after the publication of the 'special Goldwater issue,' Senator Goldwater commenced this libel action for damages against Fact Magainze, Inc., Warren against Fact Magazine, Inc., Warren Boroson, the named author of one of the and publisher of Fact. The suit was brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on the basis of diversity of citizenship. After 15 days of trial, the jury returned a verdict against each of the defendants. Although the jury awarded Goldwater only $1.00 in compensatory damages against all three defendants, it went on to 
Page 396 U.S. 1049 , 1050
 award him punitive damages of $25,000 against Ginzburg and $50,000 against Fact Magazine, Inc. In their appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Ginzburg and the other defendants attacked this award of damages, arguing that it severely penalized them for exercising their First Amendment rights to free speech and a free press. The Court of Appeals found, however, that the defendants had been accorded at trial all the First Amendment protection to which they were entitled under this Court's holdings in New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, (1964), and its progeny. New York Times and the cases following it permit public figures and officials to recover damages for libelous statements made about them if the publication was made with 'actual malice-that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.' New York Times v. Sullivan, supra, at 280, 84 S.Ct. at 726. See, e. g., Rosenblatt v. Baer, 383 U.S. 75 (1966). The Court of Appeals found that the District Court had properly applied the New York Times 'actual malice' rule and affirmed Goldwater's libel award. Defendants Ginzburg and Fact Magazine, Inc., then petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals. It is this petition which this Court today denies. 
 Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice BLACK with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS joins. 
 I cannot subscribe to the result the Court reaches today because I firmly believe that the First Amendment guarantees to each person in this country the unconditional right to print what he pleases about public affairs. See Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 170 (concurring and dissenting opinion); and New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 293 (1964) (concurring opinion).

|396 u.s. 375|"Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co.
No. 64
Argued November 13, 1969
Decided January 20, 1970
396 U.S. 375

Syllabus 
Petitioners, minority shareholders of respondent Electric Auto-Lite Co., brought this action derivatively and on behalf of minority shareholders as a class to set aside a merger of Auto-Lite and the Mergenthaler Linotype Co. (which, before the merger, owned over half of Auto-Lite's stock).  Petitioners charged that the proxy solicitation for the merger by Auto-Lite's management was materially misleading, and violated  14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 thereunder in that the merger was recommended to Auto-Lite's shareholders by that company's directors without their disclosing that they were all nominees of and controlled by Mergenthaler.  The District Court, on petitioners' motion for summary judgment, ruled that the claimed defect in the proxy statement was a material omission, and, after a hearing, concluded that, without the votes of minority stockholders, approval of the merger could not have been achieved, and that a causal relationship had thus been shown between the finding of a  14(a) violation and the alleged injury to petitioners.  The court referred the case to a master to consider appropriate relief.  On interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the conclusion that the proxy statement was materially deficient, but held that the granting of summary judgment with respect to causation was erroneous, and that it was necessary to resolve at trial whether there was a causal relationship between the deficiency in the proxy statement and the merger.  Finding that causation could not be directly established because of the impracticalities of determining how many votes were affected, the court ruled that the issue was to be determined by proof of fairness of the merger, and, if the respondents could prove fairness, it could be concluded that a sufficient number of shareholders would have approved the merger regardless of the misrepresentation.
Held:
1. Fairness of the merger terms does not constitute a defense to a private action for violation of  14(a) of the Act complaining of materially misleading solicitation of proxies that authorized a corporate merger.  Pp.  396 U. S. 381-385. 
Page 396 U. S. 376

(a) Permitting liability to be foreclosed on the basis of a finding that the merger was fair would contravene the purpose of  14(a) by bypassing the stockholders.  Pp.  396 U. S. 381-382.
(b) Imposing on small shareholders the burden of rebutting the corporation's evidence of fairness would discourage them from the private enforcement of proxy rules that ""provides a necessary supplement to Commission action.""  J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426,  377 U. S. 432.  Pp.  396 U. S. 382-383.
(c) The evidence submitted at the hearing as to the causal relationship between the proxy material and the merger was sufficient to establish petitioners' cause of action.  P.  396 U. S. 383.
(d) Where, as here, there was proof that the misstatement or omission in the proxy statement was material, this showing that the defect might have been considered important in shaping the shareholders' vote is sufficient without proof, which the Court of Appeals erroneously held was necessary, that its effect was decisive.  Pp.  396 U. S. 384-385.
2. In devising retrospective relief for violation of the proxy rules, the federal courts should be guided by the principles of equity.  Pp.  396 U. S. 386-389.
(a) The fairness of the merger may be a relevant consideration in determining the appropriate relief, and the merger should be set aside only if a court of equity concludes from all the circumstances that it would be equitable to do so.  Pp.  396 U. S. 386-388.
(b) Damages should be recoverable here only to the extent that they can be proved.  Pp.  396 U. S. 388-389.
3. Petitioners, who have established a violation of the securities laws by their corporation and its officials, are entitled to an interim award of litigation expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in proving the violation, since the expenses petitioners incurred were for the benefit of the corporation and the other stockholders.  The Court does not decide the further question of reimbursement for litigation expenses incurred in any ensuing proceedings.  Pp.  396 U. S. 389-397.

The District Court, on petitioners' motion for summary judgment, ruled that the claimed defect in the proxy statement was a material omission, and, after a hearing, concluded that, without the votes of minority stockholders, approval of the merger could not have been achieved, and that a causal relationship had thus been shown between the finding of a  14(a) violation and the alleged injury to petitioners.  The court referred the case to a master to consider appropriate relief.  On interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the conclusion that the proxy statement was materially deficient, but held that the granting of summary judgment with respect to causation was erroneous, and that it was necessary to resolve at trial whether there was a causal relationship between the deficiency in the proxy statement and the merger.  Finding that causation could not be directly established because of the impracticalities of determining how many votes were affected, the court ruled that the issue was to be determined by proof of fairness of the merger, and, if the respondents could prove fairness, it could be concluded that a sufficient number of shareholders would have approved the merger regardless of the misrepresentation.
Held:
1. Fairness of the merger terms does not constitute a defense to a private action for violation of  14(a) of the Act complaining of materially misleading solicitation of proxies that authorized a corporate merger.  Pp.  396 U. S. 381-385. 
Page 396 U. S. 376

(a) Permitting liability to be foreclosed on the basis of a finding that the merger was fair would contravene the purpose of  14(a) by bypassing the stockholders.  Pp.  396 U. S. 381-382.
(b) Imposing on small shareholders the burden of rebutting the corporation's evidence of fairness would discourage them from the private enforcement of proxy rules that ""provides a necessary supplement to Commission action.""  J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426,  377 U. S. 432.  Pp.  396 U. S. 382-383.
(c) The evidence submitted at the hearing as to the causal relationship between the proxy material and the merger was sufficient to establish petitioners' cause of action.  P.  396 U. S. 383.
(d) Where, as here, there was proof that the misstatement or omission in the proxy statement was material, this showing that the defect might have been considered important in shaping the shareholders' vote is sufficient without proof, which the Court of Appeals erroneously held was necessary, that its effect was decisive.  Pp.  396 U. S. 384-385.
2. In devising retrospective relief for violation of the proxy rules, the federal courts should be guided by the principles of equity.  Pp.  396 U. S. 386-389.
(a) The fairness of the merger may be a relevant consideration in determining the appropriate relief, and the merger should be set aside only if a court of equity concludes from all the circumstances that it would be equitable to do so.  Pp.  396 U. S. 386-388.
(b) Damages should be recoverable here only to the extent that they can be proved.  Pp.  396 U. S. 388-389.
3. Petitioners, who have established a violation of the securities laws by their corporation and its officials, are entitled to an interim award of litigation expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in proving the violation, since the expenses petitioners incurred were for the benefit of the corporation and the other stockholders.  The Court does not decide the further question of reimbursement for litigation expenses incurred in any ensuing proceedings.  Pp.  396 U. S. 389-397.

Syllabus 
Narcotics agents stopped a car in which petitioner was riding and found a package, which petitioner had thrown away, containing about 15 grams of a cocaine and sugar mixture, 5% of which was cocaine, and a package in the car weighing about 48 grams consisting of a total of 275 glassine bags containing a heroin mixture, 15.2% of which was heroin.  Petitioner was indicted and convicted of four narcotics violations:  (1) knowingly receiving, concealing, and facilitating the transportation and concealment of heroin knowing the heroin had been illegally imported into the United States, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  174; (2) knowingly purchasing, possessing, dispensing, and distributing heroin not in or from the original stamped package, in violation of 26 U.S.C.  4704(a); (3) same as the first offense with regard to the cocaine seized, and (4) same as the second offense with regard to the cocaine.  At the trial, the Government presented evidence of the seizure of the package, but offered no evidence on the origin of the drugs, and petitioner did not testify.  Section 174 provides that, when a
""defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of the narcotic drug, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains the possession to the satisfaction of the jury.""
Section 4704(a) states that:
""It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, sell, dispense, or distribute narcotic drugs except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package, and the absence of appropriate tax-paid stamps from narcotic drugs shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection. . . .""
With respect to the first and third offenses, the trial judge charged the jury, in accord with  174, that it could infer from petitioner's unexplained possession of the heroin and cocaine that petitioner knew the drugs had been illegally imported.  With respect to the second and fourth offenses, the trial judge read to the jury the prima facie evidence provision of  4704(a).  In the Court of Appeals, petitioner argued that the judge's instructions on the inferences that the jury might draw from unexplained possession of the drugs violated his privilege 
Page 396 U. S. 399
 against self-incrimination by penalizing him for not testifying.  The Court of Appeals rejected this claim and affirmed, finding that the inferences were permissible under prior decisions.
Held:
1. The trial court's instructions on the inference that might be drawn under  174 with respect to petitioner's possession of heroin did not violate his right to be convicted only on a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and did not place impermissible pressure on him to testify in his own defense.  Pp.  396 U. S. 405-418.
(a) Since it is abundantly clear that little, if any, heroin is made in this country, and that, therefore, virtually all heroin consumed in the United States is illegally imported,  174 is valid insofar as it permits a jury to infer that heroin possessed here is a smuggled drug, whether judged by the ""more likely than not"" standard applied in Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6, or by the more exacting reasonable doubt standard.  Pp.  396 U. S. 408-416.
(b) While there is no proof that petitioner knew who smuggled his heroin or how the smuggling was done, he, like others who sell or distribute the drug, was undoubtedly aware of the ""high probability"" that the heroin in his possession originated in a foreign country.  Pp.  396 U. S. 416-418.
2. The presumption under  174 will not support petitioner's conviction with respect to the possession of cocaine, as the facts show that much more cocaine is lawfully produced in, than is smuggled into, this country, and that the amount of cocaine stolen from legal sources is sufficiently large to negate the inference that petitioner's cocaine came from abroad or that he must have known that it did.  Pp.  396 U. S. 418-419.
3. The conviction under  4704(a) with respect to heroin is affirmed.  Pp.  396 U. S. 419-422.
(a) The evidence that petitioner possessed the heroin packaged in 275 glassine bags without revenue stamps attached established that the heroin was in the process of being distributed, an act proscribed by the statute.  P.  396 U. S. 420.
(b) When a jury returns a guilty verdict on a count charging several acts in the conjunctive, as here, the verdict normally stands if evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.  P.  396 U. S. 420.
(c) The conviction can also be sustained on the basis of the inference in  4704(a) of purchasing the heroin not in or from a stamped package, as there is no reasonable doubt that the possessor of heroin, who presumably purchased it, did not purchase 
Page 396 U. S. 400
 it in or from an original stamped package in view of the fact that no lawfully manufactured or lawfully imported heroin is found in this country.  Pp.  396 U. S. 421-422.
4. Petitioner's conviction with respect to cocaine based on the  4704(a) inference is not based upon sufficient evidence.  Pp.  396 U. S. 422-424.
(a) Petitioner's bare possession of a small quantity of a cocaine and sugar mixture does not establish that he was dispensing or distributing the drug.  P.  396 U. S. 423.
(b) The possibility that petitioner either stole the cocaine in or from a stamped package or obtained it from a stamped package in the possession of a thief is sufficiently real that a conviction cannot be rested solely upon the presumption.  Pp.  396 U. S. 423-424.
(c) To the extent that Casey v. United States, 276 U. S. 413, gives general approval to the  4704(a) presumption, it is limited by this decision.  P.  396 U. S. 424.

Syllabus 
While petitioner's I-A Selective Service classification was on appeal from the local board's denial of his application for exemption as a conscientious objector, petitioner surrendered his registration certificate and classification notice by leaving them, along with a statement against the war in Vietnam, on the steps of the federal building.  The State Board denied the exemption and classified petitioner I-A.  He was thereafter declared delinquent by his local board for failing to retain his registration and classification papers in his possession at all times as required by the Selective Service regulations.  Pursuant to the regulations promulgated under the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, a local board may declare a registrant a ""delinquent"" for failure to perform duties required by the Selective Service law.  A registrant in I-A status who is declared delinquent is, under 32 CFR  1642.13, assigned first priority in the order of induction call, depriving him of his previous standing in the order of call.  Petitioner was ordered to report for induction about a month after he had been declared a delinquent.  In view of petitioner's age (20), it is unlikely that he would have been called at that time for induction had he not been declared a delinquent.  Following petitioner's refusal on the designated date to be processed for induction, he was indicted and later convicted for willfully and knowingly failing ""to perform a duty required of him"" under the Act.  His conviction was affirmed on appeal.  Petitioner attacks as invalid the Selective Service regulations accelerating the induction of one declared to be a delinquent.
Held:
1. Petitioner's failure to appeal administratively from the order declaring him delinquent does not deprive him of standing to contest his conviction, as the regulations conferring hearing rights apply to those contesting classifications made by local boards, and not to those like petitioner whose delinquency rests on undisputed facts, or to those whose induction has merely been accelerated.  Pp.  396 U. S. 299-301.
2. The delinquency regulations under which petitioner was punitively deprived of the order-of-call preference accorded to 
Page 396 U. S. 296
 him are not authorized by the Act, and are therefore void.  Pp. 301-308.
(a) Congress intended to punish delinquents through the criminal law, and not through a delinquency procedure, which has no statutory sanction.  Pp. 302-303.
(b) Deferment of the order of call may bestow great benefits, and its acceleration may be extremely punitive.  Pp. 304-306.
(c) The power under the Selective Service regulations to declare a registrant ""delinquent"" lacks statutory standards or guidelines, without which the legality of a delinquency declaration cannot be judged.  Pp. 306-308.

Appellants, Negro citizens of Greene County, Alabama, who alleged that they were qualified to serve as jurors and desired to serve, but had never been summoned, brought this action seeking (1) a declaration that qualified Negroes were systematically excluded from Greene County grand and petit juries, that the Alabama jury selection statutes were unconstitutional on their face and as applied, and that the jury commission was a deliberately segregated agency; (2) a permanent injunction forbidding the systematic exclusion of Negroes and requiring that all eligible Negroes be placed on the jury roll, and (3) an order vacating the jury commissioners' appointments and compelling the Governor to select new members without racial discrimination.  The three-judge District Court found that, although the 1960 census showed that three-fourths of the county's population were Negroes, the largest number of Negroes on the jury list from 1961 to 1963 was about 7% of the total.  Following a 1964 declaratory judgment decree and a 1967 statutory amendment adding women to the list, the percentage of Negroes on the jury roll increased to 32%, but the 1967 county population was about 65% Negro.  The jury commissioners appointed by the Governor for the past 12 years were white.  The District Court found an ""invalid exclusion of Negroes on a racially discriminatory basis,"" and directed the jury commissioners and their clerk ""to take prompt action to compile a jury list . . . in accordance with the laws of Alabama and . . . constitutional principles,"" and to submit a compliance report.  The court declined to enjoin the enforcement of the challenged statutes or to direct the Governor to appoint Negroes to the jury commission, and it is from these rulings that appellants took a direct appeal.

Argued October 20, 1966
Decided January 19, 1970
396 U.S. 346

Syllabus 
Appellants, Negro residents of Taliaferro County, Georgia, brought this action to challenge the constitutionality of the statutory system used in Taliaferro and many other Georgia counties to select juries and school boards.  The scheme provides for a county school board of five freeholders, which is selected by the grand jury, which in turn is drawn from a jury list selected by the six county jury commissioners, who are appointed by the state superior court judge for the circuit in which the county is located.  Although the population of Taliaferro County is about 60% Negro, the school board members were white, selected by a predominantly white grand jury, which had been selected by white jury commissioners.  The complaint attacked Georgia's constitutional and statutory provisions for school board selection as accounting for the exclusion of Negroes and nonfreeholders from the school board and for the merely token inclusion of Negroes on the grand juries.  A three-judge District Court, after a hearing, voiced concern that only 11 Negroes were on the 130-member grand jury list and adjourned to enable the defendants to remedy the situation.  It noted that there were two school board vacancies and suggested that Negroes might be selected.  A new grand jury list was prepared containing the names of 44 Negroes and 77 whites, and one of the school board vacancies was filled by a Negro.  From the grand jury list, the superior court judge drew names leading to the impaneling of a new grand jury, of whose 23 members six were Negroes.  To obtain the new grand jury roll, the jury commissioners obtained the list of 2,152 names of registered voters, and, aided by three Negroes, eliminated many names for poor health and old age, underage, death, absence from the county, and duplication, plus 225 about whom the commissioners could obtain no information and 178 (of whom 171 were Negroes) as not meeting statutory qualifications either because they were ""unintelligent"" or not ""upright citizens.""  The 608 names left were alphabetically listed, and every other one was placed on the list of potential jurors.  Of these 304, 113 (37%) were Negroes.  
Page 396 U. S. 347
 The District Court found that, prior to the commencement of the suit, Negroes had been systematically excluded from grand juries through token inclusion, but that the new grand jury list was constitutional, and it declined to invalidate on their face the provisions governing school board and grand jury selections or the freeholder requirement for school board membership.  The court did enjoin the jury commissioners from systematically excluding Negroes from the grand jury system.
Held:
1. The constitutional and statutory scheme by which the Taliaferro County grand jury selects the school board is not unconstitutional on its face, as the scheme is not inherently unfair, or necessarily incapable of administration without regard to race.  Carter v. Jur Commission, ante, p.  396 U. S. 320.  Pp.  396 U. S. 353-355.
2. The District Court erred in its determination that the new grand jury list had been properly compiled.  Pp.  396 U. S. 359-361.
(a) The underrepresentation of Negroes, as reflected by the fact that the 304-member list from which the new grand jury was drawn contained only 37% Negroes, compared with 60% Negroes in the county, should, absent a countervailing explanation by the appellees, warrant corrective action by a federal court charged with enforcing constitutional guarantees.  P.  396 U. S. 359.
(b) The District Court should have responded to the elimination of 171 Negroes out of the 178 citizens disqualified for lack of ""intelligence"" or ""uprightness,"" as, on this record, it cannot be said that this purge of Negroes did not contribute substantially to the underrepresentation.  Pp.  396 U. S. 359-360.
(c) The District Court should have focused on the elimination of the 225 citizens for lack of information, as inquiry might have led to the discovery of many Negroes qualified for jury service.  P.  396 U. S. 360.
(d) Appellants made out a prima facie case of jury discrimination, and the burden which fell on the appellees to overcome it was not met.  Pp.  396 U. S. 360-361.
3. Appellants and members of their class have a constitutional right to be considered for public service without the burden of invidiously discriminatory qualifications, and, on this record, the limitation of school board membership to freeholders violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  396 U. S. 361-364.

			"|"Turner v. Fouche
No. 23
Argued October 20, 1966
Decided January 19, 1970
396 U.S. 346

Syllabus 
Appellants, Negro residents of Taliaferro County, Georgia, brought this action to challenge the constitutionality of the statutory system used in Taliaferro and many other Georgia counties to select juries and school boards.  The scheme provides for a county school board of five freeholders, which is selected by the grand jury, which in turn is drawn from a jury list selected by the six county jury commissioners, who are appointed by the state superior court judge for the circuit in which the county is located.  Although the population of Taliaferro County is about 60% Negro, the school board members were white, selected by a predominantly white grand jury, which had been selected by white jury commissioners.  The complaint attacked Georgia's constitutional and statutory provisions for school board selection as accounting for the exclusion of Negroes and nonfreeholders from the school board and for the merely token inclusion of Negroes on the grand juries.  A three-judge District Court, after a hearing, voiced concern that only 11 Negroes were on the 130-member grand jury list and adjourned to enable the defendants to remedy the situation.  It noted that there were two school board vacancies and suggested that Negroes might be selected.  A new grand jury list was prepared containing the names of 44 Negroes and 77 whites, and one of the school board vacancies was filled by a Negro.

Argued November 12, 1969
Decided January 13, 1970
396 U.S. 282

Syllabus 
Petitioner and a codefendant were convicted of murder and given life sentences.  Petitioner's codefendant received a free copy of the transcript for preparing his appeal, but, contrary to California court rules, would not share it with petitioner, who was then loaned a copy by the State for preparing his appeal.  The convictions were affirmed.  Several years later petitioner, having fruitlessly sought the transcript from his codefendant, and having been denied a free copy of his own by the California courts in connection with collateral proceedings in the state courts, brought this habeas corpus proceeding alleging his indigency and contending that California's failure to provide him a free transcript violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court granted the writ.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the trial court failed to find that petitioner claimed error in the proceedings leading to his conviction that warranted post-conviction relief and that petitioner was not entitled to a transcript ""to enable him to comb the record in the hope of discovering some flaw.""
Held:
1. Petitioner may not attack the state court rules, which concern only the furnishing of transcripts for purposes of direct appeal, since petitioner had the transcript for that purpose and did not complain that his having it only on loan impaired its use on appeal.  Pp.  396 U. S. 285-286.
2. This Court need not decide whether the Constitution requires a State to furnish indigent prisoners with free copies of trial transcripts to aid in preparing petitions for collateral relief unless and until it appears that petitioner cannot again borrow a copy from the State, or procure one from his codefendant or other custodian; or show that it would be significantly more advantageous for him to own, rather than borrow a copy.
