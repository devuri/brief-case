|404 u.s. 257|"Santobello v. New York
No. 70-98
Argued November 15, 1971
Decided December 20, 1971
404 U.S. 257

Syllabus 
After negotiations with the prosecutor, petitioner withdrew his previous not-guilty plea to two felony counts and pleaded guilty to a lesser included offense, the prosecutor having agreed to make no recommendation as to sentence.  At petitioner's appearance for sentencing many months later, a new prosecutor recommended the maximum sentence, which the judge (who stated that he was uninfluenced by that recommendation) imposed.  Petitioner attempted unsuccessfully to withdraw his guilty plea, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal.
Held:  The interests of justice and proper recognition of the prosecution's duties in relation to promises made in connection with ""plea bargaining"" require that the judgment be vacated and that the case be remanded to the state courts for further consideration as to whether the circumstances require only that there be specific performance of the agreement on the plea (in which case petitioner should be resentenced by a different judge), or petitioner should be afforded the relief he seeks of withdrawing his guilty plea.  Pp.  404 U. S. 260-263.
35 App.Div.2d 1084, 316 N.Y.S.2d 194, vacated and remanded.

No. 70-96
Argued November 17, 1971
Decided December 20, 1971
404 U.S. 270

Syllabus 
A grand jury returned a murder indictment against a named individual ""and John Doe, the true name and a more particular description of the said John Doe being to the said Jurors unknown.""  After respondent's arrest the indictment was amended pursuant to state law to substitute respondent's name for ""John Doe.""  The highest state court affirmed respondent's subsequent conviction, rejecting his challenge to the legality of the indictment made on the ground that the amending procedure did not comply with the statute.  Respondent subsequently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court, which dismissed the petition.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the procedure by which respondent was brought to trial was violative of equal protection.  The court rejected petitioner's contention that respondent, who had not previously raised the equal protection issue, had not exhausted available state judicial remedies as required by 28 U.S.C.  2254, holding that respondent had presented the state court with ""an opportunity to apply controlling legal principles to the facts bearing upon [his] constitutional claim.""
Held:  The substance of a federal habeas corpus claim must in the first instance be fairly presented to the state courts, and since, on the record and argument before it, the State's highest court had no fair opportunity to consider and act upon the equal protection claim, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondent had exhausted his state remedies.  Pp.  404 U. S. 275-278.

No. 70-5021
Argued November 8, 1971
Decided December 20, 1971*
404 U.S. 282

Syllabus 
This class action challenges on equal protection and supremacy grounds an Illinois statute and regulation under which needy dependent children 18 through 20 years old attending high school or vocational training school qualify for benefits under the federally assisted Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program, but such children attending a college or university do not qualify.  A three-judge District Court upheld the Illinois scheme.
Held:  Under  402(a)(10) of the Social Security Act, a state participating plan under the AFDC program must provide that aid to families with dependent children shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to ""all eligible"" individuals.  Since  406(a)(2)(B) of the Act makes dependent 18-20-year-olds eligible for benefits whether attending a college or university or a vocational or technical training course, and Congress has authorized no limitation of eligibility standards within the age group, the Illinois program conflicts with that federal statutory provision and violates the Supremacy Clause.

Possession of counterfeit alien registration receipt card held not an act punishable under 18 U.S.C.  1546, which prohibits, inter alia, the counterfeiting or alteration of, or the possession, use, or receipt of an already counterfeited or altered ""immigrant or nonimmigrant visa, permit, or other document required for entry into the United States.""  The primary purpose of an alien registration receipt card is for identification within the United States, and its merely permissible reentry function under an Immigration and Naturalization service regulation does not suffice to bring the card within the coverage of the statute.

No. 70-19
Argued November 8, 1971
Decided December 20, 1971
404 U.S. 307

Syllabus 
Appellees, claiming that the Government had known of the crimes with which they were charged, the circumstances of the crimes, and appellees' identities for over three years before they were indicted, moved to dismiss on the ground that the indictment was returned ""an unreasonably oppressive and unjustifiable time after the alleged offenses,"" and that the delay deprived them of rights to due process of law and a speedy trial as secured by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  While asserting no specific prejudice, appellees contended that the indictment required memory of many specific acts and conversations occurring several years before and that the delay was due to the prosecutor's negligence or indifference in investigating the case and presenting it to the grand jury.  The District Court, after a hearing, granted appellees' motion and dismissed the indictment for ""lack of speedy prosecution,"" having found that the defense was ""bound to have been seriously prejudiced"" by the three-year delay.  The Government took a direct appeal to this Court, which postponed consideration of the question of jurisdiction until the hearing on the merits.
Held:
1. The motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of a speedy trial was in the nature of a confession and avoidance, and constituted a motion in bar by appellees who had not been placed in jeopardy when the District Court entered its order of dismissal.  That order was therefore directly appealable to this Court under former 18 U.S.C.  3731.  Pp.  404 U. S. 311-312.
2. The Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a speedy trial is applicable only after a person has been ""accused"" of a crime, which in this case did not occur until appellees (who had not previously been arrested or otherwise charged) were indicted.  Pp.  404 U. S. 313-320.
3. The relevant statute of limitations provides a safeguard against possible prejudice resulting from pre-accusation delay, and here appellees were indicted within the applicable limitations period.  Pp.  404 U. S. 320-323. 
Page 404 U. S. 308

4. Though the Due Process Clause may provide a basis for dismissing an indictment if the defense can how at trial that prosecutorial delay has prejudiced the right to a fair trial, appellees have not claimed or proved actual prejudice resulting from the delay, and their due process claims are therefore speculative and premature.  Pp.  404 U. S. 325-326.

Respondent was convicted of possessing firearms in violation of  1202(a)(1) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, which provides that a person convicted of a felony ""who receives, possesses, or transports in commerce or affecting commerce . . . any firearm . . ."" shall be punished as prescribed therein.

Doubting its constitutionality if the statute were thus construed, the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  It is not clear from the language and legislative history of  1202(a)(1) whether or not receipt or possession of a firearm by a convicted felon has to be shown in an individual prosecution to have been connected with interstate commerce.  The ambiguity of this provision (which is not only a criminal statute but one whose broad construction would define as a federal offense conduct readily proscribed by the States), must therefore be resolved in favor of the narrower reading that a nexus with interstate commerce must be shown with respect to all three offenses embraced by the provision.

No. 70-90
Argued October 12, 1971
Decided December 20, 1971
404 U.S. 357

Syllabus 
Illinois law provides three ways in which an accused can secure his pretrial release:  (1) personal recognizance; (2) execution of a bail bond, with a deposit of 10% of the bail, all but 10% of which (amounting to 1% of the bail) is returned on performance of the bond conditions, and (3) execution of a bail bond, secured by a full amount deposit in cash, authorized securities, or certain real estate, all of which is returned on performance of the bond conditions.  Appellant Schilb, charged with two traffic offenses, secured pretrial release after depositing 10% of the bail fixed.  He was convicted of one offense and acquitted of the other.  After he paid his fine, all but 1% of the bail (amounting to $7.50) was refunded.  In this class action, he thereafter challenged the Illinois system on due process and equal protection grounds, claiming that the 1% retention charge is imposed on only one segment of the class gaining pretrial release, and on the poor but not on the rich; and that its imposition on an accused found innocent constitutes a court cost against the nonguilty.  The trial court dismissed Schilb's complaint, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. The Illinois bail system does not violate equal protection requirements.  Pp.  404 U. S. 364-370.
(a) The facts that the State has no safekeeping costs where release is on personal recognizance, and has never imposed a charge with respect to a recognizance, provide a rational basis for distinguishing that situation from the situations where deposits are made.  Though the administrative costs of the deposit system are substantially the same, other factors afford a rational basis for making no charge under the full amount deposit system.  Rinaldi v. Yeager, 384 U. S. 305, distinguished.  Pp.  404 U. S. 367-369.
(b) There is no indication that the personal recognizance system is not used without regard to the economic status of the accused, or that the full deposit system actually favors the affluent.  Pp.  404 U. S. 369-370.
2. No due process denial results from retention of the 1% charge, which is an administrative fee (and not a cost of prosecution), imposed on all -- guilty and innocent alike -- who seek its

No. 70-77
Argued October 12, 1971
Decided December 14, 1971
404 U.S. 244

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted in a General County Court in North Carolina of driving while intoxicated and was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment and payment of a fine.  On appeal, he was tried de novo in the Superior Court, found guilty, and given a two-year sentence.  The District Court denied habeas corpus, and respondent, who by then had been completely discharged from prison, appealed to the Court of Appeals.  That court, relying on North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, held that the case was not mooted by respondent's discharge, and that respondent was entitled to have the record of his conviction expunged.
Held:  North Carolina v. Pearce, supra, does not require that respondent's conviction be invalidated, but only that he be resentenced if the higher sentence imposed after the de novo trial was vulnerable under Pearce.  Since the present record deals with the mootness issue only from the standpoint of conviction vel non, and does not reveal whether, under state law, benefits accrue to respondent in having his sentence reduced after he has served it, the case is remanded for reconsideration of the mootness question.
434 F.2d 297, vacated and remanded.

Syllabus 
Petitioners' complaints relating to the condition of their confinement were held by the Missouri courts not to be cognizable by means of a petition for habeas corpus.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's subsequent dismissal of the habeas petitions on the ground that 28 U.S.C.  2254 had not been satisfied because other types of state remedies might be available.
Held:
1. Section 2254 does not require petitioners to pursue alternative courses suggested by the Court of Appeals, since their availability was conjectural and, regardless of the remedy invoked, the state courts have not granted a hearing to state prisoners on the conditions of their confinement.
2. Petitioners were entitled to have their actions treated as claims for relief under the Civil Rights Acts, to which exhaustion requirements do not apply.

Syllabus 
Appellant was convicted on nonfelony charges of violating two city of Chicago ordinances and was sentenced to pay a fine of $250 on each offense.  Desiring to appeal, he petitioned the trial court for a free trial transcript to support his appeal on the grounds of insufficient evidence and prosecutorial misconduct.  Although the court found that he was indigent, it denied his application on the basis of an Illinois Supreme Court rule which provided for trial transcripts only in felony cases.  Other rules provided alternatives to a transcript in the form of a ""Settled Statement"" or an ""Agreed Statement of Facts.""  Without resorting to either alternative, appellant moved for a free transcript in the State Supreme Court.  The motion was denied.
Held:
1. Although the State must afford the indigent defendant a trial ""record of sufficient completeness' to permit proper consideration of [his] claims,"" Draper v. Washington, 372 U. S. 487,  372 U. S. 499, it need not necessarily furnish a complete verbatim transcript, but may provide alternatives that accord effective appellate review.  Pp.  404 U. S. 193-195.
2. When the defendant's grounds for appeal, as here, make out a colorable need for a complete transcript, the State has the burden of showing that only a portion thereof or an ""alternative"" will suffice for an effective appeal on those grounds.  P.  404 U. S. 195.
3. The distinction drawn by the State Supreme Court rule between felony and nonfelony offenses is an ""unreasoned distinction"" proscribed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  404 U. S. 195-196.
4. The fact that the charges on which the appellant was convicted were punishable by a fine, rather than by confinement, does not lessen the invidious discrimination against an indigent defendant.  Pp.  404 U. S. 196-198.

Syllabus 
A union which had begun organizing respondent company's employees charged the company with unfair labor practices.  The General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued a complaint, which a Trial Examiner sustained, recommending that respondent be ordered to cease and desist from such practices.  Before the NLRB acted, the union picketed respondent's stores and respondent, contending that the union's action violated state law, sought and obtained an injunction from a state court limiting the union's picketing activities.  Subsequently the NLRB issued an order accepting the Trial Examiner's recommendations and then brought this action in District Court to restrain enforcement of the state court injunction on the ground that it regulated conduct governed exclusively by the National Labor Relations Act.  The District Court held that it was precluded from granting relief by 28 U.S.C.  2283, which prohibits a federal court from enjoining state court proceedings except as authorized by Act of Congress ""or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.""  The court rejected the contention that the NLRB was within the exception recognized in Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United States, 352 U. S. 220, for suits brought by the United States.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, for purposes of  2283, the NLRB is ""an administrative agency of the United States, and is not the United States.""
Held:
1. Since the action here does not seek to restrain unfair labor practices against which the NLRB had issued its complaint, but is based on the general doctrine of preemption, the exception in  2283 for matters ""necessary in aid of its jurisdiction"" is inapplicable.

404 U.S. 157

Syllabus 
A labor organization that was the exclusive bargaining agent for employees ""working"" on hourly pay rates at one of respondent Company's facilities had negotiated with the Company an employee health insurance plan in which retired employees participated.  Upon enactment of Medicare, the Union sought mid-term bargaining to renegotiate the insurance benefits for retired employees.  The Company, maintaining that Medicare made the insurance program useless, and that retirees' benefits were not a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, stated that it would offer each retiree a stated monthly amount toward supplemental Medicare coverage.  When, despite Union objections, the Company made the offer, the Union filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  The NLRB concluded that the Company was guilty of unfair labor practices in violation of  8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and issued a cease and desist order.  The NLRB held that the benefits of already retired employees were a mandatory subject of bargaining as ""terms and conditions of employment"" of the retirees themselves and, alternatively, of the active bargaining unit employees.  It also held that the Company's ""establishment of a fixed, additional option, in and of itself, changed the negotiated plan of benefits"" contrary to  8(d) and 8(a)(5) of the Act.  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit disagreed with the NLRB and refused to enforce its cease and desist order.
Held:
1. Retirees' benefits are not, within the meaning of  8(a)(5) and 8(d) of the NLRA, a mandatory subject of bargaining as ""terms and conditions of employment"" of the retirees.  Pp.  404 U. S. 163-176. 
Page 404 U. S. 158

(a) The collective bargaining obligation extends only to the ""terms and conditions of employment"" of the employer's ""employees,"" and the term ""employee"" has its ordinary meaning, i.e., someone who works for another for hire, which excludes retirees.  Pp.  404 U. S. 165-171.
(b) The collective bargaining obligation is limited to the ""terms and conditions of employment"" of the ""employees"" in the bargaining unit appropriate for the purpose of collective bargaining.  Retirees were not members of the unit represented by the Union, because they were no longer ""working.""  Nor could they be members, since they lack a substantial community of interests with the active employees in the unit.  Pp.  404 U. S. 171-175.
(c) Even if an industry practice of bargaining over retirees' rights exists, which is disputed, that cannot change the law and make into bargaining unit ""employees"" those who are not.  Pp.  404 U. S. 175-176.
2. Retirees' benefits are not a mandatory subject of bargaining as ""terms and conditions of employment"" of the active employees remaining in the bargaining unit, although their own future retirement plans are.  Retirees' benefits do not ""vitally"" affect the ""terms and conditions of employment"" of current employees.  The benefits that active workers may reap by including retired employees under the same health insurance contract as themselves are speculative and insubstantial, at best.  The relationship that the NLRB asserted exists between bargaining in behalf of retirees and the negotiation of active employees' retirement plans is equally too speculative a foundation on which to base an obligation to bargain.  Pp.  404 U. S. 176-182.
3. Even if the Company's offering the retirees an exchange for their withdrawal from the already negotiated health insurance plan was a unilateral mid-term ""modification"" of the plan within the meaning of  8(d) of the Act, which is disputed, it did not constitute an unfair labor practice, since it related to a permissive, rather than a mandatory, subject of bargaining.  Pp.  404 U. S. 183-188.

(a) The collective bargaining obligation extends only to the ""terms and conditions of employment"" of the employer's ""employees,"" and the term ""employee"" has its ordinary meaning, i.e., someone who works for another for hire, which excludes retirees.  Pp.  404 U. S. 165-171.
(b) The collective bargaining obligation is limited to the ""terms and conditions of employment"" of the ""employees"" in the bargaining unit appropriate for the purpose of collective bargaining.  Retirees were not members of the unit represented by the Union, because they were no longer ""working.""  Nor could they be members, since they lack a substantial community of interests with the active employees in the unit.  Pp.  404 U. S. 171-175.
(c) Even if an industry practice of bargaining over retirees' rights exists, which is disputed, that cannot change the law and make into bargaining unit ""employees"" those who are not.  Pp.  404 U. S. 175-176.
2. Retirees' benefits are not a mandatory subject of bargaining as ""terms and conditions of employment"" of the active employees remaining in the bargaining unit, although their own future retirement plans are.  Retirees' benefits do not ""vitally"" affect the ""terms and conditions of employment"" of current employees.  The benefits that active workers may reap by including retired employees under the same health insurance contract as themselves are speculative and insubstantial, at best.  The relationship that the NLRB asserted exists between bargaining in behalf of retirees and the negotiation of active employees' retirement plans is equally too speculative a foundation on which to base an obligation to bargain.  Pp.  404 U. S. 176-182.
3. Even if the Company's offering the retirees an exchange for their withdrawal from the already negotiated health insurance plan was a unilateral mid-term ""modification"" of the plan within the meaning of  8(d) of the Act, which is disputed, it did not constitute an unfair labor practice, since it related to a permissive, rather than a mandatory, subject of bargaining.  Pp.  404 U. S. 183-188.

No. 70-11
Argued October 20, 1971
Decided December 6, 1971
404 U.S. 97

Syllabus 
Respondent was injured in December, 1965, while working on petitioner's artificial island drilling rig, located on the Outer Continental Shelf off the Louisiana coast.  Allegedly, not until many months later were the injuries discovered to be serious.  In January, 1968, respondent brought suit for damages against petitioner in federal district court.  The District Court, relying on Rodrigue v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 395 U. S. 352 (1969), held that Louisiana's one-year limitation on personal injury actions applied, rather than the admiralty laches doctrine, and granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment.  Rodrigue had held that state law, and not admiralty law, applied to fixed structures on the Outer Continental Shelf under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (hereinafter Lands Act), and extended to that area as federal laws the laws of the adjacent State ""to the extent that they are applicable and not inconsistent"" with federal laws.  Respondent argued on appeal that, in view of pre-Rodrigue jurisprudence making admiralty law (including the laches doctrine) applicable, it would be unfair to give that decision retrospective effect.  The Court of Appeals, not reaching that argument, reversed, holding that Louisiana's ""prescriptive"" time limitation, which barred the remedy but did not extinguish the right to recovery, was not binding outside a Louisiana forum.  Consequently, the court concluded that the time limitation was not ""applicable"" of its own force, and was ""inconsistent"" with the admiralty laches doctrine, which, though not directly applicable by virtue of Rodrigue, was applicable as a matter of federal common law.
Held:
1. The Lands Act, as interpreted in Rodrigue, requires that a State's statute of limitations be applied to actions for personal injuries occurring on fixed structures on the Outer Continental Shelf.  The fact that the Louisiana law is ""prescriptive"" does not make it inapplicable as federal law under the Lands Act, and a 
Page 404 U. S. 98
 federal court may not apply a laches test to preclude application of the State time limitation.  Pp.  404 U. S. 100-105.
2. The Louisiana one-year statute of limitation. should not, however, bar respondent's action here, since retroactive application of that statute under Rodrigue would deprive respondent of any remedy at all on the basis of the unforeseeable superseding legal doctrine of that decision.

Two unions, the Plasterers and the Tile Setters, in accordance with procedures binding them to arbitrate, submitted to a board their jurisdictional dispute over work to be done for a contractor.  The board awarded the work to the Plasterers.  When the contractor and the Tile Setters refused to abide by the arbitration board's decision, the Plasterers, to force reassignment of the work, picketed that contractor as well as another contractor employing members of the Tile Setters.  Neither contractor was subject to the arbitration agreement.  Charges were thereupon filed against the Plasterers for allegedly violating  8(b)(4)(D) of the National Labor Relations Act, and a hearing to resolve the dispute was held under  10(k), which directs the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to ""hear and determine the dispute out of which [the alleged] unfair labor practice has arisen"" unless ""the parties to such dispute"" agree upon a settlement.  The NLRB, after weighing the arbitration board's decision ""and all [other] relevant factors,"" awarded the work to the Tile Setters.  When the Plasterers refused to abide by the award, a  8(b)(4)(D) complaint was filed against them and they were found to have violated that provision.

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL concurs, dissenting. 
 The Court today denies certiorari to a Black man who stands convicted by an all-White jury which had been selected through a process which petitioner alleges methodically excluded members of minority racial groups. The most pernicious of the practices used to exclude Black and Chicano jurors was what purported to be an intelligence test which, because of its cultural bias and its blatant unreliability, excluded nearly 50% of the otherwise qualified prospective jurors from minority groups. We would all agree that the brand of justice received in our courts should not depend upon the color of one's skin and that the selection of jury panels should not be tainted by the exclusion of racial groups. With all respect I fear precisely that result has obtained in the case. 
 Petitioner was convicted of the unlawful possession of marihuana. The State's evidence consisted of the testimony of two White police officers that they observed and smelled petitioner smoke a marihuana cigarette and that he dropped the cigarette on the ground before he was arrested. Petitioner steadfastly denied his guilt. He offered witnesses who 'testified that, because of an obstruction, it was not possible to see' the area where 
Page 404 U.S. 968 , 969
 petitioner was allegedly smoking marihuana, who supported his story 'that no one was smoking marihuana,' and who gave credence to the apparent theory of the defense that a Black man was being framed by White police officers. People v. Donaldson, Crim.No. 17615, at 3-4 (Cal.Ct.App., Dec. 21, 1970.) 
 The issue for the jury was the relative credibility of two White police officers and the four Black defense witnesses. Cf. Note, 79 Yale L. J. 531 (1970). That this question was close is indicated by the fact that after some 5 1/4 hours of deliberation the jury reported itself deadlocked eight-to-four and an Allen charge was then given. See Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896). It took an additional hour of deliberation before the jury resolved the credibility issue against petitioner and returned a verdict of guilty. 
 On appeal the California Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction, holding that petitioner, as a Black, had no standing to challenge the exclusion of Chicanos from the jury panel,1 that the exclusion of racial minorities was unintentional and that, in any event, it did not deny equal protection of the laws. The Supreme Court of California denied a petition for a hearing and petitioner now seeks a writ of certiorari. 
 The culturally-based intelligence test used in this case excludes almost half of the otherwise qualified prospective jurors from minority groups.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 22, 1971
 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN concurs, dissenting. 
 Over the dissents of Justices Black, Brennan, Marshall and myself, this Court last Term held that statements elicited in violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), may nevertheless be used to impeach the credibility of a defendant whose testimony in his own behalf is inconsistent with those statements. Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222 (1971). A denial of certiorari in this case would illustrate the rewards that would flow to those police interrogators who, deliberately or otherwise, ignore the restrictions placed upon them by Miranda: restrictions necessary to safeguard the privilege against self-incrimination and to insure the reliability of statements elicited in the police-dominated atmosphere of an incommunicado custodial interrogation. 
 Petitioner Riddell was convicted in state court of assault. The facts are undisputed. In the course of an argument over the conduct of a neighbor's dog, a rifle carried by Mr. Riddell discharged, the bullet striking his neighbor in the foot. The only real issue at trial was that of intent. Testifying in his own defense, Mr. Riddell said he did not intend for the rifle to go off, and did not have his finger on the trigger when it did fire. On cross-examination, however, the prosecution was permitted to confront Mr. Riddell with a statement elicited from him, in violation of Miranda, in which he told the police 'I cocked the hammer and pulled the trigger. I thought the rifle was aimed towards the ground and only intended to scare Mr. Lewis.' This statement was virtually a direct admission of the only element of the offense at issue; and though it was introduced for the 
Page 404 U.S. 974 , 975
 'limited purpose' of 'impeachment,' it was certain to have a prejudicial, if not conclusive, effect on the jury. 
 The possibility of using illegally obtained incriminating statements at trial, for any purpose, raises grave questions concerning police noncompliance with Miranda. It is undeniable that Miranda was predicated in part upon a deep concern for discouraging coercive police practices. Eleven pages of the opinion are devoted to an examination of police interrogation procedures. They compel the conclusion that 
 It is, of course, just this kind of testimonial compulsion that the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, proscribes.

No. 70-97

404 U.S. 37

Syllabus 
In anticipation of a railroad consolidation by which petitioner acquired the so-called Sandusky Line from the Pennsylvania Railroad, petitioner entered into an agreement with certain labor unions for the protection of the employees involved.  The agreement provided that the employees would not be adversely affected in their employment as a result of the transaction.  Respondents were employees of the Pennsylvania, who worked seasonally on the Sandusky Line, and, during the winter freeze which barred navigation on Lake Erie, worked at other points on the Pennsylvania system.  Upon the consolidation, respondents accepted employment with petitioner.  The agreement called for a salary supplement based upon pre-consolidation monthly compensation.  The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), in its consolidation approval, stated that the agreement was ""made pursuant to and in conformity with  5(2)(f) of the Interstate Commerce Act for the protection of the covered employees.""  Section 5(2)(f) provides that the ICC ""shall require a fair and equitable arrangement to protect the interests of the railroad employees affected,"" and states that,
""[n]otwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, an agreement pertaining to the protection of the interests of said employees may hereafter be entered into""
by any railroad and an employee union.  A post-consolidation agreement was made between petitioner and the union under which petitioner claimed that the salary supplement was limited solely to the amount paid respondent for their seasonal Sandusky Line work.  The District Court agreed with respondents that the new agreement was not enforceable, as it conflicted with the terms of the pre-merger agreement, and thus violated the Act under which the consolidation took place, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, with a modification as to damages.
Held:
1. Section 5(2)(f) provides mandatory compensation protection for railroad employees affected by a consolidation, and the 
Page 404 U. S. 38
 ICC's adoption or approval of a pre-merger collective agreement becomes a ""condition"" of the ICC's approval of a consolidation under that section.  Pp.  404 U. S. 41-43.
2. The ""notwithstanding"" proviso of  5(2)(f) affords the machinery for the terms of a pre-merger collective agreement, and thus supplies one minimum measure of fairness required by the section.  P.  404 U. S. 43.
3. The post-consolidation agreement abrogated the employees' rights and the standard of ""compensation"" covered by the pre-merger agreement that had come under the ICC's protective order.  Pp.  404 U. S. 43-45.

No. 70-60
Argued October 13, 1971
Decided November 8, 1971
404 U.S. 6

Syllabus 
Petitioner, liquidator of Manhattan Casualty Co., alleged that the company was defrauded, in violation of federal securities laws, by a fraudulent sale of securities owned by it. Manhattan's sole stockholder agreed to sell all of its Manhattan stock to one Begole for $5 million.  Begole conspired with others to use United States Treasury bonds owned by Manhattan to pay for the shares.  Through a deceptive device, the bonds were sold and the proceeds used in the purchase of the stock.  The depletion of Manhattan's assets was concealed by the purported transfer to it, in exchange for the proceeds of the bond sale, of a certificate of deposit which, in fact, had been assigned by Manhattan's new president, a coconspirator, to another corporation, and by it used as collateral for a loan.  The District Court dismissed the complaint and the Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that ""no investor [was] injured"" and that the ""purity of the security transaction and the purity of the trading process were unsullied.""
Held:  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 makes it unlawful to use ""in connection with the purchase or sale"" of any security ""any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance"" in contravention of the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and regulations.  Section 10(b) prohibits the use of any deceptive device in the ""sale"" of any security by ""any person,"" and it is irrelevant that Manhattan was a corporation, rather than an individual investor; that the fraud was perpetrated by a corporate officer and his outside collaborators; that the transaction was not conducted through a securities exchange or an organized market; that the proceeds due the seller were misappropriated; and that the creditors of the defrauded corporate seller may be the ultimate victims.

 tities, directed the pair to walk in roadside dust, and concluded that their shoeprints were similar to those the officers had seen only hours earlier in sand 'traps' some 50 yards south of the highway. [Footnote 1] Suspecting the two of smuggling contraband, the agents detained them while reinforcements arrived and backtracked in search of contraband which officers believed might have been hidden along the pair's path. During the probe two knapsacks containing marihuana were found at a spot 100 yards east of the point where the two had been stopped and near the trail which officers believed had been left by the petitioner and his companion. The officers then formally arrested them and afterwards traced what they suspected to be the pair's footprints to a railroad tunnel nearer the border leading into Mexico. 
 The two were convicted of smuggling marihuana at a trial before a jury. The Government was unable to produce direct evidence that the codefendants had actually crossed the border via the railroad tunnel. In fact, all the agents could claim was that they had traced what they believed to be the co-defendants' footprints into the mouth of the tunnel. Furthermore, no direct evidence was adduced to show, assuming the pair had crossed the border, that they had crossed with marihuana. Given the lack of direct evidence on any of these matters, however, the Government understandably desired to be more persuasive.

 DUN & BRADSTREET, INC.,v. C. R. GROVE, Trustee, et al.No. 71-206. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 19, 1971
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 The petitioner, Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., publishes credit reports available by private subscription. Because Altoona Clay Products, Inc., was a sizable concern it became a subject of analysis by the petitioner. From time to time the petitioner issued confidential financial studies of Altoona which were requested by the subject's creditors and suppliers. 
 In early 's, employees discovered in the judgment index of Blair County, Pennsylvania, an unsatisfied entry of $60,000 against Altoona Clay Products Company, a predecessor and defunct enterprise which had been operated by those controlling the subject. On January 3, 1963, the petitioner issued an analysis concerning Altoona, noting this find, but failing to state that the unpaid judgment was against an entirely different firm, at least technically, so that its creditors and suppliers were led to believe that the outstanding liability was owed by Altoona. The error was retracted by Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., in April, 1963, but the respondent, a trustee in bankruptcy presiding over Altoona's estate, claims that the financial demise of its ward was worked during the interim misunderstanding. 
 After protracted litigation initiated in the District Court on diversity jurisdiction, involving a prior appeal and remand, a jury, applying Pennsylvania libel law, awarded $110,000 in 'general damages' to the trustee in bankruptcy. No special damages were found. The District Court, however, entered a judgment n. o. v. in favor of Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., on the ground that New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), pro- 
Page 404 U.S. 898 , 899
 scribed libel judgments under such circumstances of innocent error. 
 The respondent appealed this order to the Third Circuit Which reversed, reinstating the verdict and holding that 'the doctrine of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan does not extend to private credit reports, and that any allegations of defamation concerning such reports are properly subject to the libel laws of the several states.' The opinion issued by the Third Circuit distinguished New York Times on three grounds: (a) unlike Sullivan, the subject of these private reports, Altoona, had no access to the same medium to correct the error; (b) unlike the civil rights struggle, the confidential nature of these nonpublic reports fell outside the realm of public debate; and (c) unlike New York Times, the dispute here was factual in nature, not a difference of opinion. Grove v. Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., 438 F.2d 433 (CA 3 1971). 
 I would grant certiorari and hear argument on the question whether we should reverse the Third Circuit's holding, not because it misreads the New York Times case, but because libel and slander awards are no longer constitutionally permissible elements of American law. 
 It is clear that the First Amendment would proscribe any attempt to enact a federal libel law, notwithstanding the Alien and Sedition Act (1 Stat. 596) the contrary. [Footnote 1] I do not suppose that anyone considered at the time of its adoption whether the Fourteenth Amendment meant that state courts could no longer participate in libel and slander awards. But I have expressed the idea before that 'constitutional law is not frozen as of a particular [404 U.S. 898 , 900]

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of possessing nontaxpaid liquor in violation of 26 U.S.C.  5205(a)(2).  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the federal tax investigator's affidavit supporting the search warrant, the execution of which resulted in the discovery of illicit liquor, was insufficient to establish probable cause.  The affidavit stated that respondent had a reputation with the investigator for over four years as being a trafficker in nontaxpaid distilled spirits; during that time, the local constable had located illicit whiskey in an abandoned house under respondent's control; on the date of the affidavit, the affiant had received sworn oral information from a person whom the affiant found to be a prudent person, and who feared for his life should his name be revealed, that the informant had purchased illicit whiskey from the residence described, for a period exceeding two years, most recently within two weeks; that the informant asserted he knew of another person who bought such whiskey from the house within two days; that he had personal knowledge that such whiskey was consumed in a certain outbuilding; and that he had seen respondent go to another nearby outbuilding to obtain whiskey for other persons.  The Court of Appeals relied on Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108, in stressing that affiant had never alleged that the informant was truthful, but only prudent, and on Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410, in giving no weight to affiant's assertion concerning respondent's reputation.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  403 U. S. 577-585.
412 F.2d 796, reversed.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and MR. JUSTICE STEWART (as to the first sentence of item 1) concluded that:
1. The affidavit in this case, based on a tip similar to the one held sufficient in Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257 (which was approved in Aguilar, supra), contains an ample factual foundation 
Page 403 U. S. 574
 for believing the informant which, when taken in conjunction with the affiant's knowledge of respondent's background, afforded a basis upon which a magistrate could reasonably issue a warrant.  Both the affidavit here and the one in Jones (contrary to the situation in Spinelli, supra) purport to relate an unidentified informant's personal observations and recite prior events within his knowledge.  While the affidavit here, unlike the Jones affidavit, did not aver that the informant had previously given ""correct information,"" an averment of previous reliability is not essential when supported, as here, by other information; and Spinelli is not to be read as precluding a magistrate's relying on an officer's knowledge of a suspect's reputation.  Pp.  403 U. S. 577-583.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that:

Syllabus 
Rhode Island's 1969 Salary Supplement Act provides for a 15% salary supplement to be paid to teachers in nonpublic schools at which the average per-pupil expenditure on secular education is below the average in public schools. Eligible teachers must teach only courses offered in the public schools, using only materials used in the public schools, and must agree not to teach courses in religion. A three-judge court found that about 25% of the State's elementary students attended nonpublic schools, about 95% of whom attended Roman Catholic affiliated schools, and that to date about 250 teachers at Roman Catholic schools are the sole beneficiaries under the Act. The court found that the parochial school system was ""an integral part of the religious mission of the Catholic Church,"" and held that the Act fostered ""excessive entanglement"" between government and religion, thus violating the Establishment Clause. Pennsylvania's Nonpublic Elementary and Secondary Education Act, passed in 1968, authorizes the state Superintendent of Public Instruction to ""purchase"" certain ""secular educational services"" from nonpublic schools, directly reimbursing those schools solely for teachers' salaries, textbooks, and instructional materials. Reimbursement is restricted to courses in specific secular subjects, the textbooks and materials must be approved by the Superintendent, and no payment is to be made for any course containing ""any subject matter expressing religious teaching, or the morals or forms of worship of any sect."" Contracts were made with schools that have more than 20% of all the students in the State, most of which were affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. The complaint challenging the constitutionality of 
Page 403 U. S. 603
 the Act alleged that the church-affiliated schools are controlled by religious organizations, have the purpose of propagating and promoting a particular religious faith, and conduct their operations to fulfill that purpose.  A three-judge court granted the State's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief, finding no violation of the Establishment or Free Exercise Clause.
Held:  Both statutes are unconstitutional under the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, as the cumulative impact of the entire relationship arising under the statutes involves excessive entanglement between government and religion.  Pp.  403 U. S. 611-625.
(a) The entanglement in the Rhode Island program arises because of the religious activity and purpose of the church-affiliated schools, especially with respect to children of impressionable age in the primary grades, and the dangers that a teacher under religious control and discipline poses to the separation of religious from purely secular aspects of elementary education in such schools.  These factors require continuing state surveillance to ensure that the statutory restrictions are obeyed and the First Amendment otherwise respected.  Furthermore, under the Act, the government must inspect school records to determine what part of the expenditures is attributable to secular education, as opposed to religious activity, in the event a nonpublic school's expenditures per pupil exceed the comparable figures for public schools.  Pp.  403 U. S. 615-620.
(b) The entanglement in the Pennsylvania program also arises from the restrictions and surveillance necessary to ensure that teachers play a strictly nonideological role and the state supervision of nonpublic school accounting procedures required to establish the cost of secular, as distinguished from religious, education.  In addition, the Pennsylvania statute has the further defect of providing continuing financial aid directly to the church-related schools.  Historically, governmental control and surveillance measures tend to follow cash grant programs, and here the government's post-audit power to inspect the financial records of church-related schools creates an intimate and continuing relationship between church and state.  Pp.  403 U. S. 620-622.
(c) Political division along religious lines was one of the evils at which the First Amendment aimed, and in these programs, where successive and probably permanent annual appropriations that benefit relatively few religious groups are involved, political 
Page 403 U. S. 604
 fragmentation and divisiveness on religious lines are likely to be intensified.  Pp.  403 U. S. 622-624.
(d) Unlike the tax exemption for places of religious worship, upheld in Walz v. Tax Commission, 397 U. S. 664, which was based on a practice of 200 years, these innovative programs have self-perpetuating and self-expanding propensities which provide a warning signal against entanglement between government and religion.

Syllabus 
The Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 provides federal construction grants for college and university facilities, excluding
""any facility used or to be used for sectarian instruction or as a place for religious worship, or . . . primarily in connection with any part of the program of a school or department of divinity.""
The United States retains a 20-year interest in any facility constructed with funds under the Act, and if, during this period, the recipient violates the statutory conditions, the Government is entitled to recovery of funds.  Four church-related colleges and universities in Connecticut received federal construction grants for five facilities.  Appellants attempted to show, in a three-judge court, that the recipient institutions were ""sectarian"" by introducing evidence of their relations with religious authorities, the curricula content, and other indicia of religious character.  Appellee colleges introduced testimony that they had fully complied with the statutory conditions, and that their religious affiliations did not interfere with their secular educational functions.  The court held that the Act authorized grants to church-related schools, and sustained its constitutionality, finding that the Act had neither the purpose nor the effect of promoting religion.
Held:  The Act is constitutional except for that portion providing for a 20-year limitation on the religious use of the facilities constructed with federal funds.  Pp.  403 U. S. 676-689,  403 U. S. 661-671,  403 U. S. 692.
312 F.Supp. 1191, vacated and remanded.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that:
1. The Act includes colleges and universities with religious affiliations.  Pp.  403 U. S. 676-677.
2. Congress' objective of providing more opportunity for college education is a legitimate secular goal entirely appropriate for governmental action.  Pp.  403 U. S. 678-679. 
Page 403 U. S. 673

3. The record fully supports the District Court's findings that the colleges involved have not violated the statutory restrictions; it provides no basis for assuming that religiosity necessarily permeates the secular education of the colleges; and it yields no evidence that religion seeps into the use of any of the five facilities.  Pp.  403 U. S. 680-682.
4. The limitation of federal interest in the facilities to a period of 20 years violates the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, as the unrestricted use of valuable property after 20 years is in effect a contribution to a religious body.  Pp.  403 U. S. 682-684.
5. This case is distinguished from Lemon v. Kurtzman, ante, p.  403 U.

			"|"Tilton v. Richardson
No. 153
Argued March 2-3, 1971
Decided June 28, 1971
403 U.S. 672

Syllabus 
The Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 provides federal construction grants for college and university facilities, excluding
""any facility used or to be used for sectarian instruction or as a place for religious worship, or . . . primarily in connection with any part of the program of a school or department of divinity.""
The United States retains a 20-year interest in any facility constructed with funds under the Act, and if, during this period, the recipient violates the statutory conditions, the Government is entitled to recovery of funds.  Four church-related colleges and universities in Connecticut received federal construction grants for five facilities.  Appellants attempted to show, in a three-judge court, that the recipient institutions were ""sectarian"" by introducing evidence of their relations with religious authorities, the curricula content, and other indicia of religious character.  Appellee colleges introduced testimony that they had fully complied with the statutory conditions, and that their religious affiliations did not interfere with their secular educational functions.  The court held that the Act authorized grants to church-related schools, and sustained its constitutionality, finding that the Act had neither the purpose nor the effect of promoting religion.
Held:  The Act is constitutional except for that portion providing for a 20-year limitation on the religious use of the facilities constructed with federal funds.  Pp.  403 U. S. 676-689,  403 U. S. 661-671,  403 U. S. 692.
312 F.Supp. 1191, vacated and remanded.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that:
1. The Act includes colleges and universities with religious affiliations.  Pp.  403 U. S. 676-677.
2. Congress' objective of providing more opportunity for college education is a legitimate secular goal entirely appropriate for governmental action.  Pp.  403 U. S. 678-679. 
Page 403 U. S. 673

3. The record fully supports the District Court's findings that the colleges involved have not violated the statutory restrictions; it provides no basis for assuming that religiosity necessarily permeates the secular education of the colleges; and it yields no evidence that religion seeps into the use of any of the five facilities.  Pp.  403 U. S. 680-682.
4. The limitation of federal interest in the facilities to a period of 20 years violates the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, as the unrestricted use of valuable property after 20 years is in effect a contribution to a religious body.  Pp.  403 U. S. 682-684.
5. This case is distinguished from Lemon v. Kurtzman, ante, p.  403 U. S. 602; (a) there is less danger here than in church-related primary and secondary schools dealing with impressionable children that religion will permeate the area of secular education, since religious indoctrination is not a substantial purpose or activity of these church-related colleges, (b) the facilities provided here are themselves religiously neutral, with correspondingly less need for government surveillance, and (c) the government aid here is a one-time, single-purpose construction grant, with only minimal need for inspection.  Cumulatively, these factors lessen substantially the potential for divisive religious fragmentation in the political arena.  Pp.  403 U. S. 684-689.
6. The implementation of the Act does not inhibit the free exercise of religion in violation of the First Amendment.  P.  403 U. S. 689.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE concurred in the judgment in this case.  Pp.  403 U. S. 661-671.

No. 783
Argued April 19, 1971
Decided June 28, 1971
403 U.S. 698

Syllabus 
Petitioner appealed his local draft board's rejection of his application for conscientious objector classification.  The Justice Department, in response to the State Appeal Board's referral for an advisory recommendation, concluded, contrary to a hearing officer's recommendation, that petitioner's claim should be denied, and wrote that board that petitioner did not meet any of the three basic tests for conscientious objector status.  The Appeal Board then denied petitioner's claim, but without stating its reasons.  Petitioner refused to report for induction, for which he was thereafter tried and convicted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  In this Court, the Government has rightly conceded the invalidity of two of the grounds for denial of petitioner's claim given in its letter to the Appeal Board, but argues that there was factual support for the third ground.
Held:  Since the Appeal Board gave no reason for the denial of a conscientious objector exemption to petitioner, and it is impossible to determine on which of the three grounds offered in the Justice Department's letter that board relied, petitioner's conviction must be reversed.  Sicurella v. United States, 348 U. S. 385.

Syllabus 
Petitioner's complaint alleged that respondent agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, acting under color of federal authority, made a warrantless entry of his apartment, searched the apartment, and arrested him on narcotics charges.  All of the acts were alleged to have been done without probable cause.  Petitioner's suit to recover damages from the agents was dismissed by the District Court on the alternative grounds (1) that it failed to state a federal cause of action and (2) that respondents were immune from suit by virtue of their official position.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the first ground alone.
Held:

Georgia law provides that any political organization whose candidate received 20% or more of the vote at the most recent gubernatorial or presidential election is a ""political party.""  Any other political organization is a ""political body.""  ""Political parties"" conduct primary elections, and the name of the winning candidate for each office is printed on the ballot.  A nominee of a ""political body"" or an independent candidate may have his name on the ballot if he files a nominating petition signed by not less than 5% of those eligible to vote at the last election for the office he is seeking.  The time for circulating the petition is 180 days, and it must meet the same deadline as a candidate in a party primary.  Electors who sign a nominating petition are not restricted in any way, and there is no limitation on write-in votes on ballots.
Held:  The challenge of appellants, prospective candidates and registered voters, to this election procedure was properly rejected, as it does not abridge the rights of free speech and association secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and is not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.

403 U.S. 443

Syllabus 
Police went to petitioner's home on January 28, 1964, to question him about a murder.  In the course of their inquiry, he showed them three guns, and he agreed to take a lie detector test on February 2.  The test was inconclusive on the murder, but, during its course, petitioner admitted a theft.  In petitioner's absence, two other policemen came to the house and questioned petitioner's wife to check petitioner's story and corroborate his admission of the theft.  Unaware of the visit of the other officers who had been shown the guns and knowing little about the murder weapon, the police asked about any guns there might be in the house, and were shown four by petitioner's wife which she offered to let them take.  After one policeman first declined the offer, they took the guns, along with various articles of petitioner's clothing his wife made available to them.  On February 19, petitioner was arrested in his house for the murder, and, on that date, a warrant to search petitioner's automobile was applied for by the police chief and issued by the Attorney General (who had assumed charge of the investigation and was later the chief prosecutor at the trial), acting as a justice of the peace.  The car, which, at the time of the arrest, was parked in petitioner's driveway, was subsequently towed to the police station, where, on February 21 and on two occasions the next year, it was searched.  Vacuum sweepings from the car as well as from the clothing were used as evidence at the trial, along with one of the guns made available by petitioner's wife.  Following the overruling of pretrial motions to suppress that evidence, petitioner was convicted, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. The warrant for the search and seizure of petitioner's automobile did not satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, because it was not issued by a ""neutral and detached magistrate.""  Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10,  333 U. S. 14.  Pp. 449-453.

""searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment -- subject only to a few specifically established and well

 defined exceptions,""
and, on the facts of this case, a warrantless search and seizure of the car cannot be justified under those exceptions.  Pp.  403 U. S. 453-482.
(a) The seizure of the car in the driveway cannot be justified as incidental to the arrest, which took place inside the house.  Even assuming, arguendo, that the police could properly have made a warrantless search of the car in the driveway when they arrested petitioner, they could not have done so at their leisure after its removal.  Pp.  403 U. S. 455-457.
(b) Under the circumstances present here -- where the police for some time had known of the probable role of the car in the crime, petitioner had had ample opportunity to destroy incriminating evidence, the house was guarded at the time of arrest and petitioner had no access to the car -- there were no exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search even had it been made before the car was taken to the police station, and the special exceptions for automobile searches in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, and Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42, are clearly inapplicable.  Cf. Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., 391 U. S. 216.  Pp.  403 U. S. 458-464.
(c) Under certain circumstances, the police may, without a warrant seize, evidence in ""plain view,"" though not for that reason alone, and only when the discovery of the evidence is inadvertent.  That exception is inapplicable to the facts of the instant case, where the police had ample opportunity to obtain a valid warrant, knew in advance the car's description and location, intended to seize it when they entered on petitioner's property, and no contraband or dangerous objects were involved.  Pp.  403 U. S. 464-473.
3. No search and seizure were implicated in the February 2 visit when the police obtained the guns and clothing from petitioner's wife, and hence they needed no warrant.  The police, who exerted no effort to coerce or dominate her, were not obligated to refuse her offer for them to take the guns, and, in making these and the other items available to the police, she was not acting as the instrument or agent of the police.

Syllabus 
Police went to petitioner's home on January 28, 1964, to question him about a murder.  In the course of their inquiry, he showed them three guns, and he agreed to take a lie detector test on February 2.  The test was inconclusive on the murder, but, during its course, petitioner admitted a theft.  In petitioner's absence, two other policemen came to the house and questioned petitioner's wife to check petitioner's story and corroborate his admission of the theft.  Unaware of the visit of the other officers who had been shown the guns and knowing little about the murder weapon, the police asked about any guns there might be in the house, and were shown four by petitioner's wife which she offered to let them take.  After one policeman first declined the offer, they took the guns, along with various articles of petitioner's clothing his wife made available to them.

No. 322
Argued December 10, 1970
Decided June 21, 1971*
403 U.S. 528

Syllabus 
The requests of appellants in No. 322 for a jury trial were denied, and they were adjudged juvenile delinquents under Pennsylvania law.  The State Supreme Court, while recognizing the applicability to juveniles of certain due process procedural safeguards, held that there is no constitutional right to a jury trial in juvenile court.  Appellants argue for a right to a jury trial because they were tried in proceedings ""substantially similar to a criminal trial,"" and note that the press is generally present at the trial, and that members of the public also enter the courtroom.  Petitioners in No. 128 were adjudged juvenile delinquents in North Carolina, where their jury trial requests were denied, and in proceedings where the general public was excluded.
Held:  A trial by jury is not constitutionally required in the adjudicative phase of a state juvenile court delinquency proceeding.  Pp.  403 U. S. 540-551,  403 U. S. 553-556.
No. 322, 438 Pa. 339, 265 A.2d 350, and No. 128, 275 N.C. 517, 169 S.E.2d 879, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concluded that:
1. The applicable due process standard in juvenile proceedings is fundamental fairness, as developed by In re Gault, 387 U. S. 1, and In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, which emphasized factfinding procedures, but, in our legal system, the jury is not a necessary component of accurate factfinding.  P.  403 U. S. 543.
2. Despite disappointments, failures, and shortcomings in the juvenile court procedure, a jury trial is not constitutionally required in a juvenile court's adjudicative stage.  Pp.  403 U. S. 545-550.
(a) The Court has not heretofore ruled that all rights constitutionally assured to an adult accused are to be imposed in a juvenile proceeding.  P.  403 U. S. 545.
(b) Compelling a jury trial might remake the proceeding into a fully adversary process, and effectively end the idealistic prospect of an intimate, informal protective proceeding.  P.  403 U. S. 545.
(c) Imposing a jury trial on the juvenile court system would not remedy the system's defects, and would not greatly strengthen the factfinding function.  P.  403 U. S. 547. 
Page 403 U. S. 529

(d) The States should be free to experiment to achieve the high promise of the juvenile court concept, and they may install a jury system; or a juvenile court judge may use an advisory jury in a particular case.  P.  403 U. S. 547.
(e) Many States, by statute or judicial decision, deny a juvenile a right to jury trial, and the great majority that have faced that issue since Gault, supra, and Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, have concluded that the considerations involved in those cases do not compel trial by jury in juvenile court.  Pp.  403 U. S. 548-549.
(f) Jury trial would entail delay, formality, and clamor of the adversary system, and possibly a public trial.  P.  403 U. S. 550.
(g) Equating the adjudicative phase of the juvenile proceeding with a criminal trial ignores the aspects of fairness, concern, sympathy, and paternal attention inherent in the juvenile court system.  P.  403 U. S. 550.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concluded that:
Due process in juvenile delinquency proceedings, which are not ""criminal prosecutions,"" does not require the States to provide jury trials on demand so long as some other aspect of the process adequately protects the interests that Sixth Amendment jury trials are intended to serve.  In the juvenile context, those interests may be adequately protected by allowing accused individuals to bring the community's attention to bear upon their trials.  Since Pennsylvania has no statutory bar to public juvenile trials, and since no claim is made that members of the public were excluded over appellants' objections, the judgment in No. 322 should be affirmed.  Pp.  403 U. S. 553-556.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concurred in the judgments in these cases on the ground that criminal jury trials are not constitutionally required of the States, either by the Sixth Amendment or by due process.  P.  403 U. S. 557.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 21, 1971
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, Ninth Supreme Judicial District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BLACK, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS joins, dissenting. 
 Glenn Patrick was killed and Earl Eilers was severely injured when a defective dome lid on a railroad tank car, upon which they were working in the performance of their duties, exploded in their faces. Patrick's widow, and her two children, and Eilers, the injured workman, brought this action in the Texas state courts seeking recovery for their injuries under the Safety Appliance Act of 1910. Act of April 14, 1910, c. 160, 36 Stat. 298, 45 U.S.C. 1 et seq. They named as defendants Union Tank Car Company, the corporate owner of the tank car; Hercules, Inc., the lessee of the car; and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, the railroad which delivered the car. The case was tried to a jury. The evidence at trial showed that the two workmen were sent to open the dome lid on top of the tank car. If functioning properly, the dome lid would have been loose and would have permitted the pressure accumulating during the loading of the car to escape. But rust and corrosion had caused the dome lid to freeze closed and, as the two workmen mounted the car, the lid exploded killing one and crippling the other. In response to a special issue charge submitted by the trial judge, the jury found that the dome lid of the tank car in question was a safety appliance within the coverage of the Safety Appliance Acts, that the dome lid had failed to operate properly to release the car's internal pressure, and that such failure was the proximate cause of the explosion and injury. The jury awarded $80,000 each to Patrick's widow and two children, and $42,000 to Eilers. 
Page 403 U.S. 937 , 938
 The Texas Court of Civil Appeals reversed and rendered judgment for the respondents holding that as a matter of law the dome lid of the tank car was not a safety appliance so as to invoke the absolute liability for violation of the Safety Appliance Acts. Believing that the court below is wrong in its interpretation of the Acts, I would grant the petition for writ of certiorari, reverse the decision below, and reinstate the jury verdict. 
 The Texas appellate court recognized that the dome lid in this case was designed to serve the dual function of an opening through which the car could be filled and an escape for pressure resulting from the filling. Indeed, the court below seemed to concede that the dome lid was a 'safety appliance' but held that it was not covered by the Safety Appliance Acts because it was not specifically mentioned in the Acts or the regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission. That court took this step in the face of this Court's express decision in Shields v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., 350 U.S. 318 (1956), that the Safety Appliance Acts are not limited to those devices specified in the Acts and the Commission regulations. As we said in that case: 'At best, appliances standardized in Commission regulations represent the minimum of safety equipment, and there is no prohibition of additional safety appliances.' 350 U.S., at 324. We held in Shields that if a safety appliance is provided by the railroad or the makers of the car and used by the railroad as an appliance necessary for the use of the car, it must be safe. 
 One man is dead and another is crippled for life because the dome lid on the tank car furnished by the respondents was defective. The dome lid was provided by the respondents as a safety appliance; its failure to function properly was the proximate cause of the explosion and injuries. In my view, petitioners have shown a [403 U.S. 937 , 939]

No. 107
Argued December 14, 1970
Decided June 14, 1971
403 U.S. 217

Syllabus 
Following the Court of Appeals' affirmance of a District Court judgment invalidating enforced segregation on equal protection grounds, the city council of Jackson, Mississippi, desegregated its public recreational facilities, including its five public parks, except for their swimming pools.  Stating that the pools could not be operated safely and economically on an integrated basis, the council closed four city-owned pools and surrendered its lease on a fifth, which the lessor, the YMCA, continued to operate for whites only.  Petitioners, Negro citizens of Jackson, then brought this action, mainly on equal protection grounds, to force the city to reopen and operate the pools on a desegregated basis.  The District Court held that there was no denial of equal protection.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the contention that, since the pools had been closed to avoid desegregation there was a denial of equal protection.
Held:
1. The closing of the pools to all persons did not constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Negroes.  Pp.  403 U. S. 219-226.
(a) This case is distinguishable from Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, 377 U. S. 218, and Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U. S. 369, on both of which petitioners rely.  In Griffin, there were many facets of state involvement in the segregated operation of ""private"" schools; here there is no city involvement in the operation or funding of any pool.  In Reitman, the evidence was deemed sufficient to show that the State, by enacting a constitutional amendment establishing the right of private persons to discriminate in realty transactions, thereby repealing two housing anti-discrimination laws, was abetting refusal to rent apartments on racial grounds; here there was no evidence that the city conspired with the YMCA that its pool be segregated.  Pp.  403 U. S. 221-224.
(b) In this case, where there was substantial evidence to support the council's stated reason for closing the pools and there 
Page 403 U. S. 218
 was no evidence of state action affecting Negroes differently from white, petitioners' contention that equal protection requirements were violated because the pool-closing decision was motivated by anti-integration considerations must also fail, since courts will not invalidate legislation based solely on asserted illicit motivation by the enacting legislative body.  Pp.  403 U. S. 224-226.
2. The city council's action in closing the pools, instead of keeping them open on an integrated basis, did not create a ""badge or incident"" of slavery in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment.  Pp.  403 U. S. 226-227.

No. 107
Argued December 14, 1970
Decided June 14, 1971
403 U.S. 217

Syllabus 
Following the Court of Appeals' affirmance of a District Court judgment invalidating enforced segregation on equal protection grounds, the city council of Jackson, Mississippi, desegregated its public recreational facilities, including its five public parks, except for their swimming pools.  Stating that the pools could not be operated safely and economically on an integrated basis, the council closed four city-owned pools and surrendered its lease on a fifth, which the lessor, the YMCA, continued to operate for whites only.  Petitioners, Negro citizens of Jackson, then brought this action, mainly on equal protection grounds, to force the city to reopen and operate the pools on a desegregated basis.  The District Court held that there was no denial of equal protection.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the contention that, since the pools had been closed to avoid desegregation there was a denial of equal protection.
Held:
1. The closing of the pools to all persons did not constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Negroes.  Pp.  403 U. S. 219-226.

No. 76
Argued December 15, 1970

403 U.S. 274

Syllabus 
Respondent, who had been discharged from employment on the ground that he had forfeited his good standing membership in petitioner Union by dues arrearage, and was therefore subject to termination under the union security clause in the applicable collective bargaining agreement, brought suit in the state court against the Union and the employer (which was later dropped as a party).  The two-count complaint charged (1) that the Union, in suspending respondent from membership, which resulted in his loss of employment, acted wrongfully, and deprived respondent of the employment with his employer that accrued to him and would accrue to him by reason of his employment, seniority, and experience, and (2) that, by the suspension in violation of the Union's constitution and general laws (which constituted a contract between respondent as a union member and the Union) the Union had breached its contract with respondent.  The trial court, rejecting the Union's contention that the complaint charged the commission of an unfair labor practice within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), held that it had jurisdiction under Machinists v. Gonzales, 356 U. S. 617, concluded that there had been a breach of contract, for which it awarded money damages for lost wages, and ordered respondent restored to union membership.  The Idaho Supreme Court, which also ordered respondent's seniority rights restored, affirmed by a divided vote, concluding that, although the Union's conduct ""did most certainly"" violate  8(b)(1)(A) and 8(b)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act and ""probably caused the employer to violate  8(a)(3),"" the state courts had jurisdiction because the complaint charged a breach of contract, rather than an unfair labor practice; state courts, in interpreting contract terms, deal with different conduct than would the NLRB in deciding whether a union is discriminating against a member; and Gonzales, supra, constitutes an exception that permits state courts to exercise jurisdiction in a case like this.
Held: 
Page 403 U. S. 275

1. Respondent's complaint that the Union had wrongfully interfered with his employment relation involved a matter that was arguably protected by  7 or prohibited by  8 of the National Labor Relations Act and thus was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB.  San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236.  Pp.  403 U. S. 285-291.
2. The reasons relied on for the assumption of state court jurisdiction in this case do not suffice to overcome the factors on which the preemption doctrine of Garmon was predicated, viz., the congressional purpose for effectuating a comprehensive national labor policy to be administered by an expert central agency, rather than by a federalized judicial system; the necessity for carrying out that labor policy without specific congressional direction or judicial resolution on a case-by-case basis; and the avoidance of different treatment of the judicial power to deal with conduct that the Act protects from that which the Act prohibits.  Pp.  403 U. S. 285-297.
(a) Since preemption is designed to shield the system from conflicting regulation of conduct, the formal description of that conduct (here the characterization that a breach of contract was involved) is immaterial.  Pp.  403 U. S. 291-292.
(b) Since the conduct here was arguably protected by  7 or prohibited by  8 of the Act, the substantial interests sought to be protected by the preemption doctrine are directly involved, and the fact that the Union may have misconstrued its own rules in this case would not be treated by the NLRB as a defense to a claimed violation of  8(b)(2).  Pp.  403 U. S. 292-293.
(c) The Gonzales case ""was focused on purely internal union matters,"" and the state courts only had to consider the union's constitution and bylaws, whereas respondent's case turned on the construction of the applicable union security clause, as to which federal concern is pervasive, and its regulation complex.  Pp.  403 U. S. 293-297.
3. Respondent's contention that his action is excepted from the Garmon principle as being a suit for the enforcement of a collective bargaining agreement is without merit, since respondent specifically dropped the employer as a defendant, as is his alternative contention that his suit is essentially one to redress the Union's breach of its duty of fair representation, for to sustain such a claim respondent would have to prove ""arbitrary or bad faith conduct on the part of the union,"" whereas the Idaho Supreme Court found only that the Union had misinterpreted the contract.

A store manager and a customer were robbed by two armed men.  Petitioner was tried and convicted of robbing the manager, but, on retrial after reversal, he was acquitted.  He was then charged with robbing the customer, his motion to quash the information on double jeopardy grounds was overruled, and he was found guilty.  Each jury verdict was a general one.  The District Court of Appeal, after the decision in Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.

The State Supreme Court denied review.
Held:  As stated in Ashe, supra, ""mutuality"" is not an ingredient of the collateral estoppel rule imposed on the States by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; and unless the jury verdict in the second trial ""could have [been] grounded . . . upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration,"" the double jeopardy provision vitiates petitioner's conviction.

Syllabus 
Petitioners, Negro citizens of Mississippi, filed a damages action under 42 U.S.C.  1985(3), charging that respondents, white citizens of Mississippi, conspired to assault petitioners, who were passengers ""traveling upon the federal, state, and local highways"" in an automobile driven by one Grady, a citizen of Tennessee, for the purpose of preventing them ""and other Negro-Americans, through . . . force, violence and intimidation, from seeking the equal protection of the laws and from enjoying the equal rights, privileges and immunities of citizens under the laws of the United States and the State of Mississippi,"" including rights to free speech, assembly, association, and movement, and the right not to be enslaved.  The complaint alleged that, pursuant to the conspiracy, respondents, mistakenly believing Grady to be a civil rights worker, blocked the travelers' passage on the public highways, forced them from the car, held them at bay with firearms, and, amidst threats of murder, clubbed them, inflicting serious physical injury.  Section 1985(3) provides:
""If two or more persons . . . conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another, for the purpose of depriving . . . any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws [and] in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged therein do . . . any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured . . . or deprived of . . . any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the party so injured or deprived""
may have a cause of action for damages against the conspirators.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, relying on Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U. S. 651, where the Court, in order to avoid difficult constitutional questions, in effect construed  1985(3) to reach only conspiracies under color of state law.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Section 1985(3) does not require state action but reaches private conspiracies, such as the one alleged in the complaint here, that are aimed at invidiously discriminatory deprivation of the 
Page 403 U. S. 89
 equal enjoyment of rights secured to all by law, as is clearly manifested by the wording and legislative history of the statute and companion statutory provisions, and the constitutional impediments that influenced the Court's construction of the statute in Collins, supra, as is clear from more recent decisions, simply do not exist.

2. Congress had the constitutional authority to reach a private conspiracy of the sort alleged in the complaint in this case both under  2 of the Thirteenth Amendment and under its power to protect the right of interstate travel.  Pp. 104-106.

Syllabus 
Appellant, in this suit filed in 1964 challenging the constitutionality of Arizona's state legislative districting laws, attacked the State's third attempt to enact a valid apportionment plan.  The District Court found the plan constitutionally deficient in several respects, but, because of the proximity of the 1970 elections (which would be the last held before the 1970 census data became available for new plans) and because the court concluded that the main difficulty was the State's large population increase since the last census, upheld the legislature's plan as the least unsatisfactory alternative (including appellant's plan).  In its order, the court ""assume[d] that the Arizona Legislature will, by November 1, 1971, enact a valid plan of reapportionment,"" but that, ""[u]pon failure of the Legislature so to do, any party to this action may apply to the court for appropriate relief.""  Though the 1970 general election was held on the basis of the state law as thus upheld, appellant contends that the District Court should now adopt an apportionment plan which would be displaced only if the legislature adopts a valid plan.
Held:  The District Court did not err in affording the legislature a reasonable time to enact a constitutionally adequate apportionment plan for the 1972 elections, on the basis of the 1970 census figures which will presumably be available, that court being in the best position to know if the November 1 deadline will be adequate to facilitate its consideration of the legislative plan and to enable it to prepare its own plan if the official version is not constitutional.

No. 92
Argued December 8, 1970

403 U.S. 124

Syllabus 
This suit was brought by residents of Marion and Lake Counties, Indiana, challenging state statutes establishing Marion County as a multi-member district for the election of state senators and representatives.  It was alleged, first, that the laws invidiously diluted the votes of Negroes and poor persons living in the ""ghetto area"" of Marion County, and, second, that voters in multi-member districts were overrepresented, since the true test of voting power is the ability to cast a tie-breaking vote, and the voters in multi-member districts had a greater theoretical opportunity to cast such votes than voters in single member districts.  The tendency of multi-member district legislators to vote as a bloc was alleged to compound this discrimination.  The three-judge court, though not ruling squarely on the second claim, determined that a racial minority group with specific legislative interests inhabited a ghetto area in Indianapolis, in Marion County; that the statutes operated to minimize and cancel out the voting strength of this minority group; and that redistricting Marion County alone would leave impermissible variations between Marion districts and others in the State, thus requiring state-wide redistricting, which could not await 1970 census figures.  The court held the statutes unconstitutional, and gave the State until October 1, 1969, to enact reapportionment legislation.  No such legislation ensued, and the court drafted a plan using single member districts throughout the State.  The 1970 elections were ordered to be held in accordance with the new plan.  This Court granted a stay of judgment pending final action on the appeal, thus permitting the 1970 elections to be held under the condemned statutes.  Under those statutes, based on the 1960 census, there was a maximum variance in population of senate districts of 28.20%, with a ratio between the largest and smallest districts of 1.327 to 1, and a maximum variance in house districts of 24.78%, with a ratio of 1.279 to 1.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case remanded.  Pp.  403 U. S. 140-170;  403 U. S. 179-180.
305 F.Supp. 1364, reversed and remanded. 
Page 403 U. S. 125

MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I-VI, finding that:
1. Although, as the Court was advised on June 1, 1971, the Indiana legislature enacted new apportionment legislation providing for state-wide single member house and senate districts, the case is not moot.  Pp.  403 U. S. 140-141.
2. The validity of multi-member districts is justiciable, but a challenger has the burden of proving that such districts unconstitutionally operate to dilute or cancel the voting strength of racial or political groups.  Pp.  403 U. S. 141-144.
3. The actual, as distinguished from theoretical, impact of multi-member districts on individual voting power has not been sufficiently demonstrated on this record to warrant departure from prior cases involving multi-member districts, and neither the findings below nor the record sustains the view that multi-member districts overrepresent their voters as compared with voters in single-member districts, even if the multi-member legislative delegation tends to bloc voting.  Pp.  403 U. S. 144-148.
4. Appellees' claim that the fact that the number of ghetto residents who were legislators was not proportionate to ghetto population proves invidious discrimination, notwithstanding the absence of evidence that ghetto residents had less opportunity to participate in the political process, is not valid, and, on this record, the malproportion was due to the ghetto voters' choices' losing the election contests.  Pp.  403 U. S. 148-155.
5. The trial court's conclusion that, with respect to their unique interests, ghetto residents were invidiously underrepresented due to lack of their own legislative voice, was not supported by the findings.  Moreover, even assuming bloc voting by the county delegation contrary to the ghetto majority's wishes, there is no constitutional violation, since that situation inheres in the political process, whether the district be single- or multi-member.  P.  403 U. S. 155.
6. Multi-member districts have not been proved inherently invidious or violative of equal protection, but, even assuming their unconstitutionality, it is not clear that the remedy is a single-member system with lines drawn to ensure representation to all sizable racial, ethnic, economic, or religious groups.  Pp. 156-160.
7. The District Court erred in brushing aside the entire state apportionment policy without solid constitutional and equitable 
Page 403 U. S. 126
 grounds for doing so, and without considering more limited alternatives.  Pp. 160-161.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded, in Part VII, that it was not improper for the District Court to order state-wide redistricting on the basis of the excessive population variances between the legislative districts shown by this record.  That court ordered reapportionment not because of population shifts since its 1965 decision upholding the statutory plan, but because the disparities had been shown to be excessive by intervening decisions of this Court.  Pp.  403 U. S. 161-163.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded, with respect to redistricting the entire State, that there were impermissible population variances between districts under the current apportionment plan, and that the new Marion County districts would also have impermissible variances, thus requiring state-wide redistricting.  Pp.  403 U. S. 179-180.

Under those statutes, based on the 1960 census, there was a maximum variance in population of senate districts of 28.20%, with a ratio between the largest and smallest districts of 1.327 to 1, and a maximum variance in house districts of 24.78%, with a ratio of 1.279 to 1.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case remanded.  Pp.  403 U. S. 140-170;  403 U. S. 179-180.
305 F.Supp. 1364, reversed and remanded. 
Page 403 U. S. 125

MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I-VI, finding that:
1. Although, as the Court was advised on June 1, 1971, the Indiana legislature enacted new apportionment legislation providing for state-wide single member house and senate districts, the case is not moot.  Pp.  403 U. S. 140-141.
2. The validity of multi-member districts is justiciable, but a challenger has the burden of proving that such districts unconstitutionally operate to dilute or cancel the voting strength of racial or political groups.  Pp.  403 U. S. 141-144.
3. The actual, as distinguished from theoretical, impact of multi-member districts on individual voting power has not been sufficiently demonstrated on this record to warrant departure from prior cases involving multi-member districts, and neither the findings below nor the record sustains the view that multi-member districts overrepresent their voters as compared with voters in single-member districts, even if the multi-member legislative delegation tends to bloc voting.  Pp.  403 U. S. 144-148.
4. Appellees' claim that the fact that the number of ghetto residents who were legislators was not proportionate to ghetto population proves invidious discrimination, notwithstanding the absence of evidence that ghetto residents had less opportunity to participate in the political process, is not valid, and, on this record, the malproportion was due to the ghetto voters' choices' losing the election contests.  Pp.  403 U. S. 148-155.
5. The trial court's conclusion that, with respect to their unique interests, ghetto residents were invidiously underrepresented due to lack of their own legislative voice, was not supported by the findings.  Moreover, even assuming bloc voting by the county delegation contrary to the ghetto majority's wishes, there is no constitutional violation, since that situation inheres in the political process, whether the district be single- or multi-member.  P.  403 U. S. 155.
6. Multi-member districts have not been proved inherently invidious or violative of equal protection, but, even assuming their unconstitutionality, it is not clear that the remedy is a single-member system with lines drawn to ensure representation to all sizable racial, ethnic, economic, or religious groups.  Pp. 156-160.
7. The District Court erred in brushing aside the entire state apportionment policy without solid constitutional and equitable 
Page 403 U. S. 126
 grounds for doing so, and without considering more limited alternatives.  Pp. 160-161.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded, in Part VII, that it was not improper for the District Court to order state-wide redistricting on the basis of the excessive population variances between the legislative districts shown by this record.  That court ordered reapportionment not because of population shifts since its 1965 decision upholding the statutory plan, but because the disparities had been shown to be excessive by intervening decisions of this Court.  Pp.  403 U. S. 161-163.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded, with respect to redistricting the entire State, that there were impermissible population variances between districts under the current apportionment plan, and that the new Marion County districts would also have impermissible variances, thus requiring state-wide redistricting.  Pp.  403 U. S. 179-180.
WHITE, J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered an opinion, of the Court with respect to Parts I-VI, in which BURGER, C.J., and BLACK, STEWART, and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined, and in which, as to Part VII, BURGER, C.J., and BLACK and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined.

No. 71
Argued November 19, 1970
Decided June 7, 1971
403 U.S. 182

Syllabus 
For more than a century, the Rockland County board of supervisors consisted of the supervisors of the county's five towns, resulting in extensive functional interrelationships and intergovernmental coordination between county and towns.  Severe malapportionment due to population growth led to court-ordered reapportionment.  The proposed plan, challenged by petitioners, provides for a county legislature of 18 members chosen from five districts, corresponding with the towns, each district being assigned legislators in the proportion of its population to that of the smallest town.  The plan produces a total deviation from equality of 11.9%.  The Court of Appeals of New York upheld the plan.
Held:  In light of the long tradition of overlapping functions and dual personnel in the Rockland County government and the fact that the plan does not contain any built-in bias favoring particular political interests or geographic areas, the plan is not violative of the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  403 U. S. 185-187.

A three-judge District Court invalidated Mississippi apportionment statute as allowing impermissibly large variations among election districts.

Applicants, who had quickly submitted four plans calling for single-member districts in Hinds County, ask for a stay of that judgment and an extension of the filing deadline until the District Court provides single member districts for Hinds County, or until the Attorney General or the District Court for the District of Columbia approves the District Court's apportionment plan under  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Held:  A stay is granted until June 14, 1971.
(a) A decree of a district court is not within the reach of  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
(b) Single-member districts are generally preferable to large multi-member districts in court-fashioned apportionment plans.
(c) In view of the availability of 1970 census data and the dispatch with which applicants devised their plans, the District Court is instructed, absent insurmountable difficulties, to devise and put into effect a single member district plan for Hinds County by June 14, 1971, and to extend appropriately the filing date for candidates from that county.

No. 821
Argued April 19, 1971
Decided June 1, 1971
402 U.S. 549

Syllabus 
The United States brought this civil antitrust suit charging that the acquisition by Greater Buffalo Press (Buffalo) in 1955 of all the stock of International Color Printing Co. (International) violated  7 of the Clayton Act, and that Buffalo, Hearst Corp., through its unincorporated division King Features Syndicate (King), Newspaper Enterprise Assn., and others had conspired to restrain the sale to newspapers of the printing of color comic supplements in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  Before trial, a consent decree was entered against Hearst.  Buffalo, which does not control ownership of features or license them, prints the color supplements for newspapers and sells them.  International prints color supplements only for King, which controls many popular comic features and is a licensor.  International's owners wanted to sell, rather than raise capital for modernization and expansion.  International paid dividends every year, and, in the year of sale, its profits increased.  Only King and Buffalo were considered as prospective purchasers; no others were even approached.  After acquiring International, Buffalo controlled about 75% of the independent color comic supplement business and, through International, it entered into a 10-year contract with King to supply King's printing.  The District Court dismissed the complaint after trial.  As to the Clayton Act claim, it found two distinct lines of commerce:  (1) printing of color comic supplements for newspapers not printing their own, and (2) printing of color comic supplements for syndicates selling copyrighted features to newspapers.  That court also found the acquisition to be within the ""failing company"" exception to  7 of the Clayton Act.  The United States appeals only from dismissal of the Clayton Act claim.  The court did not reach the question of remedy.
Held:
1. The line of commerce here is the color comic supplement printing business, which includes the printing of the supplements and their sale, and the ""area of effective competition"" encompasses the business of Buffalo, International, and King.  While there may be submarkets within this broad market, ""submarkets are not a 
Page 402 U. S. 550
 basis for the disregard of a broader line of commerce that has economic significance.""  Pp.  402 U. S. 552-554.
2. The test of  7 of the Clayton Act, whether the effect of an acquisition ""may be substantially to lessen competition,"" is met here by Buffalo's control of about 75% of the independent color comic supplement printing business.  P.  402 U. S. 555.
3. The District Court erred in finding that the acquisition was within the ""failing company"" exception, as the two requirements, (a) that International's resources were ""so depleted and the prospect of rehabilitation so remote that it faced the grave probability of a business failure,"" and (b) that there was no other prospective purchaser, were not satisfied.  Pp.  402 U. S. 555-556.
4. The mere passage of time is no barrier to the divestiture of stock illegally acquired.  P.  402 U. S. 556.
5. The case is remanded to the District Court, which has the initial responsibility of the drafting of a decree that will provide an appropriate and effective remedy.  Pp.  402 U. S. 556-557.

Syllabus 
Petitioner railroad brought this suit (after formal procedures of the Railway Labor Act had been exhausted) to enjoin a threatened strike by respondent Union, charging that the Union had failed to perform its obligations under  2 First of the Railway Labor Act ""to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, and working conditions.""  The Union answered that the Norris-LaGuardia Act deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to enjoin the strike, and that, in any event, the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.  The District Court, declining to pass on whether either party had violated  2 First, concluded that the matter was one for administrative determination by the National Mediation Board, and was not justiciable, and that  4 and 7 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act deprived the court of jurisdiction to enjoin the threatened strike.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, construing  2 First as hortatory, and not enforceable by the courts, but only by the National Mediation Board.

			"|"Chicago & North Western Railway Co. v.
United Transportation Union
No. 189
Argued January 18, 1971
Decided June 1, 1971
402 U.S. 570

Syllabus 
Petitioner railroad brought this suit (after formal procedures of the Railway Labor Act had been exhausted) to enjoin a threatened strike by respondent Union, charging that the Union had failed to perform its obligations under  2 First of the Railway Labor Act ""to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, and working conditions.""  The Union answered that the Norris-LaGuardia Act deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to enjoin the strike, and that, in any event, the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.  The District Court, declining to pass on whether either party had violated  2 First, concluded that the matter was one for administrative determination by the National Mediation Board, and was not justiciable, and that  4 and 7 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act deprived the court of jurisdiction to enjoin the threatened strike.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, construing  2 First as hortatory, and not enforceable by the courts, but only by the National Mediation Board.
Held:
1. Sec. 2 First was intended to be not just a mere exhortation, but an enforceable legal obligation on carriers and employees alike.  Pp.  402 U. S. 574-578.
2. The obligation imposed by  2 First, which is central to the effective working of the Railway Labor Act, is enforceable in the courts, rather than by the Mediation Board, as is clear from the Act's legislative history.  Pp.  402 U. S. 578-581.

Utility District of Hawkins County, Tennessee
No. 785
Argued April 20, 1971
Decided June 1, 1971
402 U.S. 600

Syllabus 
In this unfair labor practice proceeding under the Labor Management Relations Act, respondent contended that it was not an ""employer,"" but came within the ""political subdivision"" exemption in  2(2) of the Act.  The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had found that respondent met neither of the tests to which it held that exemption was limited, viz., entities that are either (1) created directly by the State, so as to constitute governmental departments or administrative arms, or (2) administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or the general electorate.  The Court of Appeals upheld respondent's contention, viewing as controlling a Tennessee Supreme Court decision construing the State's Utility District Law under which respondent had been organized.  A District organized under that statute is a ""municipality' or public corporation,"" has eminent domain powers, is exempt from state, county, or municipal taxation, and whose income from its bonds is exempt from federal income tax.  The officers who conduct the District's business receive nominal compensation, are appointed by a public official, and are subject to removal by statutory procedures applicable to public officials.
Held:
1. Federal, rather than state, law governs the determination whether an entity is a ""political subdivision"" of a State within the meaning of  2(2) of the Labor Management Relations Act.  NLRB v. Randolph Electric Membership Corp., 343 F.2d 60.  Pp.  402 U. S. 602-604.
2. While the NLRB's construction of the statutory term is entitled to great respect, there is no ""warrant in the record"" and ""no reasonable basis in law"" for the NLRB's conclusion that respondent was not a political subdivision.  In the light of all the factors present here, including the fact that the District is administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials (thus meeting even one of the tests used by the NLRB), respondent

402 U.S. 622

Syllabus 
Respondent and one Runnels were charged with committing various crimes and, at their joint trial, offered an alibi defense.  A police officer testified that Runnels had orally admitted the crimes and implicated respondent.  Runnels, who took the stand, denied making the statement.  The trial judge ruled that Runnels' alleged statement was inadmissible hearsay as to respondent, and could not be considered by the jury in deciding whether respondent was guilty.  Respondent also took the stand on his own behalf and gave the same version of their activities as Runnels.  Both defendants were found guilty, and, after unsuccessful efforts to have his conviction set aside, respondent applied for habeas corpus relief.  The District Court ruled that respondent's conviction was improper under Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123, and Roberts v. Russell, 392 U. S. 293, which held that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, is violated where a codefendant's out-of-court hearsay statement is admitted into evidence without the declarant's being available at trial for ""full and effective"" cross-examination by the defendant, and that a cautionary instruction to the jury does not adequately protect the defendant where the codefendant does not testify.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, stressing that effective confrontation of a witness who has allegedly made an out-of-court statement implicating the defendant was possible only if the witness affirmed the statement as his.
Held:  Where a codefendant takes the stand in his own defense, denies making an alleged out-of-court statement implicating the defendant, and testifies in the defendant's favor, the defendant has been denied no rights protected by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, and, in the circumstances of this case, respondent, who would have encountered greater difficulty had Runnels affirmed the statement as his, was denied neither the opportunity nor the benefit of fully and effectively cross-examining Runnels.

No. 464
Argued February 24, 1971
Decided May 24, 1971*
402 U.S. 515

Syllabus 
Pursuant to  202(b) of the Federal Power Act, the Federal Power Commission (FPC) is empowered to direct one electric utility to interconnect its electric system with another utility, and it
""may prescribe the terms and conditions of the arrangement to be made . . . including the apportionment of the cost between them and the compensation or reimbursement reasonably due to any of them.""
After hearings and staff studies the FPC found that an interconnection between Gainesville, a small municipally owned utility, and respondent, a major investor-owned electric utility, would be in the public interest, would not unduly burden respondent, and would benefit both parties.  The FPC ordered the interconnection, requiring Gainesville to pay the entire $3 million cost thereof and to maintain certain generating capacity.  In the light of these circumstances, the FPC imposed no standby charge on Gainesville.  The Court of Appeals denied enforcement of the order, agreeing with respondent's claim that the omission of an annual $150,000 payment to it by petitioner for the backup service provided by the interconnection resulted in a failure to satisfy the statutory mandate of ""reimbursement reasonably due"" respondent because respondent would obtain no benefit from the interconnection.  Section 313(b) of the Act provides that ""findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.""
Held:  Since there was substantial evidence to support the FPC's findings that benefits will accrue to respondent from the interconnection, the Court of Appeals erred in not deferring to the FPC's expert judgment.  Pp.  402 U. S. 521-529.

			"|"Gainesville Utilities Department v. Florida Power Corp.
No. 464
Argued February 24, 1971
Decided May 24, 1971*
402 U.S. 515

Syllabus 
Pursuant to  202(b) of the Federal Power Act, the Federal Power Commission (FPC) is empowered to direct one electric utility to interconnect its electric system with another utility, and it
""may prescribe the terms and conditions of the arrangement to be made . . . including the apportionment of the cost between them and the compensation or reimbursement reasonably due to any of them.""
After hearings and staff studies the FPC found that an interconnection between Gainesville, a small municipally owned utility, and respondent, a major investor-owned electric utility, would be in the public interest, would not unduly burden respondent, and would benefit both parties.  The FPC ordered the interconnection, requiring Gainesville to pay the entire $3 million cost thereof and to maintain certain generating capacity.  In the light of these circumstances, the FPC imposed no standby charge on Gainesville.  The Court of Appeals denied enforcement of the order, agreeing with respondent's claim that the omission of an annual $150,000 payment to it by petitioner for the backup service provided by the interconnection resulted in a failure to satisfy the statutory mandate of ""reimbursement reasonably due"" respondent because respondent would obtain no benefit from the interconnection.  Section 313(b) of the Act provides that ""findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.""
Held:  Since there was substantial evidence to support the FPC's findings that benefits will accrue to respondent from the interconnection, the Court of Appeals erred in not deferring to the FPC's expert judgment.  Pp.  402 U. S. 521-529.

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 The ability of the government and private agencies to gather, retain, and catalogue information on anyone for their unfettered use raises problems concerning the privacy and dignity of individuals. [Footnote 1] Public and private agencies are storing more and more data. 'If your name is not in the records of at least one credit bureau, it doesn't mean that you don't rate. What it does mean is that you are either under twenty-one or dead.'2 
 A file may show that an individual was arrested. But will it show the arrest was unconstitutional because it was solely for purposes of investigation? Or that the charges were dropped? Or that a jury acquitted him? 
 Other 'facts' may be in a file. Did he vote for Henry Wallace? Was he cited by HUAC? Is he subversive? Did he ever belong to any subversive organizations? 
 Private files amass similar irrelevancies and subjective information. Is he well regarded in his neighborhood as to character and habits? Does he have domestic difficulties? Is he 'slow' in paying his bills? 
Page 402 U.S. 1000 , 1001
 The problems of a computerized society3 with large data banks are immense. Who should have access to the files on an individual? For what purposes should access be allowed? Should an individual be informed each time information is passed on to new parties? How long should information be retained? What mechanisms ought there be for correcting factual errors? 
 This case presents the latter issue. A caseworker has prepared a highly critical report on petitioner setting forth in detail factual allegations and accusing petitioner of child neglect. The report recommends petitioner be permanently deprived of the custody of her children. Custody was temporarily placed in juvenile court because petitioner was hospitalized. Subsequently a hearing in juvenile court was held and petitioner was exonerated and retained custody of her children. But the critical report-which petitioner alleges is false-remains in the files with the Department of Social and Health Services of the State of Washington. 
 Not surprisingly, petitioner would like the allegedly false information removed from those files. But her efforts to obtain a hearing to correct the information have failed. 
 The State says that petitioner's file is 'confidential and privileged' and under current state law the file may only be disclosed 'for purposes directly connected with the administration of public assistance and specific investigatory purposes by legislative committees and properly authorized bodies.' Just how many people and agencies this includes is unclear. The only thing perfectly clear from this record is that [402 U.S. 1000 , 1002]

Respondent demurred to a count of an indictment charging him with violating Cal.Vehicle Code  20002(a)(1) (Supp. 1971) by failing to stop and furnish his name and address after involvement in an automobile accident, resulting in damage to property, on the ground that compliance would have violated his privilege against self-incrimination.  His demurrer was sustained by the California Supreme Court, which held that compliance confronted respondent with ""substantial hazards of self-incrimination,"" but upheld the statute by inserting a use restriction on the information disclosed.  That court concluded that it would be unfair to punish respondent, since he could not reasonably have anticipated the use restriction.
Held:  The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  402 U. S. 427-458.
71 Cal.2d 1039, 458 P.2d 465, vacated and remanded.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that:
1. Compliance with this essentially regulatory and noncriminal statute, where self-reporting is indispensable to its fulfillment, where the burden is on ""the public at large,"" as distinguished from a ""highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities,"" and where the possibility of incrimination is not substantial, does not infringe the privilege against self-incrimination.  Pp.  402 U. S. 427-431.
2. Even assuming that the statutory requirement of the essentially neutral act of disclosing name and address is incriminating in the traditional sense, it would be an extravagant extension of the privilege to hold that it is testimonial in the Fifth Amendment sense.  Just as there is no constitutional right to refuse to file an income tax return, there is no constitutional right to flee the scene of an accident to avoid any possible legal involvement.  Pp.  402 U. S. 431-434.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concluded that the presence, from the individual's point of view, of a ""real,"" and not ""imaginary,"" risk of self-incrimination is not a sufficient predicate for extension of the privilege against self-incrimination to regulatory schemes of the character involved in this case.  Considering the noncriminal governmental purpose of securing the information (to ensure

402 U.S. 479

Syllabus 
Petitioner applied in 1966 for conscientious objector status to his local Selective Service board, which advised him that his claim would be passed on when his student deferment expired.  His board was told in 1967 that petitioner had been accepted for a graduate program where, in petitioner's own view, he would ""probably qualify"" for a theological exemption.  However, no request for ministerial student status was made, nor was pertinent supporting information presented.  Petitioner refused to fill out a current information questionnaire sent to him on his graduation from college, announcing that he would not cooperate with the Selective Service System.  Following the local board's subsequent reclassification of petitioner I-A, he did not seek a personal appearance before the board or appeal board review.  Petitioner thereafter refused to submit to induction, for which, along with other draft law violations, he was prosecuted and convicted.  The Court of Appeals, rejecting petitioner's defense that the local board had erred in its classification, affirmed.
Held:  Petitioner's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies jeopardized the interest of the Selective Service System, as the administrative agency responsible for classifying registrants, in developing the facts and using its expertise to assess his claims to exempt status, and thus bars petitioner's defense that he was erroneously classified.

McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185, factually distinguished.  Pp.  402 U. S. 483-491.

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted of engaging in the wagering business without payment of the special occupational tax. This took place prior to our decision in Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906, holding unconstitutional against a claim of self-incrimination a conviction under the same statute. In the course of that prosecution a search warrant was obtained and evidence was obtained on the basis of which the present civil suit for excise taxes, fraud penalties, and interest was brought. 
 The central question is whether the evidence obtained by a warrant in the criminal case, which retrospectively contained the constitutional infirmity noted in Grosso, may be used in this civil case. 
 Since, as was we held in United States v. United States Coin and Currency, 401 U.S. 915, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434, our decision in Grosso (and its companion Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889), are retroactive, I do not see how evidence obtained by use of a search warrant issued under the old regime which Grosso and Marchetti put into the discard, can do service for process in this new and wholly different civil proceeding. [978-Continued.] 
 There are means of discovery provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure* and by a special procedure, 26 U.S.C. 7602, applicable to civil suits to collect federal taxes. The United States would never dare ask for a search warrant to ferret out the facts necessary for its civil suit. The fact that it obtained evidence by a warrant issued in a procedure incident to an unconstitutional prosecution should not now be turned into a windfall. The Government should turn square corners, not taxpayers alone. 
 * Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules 26-38. 
Page 402 U.S. 978, 979
 In restrospect the warrant should not have issued, though under then- existing law it may have been wholly proper. We should hold the Government to the maxim expressed by Mr. Justice Holmes in Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 358, 392, 40 S.Ct. 182: 
 I would grant this petition for certiorari. 

 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 The courts below have ordered a sale of petitioner's farm to satisfy a tax lien. The extent of petitioner's liability was determined on the basis of evidence seized by Internal Revenue agents under a search warrant grounded upon the determination that there was probable cause to believe that petitioner was engaged in the wagering business without having registered and paid the required occupational tax. We subsequently held that the Fifth Amendment prohibits the Government from requiring such registration of a gambler who justifiably fears that he will thereby incriminate himself, and who does not waive his privilege against self- incrimination. Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L. Ed.2d 889 (1968). And we have just this Term held that prohibition applicable whether the failure to register took place before or after Marchetti was decided. United States v. United States Coin and Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971). 
 Under these cases, therefore, there is substantial doubt whether the Government could constitutionally punish petitioner for his failure to register. [Footnote 1] By the same token, [402 U.S. 978, 980]

|402 u.s. 183|"McGautha v. California
No. 203
Argued November 9, 1970
Decided May 3, 1971*
402 U.S. 183

Syllabus 
Petitioner in No. 203 was convicted of first-degree murder in California, and was sentenced to death.  The penalty was left to the jury's absolute discretion, and punishment was determined in a separate proceeding following the trial on the issue of guilt.  Petitioner in No. 204 was convicted of first-degree murder, and was sentenced to death in Ohio, where the jury, which also had absolute penalty discretion, determined guilt and penalty after a single trial and in a single verdict.  Certiorari was granted to consider whether petitioners' rights were infringed by permitting the death penalty without standards to govern its imposition, and in No. 204, to consider the constitutionality of a single guilt and punishment proceeding.
Held:
1. In light of history, experience, and the limitations of human knowledge in establishing definitive standards, it is impossible to say that leaving to the untrammeled discretion of the jury the power to pronounce life or death in capital cases violates any provision of the Constitution.  Pp.  402 U. S. 196-208.
2. The Constitution does not prohibit the States from considering that the compassionate purposes of jury sentencing in capital cases are better served by having the issues of guilt and punishment resolved in a single trial than by focusing the jury's attention solely on punishment after guilt has been determined.  Pp.  402 U. S. 208-222.
(a) Petitioner in No. 204 has failed to show that his unitary trial violated the Constitution by forcing ""the making of difficult judgments"" in his decision whether to remain silent on the issue of guilt at the cost of surrendering his chance to plead his case on the punishment issue.  Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377, distinguished.  Pp.  402 U. S. 210-213.
(b) The policies of the privilege against self-incrimination are not offended when a defendant in a capital case yields to the pressure to testify on the issue of punishment at the risk of damaging his case on guilt.  Pp.  402 U. S. 213-217. 
Page 402 U. S. 184

(c) Ohio does provide for the common law ritual of allocution, but the State need not provide petitioner an opportunity to speak to the jury free from any adverse consequence on the issue of guilt.  Pp.  402 U. S. 217-220.
No. 203, 70 Cal.2d 770, 452 P.2d 650; and No. 204, 18 Ohio St.2d 182, 248 N.E.2d 614, affirmed.

Syllabus 
Appellee, who had advertised in the newspaper the sale to persons over 21 years of age of a booklet entitled The True Facts About Imported Pornography, was indicted for mailing copies of the booklet in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1461, which prohibits the knowing use of the mails for the delivery of obscene matter.  Appellee moved to dismiss the indictment, contending that the statute was unconstitutional.  Assuming, arguendo, that the booklets were obscene, the trial judge granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that appellee made a constitutionally protected delivery and that  1461 was unconstitutional as applied to him.

|402 u.s. 363|"United States v. Thirty-Seven (37) Photographs (Luros, Claimant)
No. 133
Argued January 20, 1971
Decided May 3, 1971
402 U.S. 363

Syllabus 
Customs agents seized as obscene photographs possessed by claimant Luros when he returned to this country from Europe on October 24, 1969.  Section 1305(a) of 19 U.S.C. pursuant to which the agents acted, prohibits the importation of obscene material, provides for its seizure at any customs office and retention pending the judgment of the district court, and specifies that the collector of customs give information of the seizure to the district attorney, who shall institute forfeiture proceedings.  The agents referred the matter to the United States Attorney, who brought forfeiture proceedings on November 6.  Luros' answer denied that the photographs were obscene and counterclaimed that  1305(a) was unconstitutional.  He asked for a three-judge court, which, on November 20, was ordered to be convened.  Following a hearing on January 9, 1970, the court on January 27 held  1305(a) unconstitutional on the grounds that the statute (1) failed to meet the procedural requirements of Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, and (2) was overly broad as including within its ban obscene material for private use, making it invalid under Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557.
Held:  The judgment is reversed and the case remanded.  Pp.  402 U. S. 367-379.
309 F.Supp. 36, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded in Part I that  1305(a) can be construed as requiring administrative and judicial action within specified time limits that will avoid the constitutional issue that would otherwise be presented by Freedman, supra.  Pp.  402 U. S. 367-375.
(a) In Freedman, unlike the situation here, the statute failing to specify time limits was enacted pursuant to state authority, and could not be given an authoritative construction by this Court to avoid the constitutional issue.  P.  402 U. S. 369.
(b) The reading into  1305(a) of the time limits required by Freedman comports with the legislative purpose of the statute 
Page 402 U. S. 364
 and furthers the policy of statutory construction to avoid a constitutional issue.  Pp. 37373.
(c) Section 1305(a) may be constitutionally applied as construed to require intervals of no longer than 14 days from seizure of the goods to the institution of judicial proceedings for their forfeiture and no longer than 60 days from the filing of the action to final decision in the district court (absent claimant-induced delays).  Pp.  402 U. S. 373-374.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded in Part II that Congress' constitutional power to remove obscene materials from the channels of commerce is unimpaired by this Court's decision in Stanley, supra. Cf. United States v. Reidel, ante, p.  402 U. S. 351.  Pp.  402 U. S. 375-377.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concluded that Luros, who stipulated with the Government that the materials were imported for commercial purposes, lacked standing to challenge the statute for overbreadth on the ground that it applied to importation for private use.  P.  402 U. S. 378.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART while agreeing that the First Amendment does not prevent the border seizure of obscene materials imported for commercial dissemination and that Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, imposes time limits for initiating forfeiture proceedings and completing the judicial obscenity determination, would not even intimate that the Government may lawfully seize literature intended for the importer's purely private use.  P.  402 U. S. 378.
WHITE, J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered an opinion in which (as to Part I) BURGER, C.J., and HARLAN, BRENNAN, STEWART, and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined, and in which (as to Part II), BURGER, C.J., and BRENNAN and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined.

The agents referred the matter to the United States Attorney, who brought forfeiture proceedings on November 6.  Luros' answer denied that the photographs were obscene and counterclaimed that  1305(a) was unconstitutional.  He asked for a three-judge court, which, on November 20, was ordered to be convened.  Following a hearing on January 9, 1970, the court on January 27 held  1305(a) unconstitutional on the grounds that the statute (1) failed to meet the procedural requirements of Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, and (2) was overly broad as including within its ban obscene material for private use, making it invalid under Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557.
Held:  The judgment is reversed and the case remanded.  Pp.  402 U. S. 367-379.
309 F.Supp. 36, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded in Part I that  1305(a) can be construed as requiring administrative and judicial action within specified time limits that will avoid the constitutional issue that would otherwise be presented by Freedman, supra.  Pp.  402 U. S. 367-375.
(a) In Freedman, unlike the situation here, the statute failing to specify time limits was enacted pursuant to state authority, and could not be given an authoritative construction by this Court to avoid the constitutional issue.  P.  402 U. S. 369.
(b) The reading into  1305(a) of the time limits required by Freedman comports with the legislative purpose of the statute 
Page 402 U. S. 364
 and furthers the policy of statutory construction to avoid a constitutional issue.  Pp. 37373.
(c) Section 1305(a) may be constitutionally applied as construed to require intervals of no longer than 14 days from seizure of the goods to the institution of judicial proceedings for their forfeiture and no longer than 60 days from the filing of the action to final decision in the district court (absent claimant-induced delays).  Pp.  402 U. S. 373-374.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded in Part II that Congress' constitutional power to remove obscene materials from the channels of commerce is unimpaired by this Court's decision in Stanley, supra. Cf. United States v. Reidel, ante, p.  402 U. S. 351.  Pp.  402 U. S. 375-377.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concluded that Luros, who stipulated with the Government that the materials were imported for commercial purposes, lacked standing to challenge the statute for overbreadth on the ground that it applied to importation for private use.  P.  402 U. S. 378.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART while agreeing that the First Amendment does not prevent the border seizure of obscene materials imported for commercial dissemination and that Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, imposes time limits for initiating forfeiture proceedings and completing the judicial obscenity determination, would not even intimate that the Government may lawfully seize literature intended for the importer's purely private use.  P.  402 U. S. 378.
WHITE, J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered an opinion in which (as to Part I) BURGER, C.J., and HARLAN, BRENNAN, STEWART, and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined, and in which (as to Part II), BURGER, C.J., and BRENNAN and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined.  HARLAN, J., post, p.  402 U. S. 377, and STEWART, J., post, p.  402 U. S. 378, filed opinions concurring in the judgment and concurring in Part I of WHITE, J.'s opinion.  BLACK, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which DOUGLAS, J., joined, post, p.  402 U. S. 379.  MARSHALL, J., filed a dissenting opinion, ante, p.  402 U. S. 360.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 3, 1971
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied since it was untimely filed.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 The court below held in this school segregation case that the 'district court correctly excluded evidence of alleged racial discrimination in the public and private housing markets.' I would remand this case so that that evidence can be made part of the record and the lower courts can rule on the issues of de jure and de facto segregation of the races that are presented. It is true that this petition arrived one working day after a time extension granted by Mr. Justice White expired. Unlike some types of cases where the time for filing is prescribed by our rules,1 Congress has stated that 'any writ of certiorari intended to bring any judgment or decree in a civil action, suit or proceeding before the Supreme Court for review shall be taken or applied for within ninety days after the entry of such judgment or decree. A justice of the Supreme Court, for good cause shown, may extend the time for applying for a writ of certiorari for a period not exceeding sixty days.' 28 U.S.C. 2101(c). (Italics added.) The question here is whether a petition arriving at the Clerk's Office one day after the statutory period expires is jurisdictionally barred from a determination on the merits. Mr. Justice BLACK has pointed out that early cases under the predecessor sections to 2101 (c) 'made clear that this Court had power to waive the time requirement of these provisions under appropriate circumstances.' Teague v. Regional Commissioner of Customs, 394 U.S. 977, 982 ( dissenting opinion). And in Ray v. 
Page 402 U.S. 962 , 963
 Pierson (No. 94, October Term, 1966), 386 U.S. 547d 288, we decided on the merits a cross-petition for certiorari that was substantially out of time under 2101(c).2 We offered no explanation. [Footnote 3] Even under the companion sections to 2101(c) our practice has not been consistent. We have dismissed for failure to file appeals in the time set by Congress, e. g., Ward v. Winstead, 400 U.S. 1019d 630, while not always dismissing for untimely docketing under our rules even though the time limitations were also set by Congress, e. g., United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 84-86. 
 Naturally, past inconsistencies are no justification for overturning a congressional bar if one exists. But one does not exist in this case. The statute states a petition 'for review shall be taken or applied for' within certain specified times. That phrase is not free from ambiguity. What constitutes applying for review? A majority of the Court apparently feel it is receipt of the petition for certiorari by the Clerk's Office. Teague, supra. Yet I can see no reason why mailing or other transmission to this Court shall not be construed as an application for relief [402 U.S. 962 , 964]

Section 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act requires a method of administration ""reasonably calculated to insure full payment of unemployment compensation when due.""  In light of the intent of Congress to make payments available at the earliest stage of unemployment as is administratively feasible, in order to provide a substitute for wages, the language ""when due"" must be construed to mean when benefits are allowed as a result of a hearing of which both parties have notice and at which they are permitted to present their respective positions.

No. 156

Syllabus 
In 1953, respondent fled mainland China, of which he was a national, going to Hong Kong, where he resided with his family until 1960, when he came to the United States as a business visitor.  He remained in this country, though he kept his business in Hong Kong for several years.  His temporary permit having expired, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in 1966 began deportation proceedings.  Respondent then sought classification as a refugee under  203(a)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which provides that aliens may apply in any non-Communist country for conditional entry into the United States if (i) they have fled from any Communist country because of persecution or fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, or political opinion, (ii) are remaining away from that country for those reasons, and (iii) are not nationals of the country in which they apply for conditional entry.  The INS Director denied respondent's application on the ground that  203(a)(7) requires that ""physical presence in the United States [be] a consequence of an alien's flight in search of a refuge,"" and that such presence must be
""reasonably proximate to the flight, and not one following a flight remote in point of time or intervening residence in a third country reasonably constituting a termination of the original flight in search of refuge.""
Without deciding whether resettlement would have barred respondent's claim, the District Court reversed the INS determination, on the ground that respondent had never firmly resettled in Hong Kong.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis that the relevant factor was not the ""firmly resettled"" issue, but that, under  203(a)(7)(iii), respondent was a national of Communist China, from which he was a refugee, and not a national of Hong Kong.
Held:  Whether a refugee has already ""firmly resettled"" in another country is relevant to determining the availability to him of the asylum provision of  203(a)(7), since Congress did not intend to grant asylum to a refugee who 
Page 402 U. S. 50
 has found permanent shelter in another country, and the  203(a)(7)(iii) nationality requirement is no substitute for the ""resettlement"" concept.  Pp.  402 U. S. 52-58.

Respondent then sought classification as a refugee under  203(a)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which provides that aliens may apply in any non-Communist country for conditional entry into the United States if (i) they have fled from any Communist country because of persecution or fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, or political opinion, (ii) are remaining away from that country for those reasons, and (iii) are not nationals of the country in which they apply for conditional entry.  The INS Director denied respondent's application on the ground that  203(a)(7) requires that ""physical presence in the United States [be] a consequence of an alien's flight in search of a refuge,"" and that such presence must be
""reasonably proximate to the flight, and not one following a flight remote in point of time or intervening residence in a third country reasonably constituting a termination of the original flight in search of refuge.""
Without deciding whether resettlement would have barred respondent's claim, the District Court reversed the INS determination, on the ground that respondent had never firmly resettled in Hong Kong.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis that the relevant factor was not the ""firmly resettled"" issue, but that, under  203(a)(7)(iii), respondent was a national of Communist China, from which he was a refugee, and not a national of Hong Kong.
Held:  Whether a refugee has already ""firmly resettled"" in another country is relevant to determining the availability to him of the asylum provision of  203(a)(7), since Congress did not intend to grant asylum to a refugee who 
Page 402 U. S. 50
 has found permanent shelter in another country, and the  203(a)(7)(iii) nationality requirement is no substitute for the ""resettlement"" concept.  Pp.  402 U. S. 52-58.

||"Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education
No. 281
Argued October 12, 1970
Decided April 20, 1971*
402 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
The Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system, which includes the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, had more than 84,000 students in 107 schools in the 1968-1969 school year.  Approximately 29% (24,000) of the pupils were Negro, about 14,000 of whom attended 21 schools that were at least 99% Negro.  This resulted from a desegregation plan approved by the District Court in 1965, at the commencement of this litigation.  In 1968, petitioner Swann moved for further relief based on Green v. County School Board, 391 U. S. 430, which required school boards to
""come forward with a plan that promises realistically to work . . . now . . . until it is clear that state-imposed segregation has been completely removed.""
The District Court ordered the school board in April 1969 to provide a plan for faculty and student desegregation.  Finding the board's submission unsatisfactory, the District Court appointed an expert to submit a desegregation plan. In February 1970, the expert and the board presented plans, and the court adopted the board's plan, as modified, for the junior and senior high schools, and the expert's proposed plan for the elementary schools.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order as to faculty desegregation and the secondary school plans, 
Page 402 U. S. 2
 but vacated the order respecting elementary schools, fearing that the provisions for pairing and grouping of elementary schools would unreasonably burden the pupils and the board.  The case was remanded to the District Court for reconsideration and submission of further plans.  This Court granted certiorari and directed reinstatement of the District Court's order pending further proceedings in that court.  On remand the District Court received two new plans, and ordered the board to adopt a plan, or the expert's plan would remain in effect.  After the board ""acquiesced"" in the expert's plan, the District Court directed that it remain in effect.
Held:
1. Today's objective is to eliminate from the public schools all vestiges of state-imposed segregation that was held violative of equal protection guarantees by Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, in 1954.  P.  402 U. S. 15.
2. In default by the school authorities of their affirmative obligation to proffer acceptable remedies, the district courts have broad power to fashion remedies that will assure unitary school systems.  P.  402 U. S. 16.
3. Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not restrict or withdraw from the federal courts their historic equitable remedial powers.  The proviso in 42 U.S.C.  2000c-6 was designed simply to foreclose any interpretation of the Act as expanding the existing powers of the federal courts to enforce the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  402 U. S. 16-18.
4. Policy and practice with regard to faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities are among the most important indicia of a segregated system, and the first remedial responsibility of school authorities is to eliminate invidious racial distinctions in those respects.  Normal administrative practice should then produce schools of like quality, facilities, and staffs. Pp.  402 U. S. 18-19.
5. The Constitution does not prohibit district courts from using their equity power to order assignment of teachers to achieve a particular degree of faculty desegregation.  United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education, 395 U. S. 225, was properly followed by the lower courts in this case.  Pp.  402 U. S. 19-20.
6. In devising remedies to eliminate legally imposed segregation, local authorities and district courts must see to it that future school construction and abandonment are not used and do not serve to perpetuate or reestablish a dual system.  Pp.  402 U. S. 20-21. 
Page 402 U. S. 3

7. Four problem areas exist on the issue of student assignment:
(1) Racial quotas. The constitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in the community must always reflect the racial composition of the system as a whole; here the District Court's very limited use of the racial ratio -- not as an inflexible requirement, but as a starting point in shaping a remedy -- was within its equitable discretion.  Pp.  402 U. S. 22-25.
(2) One-race schools.  While the existence of a small number of one-race, or virtually one-race, schools does not, in itself, denote a system that still practices segregation by law, the court should scrutinize such schools and require the school authorities to satisfy the court that the racial composition does not result from present or past discriminatory action on their part.  Pp.  402 U. S. 25-26.
An optional majority-to-minority transfer provision has long been recognized as a useful part of a desegregation plan, and to be effective such arrangement must provide the transferring student free transportation and available space in the school to which he desires to move.  Pp.  402 U. S. 26-27.
(3) Attendance zones.  The remedial altering of attendance zones is not, as an interim corrective measure, beyond the remedial powers of a district court.  A student assignment plan is not acceptable merely because it appears to be neutral, for such a plan may fail to counteract the continuing effects of past school segregation.  The pairing and grouping of noncontiguous zones is a permissible tool; judicial steps going beyond contiguous zones should be examined in light of the objectives to be sought.  No rigid rules can be laid down to govern conditions in different localities.  Pp.  402 U. S. 27-29.
(4) Transportation.  The District Court's conclusion that assignment of children to the school nearest their home serving their grade would not effectively dismantle the dual school system is supported by the record, and the remedial technique of requiring bus transportation as a tool of school desegregation was within that court's power to provide equitable relief.  An objection to transportation of students may have validity when the time or distance of travel is so great as to risk either the health of the children or significantly impinge on the educational process; limits on travel time will vary with many factors, but probably with none more than the age of the students.  Pp.  402 U. S. 29-31. 
Page 402 U. S. 4

8. Neither school authorities nor district courts are constitutionally required to make year-by-year adjustments of the racial composition of student bodies once a unitary system has been achieved.  Pp.  402 U. S. 31-32.
431 F.2d 138, affirmed as to those parts in which it affirmed the District Court's judgment.  The District Court's order of August 7, 1970, is also affirmed.
BURGER, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Syllabus 
East of the major highway that divides the metropolitan area of Mobile, Ala., live 94% of the area's Negro students, and the schools there are 65% Negro and 35% white.  West of the highway, the schools are 12% Negro and 88% white.  The Court of Appeals approved a desegregation plan which, like the District Court's plan, insofar as those areas were concerned, treated the western section as isolated from the eastern, with unified geographic zones and providing no transportation of students for desegregation purposes.  Though some reduction in the number of all-Negro schools was achieved for the 1970-1971 school year, nine elementary schools in the eastern section (attended by 64% of all Negro elementary school pupils in the metropolitan area) were over 90% Negro, and over half of the Negro junior and senior high school students went to all-Negro or nearly all-Negro schools.  With regard to the faculty and staff ratio in each of Mobile County's schools, the Court of Appeals directed the District Court to require the school board to establish ""substantially the same"" ratio as that, for the whole district.

Syllabus 
The Board of Education of Clarke County, Ga.

The state trial court denied an injunction.  The Georgia Supreme Court reversed, holding that the plan violated (1) equal protection because it ""[treated] students differently because of their race,"" and (2) the Civil Rights Act of 1964, because Title IV prohibits a school board from requiring busing to achieve a racial balance.

 2,606.84 ACRES OF LAND IN TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS, and Frank Corn, et al.v. UNITED STATES.No. 1316. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 19, 1971
 Rehearing Denied June 7, 1971. 
 See 403 U.S. 912. 
 On Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, whom Mr. Justice BLACK joins, dissenting. In 1945 Congress authorized the Benbrook Dam and Reservoir Project on the Clear Fork of the Trinity River near the southwest outskirts of Fort Worth, Texas. The authorization stated in part: 'The improvement of the Trinity River and tributaries, Texas, for navigation, flood control, and allied purposes is hereby approved and authorized in accordance with the reports contained in House Document Numbered 403, Seventy-seventh Congress.' 2, 59 Stat. 18. The project described in House Document 403 called for a gated spillway dam to be located on the Clear Fork at river mile 11.3. The storage capacity of the reservoir in acre feet of water was to be dead storage, 603; conservation storage, 30,603; and controlled (combined conservation and flood control) storage, 208,850. The elevation of the spillway crest was 672 feet and the top of the dam was 702 feet. Approximately 6,200 acres of land would have been required. Projected cost of the land was $483,600 and the entire project was estimated to cost about $5,205,502. The project that was subsequently built bears little resemblance to the one described in House Document 403. It is located 3.7 miles farther upstream at river mile 15. It is an uncontrolled spillway type. The notch crest of the spillway is 710 feet, and the main spillway crest is 724 feet. The top of the dam is 747 feet. The storage capacity in acre feet of water as stated by the Definite Project Report is dead storage, 17,750; conservation storage, 88,250; and controlled storage, 410,013. Over 13,000 
Page 402 U.S. 916 , 917
 acres of land were acquired at a cost of about $2,500,000; total project cost was well over $14,000,000. 
 This case arose when the United States filed a petition for condemnation of petitioner's land in federal district court. Some 1,207 acres were finally sought. Of this land some lies below the elevation of 697.1 feet (conservation pool elevation, the maximum water level of the pool below flood stage). That land below elevation 697.1 is not involved in the case here. But some 647 acres lie above that elevation. The Army Corps of Engineers took that land for recreation purposes. Petitioners claim that taking is not authorized by law. Petitioners have consistently contended that the land was taken for recreation purposes and that was not authorized under statutes authorizing the Benbrook Project and that the project, as built, was so radically and materially changed that it had to be resubmitted to Congress for a new authorization. 
 Shortly after the Government filed its condemnation suit, petitioners' predecessor, Richardson, instituted discovery proceedings. The Secretary of the Army refused to submit and the District Court abated the cause with bare legal title left in the Government and possession restored to petitioner pending the Government's obedience to the court's discovery orders. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed this action. United States v. Richardson, 204 F.2d 552 (1953). The Government later submitted to discovery and discovery showed, as General Sturgis, former Chief of the Corps, admitted to a congressional subcommittee, that 'it could have been very embarrassing to have justified his [the Secretary's] certification of the public need of all this particular taking.'1 
Page 402 U.S. 916 , 918
 As a result of a congressional investigation and discovery in this case certain facts about this case emerged. Petitioners allege that prior to 1953 the Corps had a 'field practice' of taking more property than was authorized in order to create land for purely recreational purposes. According to the District Court, 309 F.Supp. 887, almost simultaneously with the 1945 authorization the Corps in the present case began its plans for twice as much land as had been authorized with much of the excess for purely recreational purposes. Maps were prepared showing the locations of the recreational facilities. The final recreational plans for the project were in the form of Appendix VIII E to the Definite Project Report. In preliminary drafts certain proposed expenses were designated as 'for recreation,' but in final drafts they were credited to 'preparation of master plan.' Similarly the maps initially showed 'recreational areas,' but in final stages the label was changed to 'reservoir management.' In addition Appendix VIII E was stamped 'Not for Public Release.' According to the District Court, no other appendix was so classified. Id., at 896. 
 Justification for the excess land was necessary. The District Court found that to accomplish this, the Corps created the Great Storm and used its Great Storm as a basis for its spillway design on the dam as built. It is said that the storm will indeed be great, if it ever comes, dumping some 28.2 inches of rain in the area within a 60-hour period. The likelihood of this happening is said not to be high. Average annual rainfall in the area is 31.3 inches. The greatest storm ever recorded there dropped 12.57 inches in a 57-hour period. The District Court says the Great Storm was invented from a storm near Thrall, Texas in 1922. Thrall is 130 miles from the Gulf of Mexico and over 150 miles from the Benbrook Project. The Thrall storm dropped an uncertain amount of rain and reports of the amount increased as 
Page 402 U.S. 916 , 919
 the years passed. The District Court found that in all probability about 18-19 inches were dropped in a three-day period in Thrall. 
 But even with the Great Storm, recordbreaking though it would be, the District Court found that the Corps could not justify the height of the spillway necessary to obtain the land it wanted for recreational purposes. But one Great Storm deserves another and that, it is said, is what the Corps postulated. The Great Storm was assumed to come right after another big storm had dropped large amounts of rain in the area, thus preventing any opening of the dam gates. Furthermore none of the spillway design criteria made any allowance for the well-established reservoir management practice of lowering the level of water during potential flood months. And large floods have occurred only during three months of the year in the Fort Worth area. 
 The District Court found that the taking of the land for recreational purpose was lawless. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, concluding that recreational development was an 'allied purpose' within the meaning of the project authorization and also concluding the modifications were proper and needed no further authorization. 432 F.2d, at 1291. 
 From the Solicitor General's brief in opposition there is much we do not know about the Government position. There have been congressional inquiries into the Corps actions in taking more land than necessary for projects which it is building. Hearings on Army-Interior Reservoir Land Acquisition Policy before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. (1957); Report of the Subcommittee on Deficiencies and Army Civil Functions of the House Committee on Appropriations, Investigation of Corps of Engineers Civil Works Program, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 
Page 402 U.S. 916 , 920
 (Comm. Print 1951). The Solicitor General does not discuss the effect of these reports on this litigation. 
 Further, there is some relevant statutory material which the Solicitor General does not discuss or cite. Section 701b-8 of 33 U.S.C. states that '[n]o ... modification not authorized, of a project ... shall be authorized ... unless a report for such ... modification has been previously submitted by the Chief of Engineers ... in conformity with existing law.' Section 701m authorizes the Corps to make a dam smaller than originally planned, but does not authorize making a dam larger, as happened here. Section 701 requires reports for projects or modifications covering, inter alia, 'the extent and character of the area to be affected by the proposed improvement' and 'such other uses as may be properly related to or coordinated with the project.' 
 Finally we do not know to what use the land has been put. If there is no development yet, what are the current plans? The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq. (1964 ed., Supp. V), requires environmental impact statements for proposed projects. [Footnote 2] So far as we are advised, no such statement has been filed. 
 The questions raised are of such great public importance that I dissent from a denial of certiorari.

Syllabus 
Respondent brought this action to enjoin the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen (later merged into petitioner) from engaging in group legal activity for the stated purpose of assisting workers in filing damage suits under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA).  Respondent charged that the Union had recommended to its Michigan members selected Chicago attorneys whose fees would not exceed 25% of the amount recovered.  The Union's answer admitted, inter alia, that it had engaged in the practice of protecting its members against large fees and incompetent counsel and that Union members were reimbursed for transporting injured members to the legal counsel's offices.  On the basis of the pleadings and one witness' testimony that a large number of Michigan FELA claimants were represented by the Union's Chicago counsel, the trial court issued an injunction.  While that decision was on appeal, this Court decided Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1, and the Michigan Supreme Court thereafter remanded the case to the trial court for further consideration.  Following respondent's motion for judgment, that court, adopting the decree entered against the Union in Trainmen after this Court's remand, enjoined the Union from ""giving or furnishing legal advice to its members or their families""; furnishing attorneys the names of injured members or information relating to their injuries; accepting compensation for the solicitation of legal employment for any lawyer; and from controlling the lawyer's fees.  The Michigan Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The injunction issued against the Union in this case violated its right under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to engage in group activity to enable its members to meet the costs of legal representation and otherwise to secure meaningful access to the courts, Trainmen, supra; United Mine Worker v.

Syllabus 
In Haynes v. United States, 390 U. S. 85, the Court held invalid under the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment provisions of the National Firearms Act, which constituted parts of an interrelated statutory scheme for taxing certain classes of firearms primarily used for unlawful purposes, and made the potentially incriminating information available to state and other officials.  To eliminate the defects revealed by Haynes, Congress amended the Act so that only a possessor who lawfully makes, manufactures, or imports firearms can and must register them.  The transferor must identify himself, describe the firearm, and give the name and address of the transferee, whose application must be supported by fingerprints and a photograph and a law enforcement official's certificate identifying them as those of the transferee and stating that the weapon is intended for lawful uses.  Only after the transferor's receipt of the approved application form may the firearm transfer be legally made.  A transferee does not and cannot register, though possession of an unregistered firearm is illegal.  No information or evidence furnished under the Act can be used as evidence against a registrant or applicant
""in a criminal proceeding with respect to a violation of law occurring prior to or concurrently with the filing of the application or registration, or the compiling of the records containing the information or evidence,""
and no information filed is, as a matter of administration, disclosed to other federal, local, or state agencies.  Appellees, who had been indicted under the amended Act for possessing and conspiring to possess unregistered hand grenades, filed motions to dismiss, which the District Court granted on the ground that the amended Act, like its predecessor, compels self-incrimination and that the indictment contravenes due process requirements by failing to allege scienter.  Appellees also contend that the provisions relating to fingerprints and photographs will cause future incrimination.
Held:
1. The revised statutory scheme of the amended Act, which significantly alters the scheme presented in Haynes, does not involve any violation of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  401 U. S. 605-607. 
Page 401 U. S. 602

2. The amended Act fully protects a person against incrimination for past or present violations, and creates no substantial hazards of future incrimination.  P.  401 U. S. 606.
3. The amended Act's prohibition against a person's ""receiv[ing] or possess[ing] a firearm which is not registered to him,"" requires no specific intent, and the absence of such a requirement in this essentially regulatory statute in the area of public safety does not violate due process requirements either as respects the substantive count or the conspiracy count.  Pp.  401 U. S. 607-610.
Reversed.

Syllabus 
Petitioners in No. 61, an association of open-end investment companies and several individual such companies, attack (1) portions of the Comptroller of the Currency's Regulation 9, purporting to authorize banks to operate collective investment funds, as violative of the Glass-Steagall Banking Act of 1933 and (2) the Comptroller's approval given First National City Bank to operate a collective investment fund.  Petitioner in No. 59 seeks review of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) order exempting that fund from certain provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The District Court concluded in No. 61 that the challenged provisions of Regulation 9 were invalid.  The Court of Appeals, after consolidating the cases, held that the Comptroller's and the SEC's actions were consonant with the relevant statutes, and affirmed the SEC's order and reversed the District Court.

No. 81
Argued October 21, 1970
Decided April 5, 1971*
401 U.S. 646

Syllabus 
In No. 81, here on direct review, petitioner was convicted of selling narcotics after a trial in which heroin seized in a search incident to his arrest was introduced into evidence.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the intervening decision in Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752, narrowing the scope of permissible searches incident to arrest, was not to be retroactively applied to searches antedating the date it was decided, and that the search was valid under pre-Chimel law.  Evidence at the trial of petitioner in No. 82 included marked bills seized during a pre-Chimel search of his apartment following his arrest on narcotics charges.  The arrest and search were upheld at trial, on direct appeal, and in the District Court and Court of Appeals in proceedings under 28 U.S.C.  2255.
Held:  The judgments are affirmed.  Pp.  401 U. S. 649-666,  401 U. S. 699-700.
No. 81, 418 F.2d 159, and No. 82, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that Chimel, supra, is not retroactive, and should not be applied to searches conducted prior to the date of that decision.  Pp.  401 U. S. 649-659.
(a) Where the major purpose of a new constitutional standard is not to overcome an aspect of a criminal trial that substantially impairs the truthfinding function and thus raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule does not require retrospective application.  P.  401 U. S. 653.
(b) The Constitution does not require that pre-Chimel searches be measured by the new Chimel standards, Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244.  Petitioners' rights under then-existing law were not violated either before or during trial, it is not claimed that the evidence was constitutionally insufficient to prove guilt, and the purpose of the exclusionary rule will be sufficiently implemented by applying Chimel to searches occurring after the date of decision in that case.  P.  401 U. S. 656. 
Page 401 U. S. 647

(c) There is no constitutional difference between the applicability of Chimel to convictions here on direct appeal and those involving collateral proceedings, or between federal and state prisoners.  Pp.  401 U. S. 656-659.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concluded that the question is not whether every person convicted through evidence obtained contrary to Chimel, supra, is guilty, but rather whether Chimel compels the conclusion that the invasion of petitioners' privacy, conducted in justifiable but mistaken reliance upon the continuing validity of pre-Chimel standards, requires the exclusion of the fruits of that invasion from the factfinding process.  He agreed with the plurality opinion that it does not, and that the Chimel rule should not be applied retroactively.  Pp.  401 U. S. 660-665.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurred in the result on the ground that Chimel, supra, was wrongly decided.  P.  401 U. S. 660.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN concluded that the judgment should be affirmed in No. 82, here on collateral review, as the search in that case should not be subjected to the requirements of Chimel, supra, since petitioner's conviction became final prior to Chimel, then-prevailing law validated the search, and the conviction was obtained by methods not fundamentally unfair.  Pp.  401 U. S. 699-700.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL concluded that the judgment in No. 82 should be affirmed, as the mode of analysis in the plurality opinion is appropriate in cases here on collateral review, and the Chimel rule should not be applied retroactively in such cases.  Pp.  401 U. S. 665-666.

Syllabus 
At petitioner's trial for income tax evasion, the Government used monthly wagering tax forms petitioner had filed, as required by statute, to show that the gross amount of wagers he reported, less business expenses, exceeded the gambling profits reported on his income tax returns.  Petitioner objected on the ground that the forms were prejudicial and irrelevant, but he was convicted in 1964, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  After this Court's 1968 decisions in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S. 39, and Grosso v. United States, 390 U. S. 62, petitioner applied for post-conviction relief on the ground that the Fifth Amendment barred the prosecution's use of the wagering tax forms.  The District Court denied the application.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that Marchetti and Grosso would not be applied retroactively to overturn the earlier income tax evasion conviction based on the then-applicable constitutional principles.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  401 U. S. 671-675,  401 U. S. 700-701,  401 U. S. 703-713.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR.

Syllabus 
The United States brought this action for the forfeiture of money in the possession of one Angelini when he was arrested for failing to register as a gambler and to pay the gambling tax required by 26 U.S.C.  4411, 4412, and 4901.  Having found that the money had been used in violation of those laws, the District Court ordered forfeiture under 26 U.S.C.  7302.  After the Court of Appeals affirmed, the case was remanded for further consideration in the light of this Court's subsequent decisions in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S. 39, and Grosso v. United States, 390 U. S. 62, which held that gamblers had the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent despite the statutory requirement that they submit reports that could incriminate them.  The Court of Appeals thereafter ordered the money's return, having concluded that Angelini could assert his Fifth Amendment privilege.  The Government contends that (1) the Marchetti-Grosso rationale is inapplicable to  7302 forfeiture proceedings because, under that provision, ""any property intended for use in violating the . . . internal revenue laws"" is subject to forfeiture regardless of the property owner's guilt, and (2) Marchetti and Grosso should not be given retroactive effect.
Held:
1. The Fifth Amendment privilege may properly be invoked in this case, since the forfeiture statutes, when viewed in their entirety, are intended to penalize only persons significantly involved in a criminal enterprise.  Pp.  401 U. S. 717-722.

No. 5
Argued February 25-26, 1969

Decided April 5, 1971
401 U.S. 715

Syllabus 
The United States brought this action for the forfeiture of money in the possession of one Angelini when he was arrested for failing to register as a gambler and to pay the gambling tax required by 26 U.S.C.  4411, 4412, and 4901.  Having found that the money had been used in violation of those laws, the District Court ordered forfeiture under 26 U.S.C.  7302.  After the Court of Appeals affirmed, the case was remanded for further consideration in the light of this Court's subsequent decisions in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S. 39, and Grosso v. United States, 390 U. S. 62, which held that gamblers had the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent despite the statutory requirement that they submit reports that could incriminate them.  The Court of Appeals thereafter ordered the money's return, having concluded that Angelini could assert his Fifth Amendment privilege.  The Government contends that (1) the Marchetti-Grosso rationale is inapplicable to  7302 forfeiture proceedings because, under that provision, ""any property intended for use in violating the . . . internal revenue laws"" is subject to forfeiture regardless of the property owner's guilt, and (2) Marchetti and Grosso should not be given retroactive effect.
Held:
1. The Fifth Amendment privilege may properly be invoked in this case, since the forfeiture statutes, when viewed in their entirety, are intended to penalize only persons significantly involved in a criminal enterprise.  Pp.  401 U. S. 717-722.
2. The Marchetti-Grosso rule has retroactive effect in a forfeiture proceeding under  7302.  Pp.  401 U. S. 722-724.

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted in 1966 of narcotics violations following a trial where evidence was admitted of certain incriminating statements of respondent that were overheard by warrantless electronic eavesdropping by Government agents by means of a transmitter which an informer consented to wear during his meetings with respondent.  The informer could not be located at trial, and the trial court overruled objections to the testimony of the agents who conducted the electronic surveillance.  Reading Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967), as overruling On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747 (1952), the Court of Appeals held that the agents' testimony was impermissible under the Fourth Amendment, and reversed respondent's conviction.

405 F.2d 838, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that:
1. The Government's use of agents who themselves may reveal the contents of conversations with an accused does not violate the Fourth Amendment, and this Court's decision in Katz v. United States, supra, does not disturb the rationale of On Lee, supra, in this respect, and require a different result because the agent uses electronic equipment to transmit the conversations to other agents.  Pp.  401 U. S. 748-754.
2. The unavailability of the informant as a witness does not create any Fourth Amendment issue.  Pp.  401 U. S. 753-754.
3. Since the decision in Katz v. United States, supra, was not retroactive, Desist v. United States, 394 U.

401 U.S. 797

Syllabus 
Two men, who were driving petitioner Hill's car, were arrested for narcotics possession.  A search of the car disclosed property stolen in a robbery the previous day.  Both men admitted taking part in the robbery, and implicated Hill, who shared an apartment with one of them.  The guns used in the robbery and other stolen property were reported to be in the apartment.  An investigating officer checked official records on Hill, verifying his association with one of the informants, his description, address, and make of car.  The police, with probable cause to arrest Hill, but without a search or arrest warrant, went to his apartment, and there found a man matching Hill's description.  The arrestee denied that he was Hill (and, in fact, he was not), and denied knowledge of any guns in the apartment, but the police, who spotted a gun and ammunition in plain view, arrested the man, searched the apartment, and seized guns, stolen property, other evidentiary items, and two pages of Hill's diary.  Hill was convicted of robbery, substantially on the basis of items seized in the search.  The trial judge ruled that the police acted in good faith in believing the arrestee was Hill.  The District Court of Appeal agreed that the officers acted in good faith and that the arrest was valid, but thought the search unreasonable.  The California Supreme Court reversed, sustaining both the arrest and the search.  Hill argues that Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752, narrowing the permissible scope of searches incident to arrest, decided after the affirmance of his conviction by the state courts, should be applied to his case in this Court on direct review.
Held:
1. Chimel, supra, is inapplicable to searches antedating that decision, regardless of whether the case is on direct or collateral review or involves state or federal prisoners.  Williams v. United States, ante, p.  401 U. S. 646.  P.  401 U. S. 802.
2. The arrest and search were valid under the Fourth Amendment, since the police had probable cause to arrest Hill and reasonably believed the arrestee was Hill.  Accordingly, they were entitled to do what the law allowed them to do had the arrestee, in fact, been Hill, that is, to search incident to arrest and to seize evidence

Syllabus 
Petitioners conducted a lottery operation in Florida, near the Georgia border.  They were convicted along with two Georgia residents who placed bets at petitioners' establishment, of violating 18 U.S.C.  1952, the Travel Act, which prohibits interstate travel with the intent to ""promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate"" certain illegal activity.  The District Court instructed the jury that, if the Georgia bettors traveled to Florida for the purpose of gambling, they violated the Act, and that a defendant could be found guilty under the aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C.  2, without proof that he had personally performed every act constituting the charged offense.  The Court of Appeals reversed the convictions of the Georgia bettors, holding that  1952 did not make it a federal crime merely to cross a state line to place a bet, but upheld petitioners' convictions on the ground that gambling establishment operators are responsible for the interstate travel of their customers.
Held:  Conducting a gambling operation frequented by out-of-state bettors does not, without more, constitute a violation of the Travel Act.  Pp.  401 U. S. 811-814.

Syllabus 
Ezra Vincent died intestate, survived by only collateral relations and an illegitimate daughter, whose guardian (appellant) sued to have her declared Vincent's sole heir.  The trial court ruled that, under Louisiana law, the collateral relations took the decedent's property to the exclusion of the daughter, who had been acknowledged by her father but not legitimated.  The Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed.  The State Supreme Court denied certiorari.  Appellant, relying on Levy v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 68, contends that Louisiana's intestate succession laws that bar an illegitimate child from sharing equally with legitimate children in the father's estate constitute an invidious discrimination violative of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution.
Held:  The Louisiana statutory intestate succession scheme is within the State's power to establish rules for the protection and strengthening of family life and for the disposition of property, and, in view of various statutory alternatives, none of which was chosen by Vincent, did not (unlike the situation in Levy) constitute an insurmountable barrier to illegitimate children.

Argued January 19, 1971
Decided March 29, 1971
401 U.S. 532

Syllabus 
Ezra Vincent died intestate, survived by only collateral relations and an illegitimate daughter, whose guardian (appellant) sued to have her declared Vincent's sole heir.  The trial court ruled that, under Louisiana law, the collateral relations took the decedent's property to the exclusion of the daughter, who had been acknowledged by her father but not legitimated.  The Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed.  The State Supreme Court denied certiorari.  Appellant, relying on Levy v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 68, contends that Louisiana's intestate succession laws that bar an illegitimate child from sharing equally with legitimate children in the father's estate constitute an invidious discrimination violative of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution.
Held:  The Louisiana statutory intestate succession scheme is within the State's power to establish rules for the protection and strengthening of family life and for the disposition of property, and, in view of various statutory alternatives, none of which was chosen by Vincent, did not (unlike the situation in Levy) constitute an insurmountable barrier to illegitimate children.  Pp.  401 U. S. 535-540.
255 La. 480, 231 So.2d 395, affirmed.  See: 229 So.2d 449.

No. 136
Argued January 13, 1971
Decided March 29, 1971
401 U.S. 560

Syllabus 
A sheriff, acting on a tip, made a complaint before a magistrate charging that petitioner and another individual on the date and at the place named ""did then and there unlawfully break and enter into [the described] locked . . . building,"" and a warrant was issued.  A police radio bulletin named and described the two persons, the type of car they were probably driving, and the amount and type of money taken.  Relying on the bulletin, an officer in another county made a warrantless arrest of the suspects.  The car was then searched and various incriminating items removed, which were later used at petitioner's trial, which resulted in his conviction.  Petitioner filed a habeas corpus petition reiterating the challenge he had made at his arraignment and trial to the constitutionality of the use of evidence seized during a search incident to the assertedly illegal arrest.  The District Court denied the petition, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Petitioner's arrest violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and the evidence secured incident thereto should have been excluded from his trial.  Pp.  401 U. S. 564-569.
(a) The complaint, which did not mention that the sheriff acted on an informer's tip, and which consisted of no more than the sheriff's conclusion that the individuals named committed the offense, could not support the independent judgment of a disinterested magistrate.  P.  401 U. S. 565.
(b) The standards applicable to the factual basis for an arresting officer's probable cause assessment are no less strict than those applicable to the magistrate's assessment.  Here, the arresting officer had no information to corroborate the report that the suspects had committed the crime and the fact that the warrantless arrest was based on a police radio bulletin cannot supply the element of probable cause that the officer who issued the bulletin lacked.  Pp.  401 U. S. 565-567.
2. Since, notwithstanding petitioner's constitutional challenge at each stage, respondent made no attempt to show that the magistrate had more information than was presented in the complaint, 
Page 401 U. S. 561
 he may not attempt to do so now on remand; and the writ must issue unless the State appropriately arranges to retry the petitioner.  P.  401 U. S. 569.

In this criminal prosecution counsel for the defense asked if the Government had obtained any evidence by means of listening devices or electronic eavesdropping.

The Court of Appeals agreed that the statement of the prosecutor was 'not unequivocal' and that the disclosure should have been made to the trial judge. Yet it affirmed the conviction without further inquiry.

401 U.S. 513

Syllabus 
The debtor corporation, kept in possession of its business by court order under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, did not comply with requirements that it deposit withheld taxes in a special tax account.  It was later adjudicated a bankrupt, and the United States asked the bankruptcy court to pay the amount of withheld taxes prior to payment of costs and expenses of the bankruptcy proceedings, pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  7501(a), which provides that the amount of withheld taxes ""shall be held to be a special fund in trust for the United States.""  The referee denied the request, and the District Court and the Court of Appeals agreed.
Held:  Section 64(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, which is an overriding statement of federal policy on the question of priorities, clearly provides that the first priority in payments from bankrupt estates belongs to the costs and expenses of administration incurred in the bankruptcy proceedings.

No. 87
Argued March 2, 1971
Decided March 24, 1971
401 U.S. 520

Syllabus 
This case arises from the attempted joinder pursuant to 43 U.S.C.  666 of the United States as a defendant in a proceeding in state court for the adjudication of water rights covering the Eagle River system in Colorado.  Under  666(a),
""[c]onsent is given to join the United States as a defendant in any suit (1) for the adjudication of rights to the use of water of a river system or other source, or (2) for the administration of such rights, where it appears that the United States [owns] or is in the process of acquiring water rights by appropriation under State law, by purchase, by exchange, or otherwise. . . .""
The United States contended that  666 applies only to water rights that it had acquired under state law, and does not constitute consent to have adjudicated in a state court the Government's reserved water rights arising from withdrawals of land from the public domain.  Its objection was overruled by the trial court, and the Colorado Supreme Court denied the Government's motion for a writ of prohibition.
Held:  Section 666(a) is an all-inclusive statutory provision that subjects to general adjudication in state proceedings all rights of the United States to water within a particular State's jurisdiction regardless of how they were acquired.  Any conflict between adjudicated rights and reserved rights of the United States, if preserved in the state proceeding, can ultimately be reviewed in this Court. Pp. 522-526.

Syllabus 
In this companion case to U.S. v. District Court for Eagle County, ante, p.  401 U. S. 520, the United States had been served with notice pursuant to 43 U.S.C.  666 of a proceeding in state court for the adjudication of water rights affecting areas of the State in the drainage basins of the Colorado River system.  In addition to its claim that  666 does not apply to state court suits against the Government for adjudication of its reserved water rights, the Government contended that the state statutory proceedings involved in this case, which contemplated monthly proceedings before a water referee on water rights applications filed within a particular month, do not constitute general adjudications of water rights under  666 because all the water users and all water rights on a stream system are not implicated in the referee's determinations.  The Government's contentions were rejected by the state courts.
Held:
1. The state court has jurisdiction to adjudicate the reserved water rights of the United States.  Eagle County, supra.  P.  401 U. S. 529.
2. The state statutory proceedings are within the scope of  666, and reach all claims in their totality, although the adjudication is made on a monthly basis.  Pp.  401 U. S. 529-530.

No. 124
Argued December 14, 1970
Decided March 8, 1971
401 U.S. 424

Syllabus 
Negro employees at respondent's generating plant brought this action, pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, challenging respondent's requirement of a high school diploma or passing of intelligence tests as a condition of employment in or transfer to jobs at the plant.  These requirements were not directed at or intended to measure ability to learn to perform a particular job or category of jobs.  While  703(a) of the Act makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to limit, segregate, or classify employees to deprive them of employment opportunities or adversely to affect their status because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,  703(h) authorizes the use of any professionally developed ability test, provided that it is not designed, intended, or used to discriminate.  The District Court found that respondent's former policy of racial discrimination had ended, and that Title VII, being prospective only, did not reach the prior inequities.  The Court of Appeals reversed in part, rejecting the holding that residual discrimination arising from prior practices was insulated from remedial action, but agreed with the lower court that there was no showing of discriminatory purpose in the adoption of the diploma and test requirements.  It held that, absent such discriminatory purpose, use of the requirements was permitted, and rejected the claim that, because a disproportionate number of Negroes was rendered ineligible for promotion, transfer, or employment, the requirements were unlawful unless shown to be job-related.
Held:
1. The Act requires the elimination of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment that operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of race, and if, as here, an employment practice that operates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, it is prohibited, notwithstanding the employer's lack of discriminatory intent.  Pp.  401 U. S. 429-433.
2. The Act does not preclude the use of testing or measuring procedures, but it does proscribe giving them controlling force unless

 they are demonstrably a reasonable measure of job performance.  Pp.  401 U. S. 433-436.

Syllabus 
Petitioner in No. 85, who was convicted for failure to report for induction, and petitioner in No. 325, who sought discharge from the armed forces upon receipt of orders for Vietnam duty, claim exemption from military service because of their conscientious objection to participation in the Vietnam conflict, as an ""unjust"" war, pursuant to  6(j) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967.  That section provides that no person shall be subject to
""service in the armed forces of the United States who, by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form.""
Petitioners also challenge the constitutionality of  6(j) as construed to cover only objectors to all war, as violative of the Free Exercise and Establishment of Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.
Held:
1. The exemption for those who oppose ""participation in war in any form"" applies to those who oppose participating in all war and not to those who object to participation in a particular war only, even if the latter objection is religious in character.  Pp.  401 U. S. 441-448.
2. Section 6(j) does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  Pp.  401 U. S. 448-460.
(a) The section on its face does not discriminate on the basis of religious affiliation or belief, and petitioners have not shown the absence of neutral, secular bases for the exemption.  Pp.  401 U. S. 450-453.
(b) The exemption provision focuses on individual conscientious belief and not on sectarian affiliations.  P.  401 U. S. 454.
(c) There are valid neutral reasons, with the central emphasis on the maintenance of fairness in the administration of military conscription, for the congressional limitation of the exemption to ""war in any form,"" and therefore  6(j) cannot be said to reflect a religious preference.

Syllabus 
Appellees brought this suit in federal court challenging Florida's Millage Rollback Law as violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment on the ground that it had an invidiously discriminatory effect in its distribution of taxing authority for educational purposes by a standard related solely to a county's wealth.  Appellants contended that the statute was only part of a total plan more nearly to equalize school children's educational opportunities on a state-wide basis.  A three-judge District Court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment on the basis of the pleadings and appellees' affidavit, having rejected appellants' argument that the District Court should abstain from considering the case because of an intervening state court proceeding attacking the law on state constitutional grounds.
Held:
1. The District Court mistakenly relied upon Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, and McNeese v. Board of Education, 373 U. S. 668, in refusing to abstain from deciding the case on the merits pending resolution by the state courts of state constitutional claims, the sustainment of which would obviate the need for determining the Fourteenth Amendment issue.  Reetz v. Bozanich, 397 U. S. 82, is an example of the line of decisions that should inform the discretion of the District Court in determining whether to abstain.
2. Since the manner in which Florida's overall program operates may be critical in resolving the equal protection claim, that claim should be decided not by summary judgment, but after a full hearing.

 Lucien Candy MASSEYv. State of GEORGIA.No. 6346. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October Term, 1970. 
 March 8, 1971
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN concurs, dissenting. Prior to petitioner's trial for armed robbery, the trial judge appointed a psychiatrist at petitioner's request to conduct an examination into petitioner's competency to stand trial. He apparently was found competent. At trial the State produced evidence of the robbery and an exchange of gunfire. A number of witnesses identified petitioner as the gunman. Petitioner's defense was that he had taken some pills and had drunk some alcohol prior to the robbery and remembered nothing from the time he took the pills until the time he awoke in the station house. In rebuttal the State called the examining psychiatrist who testified that petitioner had told him a very logical and complete story of what had happened during the afternoon of the robbery. The defense moved to strike the testimony on the grounds that the psychiatrist-patient privilege accorded by Georgia law* barred the testimony. The trial judge denied the motion and the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed stating: 
 * Ga.Code Ann. 38-418: 'There are certain admissions and communications excluded from considerations of public policy. 
Page 401 U.S. 964 , 965
 his examination of the defendant.'
 This case does not present any issues relating to the question of the quantum of psychiatric aid necessary to determine competency to stand trial. Cf. Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375; Bishop v. United States, 350 U.S. 961. The issue presented is whether in keeping with the Equal Protection Clause a State can limit the psychiatristpatient privilege to situations where the psychiatrist is not court-appointed. 
 If every court-appointed psychiatrist is only an agent of the State, not a confidant and adviser of the accused, then the potential of using him to deprive the accused of his constitutional rights is great, as evident from Leyra v. Denno, 347 U.S. 556. In that case a state psychiatrist did what police could not do-'an already physically and emotionally exhausted suspect's ability to resist interrogation was broken to almost trance-like submission by use of the arts of a highly skilled psychiatrist.' Id., at 561, 74 S.Ct. at 719. 
 Would not abolishing the attorney-client privilege for indigents who had court-appointed counsel violate both the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments? Compare Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 9 L. Ed.2d 799 with Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353d 811. If so, why is the psychiatrist-patient privilege different? Can the psychiatrist-patient privilege be constitutionally limited to those with a money relationship? Does 'the kind of trial a man gets depend on the amount of money he has'? Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 19. 
 Had petitioner been able to hire his own psychiatrist, his trial chances would not have been as abruptly crushed on rebuttal as they were here. In this posture this case is much stronger than the transcript cases ( Griffin; Williams v. Oklahoma City, 395 U.S. 458d 440; Roberts v. [401 U.S. 964 , 966]

 Lucien Candy MASSEYv. State of GEORGIA.No. 6346. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October Term, 1970. 
 March 8, 1971
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN concurs, dissenting. Prior to petitioner's trial for armed robbery, the trial judge appointed a psychiatrist at petitioner's request to conduct an examination into petitioner's competency to stand trial. He apparently was found competent. At trial the State produced evidence of the robbery and an exchange of gunfire. A number of witnesses identified petitioner as the gunman. Petitioner's defense was that he had taken some pills and had drunk some alcohol prior to the robbery and remembered nothing from the time he took the pills until the time he awoke in the station house. In rebuttal the State called the examining psychiatrist who testified that petitioner had told him a very logical and complete story of what had happened during the afternoon of the robbery. The defense moved to strike the testimony on the grounds that the psychiatrist-patient privilege accorded by Georgia law* barred the testimony. The trial judge denied the motion and the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed stating: 
 * Ga.Code Ann. 38-418: 'There are certain admissions and communications excluded from considerations of public policy. 
Page 401 U.S. 964 , 965
 his examination of the defendant.'
 This case does not present any issues relating to the question of the quantum of psychiatric aid necessary to determine competency to stand trial. Cf. Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375; Bishop v. United States, 350 U.S. 961. The issue presented is whether in keeping with the Equal Protection Clause a State can limit the psychiatristpatient privilege to situations where the psychiatrist is not court-appointed. 
 If every court-appointed psychiatrist is only an agent of the State, not a confidant and adviser of the accused, then the potential of using him to deprive the accused of his constitutional rights is great, as evident from Leyra v. Denno, 347 U.S. 556. In that case a state psychiatrist did what police could not do-'an already physically and emotionally exhausted suspect's ability to resist interrogation was broken to almost trance-like submission by use of the arts of a highly skilled psychiatrist.' Id., at 561, 74 S.Ct. at 719. 
 Would not abolishing the attorney-client privilege for indigents who had court-appointed counsel violate both the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments? Compare Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 9 L. Ed.2d 799 with Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353d 811. If so, why is the psychiatrist-patient privilege different? Can the psychiatrist-patient privilege be constitutionally limited to those with a money relationship? Does 'the kind of trial a man gets depend on the amount of money he has'? Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 19. 
 Had petitioner been able to hire his own psychiatrist, his trial chances would not have been as abruptly crushed on rebuttal as they were here. In this posture this case is much stronger than the transcript cases ( Griffin; Williams v. Oklahoma City, 395 U.S. 458d 440; Roberts v. [401 U.S. 964 , 966]

Petitioner, an indigent, was convicted of traffic offenses and fined a total of $425.  Though Texas law provides only for fines for such offenses, it requires that persons unable to pay must be incarcerated for sufficient time to satisfy their fines, at the rate of $5 per day, which, in petitioner's case, meant an 85-day term.

No. 1066
Argued January 11, 1971
Decided March 2, 1971
401 U.S. 402

Syllabus 
Under  4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 and  138 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, the Secretary of Transportation may not authorize use of federal funds to finance construction of highways through public parks if a ""feasible and prudent"" alternative route exists.  If no such route is available, he may approve construction only if there has been ""all possible planning to minimize harm"" to the park.  Petitioners contend that the Secretary has violated these statutes by authorizing a six-lane interstate highway through a Memphis public park.  In April, 1968, the Secretary announced that he agreed with the local officials that the highway go through the park; in September, 1969, the State acquired the right-of-way inside the park; and in November, 1969, the Secretary announced final approval, including the design, of the road.  Neither announcement of the Secretary was accompanied by factual findings.  Respondents introduced affidavits in the District Court, indicating that the Secretary had made the decision and that it was supportable.  Petitioners filed counter affidavits and sought to take the deposition of a former federal highway administrator.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals found that formal findings were not required, and refused to order the deposition of the former administrator.  Both courts held that the affidavits afforded no basis for determining that the Secretary exceeded his authority.
Held:
1. The Secretary's action is subject to judicial review pursuant to  701 of the Administrative Procedure Act.  Pp.  401 U. S. 413.
(a) There is no indication here that Congress sought to limit or prohibit judicial review.  P.  401 U. S. 410.
(b) The exemption for action ""committed to agency discretion"" does not apply, as the Secretary does have ""law to apply,"" rather than wide-ranging discretion.  Pp.  401 U. S. 410-413.
2. Although, under  706 of the Act, de novo review is not required here, and the Secretary's approval of the route need not 
Page 401 U. S. 403
 meet the substantial evidence test, the reviewing court must conduct a substantial inquiry and determine whether the Secretary acted within the scope of his authority, whether his decision was within the small range of available choices, and whether he could have reasonably believed that there were no feasible alternatives.  The court must find that the actual choice was not ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,"" and that the Secretary followed the necessary procedural requirements.  Pp.  401 U. S. 413-416.
3. Formal findings by the Secretary are not required in this case.  Pp.  401 U. S. 417-419.
(a) The relevant statutes do not require formal findings, and there is no ambiguity in the Secretary's action.  P.  401 U. S. 417.
(b) Although a regulation requiring formal findings was issued after the Secretary had approved the route, a remand to him is not necessary, as there is an administrative record facilitating full and prompt review of the Secretary's action.  Pp.  401 U. S. 417-419.
4. The case is remanded to the District Court for plenary review of the Secretary's decision.  Pp.  401 U. S. 419-420.
(a) The lower courts' review was based on litigation affidavits, which are not the whole record, and are an inadequate basis for review.  P.  401 U. S. 419.
(b) In view of the lack of formal findings, the court may require the administrative officials who participated in the decision to give testimony explaining their action or require the Secretary to make formal findings.  P.  401 U. S. 420.

Syllabus 
Appellee, who claimed conscientious objector status, was refused representation by his attorney at the time of his personal appearance before his draft board on the basis of a Selective Service regulation prohibiting such representation.  Subsequently indicted for refusing to submit to induction, appellee filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the denial of counsel had deprived him of due process.  The District Court granted appellee's motion on the ground that the regulation was not authorized by the Military Selective Service Act of 1967.  The United States filed a notice of appeal to this Court, but, after reconsidering and concluding that this Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain its direct appeal from the District Court's order, the United States moved for a remand to the Court of Appeals.  Appellee contends that the ""construction of the statute"" dismissal provision or the ""motion in bar"" provision of the Criminal Appeals Act gives this Court jurisdiction of the appeal.
Held:

			"|"United States v. Weller
No. 77
Argued December 10, 1970
Decided February 24, 1971
401 U.S. 254

Syllabus 
Appellee, who claimed conscientious objector status, was refused representation by his attorney at the time of his personal appearance before his draft board on the basis of a Selective Service regulation prohibiting such representation.  Subsequently indicted for refusing to submit to induction, appellee filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the denial of counsel had deprived him of due process.  The District Court granted appellee's motion on the ground that the regulation was not authorized by the Military Selective Service Act of 1967.  The United States filed a notice of appeal to this Court, but, after reconsidering and concluding that this Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain its direct appeal from the District Court's order, the United States moved for a remand to the Court of Appeals.  Appellee contends that the ""construction of the statute"" dismissal provision or the ""motion in bar"" provision of the Criminal Appeals Act gives this Court jurisdiction of the appeal.
Held:
1. This Court has no jurisdiction of the appeal under the ""construction of the statute"" provision, since the interrelation of the regulation and the statute fell short of that required for the dismissal to have been based upon the construction of the statute.

No. 62
Argued December 17, 1970
Decided February 24, 1971
401 U.S. 265

Syllabus 
Just before the 1960 New Hampshire Democratic primary election, petitioner newspaper published a column characterizing senatorial candidate Roy as a ""former small-time bootlegger.""  Roy, who was not elected, sued the newspaper and the distributor of the column for libel.  The judge told the jury that Roy, as a candidate, was a ""public official,"" and that a rule requiring a showing that the article was false and had been published ""with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or true,"" applied as long as the libel concerned ""official,"" as opposed to ""private,"" conduct.  The jury was instructed that, if it found the libel to be in the ""public sector,"" it had to bring in a verdict for the distributor, as there was no evidence that it had engaged in knowing or reckless falsehood, but that it had to decide on the ""preponderance of the evidence"" whether the newspaper was liable.  If the publication was in the ""private sector,"" there were two defenses:  (1) ""justification,"" if the article was true and published on a ""lawful occasion,"" and (2) ""conditional privilege,"" if the article was false, but if the publication was
""on a lawful occasion, in good faith, for a justifiable purpose, and with a belief founded on reasonable grounds of the truth of the matter published.""
The jury returned a verdict against both the newspaper and the distributor of the column.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the jury properly considered whether the alleged libel was ""relevant"" to Roy's fitness for office.
Held:
1. Publications concerning candidates for public office must be accorded at least as much protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments as those concerning occupants of public office.  Pp.  401 U. S. 270-272.
2. As a matter of constitutional law, a charge of criminal conduct, no matter how remote in time or place, can never be irrelevant to an official's or a candidate's fitness for purposes of applying the ""knowing falsehood or reckless disregard"" rule of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254.  Pp.  401 U. S. 272-277.

Argued December 16, 1970
Decided February 24, 1971
401 U.S. 279

Syllabus 
In a discussion of ""police brutality and related private violence"" in its 1961 Report, the Civil Rights Commission mentioned the case of Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, and listed some of the allegations of Monroe's civil rights complaint filed against certain Chicago policemen headed by Deputy Chief of Detectives Pape.  In an article about the Report, Time magazine quoted from a summary of the complaint, without indicating that the charges were Monroe's, and not the independent findings of the Commission.  Pape sued the petitioner publisher for libel.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's grant of Time's motion for summary judgment, holding that there had to be a trial on the question of whether Time's failure to make clear that it was reporting no more than allegations showed ""actual malice"" (knowledge that the information was false or reckless disregard of whether it was false or not) under the rule of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254.  At the trial, the author of the article and the researcher admitted awareness that the wording of the Report had been significantly altered, but insisted that its real meaning had not been changed.  The District Court granted Time's motion for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the jury should determine whether the omission of the word ""alleged"" showed ""actual malice.""  Both courts agreed that Pape was a ""public official,"" and that the article concerned his ""official conduct.""
Held:  In the circumstances of this case, the magazine did not engage in a ""falsification"" sufficient, in itself, to sustain a jury finding of ""actual malice.""  Pp.  401 U. S. 284-292.
(a) The magazine's omission of the word ""alleged"" amounted to the adoption of one of several rational interpretations of a document bristling with ambiguities, and while that choice might reflect a misconception, it was not enough to create a jury issue of ""malice"" under the rule of New York Times, supra, as it would impose a stricter standard of liability on errors of interpretation or judgment than on errors of historic fact.

401 U.S. 302

Syllabus 
Petitioner coal mine operators brought this Sherman Act conspiracy action against respondent union alleging that respondent had expressly or impliedly agreed with the major producers to impose the provisions of the 1950 National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement (NBCWA) on all coal mine operators, knowing that the smaller ones would be unable to meet the NBCWA terms and would be driven out of business.  Petitioners based their express agreement claim on a later amendment, the Protective Wage Clause (PWC), whereby respondent undertook not to enter into any agreement with other operators on a basis other than the NBCWA, and their implied agreement claim on the PWC and subsequent activities of respondent and the major operators.  Following a trial, the trial judge dismissed the case for failure of proof, finding that the PWC did not constitute an express commitment by respondent not to bargain with other operators except on NBCWA terms, but that, all evidence considered, an implied commitment to do so would be inferred if the applicable standard of proof were the preponderance of the evidence standard ordinarily applied in civil cases.  He concluded, however, that, where a labor union is involved,  6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act requires a standard of ""clear proof,"" both with respect to the authority of individuals alleged to have performed illegal acts on behalf of unions and with respect to whether the acts themselves occurred, amounted to a conspiracy, and had injured the plaintiff's business.  Section 6 provides that no organization participating in a labor dispute shall be liable for the unlawful acts of individual officers or members except upon ""clear proof"" of actual participation in or authorization of such acts.  The District Court's judgment was affirmed by an equally divided Court of Appeals.  Petitioners additionally urge a construction of the PWC which would make it an illegal agreement for which respondent is not exempt under the antitrust laws, and they ask for reconsideration of the holding in Mine Workers v.

Held:
1. The ordinary preponderance of the evidence standard is applicable in civil antitrust actions against labor unions except with respect to proving the authority of individual members, officers, or agents of a union to perform on behalf of the union the acts complained of, where the ""clear proof"" standard applies.

No. 80
Argued November 10, 1970
Decided February 24, 1971
401 U.S. 321

Syllabus 
Respondent (HRI) brought a patent infringement suit against petitioner (Zenith) in 1959, and, in 1963, Zenith counterclaimed for damages alleging violations of the Sherman and Clayton Acts by HRI's participation in patent pools in Canada, Great Britain, and Australia, restricting Zenith's operations in those countries.  A year after evidence was closed, the trial judge entered preliminary findings of fact and conclusions of law favoring Zenith.  HRI then moved to amend its reply to the counterclaim and to reopen the record for taking additional evidence.  HRI sought to assert defenses of the statute of limitations and release, claiming that part of the damages awarded Zenith for 1959-1963 were caused by pre-1959 conduct, and thus barred by the statute of limitations, or were barred by a 1957 release given by Zenith to certain American companies in settlement of a civil treble damage action.  The trial judge permitted the defenses to be filed, but refused to reopen the record or modify his findings and conclusions concerning the Canadian market.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that Zenith had failed to prove injury to its business.  This Court reversed with respect to Canada, holding that there was ample evidence of damage in the Canadian market and noting that the trial judge had either rejected the limitations and release defenses on the merits or deemed them waived,  395 U. S. 395 U.S. 100.  On remand, the Court of Appeals held that the trial judge erroneously rejected the defenses on their merits.  That court, while doubting that Zenith's claim that the statute of limitations was tolled (by reason of a Government antitrust suit pending from 1958 to 1963 against various companies participating along with HRI in the Canadian patent pool), was properly before it, since no formal plea had been entered, rejected the tolling argument, concluding that tolling takes place only with respect to parties to a Government suit, and HRI was not such a party.  The court further ordered evidence to determine the extent of reduction of damages by virtue of the defenses it sustained.
Held:
1. Under the circumstances of this case, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion if his rejection of the limitations and release 
Page 401 U. S. 322
 defenses was based on HRI's waiver due to untimeliness of their presentation.  Pp.  401 U. S. 328-333.
2. The Court of Appeals erroneously rejected Zenith's claim that the statute of limitations was tolled during the pendency of the Government's antitrust suit against the other participants in the patent pool.  Pp.  401 U. S. 333-338.
(a) Where, as here, a plaintiff has no reason to anticipate that a claim of limitations will be raised against him, he need not set forth his claim of tolling until the limitations claim is raised.  P.  401 U. S. 334.

			"|"Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.
No. 80
Argued November 10, 1970
Decided February 24, 1971
401 U.S. 321

Syllabus 
Respondent (HRI) brought a patent infringement suit against petitioner (Zenith) in 1959, and, in 1963, Zenith counterclaimed for damages alleging violations of the Sherman and Clayton Acts by HRI's participation in patent pools in Canada, Great Britain, and Australia, restricting Zenith's operations in those countries.  A year after evidence was closed, the trial judge entered preliminary findings of fact and conclusions of law favoring Zenith.  HRI then moved to amend its reply to the counterclaim and to reopen the record for taking additional evidence.  HRI sought to assert defenses of the statute of limitations and release, claiming that part of the damages awarded Zenith for 1959-1963 were caused by pre-1959 conduct, and thus barred by the statute of limitations, or were barred by a 1957 release given by Zenith to certain American companies in settlement of a civil treble damage action.  The trial judge permitted the defenses to be filed, but refused to reopen the record or modify his findings and conclusions concerning the Canadian market.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that Zenith had failed to prove injury to its business.  This Court reversed with respect to Canada, holding that there was ample evidence of damage in the Canadian market and noting that the trial judge had either rejected the limitations and release defenses on the merits or deemed them waived,  395 U. S. 395 U.S. 100.  On remand, the Court of Appeals held that the trial judge erroneously rejected the defenses on their merits.  That court, while doubting that Zenith's claim that the statute of limitations was tolled (by reason of a Government antitrust suit pending from 1958 to 1963 against various companies participating along with HRI in the Canadian patent pool), was properly before it, since no formal plea had been entered, rejected the tolling argument, concluding that tolling takes place only with respect to parties to a Government suit, and HRI was not such a party.  The court further ordered evidence to determine the extent of reduction of damages by virtue of the defenses it sustained.
Held:
1. Under the circumstances of this case, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion if his rejection of the limitations and release 
Page 401 U. S. 322
 defenses was based on HRI's waiver due to untimeliness of their presentation.  Pp.  401 U. S. 328-333.
2. The Court of Appeals erroneously rejected Zenith's claim that the statute of limitations was tolled during the pendency of the Government's antitrust suit against the other participants in the patent pool.  Pp.  401 U. S. 333-338.
(a) Where, as here, a plaintiff has no reason to anticipate that a claim of limitations will be raised against him, he need not set forth his claim of tolling until the limitations claim is raised.  P.  401 U. S. 334.
(b) Under 28 U.S.C.  16(b) the statute of limitations is tolled against all participants in a conspiracy that is the object of a Government suit, whether or not they are named as defendants or conspirators therein.  Pp.  401 U. S. 335-338.
3. A plaintiff in an antitrust action may recover damages occurring within the statutory limitation period that are the result of conduct occurring prior to that period if, at the time of the conduct, those damages were speculative, uncertain, or otherwise incapable of proof.  Pp.  401 U. S. 338-342.
4. The effect of a release upon coconspirators is to be determined in accordance with the intention of the parties, and here, HRI, which was neither a party to the 1957 release nor a parent or subsidiary of a party, is not entitled to the benefit of the release, as the agreement to exchange releases provided expressly that they were ""to bind or benefit"" the party and ""the parent and subsidiaries of the party giving or receiving such release.""

No. 98
Argued December 15-16, 1970
Decided February 24, 1971
401 U.S. 355

Syllabus 
Petitioner, then an Army corporal, was convicted in 1961 by a general court-martial for violating Articles 134 and 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice by kidnaping and raping, within the bounds of a military reservation, two women -- one, who was waiting for her serviceman brother who was visiting the base hospital; the other, who was on her way from the home on the base where she lived with her serviceman husband to the post exchange where she worked.  In this habeas corpus proceeding, the Court granted certiorari on the issue of the retroactivity and scope of O'Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258 (1969), which held that a court-martial had no jurisdiction to try a member of the armed forces charged with attempted off-post rape of a civilian and related offenses, since such crimes were not ""service-connected.""
Held:
1. Though some of the factors are present here that the Court relied on for its result in O'Callahan (the offenses were committed in peacetime within this country's territory, did not relate to the accused's military duties, were traditionally cognizable in civilian courts (which were available to try them), and did not directly flout military authority or violate military property), this case significantly differs from O'Callahan in that the crimes there were committed by a serviceman away from his base against a victim who had no connection with the base, whereas here, the crimes were committed on the base against women properly there, one of whom was returning to her work on the base when the attack occurred.  Pp.  401 U. S. 364-365.
2. An offense committed by a serviceman on a military post that violates the security of a person or of property there is service-connected, and may be tried by a court-martial.  Pp.  401 U. S. 367-369.
3. The question of O'Callahan's retroactivity is not decided.  Pp.  401 U. S. 369-370.

Petitioner, a 1968 law school graduate and a member of the New York Bar, applied for admission to the Ohio Bar.  He made available to Ohio all the information he had given the New York Bar Committee, including answers to questions concerning organizations with which he was associated, his loyalty to the Government, and whether he was a member of a group seeking to effect changes in our form of government or to advance the interests of a foreign country.  But petitioner refused to answer three questions on the Ohio application on the ground that they infringed his rights under the First and Fifth Amendments:  (1) Question 12(g), which asked whether he was a member of ""any organization which advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States by force,"" (2) Question 13, which asked for a list of all ""organizations of which you are or have been a member,"" and (3) Question 7, which sought a list of all ""organizations of which you are or have become a member since registering as a law student.""

Syllabus 
Appellee Harris, who had been indicted for violating the California Criminal Syndicalism Act, sued in the Federal District Court to enjoin appellant, the county District Attorney, from prosecuting him, contending that the Act is unconstitutional on its face and inhibits him in exercising his free speech rights.  Appellees Dan and Hirsch, claiming that the prosecution of Harris would ""inhibit"" them from peacefully advocating the program of the political party to which they belonged, and appellee Broslawsky, a college professor, claiming that the prosecution made him ""uncertain"" as to whether his teaching and reading practices would subject him to prosecution, intervened as plaintiffs.  All asserted that they would suffer irreparable injury unless a federal injunction was issued.  A three-judge court, relying on Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, held the Act void for vagueness and overbreadth, and enjoined Harris' prosecution.
Held:
1. There is no basis for equitable jurisdiction based on the allegations of appellees other than Harris, who have not been indicted, arrested, or threatened with prosecution, and the normal course of a state criminal prosecution cannot be blocked on the basis of fears of prosecution that are merely speculative.  Pp.  401 U. S. 41-42.
2. Federal courts will not enjoin pending state criminal prosecutions except under extraordinary circumstances where the danger of irreparable loss is both great and immediate in that (unlike the situation affecting Harris) there is a threat to the plaintiff's federally protected rights that cannot be eliminated by his defense against a single prosecution.  The decision in Dombrowski, supra, which involved alleged bad faith harassment and is factually distinguishable from this case, does not substantially broaden the availability of injunctions against state criminal prosecutions.

Appellants, who had been indicted under New York's criminal anarchy law, sought declaratory as well as injunctive relief against their prosecutions, on the ground that the law is unconstitutional.  A three-judge District Court upheld the law and dismissed the complaints.

1. Since there was no showing that appellants have suffered or will suffer great and immediate irreparable injury by virtue of their being prosecuted in the state courts, where they can make their constitutional contentions, there is no basis for federal injunctive relief.

Syllabus 
Appellants, who had been indicted under New York's criminal anarchy law, sought declaratory as well as injunctive relief against their prosecutions, on the ground that the law is unconstitutional.  A three-judge District Court upheld the law and dismissed the complaints.
Held:
1. Since there was no showing that appellants have suffered or will suffer great and immediate irreparable injury by virtue of their being prosecuted in the state courts, where they can make their constitutional contentions, there is no basis for federal injunctive relief.  Younger v. Harris, ante, p.  401 U. S. 37.  Pp.  401 U. S. 68-69.
2. The same principles that govern the propriety of federal injunctions of state criminal proceedings govern the issuance of federal declaratory judgments in connection with such proceedings, and appellants here should have been denied declaratory relief without consideration of the merits of their constitutional claims.  Pp.  401 U. S. 69-74.
288 F.Supp. 348, affirmed.

Syllabus 
Appellees brought this action for injunctive and declaratory relief against enforcement of various Illinois statutes under some of which certain appellees had been arrested and all of which they claimed were being used to intimidate them in the exercise of their First Amendment rights.  A three-judge District Court declared invalid for overbreadth and enjoined enforcement of a statutory provision (under which no appellee had been arrested or charged) that prohibited intimidating a person by threats to ""[c]ommit any criminal offense.""
Held:  Since no appellee suffered, or was threatened with, great and immediate irreparable injury and the future application of the statute to any appellee was merely speculative, the District Court was not warranted in interfering with state law enforcement by the issuance of an injunction or declaratory judgment.

Decided February 23, 1971
401 U.S. 82

Syllabus 
Appellees, who had been arrested and charged with violating a Louisiana statute and a parish ordinance by displaying for sale allegedly obscene material (which was seized by the arresting officers), brought this suit in the Federal District Court for a declaration that the statute and ordinance were unconstitutional, and for an injunction against their enforcement.  A three-judge court which was convened upheld the statute and declined to issue an injunction, but, finding that the arrests and seizure were invalid, entered a suppression order prohibiting the use in state criminal proceedings of the illegally seized material and requiring its return to appellees.  The three-judge court recognized that it had no jurisdiction to pass on the constitutionality of the ordinance, but expressed the view that the ordinance was invalid.  The single-judge court then declared the ordinance unconstitutional.  Appellants appealed directly to this Court from the suppression order and the declaratory judgment invalidating the ordinance.
Held:
1. The three-judge court erred in issuing the suppression order, and thereby stifling the then-pending good faith state criminal proceeding during which the defense should first raise its constitutional claims.  Younger v. Harris, ante, p.  401 U. S. 37.  Pp.  401 U. S. 84-85.
2. This Court has no jurisdiction to review on direct appeal the validity of the order declaring the ordinance invalid, since it was a decision of a single federal judge, and, as such, was appealable only to the Court of Appeals.  Pp.  401 U. S. 86-88.

No. 370
Argued January 119, 1971
Decided February 23, 1971
401 U.S. 137

Syllabus 
Following a unit determination hearing, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) regional director concluded that three individuals were employees, rather than supervisors, and thus includible in the proposed bargaining unit at petitioner company's plant.  The NLRB denied petitioner's request for review.  Following an election, the regional director certified the union as the exclusive bargaining representative.  Subsequently, the NLRB upheld a finding that petitioner's refusal to bargain constituted an unfair labor practice.  Petitioner moved for reconsideration on the ground that the NLRB was required to give plenary review to the regional director's representation determination before issuing an unfair labor practice order based on that determination.  The motion was denied, and the Court of Appeals enforced the NLRB's order.
Held:  Under  3(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, the NLRB is permitted to delegate to the regional director its authority to determine the appropriate bargaining unit, and plenary review by the NLRB of such determination is not mandatory.  Pp. 141-143.

As a condition precedent to making a defense against a summary eviction proceeding, Georgia law provided that the tenant post a surety bond for double the amount due at the end of the trial, the landlord becoming entitled to such double rent should the tenant lose his case.  Following the Georgia Supreme Court's upholding of that statutory scheme over due process and equal protection challenges by appellants, indigent tenants seeking to contest summary eviction, appellants left the premises their landlords initially sought to recover, and entirely new legislation was enacted containing neither the bond-posting nor double rent requirement.
Held:  These ensuing developments make it inappropriate for this Court to resolve the issues originally raised by appellants, since it cannot be determined to what extent adjudication of those issues would be material to any further litigation ensuing on remand.  Pp.  401 U. S. 147-153.

No. 49
Argued October 15, 1970
Decided February 23, 1971
401 U.S. 154

Syllabus 
Appellants challenge, primarily on First Amendment vagueness and overbreadth grounds, the system for screening applicants for admission to the New York Bar.  To carry out the statutory requirement that the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ""be satisfied that such person possesses the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and counselor at law,"" Committees on Character and Fitness receive affidavits from two persons (one of whom must be a practicing attorney) acquainted with the applicant, and a questionnaire completed by the applicant.  The Committees also conduct personal interviews with each applicant.  As the final step before admission to the Bar, the applicant must take an oath that he will support the United States and New York Constitutions.  Appellants attack the procedure not because any applicant has ever been unjustifiably denied permission to practice law in New York, but on the basis that it works a ""chilling effect"" upon the exercise of free speech and association of law students.  The three-judge District Court found certain items on the questionnaire so vague, overbroad, and intrusive on applicants' privacy as to be of doubtful constitutional validity, but upheld the statute and rules as valid on their face, and with the exceptions noted, sustained the validity of the procedure.
Held:                                    I
1. The ""character and general fitness"" requirement for admission to the New York Bar is not violative of the Constitution.  Pp.  401 U. S. 159-160.
(a) The requirement has been construed by appellees to encompass no more than ""dishonorable conduct relevant to the legal profession.""  P.  401 U. S. 159.
(b) The current third-party affidavits, setting forth the nature and extent of affiants' acquaintance with the applicant, do not infringe upon the applicant's right to privacy.  P.  401 U. S. 160. 
Page 401 U. S. 155

2. New York's Rule that an applicant furnish proof that he ""believes in the form of government of the United States and is loyal to such government,"" is not constitutionally invalid in light of appellees' construction that the Rule places no burden of proof on the applicant, that the ""form of government"" and the ""government"" refer solely to the Constitution, and that ""belief"" and ""loyalty"" mean no more than willingness to take the constitutional oath and ability to do so in good faith.  Pp.  401 U. S. 161-164.
3. The challenged items on the modified questionnaire are not constitutionally invalid, as one is precisely tailored to conform to this Court's decisions on organizational membership and association, and the other is merely supportive of appellees' task of ascertaining the applicant's good faith in taking the constitutional oath.  Pp.  401 U. S. 164-166.
4. New York's carefully administered screening system does not necessarily result in chilling the exercise of constitutional freedoms, and whether a different policy might be wiser rests with that State's policymaking bodies.  P.  401 U. S. 167.

 Jesse L. JACKSON et al.,v. Richard OGILVIE et al.No. 1341. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 22, 1971
 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, concurring. 
 The Court properly stays its hand in this election case that comes to us with the customary plea for emergency action. It is not entirely clear that the three-judge court was properly convened. But assuming it was, the case is peculiarly appropriate for application of the abstention doctrine which we recently applied in Reetz v. Bozanich, 397 U.S. 82.

 While these issues are by our federal standard 'justicable,' federal courts are usually less able than state courts to work their way through a maze of state electoral laws.

 The suit in the federal court was filed December 1970, the three- judge court rendering its decision on January 28, 1971. 325 F.Supp. 864. It was not until February 1, 1971, that appellant Jackson filed his nomination papers with the Board. On February 8, 1971, two registered voters filed written objections to those nomination papers. The Board gave notice of a hearing to be held February 11, 1971, on these objections. The Board on February 18, 1971, held that the nomination papers of appellant did not satisfy requirements of the Illinois election code. Hence it was apparent that the administrative decision of the Board came after the decision of the federal three-judge court. What appellants ask us in substance to do is to sit in direct review of the Election Board. The reason, of course, is that the primary will be held February 2o, 1971, and the State will begin distributing the ballots which contain the names of the winners of the primary and the names of the independent candidates on March 8, 1971. Federal courts cannot act responsibly in those situations.

 Jesse L. JACKSON et al.,v. Richard OGILVIE et al.No. 1341. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 22, 1971
 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, concurring. 
 The Court properly stays its hand in this election case that comes to us with the customary plea for emergency action. It is not entirely clear that the three-judge court was properly convened. But assuming it was, the case is peculiarly appropriate for application of the abstention doctrine which we recently applied in Reetz v. Bozanich, 397 U.S. 82.

400 U.S. 470

Syllabus 
Appellee was tried in Federal District Court on an information charging him with willfully assisting in the preparation of fraudulent income tax returns.  Following the impaneling of the jury, the prosecutor called to the stand a taxpayer whom appellee allegedly had aided in preparing his return.  At defense counsel's suggestion, the judge warned the witness of his constitutional rights.  The witness expressed his willingness to testify, stating that he had been warned of his rights when first contacted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The judge refused to permit him to testify until he had consulted an attorney, indicating that he did not believe the witness had been warned by the IRS.  Although the prosecutor advised the judge that the remaining witnesses had been warned of their rights by the IRS upon initial contact, the judge stated that the warnings were probably inadequate.  Thereupon he discharged the jury and aborted the trial so that the witnesses could consult with attorneys.  The case was set for retrial before another jury, but on appellee's pretrial motion, the judge dismissed the information on the ground of former jeopardy.  The Government filed a direct appeal to this Court.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  400 U. S. 473-488.
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded that:
l. The sustainment of a motion in bar based on a plea of former jeopardy is appealable by the Government, as long as the motion was sustained, as here, prior to the impaneling of the jury in the subsequent proceeding at which the motion was made.  Cf. United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267.  Pp.  400 U. S. 473-478.
2. The Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause represents a constitutional policy of finality for the defendant's benefit in federal criminal proceedings.  Pp.  400 U. S. 479-486.
(a) Although it is recognized that a defendant can be reprosecuted after a successful appeal, double jeopardy policies are not 
Page 400 U. S. 471
 confined to the prevention of prosecutorial or judicial overreaching.  Pp.  400 U. S. 483-484.
(b) The defendant has the option to have his case considered by the first jury, and where the judge, acting without defendant's consent, aborts the trial, the defendant has been deprived of his ""valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.""  P.  400 U. S. 484.
(c) In the absence of defendant's motion for a mistrial, the doctrine of ""manifest necessity,"" United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579,  22 U. S. 580, commands trial judges not to foreclose the defendant's option until a scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion warrants the conclusion that justice would not be served by a continuation of the trial.  Pp.  400 U. S. 485-486.
(d) A judge must temper the decision whether or not to abort the trial by considering the importance to the defendant of being able finally to conclude his confrontation with society through the verdict of a tribunal that he might believe is favorable to him.  P.  400 U. S. 486.
3. The trial judge here abused his discretion, and accordingly appellee's reprosecution would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.  400 U. S. 486-487.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concluded that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the appeal under 18 U.S.C.  3731 because the trial judge's action amounted to an acquittal, but they join the Court's judgment in view of the decision of a majority of the Court to reach the merits.  Pp.  400 U. S. 487-488.

Syllabus 
In furtherance of an investigation of petitioner's tax returns, respondent Grady, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Special Agent, issued summonses to petitioner's putative former employer (Acme) and its accountant for the production of Acme's records of petitioner's employment and compensation during the years under investigation.  The summonses were issued under  7602 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which authorizes IRS examinations of records and witnesses for the purpose of determining tax liability.  Thereafter, respondents, pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  7402(b) and 7604(a), filed in the District Court petitions for enforcement of the summonses.  Petitioner filed motions to intervene in the enforcement proceeding, relying on Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 24(a)(2), which, inter alia, provides for intervention in an action ""when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action. . . .""  Petitioner alleged that the IRS agents were investigating him solely to obtain evidence concerning criminal violations of the tax laws, and that, consequently, the summonses were not issued for any purpose within the scope of  7602, and could not be enforced.  The court denied petitioner's motions and ordered that the records be produced
The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Petitioner has no proprietary interest in the Acme records (his sole interest therein being that they presumably contain details of payments to him), and since he has no other protectable interest by way of privilege or otherwise, he has no absolute right under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 24(a)(2) to intervene in the IRS summons enforcement proceeding.  Pp.  400 U. S. 527-531.
2. Under  7602, an IRS summons may be used in connection with a tax investigation if (as in this case) it is issued in good faith and prior to a recommendation for prosecution.  Pp.  400 U. S. 531-536.

Argued December 10, 1970

400 U.S. 433

Syllabus 
The police chief of Hartford, Wisconsin, pursuant to a state statute, caused to be posted a notice in all retail liquor outlets in Hartford that sales or gifts of liquor to appellee, a resident of that city, were forbidden for one year.  The statute provides for such ""posting,"" without notice or hearing, with respect to any person who ""by excessive drinking"" produces certain conditions or exhibits specified traits, such as exposing himself or family ""to want"" or becoming ""dangerous to the peace"" of the community.  On appellee's suit seeking, inter alia, injunctive relief, a three-judge federal court held the statute unconstitutional as violative of procedural due process.
Held:
1. The label or characterization given an individual by ""posting,"" though a mark of serious illness to some, is to others such a stigma or badge of disgrace that procedural due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard.  Pp.  400 U. S. 436-437.
2. Since here the state statute is unambiguous and there is no uncertain issue of state law, the federal court properly proceeded to determine the federal constitutional claim.  Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U. S. 241,  389 U. S. 250-251.  Pp. 400 U. S. 437-39.

400 U.S. 446

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted in 1959 of murdering his wife.  A recorded statement, made in jail to an insurance agent in connection with discussion of a policy on the life of respondent's wife, was admitted into evidence at the trial.  The California Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, finding the statement voluntary.  Respondent later sought federal habeas corpus relief, contending that the statement was involuntary.  The District Court granted relief on the ground that the trial court had excluded relevant evidence on the issue of voluntariness, and thus ""did not reliably determine whether [the] confession was voluntary or involuntary.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  An applicant for federal habeas corpus relief is not entitled to a new hearing on the voluntariness of a statement introduced at his trial merely because he can point to shortcomings in the state court procedure used to decide the voluntariness issue, as he must also show (which respondent did not do in this case) that his version of the events, if true, would require the conclusion that the statement was involuntary.

No. 5370
Decided January 18, 1971
400 U.S. 423

Syllabus 
Petitioners unsuccessfully moved to dismiss an action for a 1964 debt brought against them, on the ground that the Montana courts lacked jurisdiction because they were Blackfeet Indians and the transactions took place on the Indian reservation.  Section 7 of the Act of August 15, 1953, provided in part that a State not having civil jurisdiction over Indians could
""assume jurisdiction at such time and in such manner as the people of the State shall, by affirmative legislative action, obligate and bind the State to assumption thereof.""
Montana took no affirmative legislative action with respect to the Blackfeet Reservation.  In 1967, the Blackfeet Tribal Council adopted an act providing for concurrent jurisdiction in the Tribal Court and the state courts of any suit where the defendant is a member of the Tribe.  Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 repealed  7 of the 1953 Act and provided for the assumption of state jurisdiction
""only where the enrolled Indians within the affected area of such Indian country accept such jurisdiction by a majority vote of the adult Indians voting at a special election held for that purpose.""
Held:  The Tribal Council's unilateral action was insufficient to vest jurisdiction in the Montana courts under either the 1953 Act, which required affirmative state legislative action, or under the 1968 Act, which calls for a majority vote of all enrolled Indians.

By this remand this Court intimates no view as to the merits of the Solicitor General's position.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 establishes methods of securing relief for individuals complaining of discrimination in employment. An individual may bring court action to enforce his rights under Title VII only after he has filed a timely charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Section 706(b) of the Act provides no charge may be filed with the EEOC until 60 days after the commencement of proceedings (unless they are terminated earlier) before a state or local agency, if one exists, which has power 'to grant or seek relief' or to 'institute criminal proceedings' with respect to the complaint. The EEOC has interpreted 706(b) as requiring initial submission of the complaint to state agencies only where the agency can provide adequate relief. At present Arizona and six 
Page 400 U.S. 1004 , 1005
 other States* have agencies with remedial powers which the EEOC finds inadequate. 
 This case arose in Arizona. Petitioners brought a complaint of racial discrimination in employment to the EEOC without first going to the Arizona Civil Rights Commission. The EEOC found there was reasonable cause to believe the charge was true and sent a statutory Notice-of-Right-To-Sue- Within-Thirty-Days and the action was timely filed. The Court of Appeals held that the District Court should have dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction because the Arizona Civil Rights Commission should have been given the initial opportunity to consider the complaint. The court found that a state agency 'to grant and seek relief' included an agency that could only attempt to settle the dispute by conciliation and persuasion. 
 The proper functioning of the various Civil Rights Acts is of critical importance. This Court has recently reemphasized the importance of deference to an administrative interpretation by the agency charged with the initial interpretation of a new law. United States v. City of Chicago, 400 U.S. 8; Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16. The court below rejected the administrative interpretation of 706(b). In so doing it requires pursuing a state remedy classified as inadequate by the EEOC. 
 The various Civil Rights Acts represent a national commitment to achieve an end to racial discrimination. Forcing an alleged victim of racial discrimination-usually an indigent-first to seek a state remedy classified as inadequate by the federal rights when that state remedy is palpably inadequate presents an issue of considerable importance. See Glover v. St. Louis-San Francisco R. Co., 393 U.S. 324, 21 L. Ed.2d 519. I would grant certiorari to decide the question presented in this case.

 Rehearing Denied March 1, 1971. 
 See 401 U.S. 949. 
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Mississippi. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BLACK, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN join, dissenting. 
 This is a tragic case in which a twenty-three-year-old railroad worker was permanently and totally disabled while performing his duties. He has been denied his right to recover damages by what I believe was the gross error of the Mississippi Supreme Court in depriving him of his constitutional right to a jury trial. Petitioner Robert Rodicker, a man with an eighth-grade education, has earned his living doing manual labor for respondent Illinois Central Railroad since the age of 18. On September 18, 1964, Rodicker was working a switch engine with two other Illinois Central Railroad employees coupling an Illinois Central car to a train at the Union Passenger Terminal in New Orleans. As the engine backed up, it spewed out a shower of sparks, covering Rodicker with fire and burning his back and neck. He leaned away from the engine's steps to save himself from the sparks and smashed into a negligently placed steel garbage container that knocked him to the tracks unconscious. He brought suit against respondent under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, urging that his injury was negligently caused by the engine's excessive sparks and the dangerous placement of the steel garbage containers. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed a judgment directing a verdict for the railroad. That court held that as a matter of law petitioner was an employee of the Union Passenger Terminal and not the Illinois Central at the time of this terrible accident. I cannot understand the Court's refusal to grant certiorari. 
Page 400 U.S. 1012 , 1013
 Respondent had made an agreement with the Union Passenger Terminal whereby the latter used Illinois Central employees and those of other railroads as crews to switch the railroads' cars when they entered the terminal. Petitioner was working on such a crew when he was injured. He had an Illinois Central employee number and was being paid by check drawn on the Illinois Central. He regularly applied to the Illinois Central for vacation time and received vacation pay from it. And of course he was actually coupling an Illinois Central car at the time of the injury. 
 On this record petitioner was entitled to have a jury determine whether he should recover from the Illinois Central. See, e. q., Sinkler v. Missouri Pacific Railroad, 356 U.S. 326 (1957 ); Wilkerson v. McCarthy, 336 U.S. 53 (1949); Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis v. Fitzjohn, 165 F.2d 473 (CA 8 1948). Today the Court deprives petitioner of his right to a jury trial and frustrates the plan of Congress to provide a remedy for railroad employees injured by their employers' negligence. 
 I think it is of paramount importance that the purpose of Congress to protect people like petitioner should not be frustrated by the will of judges. I would grant certiorari and reverse the judgment of the court below.

No. 46
Argued October 20, 1970
Decided January 14, 1971
400 U.S. 379

Syllabus 
Appellants, voters and candidates for city offices, sought to enjoin the 1969 election in Canton, Mississippi, alleging that the 1969 requirements differed from those in effect on November 1, 1964, and at the last city election in 1965, and that the city sought to enforce the changed requirements without following the approval procedure set forth in  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Section 5 precludes a State or political subdivision covered by the Act from administering
""any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that, in force or effect on November 1, 1964,""

Canton, which is covered by the Act, sought to enforce changes (1) in location of polling places, (2) in municipal boundaries through annexations of adjacent areas, thus increasing the number of eligible voters, and (3) from ward to at-large election of aldermen.

1. The three-judge court should have considered only the issue of

Syllabus 
Appellants, voters and candidates for city offices, sought to enjoin the 1969 election in Canton, Mississippi, alleging that the 1969 requirements differed from those in effect on November 1, 1964, and at the last city election in 1965, and that the city sought to enforce the changed requirements without following the approval procedure set forth in  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Section 5 precludes a State or political subdivision covered by the Act from administering
""any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that, in force or effect on November 1, 1964,""

Syllabus 
Title 39 U.S.C.  4006 permits the Postmaster General to stamp as ""Unlawful"" and return to the sender letters addressed to any person and to prohibit the payment of postal money orders to that person if he finds, on ""evidence satisfactory to [him],"" that the person is obtaining or seeking money through the mails for ""an obscene . . . matter"" or is using the mails to distribute information about how such items may be obtained.  Under departmental regulations, following complaint and notice of hearing, a Judicial Officer holds a hearing and renders his opinion ""with all due speed,"" from which there is an administrative appeal.  Section 4007 permits district courts to order the defendant's incoming mail detained pending completion of the  4006 proceedings, upon a showing of ""probable cause"" to believe that  4006 is being violated, under the standards fixed by Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 65.  In No. 55, appellee, a retail magazine distributor against whom the Postmaster General had instituted a  4006 proceeding, brought an action in the District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. A three-judge court held the statute unconstitutional for failure to meet the requirements of Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, which held with respect to a scheme of administrative censorship that (1) the censor must initiate judicial review and prove that the material is unprotected expression; (2) ""prompt judicial review"" is mandatory; and (3) any restraint before a final judicial determination must be limited to the shortest, fixed period compatible with sound judicial resolution.  In No. 58, where the Postmaster General applied for a  4007 order, the District Court, on appellee distributor's counterclaim, held  4006 unconstitutional under Freedman v. Maryland, supra, and that  4007's ""probable cause"" standard was constitutionally insufficient to support a temporary mail detention order.
Held:  The administrative censorship scheme created by 39 U.S.C.  4006, 4007

 violates the First Amendment since it lacks adequate safeguards against undue inhibition of protected expression.  Freedman v. Maryland, supra.  Pp.  400 U. S. 416-422.

400 U.S. 297

Syllabus 
A general contractor (Burns) subcontracted construction work to three companies, all of which employed operating engineers who belonged to respondent union.  That union, disputing the assignment by one of the subcontractors (White) of an operation involving an electric welding machine to members of another labor organization, advised Burns that all respondent's members on the jobsite would strike unless Burns bound itself and the subcontractors to give respondent jurisdiction over electric welding machines.  The union went on strike when the employers refused to accede to its demands.  After an arbitrator, to whom Burns had referred the matter, held that there was no reason to change the disputed work assignment, respondent union physically prevented operation of the welding machine.  Thereafter an unfair labor practices proceeding against the union was brought.  The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found that, by inducing the subcontractors' employees to strike to force White to assign the disputed work to the operating engineers, the union had violated  8(b)(4)(D) of the National Labor Relations Act, which bars strikes for the object of
""forcing . . . any employer to assign particular work to employee in a particular labor organization . . . rather than to employees in another labor organization. . . .""
The NLRB also found that, by applying economic pressure on the neutral employers the union had violated  8(b)(4)(B), which bars a union from exerting coercive pressure on a neutral or secondary employer where ""an object thereof"" is forcing him, inter alia, ""to cease doing business with any other person.""  On the NLRB's petition for enforcement, the Court of Appeals sustained the NLRB's  8(b)(4)(D) finding but set aside its  8(b)(4)(b) finding, concluding that the union's objective was to force Burns ""to use its influence with the subcontractor to change 
Page 400 U. S. 298
 the subcontractor' conduct, not to terminate their relationship.""
Held:
1. In seeking to force Burn to bind all the subcontractors on the project to a particular form of job assignment and implying by its demand that Burns would have to force a change in White's policy or terminate White's contract, respondent union engaged in flagrant secondary conduct within the prohibition of  8(b)(4)(b).  Pp.  400 U. S. 302-305

New York's Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, stressing ""close contact"" with beneficiaries, requires home visits by caseworkers as a condition for assistance
""in order that any treatment or service tending to restore [beneficiaries] to a condition of self-support and to relieve their distress may be rendered and . . . that assistance or care may be given only in such amount and as long as necessary.""
Visitation with a beneficiary, who is the primary source of information to welfare authorities as to eligibility for assistance, is not permitted outside working hours, and forcible entry and snooping are prohibited.  Appellee, a beneficiary under the AFDC program, after receiving several days' advance notice, refused to permit a caseworker to visit her home, and, following a hearing and advice that assistance would consequently be terminated, brought this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief, contending that a home visitation is a search and, when not consented to or supported by a warrant based on probable cause, would violate her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The District Court upheld appellee's constitutional claim.
Held:  The home visitation provided for by New York law in connection with the AFDC program is a reasonable administrative tool, and does not violate any right guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  400 U. S. 315-326.
(a) Home visitation, which is not forced or compelled, is not a search in the traditional criminal law context of the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  400 U. S. 317-318.
(b) Even assuming that the home visit has some of the characteristics of a traditional search, New York's program is reasonable, as it serves the paramount needs of the dependent child; enables the State to determine that the intended objects of its assistance benefit from its aid and that state funds are being properly used; helps attain parallel federal relief objectives; stresses privacy by not unnecessarily intruding on the beneficiary's rights in her home; provides essential information not obtainable through secondary sources; is conducted, not by a law enforcement

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 These are applications for bail in cases from the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Catena pending certiorari to this Court and in Annaloro pending appeal to the Court of Appeals. Each applicant was convicted by a state court for refusing to testify before a grand jury. Each sought habeas corpus in the federal court; and in the Catena case, 449 F.2d 40, the Court of Appeals held that the applicant was unconstitutionally detained. 
Page 404 U.S. 807 , 808
 Concededly the Annaloro case is on all fours with Catena, although the Court of Appeals has not yet heard the merits. 
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of the motion or applications. 
 The underlying question in these cases is whether the immunity to which a witness is entitled who refuses to testify because of the Self Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment is 'transactional' immunity or 'use' immunity. The question is one that was stirred last Term in Piccirillo v. New York, 400 U.S. 548. As Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall, and I concluded in that case, the constitutional requirement calls for 'transactional' immunity. Id., at 550- 551, 562 et seq.. That plainly is the law as it now stands, ibid; and the Court of Appeals so held. Since applicants were granted only 'use' immunity and refused to testify on that ground, they have wrongfully been imprisoned. They are therefore being held unconstitutionally and should be discharged pending the appeals. 
 We have noted jurisdiction in No. 69-4, Zicarelli v. New Jersey, 404 U.S. 812, which raises the same question. But since Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, held, that the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Self Incrimination Clause to the States as fully as to the Federal Government, it will require a reversal in direction by this Court and a dilution of Malloy to say that these applicants are lawfully detained. 
 I would follow settled law until it is changed and meanwhile discharge these prisoners on suitable bail.* 
 * 'A justice or judge of the United States before whom a habeas corpus proceeding is pending, may, before final judgment or after final judgment of discharge, or pending appeal, stay any proceeding against the person detained in any State court or by or under the authority of any State or any matter involved in the habeas corpus proceeding.' 28 U.S.Code Ann. 2251.

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. Petitioner infringed respondent's copyright and a verdict was rendered against her. Petitioner argued that because the congressional power over copyrights and patents stemmed from the same constitutional provision, they both should be governed by the same standard. Thus, petitioner contended that the copyright was invalid because the book in question lacked 'novelty,' but the Court of Appeals rejected this argument saying that the appropriate standard for a copyright was 'originality' and that the respondent's book met this criteria. [Footnote 1] The standard of copyrightability presents an important question concerning the scope of Congress' enumerated powers. It has not heretofore been decided by this Court2 and, arguably, it was wrongly decided by the courts below.

 In 1961, respondent published and copyrighted a book entitled Face Lifting by Exercise. This book explained how isometric facial exercises could be used to preserve the appearance of youth. It was based on respondent's study of anatomy, physical therapy and magazine and newspaper articles, but there is nothing in the record to indicate that the ideas it contained constituted anything more than 'selecting the last piece to put into the last opening in a jig-saw puzzle.' Sinclair & Carroll Co. v. Interchemical Corp., 325 U.S. 327, 335, 1147. It was merely a repetition of the existing state of the art. During 1962, petitioner was employed in respondent's beauty salon and we may assume that it was during this time that petitioner first read respondent's book and learned of respondent's facial exercises. In 1965, petitioner published The Joyce Lee Method of Scientific Facial Exercises. It contained a system of facial exercises strikingly similar to respondent's and, even though it was unquestionably expressed in petitioner's own language, we may safely conclude that it was based on respondent's book. An action for copyright infringement was made out, therefore, if the respondent's copyright was valid and if it embraced the ideas in her book. 
 The constitutional power over copyrights is found in the same clause that governs the issuance of patents: 'The Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.' Art. I, 8, cl. 8.

 MELTZER et alv. C. Buck LECRAW & Co.No. 5048. 
 May 3, 1971. 
 Certiorari denied. 
 MR. JUSTICE BLACK. 
 On March 2, 1971, this Court decided Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, holding that Connecticut could not consistently with the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses deny access to its divorce courts to indigents unable to pay relatively small filing and service of process fees. We now have eight other cases pending on appeal or on petition for writ of certiorari in which indigents were denied access to civil courts because of their poverty. 
 One case, Sloatman v. Gibbons, No. 5067, is distinguished from Boddie only by the fact that Arizona permits an extension of time for an indigent to pay the statutory fee when filing for a divorce. In re Garland, No. 5971, involves the right of a bankrupt to file a petition for discharge in bankruptcy without payment of the $50 statutory fee. Meltzer v. LeCraw & Co., No. 5048, involves a slightly more subtle form of handicap to the indigent seeking judicial resolution of a dispute. In that case a tenant who fights his eviction by resort to 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 955
 the judicial process risks the penalty of a judgment for double the rent due during the litigation if he loses. Two other cases, Frederick v. Schwartz, No. 5050, and Bourbeau v. Lancaster, No. 5054, involve indigents who have lost civil cases -- a welfare claim and child guardianship claim -- and who cannot afford to pay the fees for docketing an appeal. Beverly v. Scotland Urban Enterprises, Inc., No. 5208, and Lindsey v. Normet, No. 6158, involve indigents who cannot post the penalty bonds required to appeal from adverse judgments in housing-eviction cases. And finally, Kaufman v. Carter, No. 6375, is perhaps the most surprising of all eight cases because in that case an indigent mother was denied court-appointed counsel to defend herself against a state civil suit to declare her an unfit mother and take five of her seven children away from her. 
 The Court has decided to note probable jurisdiction in No. 6158, Lindsey v. Normet. Review will be denied in five of the other cases -- Nos. 5048, 5208, 5054, 5971, and 6375 -- while the judgments in the two remaining cases are to be vacated and the cases remanded for reconsideration in light of the decision in Boddie. I agree with my Brethren that Lindsey v. Normet should be set for argument, but I cannot understand why that case is singled out for special treatment and why distinctions are made between the other cases. For the reasons set out below, I would grant the petitions or note probable jurisdiction in each of the other cases and set them for argument or reverse them outright on the basis of the decision in Boddie. 
 In my view, the decision in Boddie v. Connecticut can safely rest on only one crucial foundation -- that the civil courts of the United States and each of the States belong to the people of this country and that no person can be denied access to those courts, either for a trial or an appeal, because he cannot pay a fee, finance a 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 956
 bond, risk a penalty, or afford to hire an attorney. Some may sincerely believe that the decision in Boddie was far more limited in scope -- that is, applies only to divorce cases. Other people might recognize that this constitutional decision will eventually extend to all civil cases but believe that it can only be enforced slowly step by step, so that the country will have time to absorb its full import. But in my judgment Boddie cannot and should not be limited to either its facts or its language, and I believe there can be no doubt that this country can afford to provide court costs and lawyers to Americans who are now barred by their poverty from resort to the law for resolution of their disputes. 
 The opinion in Boddie attempts to draw two distinctions between divorce and other disputes. The Court there stated that access to the judicial process in divorce matters is the ""exclusive precondition to the adjustment of a fundamental human relationship."" Supra, at 383. The two elements, then, that require open access to the courts are that the judicial mechanism be the ""exclusive"" means of resolving the dispute and that the dispute involve ""fundamental"" subject matter. The first element -- the ""exclusiveness"" of the judicial process as a remedy -- is no limitation at all. The States and the Federal Government hold the ultimate power of enforcement in almost every dispute. Every law student learns in the first semester of law school that property, for instance, is ""valuable"" only because the State will enforce the collection of rights that attach to its ownership. Thus, the State holds the ultimate remedy in almost every property dispute. Similarly, the wrong that gives rise to a right of damages in tort exists only because society's lawmakers have created a standard of care and a duty to abide by that standard. The alternatives to resort to the judicial process in tort cases are negotiation and settlement, abandonment of recovery, private self-help, 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 957
 and perhaps insurance. With the exception of insurance, the alternatives are exactly the same as in a divorce case -- negotiate a separation agreement, decide to continue the marriage relationship, or violate the law. Likewise, contracts are valuable only because society will enforce them. Indeed, marriage itself when analyzed in purely legal terms is a contract that cannot be revoked without governmental approval. Thus, the judicial process is the exclusive means through which almost any dispute can ultimately be resolved short of brute force. 
 The other distinction between divorce and different kinds of controversies suggested in the Boddie opinion is the degree to which the disputes are regarded as ""fundamental."" The extent to which this requirement limits the holding of Boddie is found in the very facts of that decision -- the right to seek a divorce is simply not very "" fundamental"" in the hierarchy of disputes. Marriage is one of the cornerstones of our civilized society. Society generally places a high value on marriage and a low value on the right to divorce. And since Boddie held that the right to a divorce was ""fundamental,"" I can only conclude that almost every other kind of legally 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 958
 enforceable right is also fundamental to our society. Society generally encourages people to seek recompense when they suffer damages through the fault of others. And I cannot believe that my Brethren would find the rights of a man with both legs cut off by a negligent railroad less "" fundamental"" than a person's right to seek a divorce. Even the need to be on the welfare rolls or to file for a discharge in bankruptcy seems to me to be more ""fundamental"" than a person's right to seek a divorce. Society provides welfare to ensure the survival of the unfortunate. And bankruptcy is designed to permit a man to make a new start unhampered by overwhelming debts in hopes of achieving a useful life. For this Court to have first provided for governmental assumption of civil court costs in a divorce case seems to me a most unfortunate point of departure. But since that step has now been taken, I would either overrule Boddie at once or extend the benefits of government-paid costs to other civil litigants whose interests are at least as important to an orderly society. 
 In my judgment, the crucial foundation on which Boddie rests also forbids denial of an indigent's right of appeal in civil cases merely because he is too poor to pay appeal costs. Once the right to unhampered access to the judicial process has been established, that right is diluted unless the indigent litigant has an opportunity to assert and obtain review of the errors committed at trial. Since Boddie rejected distinctions between the civil and the criminal process in determining the permissibility of restrictions upon access to the courts, we need only apply to civil cases our long line of holdings that indigent criminals cannot because of their indigency be denied an appeal or the right to a state-furnished record on appeal. See Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 ( 1956); Draper v. Washington, 372 U.S. 487 (1963); Long v. District Court of Iowa, 385 U.S. 192 (1966); Roberts v. LaVallee, 389 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 959
 U.S. 40 (1967); Williams v. Oklahoma City, 395 U.S. 458 (1969). See also Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963). 
 Finally, there cannot be meaningful access to the judicial process until every serious litigant is represented by competent counsel. Cf. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963); Douglas v. California, supra. Of course, not every litigant would be entitled to appointed counsel no matter how frivolous his claims might be. See Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 674 (1958). But the fundamental importance of legal representation in our system of adversary justice is beyond dispute. Since Boddie held that there must be meaningful access to civil courts in divorce cases, I can only conclude that Boddie necessitates the appointment of counsel for indigents in such cases. In fact, this Court has held that attorneys' fees are part of the costs of litigation and may be taxed as costs. Sprague v. Ticonic National Bank, 307 U.S. 161 (1939). And as with fees and transcripts, I will never agree to limit the advantages of free counsel to divorce cases. See n. 1, supra. The necessity of state-appointed counsel is particularly acute in cases like one of those before us, Kaufman v. Carter, where the State initiates a civil proceeding against an individual to deprive her of the custody of her children. Here the State is employing the judicial mechanism it has created to enforce society's will upon an individual and take away her children. The case by its very nature resembles a criminal prosecution. The defendant is charged with conduct -- failure to care properly for her children -- which may be criminal and which in any event is viewed as reprehensible and morally wrong by a majority of society. And the cost of being unsuccessful is dearly high -- loss of the companionship of one's children. Indeed, Boddie held that an indigent was entitled to state-paid courts costs in a divorce contest, and such cases almost always 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 960
 involve the custody of children. Certainly, if the State must provide funds for an indigent mother's court costs for a divorce, the State should also provide her with counsel to protect her rights to something far more important to most mothers and to society -- her right to custody of her children. 
 For the reasons expressed above and given in the decision in Boddie I would set each of these cases for argument or reverse them outright and hold that citizens cannot be barred from their courts because they are too poor to afford the required fees and bonds or because they cannot hire the professional legal help essential to turn the wheels of justice. There is simply no fairness or justice in a legal system which pays indigents' costs to get divorces and does not aid them in other civil cases which are frequently of far greater importance to society. 
 MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS. 
 The facts of these cases are set out by MR. JUSTICE BLACK. All of them except No. 6375, Kaufman v. Carter, involve people who are denied access to the judicial process solely because of their indigency. Kaufman presents a distinctly different problem. There the State commenced a civil suit in 1963, declared petitioner an unfit mother and took five of her seven children away from her. The status of the children is reviewed annually as required by state law. She did not initially seek counsel; but in the 1968 review proceedings she did. The State is enforcing its view of proper public policy. That procedure has consequences for the citizen so great that it is hardly an extension to say the rationale of Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, demands that she be provided counsel. I would grant certiorari and reverse in this case. 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 961
 I believe a proper application of the Equal Protection Clause also requires that the access cases be reversed. Courts ought not be a private preserve for the affluent. All of these cases contain an invidious discrimination based on poverty, a suspect legislative classification. See Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12; Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 383 ( DOUGLAS, J., concurring). 
 Today's decisions underscore the difficulties with the Boddie approach. In Boddie the majority found marriage and its dissolution to be so fundamental as to require allowing indigents access to divorce courts without costs. When indigency is involved I do not think there is a hierarchy of interests. Marriage and its dissolution are of course fundamental. But the parent-child relationship is also of sufficient importance to require appointment of counsel when the State initiates and maintains proceedings to destroy it. Similarly, obtaining a fresh start in life through bankruptcy proceedings or securing adequate housing and the other procedures in these cases seemingly come within the Equal Protection Clause, as suggested by my separate opinion in Boddie.

 MELTZER et alv. C. Buck LECRAW & Co.No. 5048. 
 May 3, 1971. 
 Certiorari denied. 
 MR. JUSTICE BLACK. 
 On March 2, 1971, this Court decided Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, holding that Connecticut could not consistently with the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses deny access to its divorce courts to indigents unable to pay relatively small filing and service of process fees. We now have eight other cases pending on appeal or on petition for writ of certiorari in which indigents were denied access to civil courts because of their poverty. 
 One case, Sloatman v. Gibbons, No. 5067, is distinguished from Boddie only by the fact that Arizona permits an extension of time for an indigent to pay the statutory fee when filing for a divorce. In re Garland, No. 5971, involves the right of a bankrupt to file a petition for discharge in bankruptcy without payment of the $50 statutory fee. Meltzer v. LeCraw & Co., No. 5048, involves a slightly more subtle form of handicap to the indigent seeking judicial resolution of a dispute. In that case a tenant who fights his eviction by resort to 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 955
 the judicial process risks the penalty of a judgment for double the rent due during the litigation if he loses. Two other cases, Frederick v. Schwartz, No. 5050, and Bourbeau v. Lancaster, No. 5054, involve indigents who have lost civil cases -- a welfare claim and child guardianship claim -- and who cannot afford to pay the fees for docketing an appeal. Beverly v. Scotland Urban Enterprises, Inc., No. 5208, and Lindsey v. Normet, No. 6158, involve indigents who cannot post the penalty bonds required to appeal from adverse judgments in housing-eviction cases. And finally, Kaufman v. Carter, No. 6375, is perhaps the most surprising of all eight cases because in that case an indigent mother was denied court-appointed counsel to defend herself against a state civil suit to declare her an unfit mother and take five of her seven children away from her. 
 The Court has decided to note probable jurisdiction in No. 6158, Lindsey v. Normet. Review will be denied in five of the other cases -- Nos. 5048, 5208, 5054, 5971, and 6375 -- while the judgments in the two remaining cases are to be vacated and the cases remanded for reconsideration in light of the decision in Boddie. I agree with my Brethren that Lindsey v. Normet should be set for argument, but I cannot understand why that case is singled out for special treatment and why distinctions are made between the other cases. For the reasons set out below, I would grant the petitions or note probable jurisdiction in each of the other cases and set them for argument or reverse them outright on the basis of the decision in Boddie. 
 In my view, the decision in Boddie v. Connecticut can safely rest on only one crucial foundation -- that the civil courts of the United States and each of the States belong to the people of this country and that no person can be denied access to those courts, either for a trial or an appeal, because he cannot pay a fee, finance a 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 956
 bond, risk a penalty, or afford to hire an attorney. Some may sincerely believe that the decision in Boddie was far more limited in scope -- that is, applies only to divorce cases. Other people might recognize that this constitutional decision will eventually extend to all civil cases but believe that it can only be enforced slowly step by step, so that the country will have time to absorb its full import. But in my judgment Boddie cannot and should not be limited to either its facts or its language, and I believe there can be no doubt that this country can afford to provide court costs and lawyers to Americans who are now barred by their poverty from resort to the law for resolution of their disputes. 
 The opinion in Boddie attempts to draw two distinctions between divorce and other disputes. The Court there stated that access to the judicial process in divorce matters is the ""exclusive precondition to the adjustment of a fundamental human relationship."" Supra, at 383. The two elements, then, that require open access to the courts are that the judicial mechanism be the ""exclusive"" means of resolving the dispute and that the dispute involve ""fundamental"" subject matter. The first element -- the ""exclusiveness"" of the judicial process as a remedy -- is no limitation at all. The States and the Federal Government hold the ultimate power of enforcement in almost every dispute. Every law student learns in the first semester of law school that property, for instance, is ""valuable"" only because the State will enforce the collection of rights that attach to its ownership. Thus, the State holds the ultimate remedy in almost every property dispute. Similarly, the wrong that gives rise to a right of damages in tort exists only because society's lawmakers have created a standard of care and a duty to abide by that standard. The alternatives to resort to the judicial process in tort cases are negotiation and settlement, abandonment of recovery, private self-help, 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 957
 and perhaps insurance. With the exception of insurance, the alternatives are exactly the same as in a divorce case -- negotiate a separation agreement, decide to continue the marriage relationship, or violate the law. Likewise, contracts are valuable only because society will enforce them. Indeed, marriage itself when analyzed in purely legal terms is a contract that cannot be revoked without governmental approval. Thus, the judicial process is the exclusive means through which almost any dispute can ultimately be resolved short of brute force. 
 The other distinction between divorce and different kinds of controversies suggested in the Boddie opinion is the degree to which the disputes are regarded as ""fundamental."" The extent to which this requirement limits the holding of Boddie is found in the very facts of that decision -- the right to seek a divorce is simply not very "" fundamental"" in the hierarchy of disputes. Marriage is one of the cornerstones of our civilized society. Society generally places a high value on marriage and a low value on the right to divorce. And since Boddie held that the right to a divorce was ""fundamental,"" I can only conclude that almost every other kind of legally 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 958
 enforceable right is also fundamental to our society. Society generally encourages people to seek recompense when they suffer damages through the fault of others. And I cannot believe that my Brethren would find the rights of a man with both legs cut off by a negligent railroad less "" fundamental"" than a person's right to seek a divorce. Even the need to be on the welfare rolls or to file for a discharge in bankruptcy seems to me to be more ""fundamental"" than a person's right to seek a divorce. Society provides welfare to ensure the survival of the unfortunate. And bankruptcy is designed to permit a man to make a new start unhampered by overwhelming debts in hopes of achieving a useful life. For this Court to have first provided for governmental assumption of civil court costs in a divorce case seems to me a most unfortunate point of departure. But since that step has now been taken, I would either overrule Boddie at once or extend the benefits of government-paid costs to other civil litigants whose interests are at least as important to an orderly society. 
 In my judgment, the crucial foundation on which Boddie rests also forbids denial of an indigent's right of appeal in civil cases merely because he is too poor to pay appeal costs. Once the right to unhampered access to the judicial process has been established, that right is diluted unless the indigent litigant has an opportunity to assert and obtain review of the errors committed at trial. Since Boddie rejected distinctions between the civil and the criminal process in determining the permissibility of restrictions upon access to the courts, we need only apply to civil cases our long line of holdings that indigent criminals cannot because of their indigency be denied an appeal or the right to a state-furnished record on appeal. See Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 ( 1956); Draper v. Washington, 372 U.S. 487 (1963); Long v. District Court of Iowa, 385 U.S. 192 (1966); Roberts v. LaVallee, 389 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 959
 U.S. 40 (1967); Williams v. Oklahoma City, 395 U.S. 458 (1969). See also Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963). 
 Finally, there cannot be meaningful access to the judicial process until every serious litigant is represented by competent counsel. Cf. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963); Douglas v. California, supra. Of course, not every litigant would be entitled to appointed counsel no matter how frivolous his claims might be. See Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 674 (1958). But the fundamental importance of legal representation in our system of adversary justice is beyond dispute. Since Boddie held that there must be meaningful access to civil courts in divorce cases, I can only conclude that Boddie necessitates the appointment of counsel for indigents in such cases. In fact, this Court has held that attorneys' fees are part of the costs of litigation and may be taxed as costs. Sprague v. Ticonic National Bank, 307 U.S. 161 (1939). And as with fees and transcripts, I will never agree to limit the advantages of free counsel to divorce cases. See n. 1, supra. The necessity of state-appointed counsel is particularly acute in cases like one of those before us, Kaufman v. Carter, where the State initiates a civil proceeding against an individual to deprive her of the custody of her children. Here the State is employing the judicial mechanism it has created to enforce society's will upon an individual and take away her children. The case by its very nature resembles a criminal prosecution. The defendant is charged with conduct -- failure to care properly for her children -- which may be criminal and which in any event is viewed as reprehensible and morally wrong by a majority of society. And the cost of being unsuccessful is dearly high -- loss of the companionship of one's children. Indeed, Boddie held that an indigent was entitled to state-paid courts costs in a divorce contest, and such cases almost always 
Page 402 U.S. 936 , 960
 involve the custody of children. Certainly, if the State must provide funds for an indigent mother's court costs for a divorce, the State should also provide her with counsel to protect her rights to something far more important to most mothers and to society -- her right to custody of her children. 
 For the reasons expressed above and given in the decision in Boddie I would set each of these cases for argument or reverse them outright and hold that citizens cannot be barred from their courts because they are too poor to afford the required fees and bonds or because they cannot hire the professional legal help essential to turn the wheels of justice. There is simply no fairness or justice in a legal system which pays indigents' costs to get divorces and does not aid them in other civil cases which are frequently of far greater importance to society.
