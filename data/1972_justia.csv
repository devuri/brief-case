No. 71-678
Argued November 15, 1972
Decided December 18, 1972
409 U.S. 249

Syllabus 
Petitioners, invoking federal admiralty jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1333(1), brought suit for damages resulting from the crash-landing and sinking in the navigable waters of Lake Erie of their jet aircraft shortly after takeoff from a Cleveland airport.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of admiralty jurisdiction on the grounds that the alleged tort had neither a maritime locality nor a maritime nexus.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the first ground.
Held:  Neither the fact that an aircraft goes down on navigable waters nor that the negligence ""occurs"" while the aircraft is flying over such waters is sufficient to confer federal admiralty jurisdiction over aviation tort claims, and, in the absence of legislation to the contrary, such jurisdiction exists with respect to those claims only when there is a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity.  Therefore, federal admiralty jurisdiction does not extend to aviation tort claims arising from flights like the one involved here between points within the continental United States.  Pp.  409 U. S. 253-274.
448 F.2d 151, affirmed.
STEWART, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

 IRISH NORTHERN AID COMMITTEEv. ATTORNEY GENERAL OF the UNITED STATES.No. 72-521. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 18, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN concur, dissenting. 
 Petitioner is registered as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, 22 U.S.C. 611 et seq. (1970). The District Court ordered it to comply with the Act by filing, inter alia, a statement of contributions which included the names of contributors. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in an unreported order. I believe that the Foreign Agents Registration Act does not authorize the Attorney General to require lists of the names and addresses of contributors, as he has done in 28 CFR 5.201(e). Cf. Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116 (1958). I would therefore grant the petition for writ of certiorari and reverse. The Foreign Agents Registration Act sets out an extensive scheme to regulate the activities of foreign agents. But the scheme is not all- encompassing. Its purpose is to inform the American people of the activities of the agents of foreign principals so that the people may carefully 'appraise them and the purposes for which they act.' H.R.Rep. No. 1470, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966); 1966 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.News, pp. 2397, 2398. Congress has determined that we must know the extent to which a foreign agent is supported by his principal so that we may properly evaluate the agent's interest in the views he presents. To that end, the statute requires the agent to disclose 'the nature and amount of contributions, income, money, or thing of value, if any, that the registrant has received . . . from each such foreign principal.' 22 U.S.C . 612(a)(5). Prior to its amendment in 1966, the statute did require the disclosure of the name and address of 'any person who has . . . contributed or paid money or anything of 
Page 409 U.S. 1080 , 1081
 value to the registrant.' 56 Stat. 248, 252. This provision was omitted in 1966, leaving 612(a)(5) as essentially the only provision requiring disclosure of contributors. [Footnote 1] 

 The amendments adopted in 1966 were intended to limit the scope of the previous act and thereby to make effective enforcement more likely. In language repeated in each subsequent Committee report on the proposed revision, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations referred to its bill as 'better focusing the act on those individuals performing political or semipolitical activities.' S.Rep. No. 875, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1964). 2 The Committee said, 'Too broadly written for today's needs, the present act's disclosure provisions have through the years been too narrowly enforced with the emphasis paid on subversive or potentially subversive [409 U.S. 1080 , 1082]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 18, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petioner, a nonimmigrant student, was admitted to the United States in January 1962, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15), with authorization to remain in the country in that status until January 28, 1968. In June 1967, deportation proceedings were initiated against petitioner on the grounds that he had failed to maintain his student status; these proceedings were apparently dropped. [Footnote 1] On This application was denied by the Special Inquiry Officer on the grounds that the petitioner's primary interest in remaining in the United States was to work as a street vendor and not to pursue his educational interests. Petitioner was granted until May 21, 1969, to leave the country. On May 13, 1969, his application for reconsideration, wherein he verified his admission to the Washington Technical Institute, was denied. On March 4, 1970, a deportation hearing was held at which time petitioner was represented by counsel. The Special Inquiry Officer found petitioner deportable. On appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals observed that the principal basis for petitioner's appeal-the denial of his request for an extension of his student visa-was not appealable or subject to review. 8 Code of Federal Regulations 214.2(f)(4), a rule promulgated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, indicates that there is no review available of the decisions on applications for extensions of student visas. 'The applicant shall be notified of the decision and, if the application is denied, of the reason therefor. No appeal shall lie from the decision.' In light of this Court's decisions, 
Page 409 U.S. 1086 , 1087
 recognizing the fundamental rights involved in deportation, this regulation denies applicants due process of law. 
 As early as 1921 this Court recognized that fundamental rights were involved in observing that not only does deportation2 deprive a person of his liberty, but, '[i]t may result also in loss of both property and life; or of all that makes life worth living.' (Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 282) Because of the nature of the deprivation, although deportation is not technically a criminal penalty, this Court has concluded that '. . . deportation is a penalty-at times a most serious one-. . .. Meticulous care must be exercised lest the procedure by which he [the alien] is deprived of that liberty not meet the essential standards of fairness.' (Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 154, 89 L.ed. 2103.) 
 This Court has held that the denial of a motion to reopen by the Special Inquiry Officer is reviewable as a 'final order of deportation.' ( Giova v. Rosenberg, 379 U.S. 18; Foti v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 375 U.S. 217, 11 L. Ed.2d 281.) At least one federal district court has interpreted these cases to authorize judicial review of a decision on an issue stemming from a deportation proceeding. (Rose v. Woolwine, 344 F.2d 993 (CA4).) 
 Contrary to regulation 214.2(f)(4), an order of the Special Inquiry Officer denying an application for an extension of time under a currently valid visa does operate as a final order and must be subject to judicial review. [409 U.S. 1086 , 1088]

 Bentley Andrew DYEv. NEW JERSEY.No. 72-5535. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 18, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of New Jersey. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. Petitioner was convicted of bookmaking in violation of state law. The evidence from which the conviction resulted arose primarily from a wiretap of a telephone on the premises where petitioner was employed. Petitioner challenges the admissibility of the wiretap product on the grounds that the judicial authorization was not in conformity with the state statute authorizing wiretapping (N.J.S.A. 2A:156A-1) and that the wiretap violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Pursuant to judicial authorization a wiretap was placed on the pay telephone located in the restaurant-bar-liquor store in which petitioner was employed. The affidavits supporting the request for authorization of the tap included the following information: That the police had been advised that the number of the telephone in question was listed many times on the toll receipt of another telephone which was located at a place where there was 'good reason to believe,' pursuant to a different investigation, that bookmaking operations were being conducted; that police stakeouts in the restaurant-bar-liquor store overheard both petitioner and an unidentified male make a call on the telephone in which betting information was passed and that petitioner was observed taking notes from the sports pages of the newspaper and having guarded conversations with customers; that when a reliable informer was requested to call the telephone number and place a bet, petitioner refused to take the bet, leading the informer to believe that petitioner would not deal with strangers. Mr. Justice BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this petition. From the above facts, the law division judge concluded that sufficient exigent circumstances existed for 
Page 409 U.S. 1090 , 1091
 concluding that traditional investigative techniques would be unproductive, and issued a warrant which authorized the placing of a wiretap on the telephone between the hours of 10 a. m. and 3 p. m., Monday through Saturday for a 30-day period, with directions that the interception begin as soon as practicable. The order also directed that the wiretap be conducted in such a way as to minimize or eliminate the interception of communications other than the type described. Those communications subject to seizure were described as 'communications of Bentley Dye [petitioner] relating to the offenses of Bookmaking and Conspiracy from telephone facility number 201-725-9743.' 
 Pursuant to the order, the police placed a wiretap on the telephone which was operative for 27 days. Over 105 hours of conversations were tapped. A master tape of those conversations allegedly involving bookmaking and the conspiracy was made and it ran about 2 1/2 hours. The recordings of nonrelated communications were sealed. (No reason is given as to why they were not destroyed.) On several days when petitioner was not at work the wiretap remained in effect, recording any calls made on the telephone. 
 In Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 63, this Court held that '[w]hile the requirements of the Fourth Amendment are not inflexible, or obtusely unyielding to the legitimate needs of law enforcement . . . it is not asking too much that officers be required to comply with the basic command of the Fourth Amendment before the innermost secrets of one's home or office are invaded. Few threats to liberty exist which are greater that that posed by the use of eavesdropping devices.' 
 In Berger, the language of the New York statute authorizing the wiretap was held to be unconstitutionally broad, because authorization thereunder operated as the issuance of an illegal general warrant. The authoriza- [409 U.S. 1090 , 1092]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 11, 1972
 Application for stay. 
 The application for a stay presented to Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and by him referred to the Court is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, a lieutenant in the United States Army Reserves, has asked this Court for a stay of the order requiring him to report to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, for active duty for training concededly a part of his military obligation. He claims, however, that he is entitled to a medical discharge. 
 Petitioner was examined by three physicians at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center in Illinois. Each was a specialist in the area in which he conducted his examination. Purporting to follow Army regulations governing the standards for retention in the Army, one determined that petitioner has a disqualifying foot condition and another that he has a disqualifying allergic condition. The third, a psychiatrist, found that petitioner's psychiatric condition, if further documented, would render him ineligible for service. Despite these findings, the Surgeon General, exercising his ex parte discretion pursuant to Army Regulation 40-501, determined that petitioner is qualified for active duty. The only substantiation for that decision submitted to the Court is a letter written by the Surgeon General to Senator Percy, in which he stated that petitioner's problems are not of sufficient severity to render him unfit under Army regulations. [Footnote 1] 

 Petition brought an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, challenging the decision of the Surgeon General on the grounds 
Page 409 U.S. 1056 , 1057
 that it constituted an abuse of discretion and was without a basis in fact. While this action was pending, petitioner was ordered to active duty for training. [Footnote 2] Subsequently, the District Court granted summary judgment for the Government, finding that the Surgeon General's action was not arbitrary or capricious. Petitioner's appeal from that judgment is now pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which refused to stay pending appeal his order to active duty. [Footnote 3] 

 Petitioner does not challenge the validity of the regulation allowing the Surgeon General to review the decisions of examining physicians. And, indeed, it may be that petitioner is in fact qualified for retention and that the Surgeon General has not abused his discretion. The difficulty I have with the procedure afforded petitioner is that the record does not disclose any basis for the Surgeon General's action. When the District Court concluded that the decision was not arbitrary or capricious and granted summary judgment for the Government, it in effect refused to inquire into the basis for overriding the judgment of the specialists who had examined petitioner. This amounts to a conclusion that the Surgeon General has unreviewable discretion. 
 However one views the merits of military service, there can be no question that it results in very real and severe restrictions on personal liberty. We have always demanded that such restraints, as a minimum, accord with accepted notions of procedural due process. In Securities and Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94 we stated: 'The Commission's action cannot be upheld merely because findings [409 U.S. 1056 , 1058]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 11, 1972
 Rehearing Denied Jan. 22, 1973. See 410 U.S. 918. 
 On petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN join, dissenting. 
 Acting on an informant's tip that one 'Cherokee' had a mill for diluting narcotics in a certain apartment building, police officers secured the consent of the landlord to search, and then searched the basement area of the building open to use by both landlord and tenants. In one storage room they saw a closed, but unlocked trunk, on top of which were a can of milk-sugar, a scale, rubber bands, and a brown paper bag with a message telling 'Cherokee' that 'we are out of . . . action.' The trunk was then opened. Heroin and narcotics paraphernalia were discovered, seized and used against Cherokee who was latter arrested and tried. Whether the search of the trunk and seizure of its contents squared with the Fourth Amendment is a substantial question warranting review here. The seizure was not incident to petitioner's arrest, which occurred later at another place. The officers were legally in the storage room by virtue of the landlord's consent, Frazier v. Cupp, 394 U.S. 731, 740 (1969), but nothing in the trunk was in plain view as long as the trunk was unopened, and it would seem that the landlord had no authority whatsoever to consent to the search of the trunk or the seizure of its contents, which were petitioner's effects within the protection of the Fourth Amendment. The United States argues that there was probable cause to search the trunk and a warrant should not be required, because the items sought could be so easily moved. The Court has embraced such a rationale in the Carroll- Chambers line of cases with respect to automobiles, but 
Page 409 U.S. 1065 , 1066
 has expressly questioned this approach with respect to other movable personal property. See Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 461 n. 18 (1971) ('We have found no case that suggests such an extension of Carroll' to 'containers' that are 'equally movable, e. g., trunks, suitcases, boxes, briefcases, and bags'). Moreover, in Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969), searches incident to arrest were limited to the person and immediate vicinity, even though there is clearly probable cause to believe that contraband or evidence of crime will be found elsewhere on the premises where the arrest takes place. The Court there rejected the argument urged in dissent that a warrant could be dispensed with to avoid the disappearance of the property for which there was probable cause to search. 
 Because the decision below is arguably at odds with decisions of this Court, I would grant the petition for certiorari.

 December 11, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN concurs, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were convicted of sexually assaulting a fellow inmate while incarcerated in the Federal Youth Center in violation of 18 U.S.C. 13 and 1963 Colo.Rev.Stat. 40-2-31. Immediately following the assault, petitioners were placed in segregated confinement and were not arraigned until more than five months later, after an indictment had been returned. They appealed their convictions, in part on the ground that they had not been brought promptly before a United States Commissioner as required by Rule 5(a) of the Federal 
Page 409 U.S. 1066 , 1067
 Rules of Criminal Procedure.* The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that 'Rule 5 does not apply when the person affected is in custody pursuant to an unrelated valid conviction.' Accord, United States v. Reid, 437 F.2d 1166 (CA7 1971). 
 The result below stemmed from a narrow, technical reading of the word 'arrest' in Rule 5(a). Since petitioners 'were already in custody for unrelated convictions,' according to the Court of Appeals, they had not been 'arrested' for the alleged offense. The issue presented here is whether Rule 5(a) should be interpreted in this myopic fashion, without regard to the policies underlying Rule 5 as a whole. 
 Rule 5(b) requires the commissioner inter alia to 'inform the defendant . . . of his right to retain counsel, of his right to request the assignment of counsel if he is unable to obtain counsel . . .. He shall also inform the defendant that he is not required to make a statement and that any statement made by him may be used against him.' A basic purpose of this rule is to interpose a judicial officer between the accused and the accuser early in the process of custodial interrogation. This procedure insures that the accused is objectively and intelligently apprised of his rights and helps prevent the 'utilization of intensive interrogation, easily gliding into the evils of 'the third degree.""

Syllabus 
Two tenants of an apartment complex filed complaints with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development alleging that their landlord racially discriminated against nonwhites, that the tenants thereby lost the social benefits of living in an integrated community, missed business and professional advantages that would have accrued from living with members of minority groups, and suffered from being ""stigmatized"" as residents of a ""white ghetto.""  The District Court, not reaching the merits, held that the complaining tenants were not within the class of persons entitled to sue under  810(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.  The Court of Appeals, in affirming, construed  810(a) to permit complaints only by persons who are the objects of discriminatory housing practices.
Held:  The definition in  810(a) of ""person aggrieved,"" as ""any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice,"" shows a congressional intention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by Article III of the Constitution, and petitioners, being tenants of the apartment complex, have standing to sue under  810(a).

No. 71-224
Argued October 11, 1972
Decided December 7, 1972
409 U.S. 224

Syllabus 
During respondent's trial for murder, he challenged the voluntariness of his confession.  A full evidentiary hearing was held outside the jury's presence, following which the trial court held the confession admissible.  After affirmance of respondent's conviction on appeal, respondent sought state post-conviction relief.  The Missouri Supreme Court reversed the denial of respondent's motion to vacate, and an evidentiary hearing was held by the St. Louis Circuit Court on the voluntariness issue.  That court concluded that the trial judge himself had found the confession voluntary, and thus complied with Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368.  The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed, and held additionally that respondent had been given a new evidentiary hearing by the St. Louis court and that his confession had again been found to be voluntary.  Respondent then sought federal habeas corpus.  The District Court determined that Jackson v. Denno had been satisfied.

Held:  The trial court's Jakson v.

No. 71-224
Argued October 11, 1972
Decided December 7, 1972
409 U.S. 224

Syllabus 
During respondent's trial for murder, he challenged the voluntariness of his confession.  A full evidentiary hearing was held outside the jury's presence, following which the trial court held the confession admissible.  After affirmance of respondent's conviction on appeal, respondent sought state post-conviction relief.  The Missouri Supreme Court reversed the denial of respondent's motion to vacate, and an evidentiary hearing was held by the St. Louis Circuit Court on the voluntariness issue.  That court concluded that the trial judge himself had found the confession voluntary, and thus complied with Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368.  The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed, and held additionally that respondent had been given a new evidentiary hearing by the St. Louis court and that his confession had again been found to be voluntary.  Respondent then sought federal habeas corpus.  The District Court determined that Jackson v. Denno had been satisfied.  The Court of Appeals, concluding that the trial judge, as permitted by then-prevailing state law, had not made the voluntariness finding himself, but had submitted the issue to the jury, reversed and held that respondent was entitled to a new hearing.

Decided December 6, 1972
409 U.S. 188

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of rape on evidence that consisted in part of testimony concerning the victim's visual and voice identification of respondent at a station-house showup that occurred seven months after the rape.  The victim, who had been in the presence of her assailant a considerable time and had directly observed hm indoors and under a full moon outdoors, testified that she had ""no doubt"" that respondent was her assailant.  She had previously given the police a description of her assailant, which was confirmed by a police officer.  Before the showup where she identified respondent, the victim had made no identification of others who were presented at previous showups, lineups, or through photographs.  The police asserted that they used the showup technique because they had difficulty in finding for a lineup other individuals generally fitting respondent's description as given by the victim.  The Tennessee Supreme Court's affirmance of the conviction was affirmed here by an equally divided Court.  390 U. S. 404.  Respondent then brought a habeas corpus action in District Court.  After rejecting the petitioner's contention that this Court's affirmance constituted an actual adjudication within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  2244(c) and thus barred further review of the showup identification in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, the District Court, noting that a lineup is relatively more reliable than a showup, held that the confrontation here was so suggestive as to violate due process.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. This Court's equally divided affirmance of respondent's state court conviction does not, under 28 U.S.C.  2244(c), bar further federal relief by habeas corpus, since such an affirmance merely ends the process of direct review, but settles no issue of law.  Pp.  409 U. S. 190-192.
2. While the station-house identification may have been suggestive, under the totality of the circumstances, the victim's identification of respondent was reliable and was properly allowed to go to the jury.  Pp.  409 U. S. 196-201.

409 U.S. 57

Syllabus 
Petitioner was denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial judicial officer as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment where he was compelled to stand trial for traffic offenses before the mayor, who was responsible for village finances and whose court, through fines, forfeitures, costs, and fees, provided a substantial portion of village funds.  Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510.  A statutory provision for the disqualification of interested or biased judges did not accord petitioner sufficient safeguard, and it is of no constitutional relevance that petitioner could later be tried de novo in another court, as he was entitled to an impartial judge in the first instance.  Pp.  409 U. S. 59-62.
27 Ohio St.2d 179, 271 N.E.2d 757, reversed and remanded.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 13, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 I regret that the Court does not take this occasion to lay down some further ground rules for the conduct of criminal cases involving electronic surveillance, in the sensitive area, which involves both the Fourth and the Sixth Amendments. 
 In Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, we laid down rules governing the district courts where there had been electronic surveillance of the defendant in a criminal case or where in other surveillance his words had been recorded. Alderman and its descendants made possible the conduct of criminal trials with fairness to all sides and with no disturbance to orderly proceedings. 
 The present case is one of several that have come across my desk this year involving not the surveillance of a 
Page 409 U.S. 1013 , 1014
 defendant in a criminal case but the surveillance of his lawyer. 
 It is time, I think, that we hold that the confidences of the lawyer- client relationship remain inviolate. It is also time that we set forth the prescribed procedures in an Alderman type of opinion. 
 The problems where the lawyer is involved seem to me to be as critical as those where the defendant's privacy under the Fourth Amendment is violated. [Footnote 1] The ruling [409 U.S. 1013 , 1015]

 November 13, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 Petitioner and Lynette Murphy lived together as husband and wife in Collinsville, Oklahoma, from September 1970 through the end of January 1971. After leaving petitioner, Lynette went to live with her sister and brother-in-law, Lana and Larry Sanders, in Collinsville. At approximately 8 p. m. on February 2, 1971, petitioner went to the Sanders' residence, displayed a gun, and informed Gary Hany, another occupant, that he intended to take Lynette with him. After a wait of approximately 45 minutes, Lynette, Lana, and Larry arrived at the residence. Petitioner told Lynette that if she refused to go with him he would kill them all. Lynette became 'kind of shook up' and agreed to go. Petitioner then 
Page 409 U.S. 1017 , 1018
 took Larry Sanders' money (three dollars) and car keys, and left with Lynette in the Sanders' car. After an extensive chase, petitioner was apprehended by the Oklahoma police and was charged with kidnaping, two counts of armed robbery, and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.* 
 Although all of these charges arose out of the 'same transaction or occurrence,' they were prosecuted by the State in two separate proceedings. At the first trial, petitioner was convicted of the armed robbery of Larry Sanders. At the second trial, he was convicted of kidnaping Lynette Murphy, and was acquitted of a charge of armed robbery of Lana Sanders. Petitioner's contention that this second prosecution was barred by the provisions against double jeopardy in both the state and federal constitutions was rejected by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, one judge dissenting. Grubb v. State, Okl.Cr., 497 P.2d 1305 (1972). 
 I would grant the petition for certiorari and reverse. I adhere to my view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 (1969), requires the prosecution, except in most limited circumstances not present here, 'to join at one trial all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction.'

No. 71-895
Argued October 12, 1972
Decided November 7, 1972
409 U.S. 48

Syllabus 
Four employees of respondent refused to cross a picket line formed in connection with a union's organization campaign. Respondent thereafter advised the employees that because of their failure to report to work they were being permanently replaced, which was not true at the time of the discharges.  When respondent refused reinstatement, charges were filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  Concluding that the discharges were unfair labor practices under the National Labor Relations Act, and that the employees thereby became unfair labor practice strikers, the NLRB ordered unconditional reinstatement with back pay.  The Court of Appeals reversed that portion of the NLRB's order, holding that the employees were not unfair labor practice strikers, who were entitled to unconditional reinstatement, but economic strikers, who were not entitled to reinstatement if the employer had substantial business justifications for refusing to rehire them.
Held:  The unconditional reinstatement of the employees was proper, since their discriminatory discharges prior to the time their places were filled constituted unfair labor practices regardless of whether they were economic strikers or unfair labor practice strikers.  Pp.  409 U. S. 52-53.

|409 u.s. 41|"Murch v. Mottram
No. 72-55
Decided November 6, 1972
409 U.S. 41

Syllabus 
In a 1965 proceeding, respondent substituted for his original attack on the constitutional validity of his underlying convictions a petition challenging only the constitutionality of procedures attending revocation of his parole, notwithstanding advice that, under the judge's construction of Maine's statute governing post-conviction relief, a prisoner is deemed to waive constitutional grounds not asserted, and that both the petition and the previous attack came within the statute.  Respondent's 1965 challenge was not successful, and, in 1967, he filed another petition for state post-conviction relief, collaterally attacking the validity of the previous convictions.  Following an adverse ruling by the State's highest court, respondent sought relief in the District Court, which ruled against him on the ground that, in the 1965 proceeding, he had bypassed the state statutory procedures.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent had not waived his right to raise the constitutional issues.
Held:  Maine could properly provide that a prisoner seeking post-conviction relief must assert all known constitutional claims in a single proceeding, and a state prisoner may not ""elect"" not to comply with a state court's interpretation of the statute and claim, as respondent (who had received fair warning) did here, that he did not have the subjective intent to waive his constitutional claims.

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN concurs, dissenting. 
 I would grant certiorari in this case. 
 Petitioner was convicted of rape and sentenced to life imprisonment. At trial petitioner took the stand and admitted the fact of intercourse, but argued that the alleged victim had consented. Upon cross-examination by the State, petitioner was asked if he had talked with 
Page 409 U.S. 995 , 996
 two police officers making certain statements while in custody and admitting his use of force. Petitioner replied that he had talked with the officers but denied making the statements. In rebuttal, the State called the two police officers to the stand. Over petitioner's objection they testified that petitioner had admitted to them just after his arrest that he had used force to subdue the victim. Prior to this testimony the trial judge instructed the jury that the testimony was being offered solely for the purpose of impeaching the defendant, and not as substantive evidence. There was no allegation that prior to the time the alleged statement was made to the officers, petitioner had been advised of his rights under Miranda v. United States, 384 U.S. 436. Nor was there ever any determination as to the voluntariness of petitioner's alleged statements.* 
 A defendant's constitutional right to the fullest opportunity to meet the accusations against him and to be free to deny all the elements of the case against him (Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62), must include the right to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will. The allowance of tainted statements to impeach the accused who takes the stand fetters that choice. The instant case is just another example of the way Harris v. New York, 401 [409 U.S. 995 , 997]

 PRESIDENTS COUNCIL, DISTRICT 25 et al.v. COMMUNITY SCHOOL BOARD NO. 25 et al.No. 72-109. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 6, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The motion of The Authors League of America, Inc., for leave to file a brief, as amicus curiae, is granted. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 A book entitled Down These Mean Streets by Piri Thomas was purchased by the librarians of three junior high schools in School District 25 in Queens, New York. The novel describes in graphic detail sexual and drug and drug related activities that are a part of everyday life for those who live in Spanish Harlem. Its purpose was to acquaint the youth of Queens with the problems of their contemporaries in this social setting. The book was objected to by some parents and after a public meeting the School Board by a vote of 5-3 banned it from the libraries. A later vote by the Board amended the order so the book is now kept on the shelves for direct loan to any parent who wants his or her children to have access to it. To child can borrow it directly. This suit was brought on behalf of a principal, a librarian, and various parents and children who request that the court declare the resolution adopted by the Board unconstitutional, and order the defendants to place the book on normal circulation in the libraries and enjoin them from interfering with other school libraries within their jurisdiction which desire to purchase the book. Actions of school boards are not immune from constitutional scrutiny, Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923); Bartels v. Iowa, 262 U.S. 404 67 L.Ed. 1047 (1923); Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 21 l.ed.2d 228 (1968); Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 21 L. Ed.2d 731 (1969). Academic freedom has been upheld against attack on various fronts.

 Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234 (1957 ); Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183 (1952); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 ( 1967). The First Amendment involves not only the right to speak and publish but also the right to hear, to learn, to know. Martin v. Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 143; Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564; Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 534; Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 386, 390. And this Court has recognized that this right to know is 'nowhere more vital than in our schools and universities,' Kleindient v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753; Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 487 (1960); Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250 (1957); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967). The book involved is not alleged to be obscene either under the standards of Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957); or under the stricter standards for minors set forth in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968). 
 The Board, however, contends that a book with such vivid accounts of Sordid and perverted occurrences is not good for junior high students. At trial both sides produced expert witnesses to prove the value and/or harm of the novel. At school the children are allowed to discuss the contents of the book and the social problems to portrays. They can do everything but read it. This in my mind lessens somewhat the contention that the subject matter of the book is not proper.

 PRESIDENTS COUNCIL, DISTRICT 25 et al.v. COMMUNITY SCHOOL BOARD NO. 25 et al.No. 72-109. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 6, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The motion of The Authors League of America, Inc., for leave to file a brief, as amicus curiae, is granted. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 A book entitled Down These Mean Streets by Piri Thomas was purchased by the librarians of three junior high schools in School District 25 in Queens, New York. The novel describes in graphic detail sexual and drug and drug related activities that are a part of everyday life for those who live in Spanish Harlem. Its purpose was to acquaint the youth of Queens with the problems of their contemporaries in this social setting. The book was objected to by some parents and after a public meeting the School Board by a vote of 5-3 banned it from the libraries. A later vote by the Board amended the order so the book is now kept on the shelves for direct loan to any parent who wants his or her children to have access to it. To child can borrow it directly. This suit was brought on behalf of a principal, a librarian, and various parents and children who request that the court declare the resolution adopted by the Board unconstitutional, and order the defendants to place the book on normal circulation in the libraries and enjoin them from interfering with other school libraries within their jurisdiction which desire to purchase the book. Actions of school boards are not immune from constitutional scrutiny, Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923); Bartels v. Iowa, 262 U.S. 404 67 L.Ed. 1047 (1923); Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 21 l.ed.2d 228 (1968); Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 21 L. Ed.2d 731 (1969). Academic freedom has been upheld against attack on various fronts.

 Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234 (1957 ); Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183 (1952); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 ( 1967). The First Amendment involves not only the right to speak and publish but also the right to hear, to learn, to know. Martin v. Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 143; Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564; Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 534; Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 386, 390. And this Court has recognized that this right to know is 'nowhere more vital than in our schools and universities,' Kleindient v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753; Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 487 (1960); Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250 (1957); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967). The book involved is not alleged to be obscene either under the standards of Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957); or under the stricter standards for minors set forth in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968). 
 The Board, however, contends that a book with such vivid accounts of Sordid and perverted occurrences is not good for junior high students. At trial both sides produced expert witnesses to prove the value and/or harm of the novel. At school the children are allowed to discuss the contents of the book and the social problems to portrays. They can do everything but read it. This in my mind lessens somewhat the contention that the subject matter of the book is not proper. 
 The First Amendment is a preferred right and is of great importance in the schools. In Tinker, the Court held that the First Amendment can only be restricted in the schools when a disciplinary problem is raised. No such allegation is asserted here. What else can the School Board now decide it does not like? How else will its sensibilities be offended? Are we sending children to school to be educated by the norms of [409 U.S. 998 , 1000]

 Edward F. O'BRIEN et al.v. Albert SKINNER, Sheriff, Monroe County, New York, et al.No. A-484. 
 Nov. 6, 1972.

 Applicants, 72 prisoners in County Jail in Monroe County, New York, applied to me in my capacity as a Circuit Justice for a stay of a New York Court of Appeals judgment entered November 3, 1972. 
 The applicants are either convicted misdemeanants or persons who have been convicted of no crime but are awaiting trial. New York law makes no provision for the disfranchisement of these groups. Nonetheless, applicants allege that they have been prevented from registering to vote because correctional and election officials have refused to provide them with absentee ballots, refused to establish mobile voting and registration equipment at the prison, and refused to transport them to the polls. Applicants argue that these restrictions on their right of franchise are not supported by the sort of 'compelling state interest' that this Court has in the past 
Page 409 U.S. 1240 , 1241
 required. See, .e.G. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 31 L. Ed.2d 274 (1972). They challenge the constitutionality of the New York statute that permits absentee voting by persons confined to state institutions by reason of physical disability but makes no provision for absentee voting by persons confined to state prisons after misdemeanor convictions or while awaiting trial. 
 In response, respondents rely on this Court's decision in McDonald v. Board of Election Comm'rs, 394 U.S. 802 ( 1969). In McDonald we held that, under the circumstances of that case, the mere allegation that Illinois had denied absentee ballots to unsentenced inmates awaiting trial in the Cook County jail did not make out a constitutional claim. I am not persuaded, however, that McDonald governs this case. Cf. Goosby v. Osser, 452 F.2d 39 (CA3 1971), cert. granted, 408 U.S. 922 (1972). In McDonald there was 'nothing in the record to indicate that the Illinois statutory scheme (had) an impact on appellants' ability to exercise the fundamental right to vote.' 394 U.S., at 807. We pointed out that the record was 'barren of any indication that the State might not, for instance, possibly furnish the jails with special polling booths or facilities on election day, or provide guarded transportation to the polls themselves for certain inmates, or entertain motions for temporary reductions in bail to allow some inmates to get to the polls on their own.' Id., at 808 n. 6. Here, in contrast, it seems clear that the State has rejected alternative means by which applicants might exercise their right to vote. Deprivation of absentee ballots is therefore tantamount to deprivation of the franchise itself, and it is axiomatic that courts must 'strictly scrutinize' that discriminatory withdrawal of voting rights. See, e.g., Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 667, 670 (1966). [409 U.S. 1240 , 1242]

 CONFEDERATION LIFE INSURANCE COMPANYv. Hector deLARA et al.No. 71-1487. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 24, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, concurs, dissenting. 
 I dissent from the Court's refusal to grant certiorari to consider whether the Florida Supreme Court's choice of law in this action on a life insurance contract deprived petitioner of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and the principles established in Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, 281 U.S. 397 (1930). Petitioner, a Canadian insurance company, issued a policy of life insurance in 1938 to German Lopez Sanchez, who was a citizen and resident of Cuba until his death in 1962. The policy provided that all payments would be made in United States dollars, which were then recognized as one of two legal currencies in Cuba. But on June 30, 1951, the government of Cuba suspended the legal tender status of the dollar and decreed that all previously contracted dollar obligations would henceforth be payable exclusively in Cuban pesos at the rate of one peso per dollar. Petitioner concluded that the decree automatically converted the policy from dollars to pesos, and on July 1, 1951, it notified the insured that '[a]ll permiums payable in accordance with this policy as well as all other liability contracted under the same and in which a reference is made to American currency, will from now on be payable in Cuban National currency, at par, in accordance with Law No. 13 of 1948 and Decree No. 1384 of April 1951.' The insured declined to terminate the policy in light of this notification, and made all subsequent payments entirely in pesos. By legislation in 1959 and 1961 the Cuban Government reconfirmed the 1951 decree and provided criminal penalties for its violation. Petitioner 
Page 409 U.S. 953 , 954
 maintains peso reserves in Cuba prescisely for the purpose of meeting its obligations under this and similar contracts, but it is barred by the Cuban currency laws from transferring those funds outside of Cuba. Under Cuban law it thus seems clear that petitioner was obligated to pay the benefits due under the policy only in Cuba and only in pesos. 
 Nevertheless, in this suit brought by respondents, beneficiaries of the insured who are now living in Florida, the Supreme Court of Florida held that petitioner's obligations under the contract should be determined according to Florida law. And applying the law of that State, the court concluded that petitioner was obligated to pay the benefits in Florida and in United States dollars. de Lara v. Confederation Life Assn., 257 So.2d 42 (Fla.1971). 
 Whether the state court correctly applied its own substantive law is, of course, not in issue here. We are concerned only with the state court's choice of law. Petitioner maintains that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes a State from altering 'substantive obligations arising out of a foreign transaction having no significant relation to the state.' The general validity of that proposition is clearly established by Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, 281 U.S. 397 (1930), where we held that the State of Texas was 'without power to affect the terms of the contracts' since 'all acts relating to the making of the policy were done in Mexico.' In an opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis, the Court held that the attempt by the Texas courts 'to impose a greater obligation than that agreed upon and to seize property in payment of the imposed obligation violates the guaranty against deprivation of property without due process of law.' 281 U.S., at 408. 
 In Clay v. Sun Insurance Office, Ltd., 377 U.S. 179 (1964), we reaffirmed by implication the validity of Dick, but [409 U.S. 953 , 955]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 24, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 Section 70(b) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 110(b), provides: '[A]n express covenant that an assignment by operation of law or the bankruptcy of a specified party thereto or of either party shall terminate the lease or give the other party an election to terminate the same is enforceable.' In Finn v. Meighan, 325 U.S. 300 (1945), the Court held 70(b) fully applicable in ch. X reorganization proceedings despite arguments that enforcement of forfeiture clauses could deprive the debtor of property vital to the continuance of the business and so defeat the very purpose of the reorganization proceedings.* The Court said: 'There is some suggestion, however, that that provision is applicable only in ordinary bankruptcy proceedings and not to reorganizations under Ch. X. It is pointed out that frequently the value of enterprises is greatly enhanced by leases on strategic 
Page 409 U.S. 957 , 958
 premises and that if forfeiture clauses were allowed to be enforced, reorganization plans might be seriously impaired. But Congress has made the forfeiture provision of 70 applicable to reorganization proceedings under Ch. X. . . . Thus we must read 70(b) as providing that an express covenant is enforceable which allows the lessor to terminate the lease if a petition to reorganize the lessee under Ch. X is approved. Cf. In re Walker [2 Cir.], 93 F.2d 281. That being the policy adopted by Congress, our duty is to enforce it.' 325 U.S., at 302-303. 
 In the case before use the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit refused to apply 70(b) in a reorganization proceeding and to enforce a termination provision in a lease because to do so, in its opinion, would emasculate the reorganization plan. The Court of Appeals relief on Smith v. Hoboken R. Co., 328 U.S. 123 (1946), where this Court held that 70(b) did not require recognition of a forfeiture provision in the context of a railroad reorganization under 77 because the forfeiture would deprive the Interstate Commerce Commission of its statutory function . The Court was careful to distinguish Finn:

 Section 70(b) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 110(b), provides: '[A]n express covenant that an assignment by operation of law or the bankruptcy of a specified party thereto or of either party shall terminate the lease or give the other party an election to terminate the same is enforceable.' In Finn v. Meighan, 325 U.S. 300 (1945), the Court held 70(b) fully applicable in ch. X reorganization proceedings despite arguments that enforcement of forfeiture clauses could deprive the debtor of property vital to the continuance of the business and so defeat the very purpose of the reorganization proceedings.* The Court said: 'There is some suggestion, however, that that provision is applicable only in ordinary bankruptcy proceedings and not to reorganizations under Ch. X. It is pointed out that frequently the value of enterprises is greatly enhanced by leases on strategic 
Page 409 U.S. 957 , 958
 premises and that if forfeiture clauses were allowed to be enforced, reorganization plans might be seriously impaired. But Congress has made the forfeiture provision of 70 applicable to reorganization proceedings under Ch. X. . . . Thus we must read 70(b) as providing that an express covenant is enforceable which allows the lessor to terminate the lease if a petition to reorganize the lessee under Ch. X is approved. Cf. In re Walker [2 Cir.], 93 F.2d 281. That being the policy adopted by Congress, our duty is to enforce it.' 325 U.S., at 302-303. 
 In the case before use the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit refused to apply 70(b) in a reorganization proceeding and to enforce a termination provision in a lease because to do so, in its opinion, would emasculate the reorganization plan. The Court of Appeals relief on Smith v. Hoboken R. Co., 328 U.S. 123 (1946), where this Court held that 70(b) did not require recognition of a forfeiture provision in the context of a railroad reorganization under 77 because the forfeiture would deprive the Interstate Commerce Commission of its statutory function . The Court was careful to distinguish Finn: "|

 I dissent. I think petitioner's guilty plea entered in New York state court was clearly involuntary, particularly, after our decision last Term in Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257 ( 1971). On October 23, 1968, petitioner was charged in an indictment returned in New York state court with one count of criminally selling a dangerous drug in the second degree1 and one count of criminally selling a dangerous drug in the third degree. [Footnote 2] In November 1968, a second indictment was returned against petitioner in state court charging him with a single count of criminally selling a dangerous drug in the third degree. Prior to the 1969 amendments of the New York Penal Law, criminally selling a dangerous drug in the second degree was punishable by a maximum of 15 years' imprisonment, while the maximum sentence under a third degree charge was seven years' imprisonment. [Footnote 3] At arraignment, petitioner pleaded not guilty to all the charges; the case was set for trial. On February 17, 1969, the State moved for trial. Before the proceedings commenced, the prosecutor, the defense counsel, and the trial judge met in the judge's

 chambers-in the absence of the petitioner-to discuss the case. When the case was subsequently called for disposition, the prosecutor began by stating that he understood petitioner wished to withdraw his earlier pleas of not guilty and to 'enter a plea of guilty to the second count of [the October 23] indictment . . . charging [him] with the crime of Criminally Selling a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree.' At this point the court interrupted the prosecutor and the following exchange occurred:

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 I vote to hear this case because it raises substantial questions of law in the area of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Petitioners are inmates of the Texas Department of Corrections (T. D. C.). They brought a class action under 42 U.S.C.A. 1983, challenging the constitutionality of: (1) a T. D. C. regulation barring all inmate assistance in preparation of legal work. (2) the primitive conditions of the solitary confinement as administered by the T. D. C. The District Court denied relief, Novak v. Beto, 320 F.Supp. 1206 (SD Tex.1970). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit unanimously reversed as to the prohibition on prisoners' legal assistance, holding the State had not met its burden of providing alternatives to assure access to the courts as required by Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483 (1969). A divided Court affirmed the constitutionality of the conditions of solitary confinement. Novak v. Beto, 453 F.2d 661 (CA5 1971). A motion for a rehearing and rehearing en banc was denied March 8, 1972, six judges dissenting. Novak v. Beto, 456 F.2d 1303 (CA5 1972). If we are to believe the facts as stated by petitioner, and for purposes of appeal we must, a prisoner placed in solitary confinement in Texas will find himself in a shockingly primitive condition.

 The cell is kept in complete darkness 24 hours a day. A barred iron gate backed up by a wooden door blocks all light and prevents any human contact with those in the hall.

The inmate is fed on a bread and water diet with one full meal every 72 hours. 2 He is clothed only by a cloth gown. Aside from those conditions, which were considered inhumane at the time of Charles Dickens, the prisoner has no opportunity to exercise; he is not permitted correspondence with family, friends or lawyer; no visits are allowed and he is allowed no reading material of any kind. 
 The prisoner is not seen by a psychologist, psychiatrist or counselor before, during or after confinement to solitary. And all deprivations of solitary confinement apply uniformly regardless of the individual's background or criminal record of offense for which he is being punished. 
 A prisoner can be kept so confined for 15 days and reconfined after a two-day respite. Such practices as above described exist in all of Texas' 14 correctional facilities. [409 U.S. 968 , 970]

 The motion for leave to supplement the jurisdictional statement in No. 71-1408 is granted. The appeals are dismissed for failure to docket the cases within the time prescribed by Rule 13(1) of the Rules of this Court.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 These cases, here on appeal, are dismissed by the Court, as being out of time under our Rules. I dissent from that disposition. We held in United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 84-86, that the Rules of this Court determine the effect of untimely docketing. Only the filing of the notice of appeal is jurisdictional. Docketing is prescribed by Rule 13(1), and this Court in case after case has in its discretion waived the strictures of that rule. Up to now it has, indeed, been more concerned with disposing of cases as justice may require rather than finding technical ways to avoid decision of knotty questions. In the Aero Mayflower Transit Co. case the three-judge court entered its judgment on December 29, 1972, and Aero Mayflower filed its notice of appeal on February 14, 1972, within the 60-day period prescribed by 28 U.S. C. 2101(a) but did not docket its case within the subsequent 60-day period. Instead, it filed its jurisdictional statement on April 28, 1972, 14 days out of time. In the Hutter case the notice of appeal was filed on February 17, 1972, following denial by the Illinois Supreme Court of Hutter's motion to reconsider on January 18, 1972. This was timely under 2101(c). Dock- 
Page 409 U.S. 905 , 906
 eting on May 1, 1972, however, did not occur within the period provided by Rule 13(1), but was 14 days late. 
 The delay in each of these appeals was much shorter than that which occurred in Johnson v. Florida, 391 U.S. 596, where we entertained an appeal that was not docketed until 56 days after the time provided in Rule 13(1) expired. 391 U.S., at 598 n., 88 S. Ct., at 1714. 
 In Durham v. United States, 401 U.S. 481 (1971), the Court considered a petition for certiorari in which the opinion of the Court of Appeals was filed on November 12, 1969, rehearing was denied on March 5, 1970, and the petition was filed on September 26, 1970. Under Rule 22(2) that applied in that case, the petition was more than five months out of time. Only Justice Blackmun dissented. 
 Our Rules are only guidelines for litigants and we do disservice to the administration of justice by exalting them as Baron Parke doubtless would have done. Our experience with our Rules shows that lateness in docketing may be due to slow delivery of the mail (which is even worse today than it was 10 years ago), to snowstorms1 that stop or slow up all traffic, to sickness of [409 U.S. 905 , 907]

 OHIO AFL-CIO, The UNITED AUTOWORKERS OF OHIO, et al.v. The INSURANCE RATING BOARD et al.No. 71-1386. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 16, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the sixth circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 I would grant certiorari in this case. 
 The District Court dismissed petitioners' complaint, which alleged that respondents had engaged in an illegal combination and conspiracy in the fixing of automobile insurance premiums in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the exemption of the insurance industry from anti-trust laws by the McCarran- Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. 1012. This McCarran-Ferguson Act provides, in part, that the Sherman Anti- Trust Act 'shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law.' In Federal Trade Commission v. National Casualty Co., 357 U.S. 560, 563, 2 L. Ed.2d 1540, after examining the statute and its legislative history, we held that federal regulation as to advertising practices was prohibited in those States which were regulating such practices under their own laws. We indicated, however, that the grant of exclusive regulatory power to the State would be ineffective if the state statutory provisions which purported to regulate were a 'mere pretense' of regulation. In the instant case the petitioners allege that the state statutory scheme is such a 'mere pretense' of regulation. This allegation is based on the following factors: Although rating organizations are required to be examined at least once every five years under the statutory scheme, the state Department of Insurance has examined only two rate bureaus in the last five years, and only six examinations have been conducted in the last 20 
Page 409 U.S. 917 , 918
 years. The Insurance Rating Board which is composed of 129 insurance companies who write approximately 17% of the automobile liability insurance and approximately 22% of the physical damage insurance in the State, is permitted under the statutory scheme to determine the amount of any rate increase and institute that increase at a date picked by it. Review of that determination may occur only upon the challenge of the state Department of Insurance, which has never challenged an increase, and which in fact does not even employ an actuary so as to be able to examine the increase. 
 A governmental regulatory agency which, in contradiction of a statutory direction, only rarely exercises its examinatory powers; which has never exercised its power of review of rate increases; and which does not even employ the personnel which would be necessary to exercise the power would prima facie seem to be no more than a 'mere pretense' of regulation. Perhaps a full hearing would show otherwise. But enough had been tendered to make the trial court's dismissal of the complaint improper and this petition a clear grant.

 James CHONGRIS et al.v. Hugh A. CORRIGAN et al.No. 71-1532. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 16, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 In 1946, this Court articulated the standard to be applied in testing flight patterns over private property against the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment. United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256. We held that 'the flight of airplanes, which skim the surface but do not touch it, is as much an appropriation of the use of the land as a more conventional entry upon it.' We noted that the important factor is whether the intrusion impinges on 'the owner's full enjoyment of the property and . . . his exploitation of it.' 328 U.S., at 264-265, 66 S. Ct. 1062. And, in 1962, we reiterated that standard. Griggs v. Allegheny County, 369 U.S. 84. 
 State after State, in the years since Causby, has come to the conclusion that airport zoning schemes that impose height restrictions on the land located below the glide paths of approaching and departing aircraft are unconstitutional efforts at avoiding the costs properly incident to the use of airport facilities, and that the imposition of such regulations upon private property constitutes a 'taking' prohibited by the Constitution.

 Yet a quarter of a century after Causby, the Supreme Court of Ohio has sustained the Airport Zoning Statutes contained in Chapter 4563 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
 It accomplishes this tour de force through the application of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365. Reasoning that zoning regulations always involve some restriction on the uses to which land may be put, the court balanced 'the loss of use against the benefits to society thus obtained.' 29 Ohio St.2d 39, 46, 278 N.E.2d 658. It is a nice question when police power comes to an end as a justification for public taking of private property. Is it when the public at large is benefited at the expense of an owner of private property who is refrained from using his land in a way that is not obnoxious to his neighbors? Arguably eminent domain principles then apply; and, although the public may force upon the property owner the public need for his land, compensation is due him.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 16, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 In 1946, this Court articulated the standard to be applied in testing flight patterns over private property against the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment. United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256. We held that 'the flight of airplanes, which skim the surface but do not touch it, is as much an appropriation of the use of the land as a more conventional entry upon it.' We noted that the important factor is whether the intrusion impinges on 'the owner's full enjoyment of the property and . . . his exploitation of it.' 328 U.S., at 264-265, 66 S. Ct. 1062. And, in 1962, we reiterated that standard. Griggs v. Allegheny County, 369 U.S. 84.

 This would be a difficult case under the regime of Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, whose broad language denied a federal taxpayer standing to challenge the constitutionality of a federal statute. But Frothingham was greatly narrowed by our 1968 decision in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83. Flast held that federal taxpayers have standing if the constitutionality of the taxing or spending claims of Art.

 In Flast the challenged expenditures were said to have violated the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment. Here they are said to contravene the provision in Art. I, 8, cl. 11, which gives Congress the power to 'declare war.' No declaration of war has been made respecting Vietnam. Hence the question can be phrased in terms of the constitutionality of the use of funds to pursue a 'Presidential war.'

 James McLAMOREv. SOUTH CAROLINA et al.No. 71-6489. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 16, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of South carolina. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 I vote to hear this case because of the importance of the question raised. 
 A prisoner sentenced in the State of South Carolina, in any case in which confinement is the punishment, can be sent: (1) to a county to work on its chain gang (if the county maintains one) (2) or in the alternative to the Department of Corrections and then to the local jail 
Page 409 U.S. 934 , 935
 or state penitentiary. [Footnote 1] Under the statute, an elected official, the County Supervisor, makes the choice. There are no statutory criteria for him by which he is to make his choice. 
 Petitioner was sentenced under 17-554 and assigned to the chain gang of Richland County, South Carolina. Under the Post Conviction Relief Statute of South Carolina he sought review of two questions: (1) whether the chain gang was cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments? (2) whether the sending of certain prisoners to the penitentiary where some rehabilitative services are available and others to the chain gang where none exists is a denial of equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
 On April 28, 1971, the relief in both areas was denied and the decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of South Carolina, 257 S.C. 413, 186 S.E.2d 250 (1972). The case is here on certiorari. 
 The delineation of just what conditions constitute cruel and unusual punishment is not well defined. But we know from Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349 (1910), that the concept is not rigid but progressive; that it acquires meaning as the public becomes enlightened. [409 U.S. 934 , 936]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 16, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Alabama. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 I vote to hear this case because I assume that equal protection and due process of law under our Constitution apply to the rich as well as to the poor, to whites as well as to the minorities. [Footnote 1] 

 In Alabama a certified transcript or sufficient statement of the evidence must be filed within 60 days from the taking of an appeal or from the trial court's ruling on 
Page 409 U.S. 937 , 938
 a motion for new trial, whichever is later. [Footnote 2] Petitioner filed his transcript three days beyond the deadline. The Courts of Appeals dismissed his appeal as out of time. Hadley v. State, 47 Ala.App. 738, 259 So.2d 853 ( 1971). 
 The Supreme Court of the State of Alabama affirmed, with three justices dissenting. Ex parte Hadley. Under the case law of the Supreme Court of Alabama, had petitioner been an indigent, such tardiness would not have prevented appeal. In Leonard v. State, 43 Ala.App. 454, 192 So.2d 461 (1966), the transcript of evidence was filed approximately sixteen (16) days after its due date. The court did not dismiss for tardiness but laid down a new procedure '. . . this court will not honor requests to strike when a lower court . . . has ordered a free transcript. See Rule 48.' Such motion to dismiss was also denied in Brummitt v. State, 44 Ala.App. 78, 203 So.2d 133 (1967), where the court allowed a late filing on a showing of indigency the day after defendant's arrest, although no formal adjudication of indigency was ever made. 
 The question petitioner Hadley raises here and raised in the Alabama Supreme Court below, is whether by case law, a State can give more time for filing of a transcript [409 U.S. 937 , 939]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 16, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 This case on its face seems to me to be one we should grant and reverse on the basis of Sicurella v. United States, 348 U.S. 385. At the very least we should put the case down for oral argument. 
 Petitioner was convicted for failure to report for induction into the Armed Forces in violation of 50 U.S.C. App. 462(a) and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 457 F.2d 553. 
 When classified as I-A, petitioner requested classification as a Conscientious Objector. The Board rejected his request on five grounds: 
 1. Left Church. Religion is not thoroughly understood. 
 2. Appears insincere in his I-O request. Possibly coached. 
 3. Could help a wounded man, but wouldn't in battle. 
 4. Decision to fill out SSS 150 and apply for I-O status came after he fell behind academically. 
 5. Won't take military orders. Appeals that he is against taking any orders. 
 The first reason seems plainly untenable as a ground for denying the CO classification. Two years earlier petitioner had joined the Church of Christ. But the fact that he left it is [ Francis v. U.S. 409 U.S. 940 (1972) ][940-Continued.] 
irrelevant to his CO status. His tie to a church is irrelevant to his claim, because purely ethical or moral grounds, though unrelated to any church, are adequate, if sincerely believed. United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163; Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333. 
 The third ground is also plainly insufficient. It is true as the Government says that the extent to which petitioner would be willing to help the wounded is relevant to whether he should be assigned to Class I-A- O for non- 
Page 409 U.S. 940 , 941
 combatant service. Yet one's objection to all military service may well include even that part of military service that one can serve in a noncombatant capacity. That apparently was the point of petitioner's willingness to help an injured man, except in battle. It underlines his asserted belief that service even in a noncombatant capacity infringes upon his beliefs. The fifth ground stated by the Selective Service Board is really part and parcel of petitioner's asserted objection to all military service. 
 In Sicurella v. United States, 348 U.S. 385, 392, it was impossible to say on what grounds the Selective Service Board made the classification. One ground being illegitimate, we set aside the conviction, for the integrity of the system demanded that the Board rely on some legitimate ground. We followed that course in Clay v. United States, 403 U.S. 698, 703-704, where concededly two of the three grounds on which the Board denied relief were not valid ones. And we noted that since Sicurella that rule had become the established practice of federal courts, when dealing with the criminal sanction of the Selective Service Laws. Id., at 705. 
 I see no way to distinguish this case from Sicurella and Clay and would therefore grant and reverse. Or as I said, at the very least we should grant certiorari and put the case down for oral argument.

While neither the Court nor any Justice individually appears ever to have done so, I have determined that it would be appropriate for me to state the reasons which have led to my decision with respect to respondents' motion.  In so doing, I do not wish to suggest that I believe such a course would be desirable or even appropriate in any but the peculiar circumstances present here. [Footnote 1]
Respondents contend that because of testimony which I gave on behalf of the Department of Justice before the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate at its hearings on ""Federal Data Banks, Computers and the Bill of Rights,"" and because of other statements I made in speeches related to this general subject, I should have

 disqualified myself from participating in the Court's consideration or decision of this case.  The governing statute is 28 U.S.C.  455 which provides:
""Any justice or judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any case in which he has a substantial interest, has been of counsel, is or has been a material witness, or is so related to or connected with any party or his attorney as to render it improper, in his opinion, for him to sit on the trial, appeal, or other proceeding therein.""
Respondents also cite various draft provisions of Standards of Judicial Conduct prepared by a distinguished committee of the American Bar Association, and adopted by that body at its recent annual meeting.  Since I do not read these particular provisions as being materially different from the standards enunciated in the congressional statute, there is no occasion for me to give them separate consideration.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 5, 1972
 The application for a temporary restraining order presented to Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, and by him referred to the Court, is denied. Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice DOUGLAS.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 The American Party, seeking to get on the Texas ballot for this year's election, brought an action which asked a three-judge federal court to hold provisions of the Texas election laws unconstitutional. 
 Texas has four methods of nominating candidates. 
 First, those whose gubernatorial candidate polled more than 200,000 votes in the last general election may be nominated through primaries. Election Code, Art. 13.02, V.A.T.S. Second, those whose party candidates polled less than 200,000 votes but more than 2% of the total votes cast for governor may be nominated by primaries or by nominating conventions. Third, those whose party candidates polled less than 2% of the total gubernatorial vote and those whose party did not have a nominee for governor in the last general election may be nominated by convention only or by fulfilling the requirements of Art. 13.45(2) of the Election Code. Fourth, nonpartisan and independent candidates 
Page 409 U.S. 803 , 804
 may appear on the ballot after meeting the requirements of Art. 13.50 of the Election Code. 
 The American Party falls in the third category. In order to get its nominees printed on the ballot it must meet the following requirements: 
 It must by the previous September declare its intention to nominate by convention. That entails a state-wide party organization with an executive committee. It also requires the filing with the Secretary of State by February of the names of the candidates; it requires the filing of party rules by March. It requires the holding of precinct conventions on the day of the primary and the holding of county conventions the following week and a state convention on a day certain. 
 The American Party must in addition do the following: 
 (1) It must furnish a list of participants in each precinct convention with the names, addresses and registration certificate numbers of qualified voters attending such conventions. The names on the list must total at least 1% of the total votes cast for governor at the last preceding general election. 
 (2) If the number of qualified voters attending the precinct conventions is less than 1%, there must be filed a petition requesting that the names of the nominees be printed on the election ballot, signed by a sufficient number of additional qualified voters to make a combined total of at least 1% of the total votes cast for governor in the last election. 
 (3) No person who during the voting year voted at any primary election or participated in any convention of any other party may attend the minority party convention or sign the petition. If he does, he is subject to criminal penalties. 
 (4) The petition may not be circulated until after the date set for the holding of the major parties primaries. Signatures must be certified before 20 days after the date [409 U.S. 803 , 805]

Syllabus 
Applicants had been granted ""use"" immunity, and were testifying before a grand jury when court-approved electronic surveillance of a telephone resulted in interception of a conversation of their attorney.  Their refusal thereafter to answer certain questions propounded by the grand jury resulted in commitment for civil contempt.  The applicants, claiming deprivation of their right to counsel, appealed the commitment and applied for bail pending disposition of the appeals.  The Government responded that, since the applicants had been granted all the immunity to which they were constitutionally entitled, there was no longer an attorney-client privilege to be protected.
Held:  Bail should be granted under the standard applicable under 28 U.S.C.  1826(b), since the issues are not frivolous and the appeals are not taken for delay.

SCRAP, a student environmental association, secured from a three-judge District Court an injunction against the authorization by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) of a temporary 2.5% freight surcharge to be imposed across the board by most of the Nation's railroads.  The ground for the injunction was that by adding the surcharge to the cost of transporting recyclable goods, fewer such goods would be transported, the need would be met by increased use of natural resources, and there would therefore be an adverse impact on the environment; hence the National Environmental Policy Act required that the ICC prepare an ""impact statement"" on the surcharge.  The District Court considered the applications for stay of the injunction pending appeal but, concluding that danger to the environment outweighed the loss of income and consequent financial threat to the railroads, the court denied the application.
Held:  Since it cannot be said that the District Court's factual evaluation of the necessity for a stay constituted an abuse of discretion, the applications for stay must be denied.

No. 71-5103
Argued April 11, 1972
Decided June 29, 1972
408 U.S. 471

Syllabus 
Petitioners in these habeas corpus proceedings claimed that their paroles were revoked without a hearing and that they were thereby deprived of due process.  The Court of Appeals, in affirming the District Court's denial of relief, reasoned that, under controlling authorities, parole is only ""a correctional device authorizing service of sentence outside a penitentiary,"" and concluded that a parolee, who is still ""in custody,"" is not entitled to a full adversary hearing such as would be mandated in a criminal proceeding.
Held:
1. Though parole revocation does not call for the full panoply of rights due a defendant in a criminal proceeding, a parolee's liberty involves significant values within the protection of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and termination of that liberty requires an informal hearing to give assurance that the finding of a parole violation is based on verified facts to support the revocation.   Pp.  408 U. S. 480-482.
2. Due process requires a reasonably prompt informal inquiry conducted by an impartial hearing officer near the place of the alleged parole violation or arrest to determine if there is reasonable ground to believe that the arrested parolee has violated a parole condition. The parolee should receive prior notice of the inquiry, its purpose, and the alleged violations.  The parolee may present relevant information and (absent security considerations) question adverse informants.  The hearing officer shall digest the evidence on probable cause and state the reasons for holding the parolee for the parole board's decision.  Pp.  408 U. S. 484-487.
3. At the revocation hearing, which must be conducted reasonably soon after the parolee's arrest, minimum due process requirements are:  (a) written notice of the claimed violations of parole; (b) disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation); (e) a ""neutral and detached"" hearing body such as a traditional parole board, members of which need not be judicial officers or lawyers; and (f) a written statement

Syllabus 
Appellee, a former United States Senator, was charged with the solicitation and acceptance of bribes in violation of 18 U.S.C.  201(c)(1) and 201(g).  The District Court, on appellee's pretrial motion, dismissed the indictment on the ground that the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution shielded him ""from any prosecution for alleged bribery to perform a legislative act.""  The United States filed a direct appeal to this Court under 18 U.S.C.  3731 (1964 ed., Supp. V), which appellee contends this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain because the District Court's action was not ""a decision or judgment setting aside, or dismissing"" the indictment, but was instead a summary judgment on the merits based on the facts of the case.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.  3731 (1964 ed., Supp. V) to hear the appeal, since the District Court's order was based upon its determination of the constitutional invalidity of 18 U.S.C.  201(c)(1) and 201(g) on the facts as alleged in the indictment.  Pp. 50507.
2. The prosecution of appellee is not prohibited by the Speech or Debate Clause.  Although that provision protects Members of Congress from inquiry into legislative acts or the motivation for performance of such acts, United States v. Johnson, 383 U. S. 169,  383 U. S. 185, it does not protect all conduct relating to the legislative process.  Since, in this case, prosecution of the bribery charges does not necessitate inquiry into legislative acts or motivation, the District Court erred in holding that the Speech or Debate Clause required dismissal of the indictment.

No. 71-162
Argued January 18, 1972
Decided June 29, 1972
408 U.S. 564

Syllabus 
Respondent, hired for a fixed term of one academic year to teach at a state university, was informed without explanation that he would not be rehired for the ensuing year.  A statute provided that all state university teachers would be employed initially on probation, and that only after four years' continuous service would teachers achieve permanent employment ""during efficiency and good behavior,"" with procedural protection against separation.  University rules gave a nontenured teacher ""dismissed"" before the end of the year some opportunity for review of the ""dismissal,"" but provided that no reason need be given for nonretention of a nontenured teacher, and no standards were specified for reemployment.  Respondent brought this action claiming deprivation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights, alleging infringement of (1) his free speech right because the true reason for his nonretention was his criticism of the university administration, and (2) his procedural due process right because of the university's failure to advise him of the reason for its decision.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the respondent on the procedural issue.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Fourteenth Amendment does not require opportunity for a hearing prior to the nonrenewal of a nontenured state teacher's contract unless he can show that the nonrenewal deprived him of an interest in ""liberty"" or that he had a ""property"" interest in continued employment, despite the lack of tenure or a formal contract.  Here, the nonretention of respondent, absent any charges against him or stigma or disability foreclosing other employment, is not tantamount to a deprivation of ""liberty,"" and the terms of respondent's employment accorded him no ""property"" interest protected by procedural due process.  The courts below therefore erred in granting summary judgment for the respondent on the procedural due process issue.  Pp.  408 U. S. 569-579.

No. 70-36
Argued January 18, 1972
Decided June 29, 1972
408 U.S. 593

Syllabus 
Respondent was employed in a state college system for 10 years, the last four as a junior college professor under a series of one-year written contracts.  The Regents declined to renew his employment for the next year without giving him an explanation or prior hearing.  Respondent then brought this action in the District Court, alleging that the decision not to rehire him was based on respondent's public criticism of the college administration, and thus infringed his free speech right, and that the Regents' failure to afford him a hearing violated his procedural due process right.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners, concluding that respondent's contract had terminated and the junior college had not adopted the tenure system.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the grounds that, despite lack of tenure, nonrenewal of respondent's contract would violate the Fourteenth Amendment if it was in fact, based on his protected free speech, and that, if respondent could show that he had an ""expectancy"" of reemployment, the failure to allow him an opportunity for a hearing would violate the procedural due process guarantee.
Held:
1. Lack of a contractual or tenure right to reemployment, taken alone, did not defeat respondent's claim that the nonrenewal of his contract violated his free speech right under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court therefore erred in foreclosing determination of the contested issue whether the decision not to renew was based on respondent's exercise of his right of free speech.  Pp.  408 U. S. 596-598.
2. Though a subjective ""expectancy"" of tenure is not protected by procedural due process, respondent's allegation that the college had a de facto tenure policy, arising from rules and understandings officially promulgated and fostered, entitled him to an opportunity of proving the legitimacy of his claim to job tenure.  Such proof would obligate the college to afford him a requested hearing where he could be informed of the grounds for his nonretention and challenge their sufficiency.  Pp.  408 U. S. 599-603.

Syllabus 
A United States Senator read to a subcommittee from classified documents (the Pentagon Papers), which he then placed in the public record.  The press reported that the Senator had arranged for private publication of the Papers.  A grand jury investigating whether violations of federal law were implicated subpoenaed an aide to the Senator.  The Senator, as an intervenor, moved to quash the subpoena, contending that it would violate the Speech or Debate Clause to compel the aide to testify.  The District Court denied the motion, but limited the questioning of the aide.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial, but modified the protective order, ruling that congressional aides and other persons may not be questioned regarding legislative acts, and that, though the private publication was not constitutionally protected, a common law privilege similar to the privilege of protecting executive officials from liability for libel, see Barr v. Matteo, 360 U. S. 564, barred questioning the aide concerning such publication.
Held:
1. The Speech or Debate Clause applies not only to a Member of Congress but also to his aide, insofar as the aide's conduct would be a protected legislative act if performed by the Member himself.  Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U. S. 168; Dombrowski v. Eastland, 387 U. S. 82; and Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, distinguished.  Pp.  408 U. S. 613-622.
2. The Speech or Debate Clause does not extend immunity to the Senator's aide from testifying before the grand jury about the alleged arrangement for private publication of the Pentagon Papers, as such publication had no connection with the legislative process.  Pp.  408 U. S. 622-627.
3. The aide, similarly, had no nonconstitutional testimonial privilege from being questioned by the grand jury in connection with its inquiry into whether private publication of the Papers violated federal law.  P.  408 U. S. 627. 
Page 408 U. S. 607

4. The Court of Appeals' protective order was overly broad in enjoining interrogation of the aide with respect to any act, ""in the broadest sense,"" that he performed within the cope of his employment, since the aide's immunity extended only to legislative acts as to which the Senator would be immune.  And the aide may be questioned by the grand jury about the source of classified documents in the Senator's possession, as long as the questioning implicates no legislative act.  The order in other respects would suffice if it forbade questioning the aide or others about the conduct or motives of the Senator or his aides at the subcommittee meeting; communications between the Senator and his aides relating to that meeting or any legislative act of the Senator; or steps of the Senator or his aides preparatory for the meeting, if not relevant to third-party crimes.

And the aide may be questioned by the grand jury about the source of classified documents in the Senator's possession, as long as the questioning implicates no legislative act.  The order in other respects would suffice if it forbade questioning the aide or others about the conduct or motives of the Senator or his aides at the subcommittee meeting; communications between the Senator and his aides relating to that meeting or any legislative act of the Senator; or steps of the Senator or his aides preparatory for the meeting, if not relevant to third-party crimes.

408 U.S. 753

Syllabus 
This action was brought to compel the Attorney General to grant a temporary nonimmigrant visa to a Belgian journalist and Marxian theoretician whom the American plaintiff appellees had invited to participate in academic conferences and discussions in this country.  The alien had been found ineligible for admission under  212(a)(28)(D) and (G)(v) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, barring those who advocate or publish ""the economic, international, and governmental doctrines of world communism.""  The Attorney General had declined to waive ineligibility as he has the power to do under  212(d) of the Act, basing his decision on unscheduled activities engaged in by the alien on a previous visit to the United States, when a waiver was granted.  A three-judge District Court, although holding that the alien had no personal entry right, concluded that citizens of this country had a First Amendment right to have him enter and to hear him, and enjoined enforcement of  212 as to this alien.
Held:  In the exercise of Congress' plenary power to exclude aliens or prescribe the conditions for their entry into this country, Congress in  212(a)(28) of the Act has delegated conditional exercise of this power to the Executive Branch. When, as in this case, the Attorney General decides for a legitimate and bona fide reason not to waive the statutory exclusion of an alien, courts will not look behind his decision or weigh it against the First Amendment interests of those who would personally communicate with the alien.

No. 69-5001
Argued January 18, 1972
Decided June 29, 1972
408 U.S. 786

Syllabus 
Moore, who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death for the shotgun slaying of a bartender at a Lansing, Illinois, tavern, claimed that he was denied a fair trial and due process because the State failed to make pretrial disclosure of several items of evidence helpful to the defense, failed to correct false testimony of one Powell, and succeeded in introducing into evidence a shotgun that was not the murder weapon.  The evidence not disclosed consisted of a pretrial statement by one Sanders that Moore was known to him as ""Slick"" and that he had first met ""Slick"" some six months before the killing, and documents and testimony that established that Moore was not the man known to others in the area as ""Slick.""  Powell testified that he observed the killing, and the State did not introduce into evidence a diagram that, Moore claims, illustrates that Powell could not see the shooting.  The State Supreme Court rejected the claim that evidence had been suppressed and false evidence had been left uncorrected, and held that the shotgun was properly admitted into evidence as a weapon in Moore's possession when he was arrested, and suitable for commission of the crime charged.  Moore also attacked the imposition of the death penalty for noncompliance with the standards of Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510.
Held:
1. The evidentiary items (other than the diagram) on which Moore bases his suppression claim relate to Sanders' misidentification of Moore as ""Slick,"" and not to the identification, by Sanders and others, of Moore as the person who made incriminating statements in the Ponderosa Tap.  These evidentiary items are not material under the standard of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. The diagram does not support Moore's contention that the State knowingly permitted false testimony to remain uncorrected, in violation of Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264, since the diagram does not show that it was impossible for Powell to see the shooting.  Pp.  408 U. S. 794-798. 
Page 408 U. S. 787

2. Moore's due process claim as to the shotgun was not previously raised, and therefore is not properly before this Court, and, in any event, the introduction of the shotgun does not constitute federally reversible error.  Pp.  408 U. S. 798-800.
3. The sentence of death may not be imposed on Moore.  Furman v. Georgia, ante, p.  408 U. S. 238.  P. 800.

|408 u.s. 811|"Port of Portland v. United States
No. 70-31
Argued October 20, 1971
Decided June 29, 1972
408 U.S. 811

Syllabus 
The Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway Co. (SP&S), a subsidiary of Burlington Northern, and the Union Pacific (UP), sought Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) approval under  5(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act of a joint acquisition of control of the Peninsula Terminal Co. (Peninsula), whose tracks provide an access route to Rivergate, an industrial complex being developed by the Port of Portland, Oregon.  Peninsula would continue to operate as a separate carrier.  The Milwaukee and the Southern Pacific (SP), the two other line-haul carriers serving Portland, sought inclusion as joint purchasers of Peninsula, and trackage rights linking their lines with Peninsula, under  5(2)(b), (c), and (d) of the Act.  SP, by a separate proceeding, also sought trackage linking its lines with Peninsula, under  3(5).  The ICC (subject to conditions to protect the traffic of the other railroads) approved the purchase of Peninsula by Burlington Northern and UP, but denied the Milwaukee and SP petitions.  It concluded that the adverse effects on SP&S and UP of the proposed four-railroad ownership of Peninsula and accompanying trackage rights would outweigh the advantages to SP, Milwaukee, and the Rivergate industries.  Milwaukee contends that Condition 24(a) to the Northern Lines merger, which gave Milwaukee access to the Portland area over the Burlington Northern-SP&S tracks, required that Milwaukee be included in the purchase of Peninsula.
Held:
1. On the record in this case (which is ambiguous with regard to many factual and procedural issues), it has not been shown that the ICC's order authorizing UP and Burlington Northern alone to acquire Peninsula met the ""public interest"" standard of  6(2).  Pp.  408 U. S. 834-842
(a) In stressing the small share in Peninsula's traffic that Milwaukee had before the Northern Lines merger, the ICC ignored any possible increase in that share after Condition 24(a) took effect.  Pp.  408 U. S. 839-840. 
Page 408 U. S. 812

(b) In announcing a principle of preserving the market shares of the two railroads currently connecting with Peninsula, the ICC failed to explain why it was not taking into account the potentially enormous traffic over Peninsula, should Peninsula become the northern route into Rivergate.  Pp.  408 U. S. 840-841.
(c) The ICC's denial of inclusion of SP and Milwaukee because their gain would work a corresponding loss to Burlington Northern and UP is not a proper approach under  6(2), given the principle that the anticompetitive effects of any  5(2) transaction must be explicitly considered.  McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, 321 U. S. 67,  321 U. S. 83-87.  Pp.  408 U. S. 841-842.
(d) In view of uncertainties about the northern access to Rivergate -- given the physical limitations of Peninsula's present facilities -- and the apparent fact that physical operation over Peninsula into Rivergate was not at issue here, approval of the ICC order, with its protective conditions, may still be in the public interest, but the announced grounds for the ICC decision do not comport with the applicable legal principles.  See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. 80,  318 U. S. 87-88.  P.  408 U. S. 842
2. The denial of trackage rights to SP (on the ground that SP was ""not entitled to serve Peninsula or Rivergate"") should be reconsidered by the ICC in conjunction with the reappraisal of the  5(2) issues.  Pp.  408 U. S. 843-844.

No. 71-110
Argued March 27, 1972
Decided June 26, 1972*
408 U.S. 41

Syllabus 
Where a grand jury witness is adjudicated in civil contempt under 28 U.S.C.  1826(a) for refusing ""without just cause shown to comply with an order of the court to testify,"" the witness may invoke as a defense 18 U.S.C.  2515, which directs that
""[w]henever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part of the contents of such communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence in any . . . proceeding in or before any . . . grand jury . . . ,""
since a showing that the interrogation would be based upon the illegal interception of the witness' communications would constitute the ""just cause"" that precludes a finding of contempt.  Pp.  408 U. S. 46-61.

No. 71-308
Argued March 1, 1972
Decided June 26, 1972
408 U.S. 125

Syllabus 
Decedent transferred to an irrevocable trust for the benefit of his children (and if they died before the trust ended, their surviving children) stock in three unlisted corporations that he controlled, retaining the right to vote the transferred stock, to veto the transfer by the trustee (a bank) of any of the stock, and to remove the trustee and appoint another corporate trustee as successor.  The right to vote the transferred stock, together with the vote of the stock decedent owned at the time of his death, gave him a majority vote in each of the corporations.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the transferred stock was includable in decedent's gross estate under  2036(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which requires the inclusion in a decedent's gross estate of the value of any property he has transferred by inter vivos gift, if he retained for his lifetime
""(1) the . . . enjoyment of . . . the property transferred, or (2) the right, either alone or in conjunction with any person, to designate the persons who shall . . . enjoy . . . the income therefrom.""
The Commissioner claimed that decedent's right to vote the transferred shares and to veto any sale by the trustee, together with the ownership of other shares, made the transferred shares includable under  2036(a)(2), because decedent retained control over corporate dividend policy and, by regulating the flow of income to the trust, could shift or defer the beneficial enjoyment of trust income between the present beneficiaries and remaindermen, and under  2036(a)(1) because, by reason of decedent's retained control over the corporations, he had the right to continue to benefit economically from the transferred shares during his lifetime.
Held:  1. Decedent did not retain the ""right,"" within the meaning of  2036(a)(2), to designate who was to enjoy the trust income.  Pp.  408 U. S. 131-144.
(a) A settlor's retention of broad management powers did not necessarily subject an inter vivos trust to the federal estate tax.  Pp.  408 U. S. 131-135. 
Page 408 U. S. 126

(b) In view of legal and business constraints applicable to the payment of dividends, especially where there are minority stockholders, decedent's right to vote a majority of the shares in these corporations did not give him a de facto position tantamount to the power to accumulate income in the trust.  Pp.  408 U. S. 135-144.
2. Decedent's voting control of the stock did not constitute retention of the enjoyment of the transferred stock within the meaning of  2036(a)(1), since the decedent had transferred irrevocably the title to the stock and right to the income therefrom.  Pp.  408 U. S. 145-150.

408 U.S. 169

Syllabus 
Petitioners, seeking to form a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) at a state-supported college, were denied recognition as a campus organization.  Recognition would have entitled petitioners to use campus facilities for meetings and to use of the campus bulletin board and school newspaper.  The college president denied recognition because he was not satisfied that petitioners' group was independent of the National SDS, which he concluded has a philosophy of disruption and violence in conflict with the college's declaration of student rights.  Petitioners thereupon brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court first ordered a further administrative hearing, after which the president reaffirmed his prior decision.  Approving the president's judgment, the District Court held that petitioners had failed to show that they could function free from the National SDS and that the college's refusal to approve the group, which the court found ""likely to cause violent acts of disruption,"" did not violate petitioners' associational rights.  The Court of Appeals, purporting not to reach the First Amendment issues, affirmed on the ground that petitioners had failed to avail themselves of the due process accorded to them and to meet their burden of complying with the prevailing standards for recognition.
Held:
1. The courts erred in (1) discounting the cognizable First Amendment associational interest that petitioners had in furthering their personal beliefs and (2) assuming that the burden was on petitioners to show entitlement to recognition by the college, rather than on the college to justify its nonrecognition of the group, once petitioners had made application conformably to college requirements.  Pp.  408 U. S. 180-185.
2. Insofar as the denial of recognition to petitioners' group was based on an assumed relationship with the National SDS, or was a result of disagreement with the group's philosophy, or was a consequence of a fear of disruption, for which there was no support in the record, the college's decision violated the petitioners' First Amendment rights.  A proper basis for nonrecognition might have 
Page 408 U. S. 170
 been afforded, however, by a showing that the group refused to comply with a rule requiring them to abide by reasonable campus regulations.  Since the record is not clear whether the college ha such a rule, and, if so, whether petitioners intend to observe it, these issues remain to be resolved.  Pp.  408 U. S. 185-194.

Decided June 26, 1972
408 U.S. 204

Syllabus 
New York State sentenced respondent as a second offender, based on his 1964 felony conviction in Tennessee. Respondent's petition for federal habeas corpus, denied by the District Court, was granted by the Court of Appeals, which concluded that the Tennessee conviction violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to confront witnesses and thus was not available as the predicate for a ""second offender"" stiffer punishment.  The State then resentenced respondent to the same sentence, based upon still another conviction in Texas.
Held:
1. New York State's resentencing of respondent did not moot the instant case,  since the respondent's appeal involving the validity of the Texas conviction is still in the New York state courts, and therefore New York State has a present interest in the availability of the Tennessee conviction as a predicate for the stiffer punishment.  Pp.  408 U. S. 205-207.
2. Upon discovering that a State's witness had removed himself permanently to a foreign country, the State of Tennessee was powerless to compel his attendance at respondent's second trial, either through its own process or through established procedures depending upon the voluntary assistance of another government; the resultant predicate of unavailability was sufficiently strong not to warrant a federal habeas corpus court's upsetting the State's determination that the witness was not available.  Barber v. Page, 390 U. S. 719, distinguished.  Pp.  408 U. S. 207-213.
3. Where a State's witness is bona fide unavailable, the requirements of the Confrontation Clause are met when prior-recorded testimony of the witness is admitted, as occurred in the 1964 trial, if that prior testimony bears ""indicia of reliability"" that would afford ""the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.""

Petitioner was convicted of receiving, possessing, and concealing whiskey known by him to have been stolen from an interstate shipment.  Prior to his trial, the District Court had denied a motion to suppress the whiskey from evidence on the contention that there had been no showing of probable cause to support issuance of the warrant authorizing the search for the whiskey.  The petitioner raised only the validity of the warrant on his appeal, but the Court of Appeals held that he lacked standing to challenge the legality of the search, which had occurred on his father's farm where petitioner was not living or present at the time of the search.
Held:  Since the Government now suggests that the warrant was invalid, and since the record is inadequate for a determination of whether petitioner had an interest in the searched premises that would afford him standing under Mancusi v. DeForte, 392 U. S. 364, to challenge the legality of the search, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings.

Petitioner was convicted under an obscenity statute for publishing in his underground newspaper pictures of nudes and a sex poem.  The State Supreme Court upheld the conviction as not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:  In the context in which they appeared, the photographs were rationally related to a news article, in conjunction with which they appeared, and were entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.

After this Court reversed petitioner's 1964 murder conviction on the ground that written confessions used as evidence in his trial were involuntary as the products of gross coercion, and thus violated due process, petitioner was reindicted, retried, and convicted after an oral confession had been admitted into evidence.  That confession had been made to a hospital doctor one hour after petitioner's arrest, while he was in extreme pain from a gunshot wound and under the influence of morphine.

 The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. 
 The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of Louisiana for reconsideration in light of Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518 (1972).
 Mr. Justice POWELL, concurring in the result. 
 Under Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942), the issue in a case of this kind is whether 'fighting words' were used. Here a police officer, while in the performance of his duty, was called 'G02q d--- M--- F---' police. 
 If these words had been addressed by one citizen to another, face to face and in a hostile manner, I would have no doubt that they would be 'fighting words.' But the situation may be different where such words are addressed to a police officer trained to exercise a higher degree of restraint than the average citizen. See Model Penal Code 250.1, Comment 4 (Tent.Draft No. 13, 1961).

 The statute involved in this case is considerably broader than the statute involved in Rosenfeld v.

Moreover, the papers filed in this case indicate that the language for which appellant was prosecuted was used in a political meeting to which appellant had been invited to present the Black Panther viewpoint. In these circumstances language of the character charged might well have been anticipated by the audience.

407 U.S. 385

Syllabus 
Petitioner union and three of its officers were convicted of conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C.  610, which prohibited a labor organization from making a contribution or an expenditure in connection with a federal election.  Evidence indicated that the union, from 1949 through 1962, maintained a political fund to which union members and others working under the union's jurisdiction were required to contribute, and that that fund was then succeeded by the present fund, which was, in form, set up as a separate ""voluntary"" organization; union officials, nevertheless, retained unlimited control over the fund, and no significant change was made in the regular and systematic collection of contributions at a prescribed rate based on hours worked; union agents, moreover, continued to collect donations at jobsites on union time, and the proceeds were used for a variety of purposes, including political contributions in connection with federal elections; those contributions, on the other hand, were made from accounts strictly segregated from union dues and assessments, and, although some of the contributors believed otherwise, donations to the fund were not, in fact, necessary for employment or union membership.  Under instructions to determine whether the fund was in reality a union fund or the contributors' fund, the jury found each defendant guilty.  The Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' challenges, and held that the fund was a subterfuge through which the union made political contributions of union monies in violation of  610.  The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which became effective after oral argument here, added a paragraph at the end of  610 that expressly authorizes labor organizations to establish, administer, and solicit contributions for political funds, provided that the fund not make a contribution or expenditure in connection with a federal election by utilizing money or anything of value secured by physical force, job discrimination, financial reprisals, or the threat thereof, or by monies required as a condition of employment or union membership.
Held:
1. Section 610, as confirmed by the Federal Election Campaign Act, does not apply to contributions or expenditures from voluntarily 
Page 407 U. S. 386
 financed union political funds.  A legitimate political fund must be separate from the sponsoring union only in the sense that there must be a strict segregation of its monies from union dues and assessments, and solicitation by union officials, although permissible, must be conducted under circumstances plainly indicating that donations are for a political purpose, and that those solicited may decline to contribute without reprisal.  Pp.  407 U. S. 401-427.
2. Section 10 may be interpreted to prohibit the use of general union monies for the establishment, administration, or solicitation of contributions for union political funds.  By clearly permitting such use, the Federal Election Campaign Act may, therefore, have impliedly repealed  610.  Pp.  407 U. S. 428-432.
3. Even if there has been such an implied repeal, it nevertheless does not require abatement of the prosecution against petitioners because of the federal saving statute, 1 U.S.C.  109.

4. The instructions to the jury were clearly erroneous because they permitted the jury to convict without finding that donations to the fund had been actual or effective dues or assessments.  The sufficiency of the indictment is left open for determination on remand.  Pp.  407 U. S. 435-442.

No. 70-188
Argued March 1, 1972
Decided June 22, 1972
407 U.S. 451

Syllabus 
In 1967, Emporia, Virginia, which is located in the center of Greensville County, changed from a ""town"" to a politically independent ""city"" authorized by state law to provide its own public school system.  By a shared-cost agreement with the county, Emporia in 1968 continued an arrangement, which antedated its change of status, to use the county public school system for education of its children.  As a consequence of the present desegregation lawsuit initiated in 1965, the single school division was operating under a ""freedom of choice"" plan approved by the District Court.  Petitioners moved to modify that plan following this Court's decision in Green v. County School Board, 391 U. S. 430.  The District Court, after a hearing, on June 25, 1969, ordered petitioners' ""pairing"" plan to take effect as of the start of the 1969-1970 school year.  Two weeks after entry of the District Court's decree, the city announced its plan to operate a separate school system and sought termination of the 1968 agreement.  On August 1, 1969, petitioners filed a supplemental complaint seeking to enjoin the city council and school board (named as additional parties defendant) from withdrawing Emporia children from the county schools.  Following hearings, the District Court found that the effect of Emporia's withdrawal would be a ""substantial increase in the proportion of whites in the schools attended by city residents, and a concomitant decrease in the county schools.""  In addition to the disparity in racial percentages, the court found that the proportion of whites in county schools might drop as county school whites shifted to private academies, while some whites might return to city schools from the academies they previously attended; that two formerly all-white schools (both better equipped and better located than the county schools) are in Emporia, while all the schools in the surrounding county were formerly all-Negro; and that Emporia, which long had the right to establish a separate school system, did not decide to do so until the court's order prevented the county from continuing its long-maintained segregated school system.  The court concluded that Emporia's withdrawal would frustrate the June 25 decree, and enjoined respondents from 
Page 407 U. S. 452
 pursuing their plan.  Holding that the question whether new school district boundaries should be permitted in areas with a history of state-enforced racial segregation must be resolved in terms of the ""dominant purpose of [the] boundary realignment,"" the Court of Appeals concluded that Emporia's primary purpose was ""benign,"" and not a mere ""cover-up"" for racial discrimination, and reversed.
Held:
1. In determining whether realignment of school districts by officials comports with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, courts will be guided not by the motivation of the officials, but by the effect of their action.  Pp.  407 U. S. 461-462.
2. In the totality of the circumstances of this case, the District Court was justified in concluding that Emporia's establishment of a separate school system would impede the process of dismantling the segregated school system.  Pp.  407 U. S. 463-471.

The court concluded that Emporia's withdrawal would frustrate the June 25 decree, and enjoined respondents from 
Page 407 U. S. 452
 pursuing their plan.  Holding that the question whether new school district boundaries should be permitted in areas with a history of state-enforced racial segregation must be resolved in terms of the ""dominant purpose of [the] boundary realignment,"" the Court of Appeals concluded that Emporia's primary purpose was ""benign,"" and not a mere ""cover-up"" for racial discrimination, and reversed.
Held:
1. In determining whether realignment of school districts by officials comports with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, courts will be guided not by the motivation of the officials, but by the effect of their action.  Pp.  407 U. S. 461-462.
2. In the totality of the circumstances of this case, the District Court was justified in concluding that Emporia's establishment of a separate school system would impede the process of dismantling the segregated school system.  Pp.  407 U. S. 463-471.

Argued February 29-March 1, 1972

407 U.S. 484

Syllabus 
A state statute authorized creation of a new school district for Scotland Neck, N.C. a city that was part of the larger Halifax County school district, then in the process of dismantling a dual school system.  The District Court in this litigation instituted by the United States enjoined implementation of the statute as creating a refuge for white students and promoting school segregation in the county.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the statute's impact on dismantling the county dual system was minimal, and that it should not be regarded as an alternative desegregation plan for the county, since it was enacted by the legislature, and not by the school board.
Held:  Whether the action affecting dismantling of a dual school system is initiated by the legislature or by the school board is immaterial, North Carolina Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U. S. 43; the criterion is whether the dismantling is furthered or hindered by carving a new school district from the larger district having the dual school system, and a proposal that would impede the dismantling process may be enjoined.

Petitioner contends in this habeas corpus proceeding that the systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury that indicted him and the petit jury that convicted him deprived him of his rights to due process and equal protection.

No. 71-5255
Argued April 11, 1972
Decided June 22, 1972
407 U.S. 514

Syllabus 
Petitioner was not brought to trial for murder until more than five years after he had been arrested, during which time the prosecution obtained numerous continuances, initially for the purpose of first trying petitioner's alleged accomplice so that his testimony, if conviction resulted, would be available at petitioner's trial.  Before the accomplice was finally convicted, he was tried six times.  Petitioner made no objection to the continuances until three and one-half years after he was arrested.  After the accomplice was finally convicted, petitioner, after further delays because of a key prosecution witness' illness, was tried and convicted.  In this habeas corpus proceeding, the Court of Appeals, concluding that petitioner had waived his right to a speedy trial for the period prior to his demand for trial, and, in any event, had not been prejudiced by the delay, affirmed the District Court's judgment against petitioner.
Held:  A defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial cannot be established by any inflexible rule, but can be determined only on an ad hoc balancing basis in which the conduct of the prosecution and that of the defendant are weighed.  The court should assess such factors as the length of and reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.  In this case, the lack of any serious prejudice to petitioner and the fact, as disclosed by the record, that he did not want a speedy trial outweigh opposing considerations, and compel the conclusion that petitioner was not deprived of his due process right to a speedy trial.

407 U.S. 539

Syllabus 
Petitioner had a rule against solicitational activities in its stores and parking lots.  The parking lots are appurtenant to petitioner's free-standing stores, and do not serve other retail establishments.  Union organizers used petitioner's parking lots to solicit petitioner's employees to join the union, and petitioner ordered the organizers off its property.  The union filed unfair labor practice charges against petitioner.  The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) held that enforcement of petitioner's no-solicitation rule, which it found was overly broad, violated  8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, which proscribes interference with employees'  7 organizational rights.  The NLRB concluded that the character and use of the lots distinguished the case from NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U.

Syllabus 
Respondents sought to distribute handbills in the interior mall area of petitioner's large privately owned shopping center.  Petitioner had a strict no-handbilling rule.  Petitioner's security guards requested respondents under threat of arrest to stop the handbilling, suggesting that they could resume their activities on the public streets and sidewalks adjacent to but outside the center, which respondents did.  Respondents, claiming that petitioner's action violated their First Amendment rights, thereafter brought this action for injunctive and declaratory relief.  The District Court, stressing that the center is ""open to the general public"" and ""the functional equivalent of a public business district,"" and relying on Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U. S. 501, and Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308, held that petitioner's policy of prohibiting handbilling within the mall violated respondents' First Amendment rights.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  There has been no dedication of petitioner's privately owned and operated shopping center to public use so as to entitle respondents to exercise First Amendment rights therein that are unrelated to the center's operations, and petitioner's property did not lose its private character and its right to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment merely because the public is generally invited to use it for the purpose of doing business with petitioner's tenants.  The facts in this case are significantly different from those in Marsh, supra, which involved a company town with ""all the attributes"" of a municipality, and Logan Valley, supra, which involved labor picketing designed to convey a message to patrons of a particular store, so located in the center of a large private enclave as to preclude other reasonable access to store patrons.

Argued April 20, 1972
Decided June 19, 1972
407 U.S. 245

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who was given a five-year sentence, was referred under an ex parte order to the Patuxent Institution for examination to determine whether he should be committed for an indefinite term as a defective delinquent. In this proceeding for post-conviction relief, he challenge his confinement after expiration of that sentence as violative of due process.  Respondent contends that petitioner's continued confinement is justified until petitioner cooperates with the examining psychiatrists and thus facilitates an assessment of his condition.  The trial court denied relief, holding that a person confined under Maryland's Defective Delinquency Law may be detained until the statutory procedures for examination and report have been completed, regardless of whether or not the criminal sentence has expired.
Held:  In the circumstances of this case, it is a denial of due process to continue to hold petitioner on the basis of an ex parte order committing him to observation without the procedural safeguards commensurate with a long-term commitment, Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715; and without affording him those safeguards his further detention cannot be justified as analogous to confinement for civil contempt or for any other reason.  Pp.  407 U.

for the Eastern District of Michigan
No. 70-153
Argued February 24, 1972
Decided June 19, 1972
407 U.S. 297

Syllabus 
The United States charged three defendants with conspiring to destroy, and one of them with destroying, Government property.  In response to the defendants' pretrial motion for disclosure of electronic surveillance information, the Government filed an affidavit of the Attorney General stating that he had approved the wiretaps for the purpose of
""gather[ing] intelligence information deemed necessary to protect the nation from attempts of domestic organizations to attack and subvert the existing structure of the Government.""
On the basis of the affidavit and surveillance logs (filed in a sealed exhibit), the Government claimed that the surveillances, though warrantless, were lawful as a reasonable exercise of presidential power to protect the national security.  The District Court, holding the surveillances violative of the Fourth Amendment, issued an order for disclosure of the overheard conversations, which the Court of Appeals upheld.  Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, which authorizes court-approved electronic surveillance for specified crimes, contains a provision in 18 U.S.C.  2511(3) that nothing in that law limits the President's constitutional power to protect against the overthrow of the Government or against ""any other clear and present danger to the structure or existence of the Government.""  The Government relies on  2511(3) in support of its contention that ""in excepting national security surveillances from the Act's warrant requirement, Congress recognized the President's authority to conduct such surveillances without prior judicial approval.""
Held:
1. Section 2511(3) is merely a disclaimer of congressional intent to define presidential powers in matters affecting national security, and is not a grant of authority to conduct warrantless national security surveillances.  Pp.  407 U. S. 301-308. 
Page 407 U. S. 298

2. The Fourth Amendment (which shields private speech from unreasonable surveillance) requires prior judicial approval for the type of domestic security surveillance involved in this case.  Pp.  407 U. S. 314-321;  407 U. S. 323-324.
(a) The Government's duty to safeguard domestic security must be weighed against the potential danger that unreasonable surveillances pose to individual privacy and free expression.  Pp.  407 U. S. 314-315.
(b) The freedoms of the Fourth Amendment cannot properly be guaranteed if domestic security suveillances are conducted solely within the discretion of the Executive Branch, without the detached judgment of a neutral magistrate.  Pp.  407 U. S. 316-318.
(c) Resort to appropriate warrant procedure would not frustrate the legitimate purposes of domestic security searches.  Pp.  407 U. S. 318-321.

Petitioner Unterweser made an agreement to tow respondent's drilling rig from Louisiana to Italy.  The contract contained a forum-selection clause providing for the litigation of any dispute in the High Court of Justice in London.  When the rig under tow was damaged in a storm, respondent instructed Unterweser to tow the rig to Tampa, the nearest port of refuge.  There, respondent brought suit in admiralty against petitioners.  Unterweser invoked the forum clause in moving for dismissal for want of jurisdiction and brought suit in the English court, which ruled that it had jurisdiction under the contractual forum provision.  The District Court, relying on Carbon Black Export, Inc. v. The Monrosa, 254 F. 2d 297, held the forum-selection clause unenforceable, and refused to decline jurisdiction on the basis of forum non conveniens.  	The Court of Appeals affirmed.

The right of an indigent defendant in a criminal trial to the assistance of counsel, which is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, is not governed by the classification of the offense or by whether or not a jury trial is required.  No accused may be deprived of his liberty as the result of any criminal prosecution, whether felony or misdemeanor, in which he was denied the assistance of counsel.  In this case, the Supreme Court of Florida erred in holding that petitioner, an indigent who was tried for an offense punishable by imprisonment up to six months, a $1,000 fine, or both, and given a 90-day jail sentence, had no right to court-appointed counsel, on the ground that the right extends only to trials ""for non-petty offenses punishable by more than six months imprisonment.""

No. 70-5015
Argued December 6, 1971
Reargued February 28, 1972
Decided June 12, 1972
407 U.S. 25

Syllabus 
The right of an indigent defendant in a criminal trial to the assistance of counsel, which is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, is not governed by the classification of the offense or by whether or not a jury trial is required.  No accused may be deprived of his liberty as the result of any criminal prosecution, whether felony or misdemeanor, in which he was denied the assistance of counsel.  In this case, the Supreme Court of Florida erred in holding that petitioner, an indigent who was tried for an offense punishable by imprisonment up to six months, a $1,000 fine, or both, and given a 90-day jail sentence, had no right to court-appointed counsel, on the ground that the right extends only to trials ""for non-petty offenses punishable by more than six months imprisonment.""  Pp.  407 U. S. 27-40.

No. 70-5039
Argued November 9, 1971
Decided June 12, 1972*
407 U.S. 67

Syllabus 
Appellants, most of whom were purchasers of household goods under conditional sales contracts, challenge the constitutionality of prejudgment replevin provisions of Florida law (in No. 70-5039) and Pennsylvania law (in No. 70-5138).  These provisions permit a private party, without a hearing or prior notice to the other party, to obtain a prejudgment writ of replevin through a summary process of ex parte application to a court clerk, upon the posting of a bond for double the value of the property to be seized.  The sheriff is then required to execute the writ by seizing the property.  Under the Florida statute, the officer seizing the property must keep it for three days.  During that period, the defendant may reclaim possession by posting his own security bond for double the property's value, in default of which the property is transferred to the applicant for the writ, pending a final judgment in the underlying repossession action.  In Pennsylvania, the applicant need not initiate a repossession action or allege (as Florida requires) legal entitlement to the property, it being sufficient that he file an ""affidavit of the value of the property""; and to secure a post-seizure hearing, the party losing the property through replevin must himself initiate a suit to recover the property.  He may also post his own counterbond within three days of the seizure to regain possession.  Included in the printed form sales contracts that appellants signed were provisions for the sellers' repossession of the merchandise on the buyers' default.  Three-judge District Courts in both cases upheld the constitutionality of the challenged replevin provisions.
Held:
1. The Florida and Pennsylvania replevin provisions are invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment since they work a deprivation of property without due process of law by denying the right to a 
Page 407 U. S. 68
 prior opportunity to be heard before chattels are taken from the possessor.  Pp.  407 U. S. 80-93.
(a) Procedural due process in the context of these cases requires an opportunity for a hearing before the State authorizes its agents to seize property in the possession of a person upon the application of another, and the minimal deterrent effect of the bond requirement against unfounded applications for a writ constitutes no substitute for a pre-seizure hearing.  Pp.  407 U. S. 80-84.
(b) From the standpoint of the application of the Due Process Clause, it is immaterial that the deprivation may be temporary and nonfinal during the three-day post-seizure period.  Pp.  407 U. S. 84-86.
(c) The possessory interest of appellants, who had made substantial installment payments, was sufficient for them to invoke procedural due process safeguards notwithstanding their lack of full title to the replevied goods.  Pp.  407 U. S. 86-87.
(d) The District Courts erred in rejecting appellants' constitutional claim on the ground that the household goods seized were not items of ""necessity,"" and therefore did not require due process protection, as the Fourteenth Amendment imposes no such limitation.  Pp.  407 U. S. 88-90.
(e) The broadly drawn provisions here involved serve no such important a state interest as might justify summary seizure.  Pp.  407 U. S. 90-93.
2. The contract provisions for repossession by the seller on the buyer's default did not amount to a waiver of the appellants' procedural due process rights, those provisions neither dispensing with a prior hearing nor indicating the procedure by which repossession was to be achieved.

|407 u.s. 104|"Colten v. Kentucky
No. 71-404
Argued April 17, 1972
Decided June 12, 1972
407 U.S. 104

Syllabus 
Appellant, arrested for disorderly conduct when he failed, notwithstanding several requests by an officer, to leave a congested roadside where a friend in another car was being ticketed for a traffic offense, was tried and convicted in an inferior court and fined $10.  Kentucky has a two-tier system for adjudicating certain criminal cases, under which a person charged with a misdemeanor may be tried first in an inferior court and, if dissatisfied with the outcome, may have a trial de novo in a court of general criminal jurisdiction, but must risk a greater punishment if convicted.  Exercising his right to a trial de novo, appellant was tried for disorderly conduct in the circuit court, convicted, and fined $50.  The state appellate court affirmed, rejecting appellant's contention that the disorderly conduct statute is unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and that the greater punishment contravened the due process requirements of North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, and violated the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause.  The disorderly conduct statute makes it an offense for a person with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, to congregate with others in a public place and refuse to comply with a lawful police dispersal order.  As construed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, a violation occurs only where there is no bona fide intention to exercise a constitutional right or where the interest to be advanced by the individual's exercise of the right is insignificant in comparison to the inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm caused by his action.
Held:
1. The disorderly conduct statute was not unconstitutionally applied, there having been ample evidence that the action of appellant, who had no constitutional right to observe the ticketing process or engage the issuing officer in conversation, was interfering with enforcement of traffic laws.  Pp.  407 U. S. 108-110.
2. The statute is not impermissibly vague or broad, as ""citizens who desire to obey [it] will have no difficulty in understanding it,"" and, as construed by the Kentucky court, individuals may not be convicted thereunder merely for expressing unpopular ideas.  Pp.  407 U. S. 110-111. 
Page 407 U. S. 105

3. Kentucky's two-tier system does not violate the Due Process Clause, as it imposes no penalty on those who seek a trial de novo after having been convicted in the inferior court.  The Kentucky procedure involves a completely fresh determination of guilt or innocence by the superior court which is not the court that acted on the case before and has no motive to deal more strictly with a de novo defendant than it would with any other.  North Carolina v. Pearce, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  407 U. S. 112-119.
4. The Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit an enhanced sentence on reconviction.  North Carolina v. Pearce, supra, at  395 U. S. 719-720.  Pp.  407 U. S. 119-120.

Argued April 10, 1972
Decided June 12, 1972
407 U.S. 143

Syllabus 
Acting on a tip supplied moments earlier by an informant known to him, a police officer asked respondent to open his car door.  Respondent lowered the window, and the officer reached into the car and found a loaded handgun (which had not been visible from the outside) in respondent's waistband, precisely where the informant said it would be.  Respondent was arrested for unlawful possession of the handgun.  A search incident to the arrest disclosed heroin on respondent's person (as the informant had reported), as well as other contraband in the car.  Respondent's petition for federal habeas corpus relief was denied by the District Court.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the evidence that had been used in the trial resulting in respondent's conviction had been obtained by an unlawful search.
Held:  As Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, recognizes, a policeman making a reasonable investigatory stop may conduct a limited protective search for concealed weapons when he has reason to believe that the suspect is armed and dangerous.  Here, the information from the informant had enough indicia of reliability to justify the officer's forcible stop of petitioner and the protective seizure of the weapon, which afforded reasonable ground for the search incident to the arrest that ensued.

No. 70-75
Argued February 28, 1972
Decided June 12, 1972
407 U.S. 163

Syllabus 
Appellee Irvis, a Negro guest of a member of appellant, a private club, was refused service at the club's dining room and bar solely because of his race.  In suing for injunctive relief, appellee contended that the discrimination was state action, and thus a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because the Pennsylvania liquor board had issued appellant a private club liquor license.  The District Court found appellant's membership and guest practices discriminatory, agreed with appellee's view that state action was present, and declared the liquor license invalid as long as appellant continued its discriminatory practices.  Appellant's motion to have the final decree limited to its guest policy was opposed by appellee, and the court denied the motion.  Following the District Court's decision, the applicable bylaws were amended to exclude as guests those who would be excluded as members.
Held:
1. Appellee, who had not applied for or been denied membership in appellant private club, had no standing to contest appellant's membership practices.  He did, however, have standing to litigate the constitutional validity of appellant's discriminatory policies toward members' guests, and his opposition to amendment of the judgment did not constitute a disclaimer of injunctive relief directed at appellant's guest policies.  Pp.  407 U. S. 165-171.
2. The operation of Pennsylvania's regulatory scheme enforced by the state liquor board, except as noted below, does not sufficiently implicate the State in appellant's discriminatory guest practices so as to make those practices ""state action"" within the purview of the Equal Protection Clause, and there is no suggestion in the record that the State's regulation of the sale of liquor is intended overtly or covertly to encourage discrimination.  Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U. S. 715, distinguished.  Pp.  407 U. S. 171-177.
3. Pennsylvania liquor board's regulation requiring that ""every club licensee shall adhere to all the provisions of its constitution and bylaws"" in effect placed state sanctions behind the discriminatory guest practices that were enacted after the District Court's 
Page 407 U. S. 164
 decision, and enforcement of that regulation should be enjoined to the extent that it requires appellant to adhere to those practices.  Pp.  407 U. S. 177-179.

Syllabus 
This is a class action for injunctive and declaratory relief by a child and mother whose husband is away from home on military duty, challenging the validity of California's Department of Social Welfare Regulation EAS  42-350.11, pursuant to which they had been denied Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits.  Though California incorporates in its AFDC eligibility provisions the ""continued absence"" concept of the Social Security Act, under which a dependent child ""deprived of parental support . . . by reason of [a parent's] continued absence from the home,"" is deemed eligible for AFDC benefits, EAS  42-350.11 excludes absence because of military service from the definition of ""continued absence.""  The District Court granted the relief sought.
Held:  Section 402(a)(10) of the Social Security Act imposes on each State participating in the AFDC program the requirement that benefits ""shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.""  Under the Act, the eligibility criterion of ""continued absence"" of a parent from the home means that the parent may be absent for any reason.  Consequently, that criterion applies to one who is absent by reason of military service, and California's definition is invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  Pp. 600-604.

406 U.S. 621

Syllabus 
When United Gas Pipe Line Co. (United), a jurisdictional pipeline, experienced temporary shortages of natural gas supply forcing it to reduce deliveries to its contract customers, the Federal Power Commission (FPC) asserted its jurisdiction to effect a reasonable curtailment plan covering deliveries to both direct-sales customers and purchasers for resale.  While curtailment proceedings were pending before the FPC, Louisiana Power & Light Co. (LP&L), a direct-sales customer of United, brought this action in the District Court against United, seeking to enjoin curtailment of deliveries to LP&L's plants pursuant to any FPC-promulgated plans, including any under FPC Order No. 431.  LP&L also sought to enjoin United from seeking FPC certification of United's previously intrastate deliveries through its Green System.  The FPC intervened, asserting that both matters were pending before it and any decision by the District Court would therefore invade its primary jurisdiction.  The District Court dismissed the action, holding that the FPC had jurisdiction of both proceedings and that LP&L had to exhaust its administrative remedies.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the FPC lacked jurisdiction to curtail deliveries to direct-sales customers, since Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act makes the Act applicable only to sales for resale.  The Court of Appeals also reversed the District Court's decision on the Green System, holding that the system was wholly intrastate.
Held:
1. The FPC has power to regulate curtailment of direct interstate sales of natural gas under the head of its ""transportation"" jurisdiction in  1(b), and the prohibition in the proviso clause of that provision withheld from FPC only rate-setting authority with respect to such sales.  Pp.  406 U. S. 631-647.
2. The FPC had primary jurisdiction to determine whether the Green System was subject to its authority, and the Court of Appeals

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) promulgated a rule that

441 F.2d 1322, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that:

Petitioner and a companion were stopped for interrogation.  When each produced, in the course of demonstrating identification, items bearing the name ""Shard,"" they were arrested and taken to the police station.  There, the arresting officers learned of a robbery of one ""Shard"" two days before.  The officers sent for Shard, who immediately identified petitioner and his companion as the robbers.  At the time of the confrontation, petitioner and his companion were not advised of the right to counsel, nor did either ask for or receive legal assistance.  Six weeks later, petitioner and his companion were indicted for the Shard robbery.  At the trial, after a pretrial motion to suppress his testimony had been overruled, Shard testified as to his previous identification of petitioner and his companion, and again identified them as the robbers.

Title 28 U.S.C.  1391(d), providing that ""[a]n alien may be sued in any district,"" embodies the long-established rule that a suit against an alien is wholly outside the operation of all federal venue laws (whether general or special), and governs the venue of an action for patent infringement against an alien. The District Court therefore erred in holding that  1400(b) (which provides that a patent infringement suit may be brought in the district of the defendant's residence, or where he has committed infringement acts and has a regular place of business) is the exclusive provision governing venue in patent infringement litigation.  Pp.  406 U. S. 708-714.

406 U.S. 715

Syllabus 
The Indiana procedure for pretrial commitment of incompetent criminal defendants set forth in Ind.Ann.Stat.  9-1706a provides that a trial judge with ""reasonable ground"" to believe the defendant to be incompetent to stand trial must appoint two examining physicians and schedule a competency hearing, at which the defendant may introduce evidence.  If the court, on the basis of the physicians' report and ""other evidence,"" finds that the defendant lacks ""comprehension sufficient to understand the proceedings and make his defense,"" the trial is delayed and the defendant is remanded to the state department of mental health for commitment to an ""appropriate psychiatric institution"" until defendant shall become ""sane.""  Other statutory provisions apply to commitment of citizens who are ""feeble-minded, and are therefore unable properly to care for themselves.""  The procedures for committing such persons are substantially similar to those for determining a criminal defendant's pretrial competency, but a person committed as ""feeble-minded"" may be released ""at any time"" his condition warrants it in the judgment of the superintendent of the institution.  Indiana also has a comprehensive commitment scheme for the ""mentally ill,"" i.e., those with a ""psychiatric disorder"" as defined by the statute, who can be committed on a showing of mental illness and need for ""care, treatment, training or detention.""  A person so committed may be released when the superintendent of the institution shall discharge him, or when he is cured.  Petitioner in this case, a mentally defective deaf mute, who cannot read, write, or virtually otherwise communicate, was charged with two criminal offenses and committed under the  9-1706a procedure.  The doctors' report showed that petitioner's condition precluded his understanding the nature of the charges against him or participating in his defense, and their testimony showed that the prognosis was ""rather dim""; that, even if petitioner were not a deaf mute, he would be incompetent to stand trial; and that petitioner's intelligence was not sufficient to enable him ever to develop the necessary communication skills.  According to a deaf school interpreter's testimony, the State had no facilities that could help petitioner 
Page 406 U. S. 716
 learn minimal communication skills.  After finding that petitioner ""lack[ed] comprehension sufficient to make his defense,"" the court ordered petitioner committed until such time as the health department could certify petitioner's sanity to the court.  Petitioner's counsel filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied.  The State Supreme Court affirmed.  Contending that his commitment was tantamount to a ""life sentence"" without his having been convicted of a crime, petitioner claims that commitment under  9-1706a deprived him of equal protection because, absent the criminal charges against him, the State would have had to proceed under the other statutory procedures for the feeble-minded or those for the mentally ill, under either of which petitioner would have been entitled to substantially greater rights. Petitioner also asserts that indefinite commitment under the section deprived him of due process and subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment.
Held:
1. By subjecting petitioner to a more lenient commitment standard and to a more stringent standard of release than those generally applicable to all other persons not charged with offenses, thus condemning petitioner to permanent institutionalization without the showing required for commitment or the opportunity for release afforded by ordinary civil commitment procedures, Indiana deprived petitioner of equal protection.  Cf. Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U. S. 107.  Pp.  406 U. S. 723-731.
2. Indiana's indefinite commitment of a criminal defendant solely on account of his lack of capacity to stand trial violates due process.  Such a defendant cannot be held more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that he will attain competency in the foreseeable future.  If it is determined that he will not, the State must either institute civil proceedings applicable to indefinite commitment of those not charged with crime or release the defendant.  Greenwood v. United States, 350 U. S. 366, distinguished.  Pp.  406 U. S. 731-739.
3. Since the issue of petitioner's criminal responsibility at the time of the alleged offenses (as distinguished from the issue of his competency to stand trial) has not been determined, and other matters of defense may remain to be resolved, it would be premature for this Court to dismiss the charges against petitioner.  Pp.  406 U. S. 739-741.

Decided June 7, 1972
406 U.S. 759

Syllabus 
This case involves a claim by respondent for excess collateral it had pledged with petitioner to secure a loan, and a counterclaim by petitioner for that excess as an offset against the value of petitioner's property in Cuba expropriated by Cuba without compensation.  The District Court recognized that this Court's decision in Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S. 398 holding that, generally, the courts of one nation will not sit in judgment on the acts of another nation within the latter's territory (act of state doctrine) would bar assertion of the counterclaim, but concluded that post-Sabbatino congressional enactments had, in effect, overruled that decision.  The court issued summary judgment for petitioner on all issues except the amount available for possible setoff.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Sabbatino barred assertion of the counterclaim.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  406 U. S. 762-776.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concluded that, since the Executive Branch, which is charged with the primary responsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs, has (contrary to the position it took in Sabbatino) expressly represented to the Court that the application of the act of state doctrine in this case would not advance the interests of American foreign policy, the decision in Bernstein v. N.V. Nederlandsche-Amerikaansche, 210 F.2d 375, should be adopted and approved, thus permitting judicial examination of the legal issues raised by the act of a foreign sovereign within its own territory.  Pp.  406 U. S. 762-770.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concluded that the central issue in this case is governed by National City Bank v. Republic of China, 348 U. S. 356 (holding that a sovereign's claim may be offset by a counterclaim or setoff), rather than by the Bernstein exception to Sabbatino, and accordingly would allow the setoff up to the amount of respondent's claim.  Pp.  406 U. S. 770-773.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, believing that Sabbatino's broad holding was not compelled by the principles underlying the act of

Held:  As the District Court found, the parties did agree to arbitrate and, the existence and scope of an arbitration clause being matters for judicial decision, the phrase ""any difference"" encompasses the issue of laches within the broad sweep of its arbitration coverage.  Pp. 490-492.

Decided May 30, 1972
406 U.S. 498

Syllabus 
Michigan's Watercraft Pollution Control Act of 1970, appellees maintain, prohibits the discharge of sewage, whether treated or untreated, in Michigan waters and requires vessels with marine toilets to have sewage storage devices.  Appellants, the Lake Carriers' Association and members owning or operating Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels, filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the Act unduly burdens interstate and foreign commerce; contravenes uniform maritime law; violates due process and equal protection requirements; and is invalid under the Supremacy Clause primarily because of conflict with or preemption by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended by the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970.  That law appears to contemplate sewage control after appropriate federal standards have been issued through on-board treatment before disposal in navigable waters, unless the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency provides on special application for a complete prohibition on discharge in designated areas.  A three-judge District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of a justiciable controversy.  The court also found ""compelling reasons to abstain from consideration of the matter in its present posture"" -- the attitude of the Michigan authorities, who are not threatening criminal prosecution, but are seeking industry cooperation; the availability of declaratory relief in the Michigan courts; the possibility of a complete prohibition on the discharge of sewage in Michigan's navigable waters under federal law; the absence of existing conflict between the Michigan requirements and other state laws; and the publication of proposed federal standards that Michigan might consider in interpreting and enforcing its law.
Held:
1. The complaint presents an ""actual controversy"" within the meaning of the Declaratory Judgment Act, because the obligation to install sewage storage devices under the Michigan statute is presently effective in fact.  Pp.  406 U. S. 506-508. 
Page 406 U. S. 499

2. Abstention is permissible ""only in narrowly limited special circumstances,'"" Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U. S. 241,  389 U. S. 248 (1967); justifying ""the delay and expense to which application of the abstention doctrine inevitably gives rise.""  England v Medical Examiners, 375 U. S. 411,  375 U. S. 418 (1964).  Those circumstances do not include the majority of grounds given by the District Court.  Pp.  406 U. S. 509-510.
(a) The absence of an immediate threat of prosecution is not a reason for abstention.  In the absence of a pending state proceeding, exercise of federal court jurisdiction ordinarily is appropriate if the conditions for declaratory or injunctive relief are met.  Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971), and Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66 (1971), distinguished.  Pp.  406 U. S. 509-510.
(b) The availability of declaratory relief in state courts on federal claims is not a reason for abstention.  Zwickler v. Koota, supra, at  389 U. S. 248.  P.  406 U. S. 510.
(c) Just as the possibility of a complete prohibition on the discharge of sewage in Michigan's navigable waters under federal law and the asserted absence of existing conflict between the Michigan requirements and other state laws do not diminish the immediacy and reality of appellants' grievance, they do not call for abstention.  P.  406 U. S. 510.
3. The Michigan statute, however, is unclear in particulars that go to the foundation of appellants' grievance, and has not yet been construed by any Michigan court.

Argued February 22, 1972
Decided May 30, 1972
406 U.S. 535

Syllabus 
Appellants, recipients of Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), challenge the system whereby Texas, in order to allocate its fixed pool of welfare money among persons with acknowledged need, applies a percentage reduction factor to arrive at a reduced standard of need, the factor being lower for AFDC than for other categorical assistance programs.  Appellants assert that the State's method of applying this factor to recipients with outside income contravenes  402(a)(23) of the Social Security Act, which required adjustment, by July 1, 1969, of ""amounts used . . . to determine the needs of individuals"" to reflect increases in living costs, because this method does not increase the welfare rolls to the same extent as would an alternative procedure used by some other States.  They also make an equal protection claim on the grounds that the distinction between the aid programs is not rational, and that the Texas system racially discriminates against the proportionately larger number of minority groups in AFDC than in the other programs.
Held:
1. The Texas scheme does not contravene  402(a)(23) of the Social Security Act, which does not require use of a computation procedure that maximizes individual eligibility for subsidiary benefits.  Pp.  406 U. S. 539-545.
2. The challenged system does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  406 U. S. 545-551.
(a) The fact that there are more members of minority groups in the AFDC program than in other categories does not indicate racial discrimination, absent any proof of racial motivation in the Texas scheme.  There was no such proof here.  Pp.  406 U. S. 547-549.
(b) Texas' decision to provide somewhat lower welfare benefits for AFDC recipients than for the aged and infirm who are in other categories is not invidious or irrational, and there is no constitutional or statutory requirement that relief categories be treated exactly alike.

No. 70-21
Argued march 23, 1972
Decided May 30, 1972
406 U.S. 583

Syllabus 
Appellant political party, its officers, and members, attacked the constitutionality of revisions of the Ohio election code made following this Court's decision in Socialist Labor Party v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23, and a provision that a political party execute a loyalty affidavit under oath in order to obtain a ballot position.  The District Court, deciding the case on cross-motions for summary judgment on the basis of the pleadings and supporting affidavits, upheld all appellants' challenges except that involving the oath provision.  All parties appealed.  A revision of the election code made after this Court noted probable jurisdiction mooted all but the oath issue.  Appellants, who did not attack the oath provision in Rhodes and who have been on the ballot and presumably have complied with that provision since its adoption in 1941, contend that it violates the First Amendment, is impermissibly vague, does not comport with due process, and, since it applies to them and not the two major political parties, violates equal protection.
Held:  The record and pleadings on the one issue not mooted by the supervening legislation (an issue that received scant attention in appellants' complaint, and none in the affidavits supporting the cross-motions for summary judgment) are inadequate for resolution of the constitutional questions presented, and, in view of the abstract and speculative posture of the case, the appeal must therefore be dismissed.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 30, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. 
 On the representation of the Solicitor General set forth in his memorandum for the United States, filed April 26, 1972, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of the position presently asserted by the Government.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins. 
 This case involves a Selective Service registrant whose local board denied him a conscientious objector exemption. In order to aid him with his appeal, the registrant met with a Government appeals agent. The agent made out a report which was placed in the registrant's file, and which was before the appeal board when it considered petitioner's claim. The report was unfavorable, and the Solicitor General also concedes that because of the appeal agent's special position in the Selective Service System, his views probably carried substantial weight with the appeal board. Yet, this crucial report was not shown to the registrant, so that he might have attempted to rebut the unfavorable statements contained therein. THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice POWELL, and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST would deny. It is clear from the decision of this Court over the past two decades that the failure to show this report to the registrant was a violation of the statutory mandate that the 'system of selection' be 'fair and just.' 50 U.S.C. App. 451(c). Thus, this Court has held that where provisions were 
Page 406 U.S. 953 , 954
 made in the Act for FBI reports on claimants for conscientious objector exemptions, 
 And, when the Act contemplated that the Department of Justice should recommend to a registrant's appeal board whether a conscientious objector exemption should be granted or denied, this Court held that 
 In 1967, the provisions relating to Justice Department hearings and recommendations were deleted from the Act. The statutory mandate of 451( c), however, remains unchanged. And, '[v]iewed against our underlying concepts of procedural regularity and basic fair play,' Gonzales, supra, the appellate procedures employed in this case cannot stand. 'It is procedure that marks the difference between rule by law and rule by fiat.' Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 436. 
 The use of adverse information not disclosed to the registrant is exactly analogous to the FBI report summary not disclosed to the registrant in Simmons, and the Justice Department recommendation kept from the registrant in Gonzales. The failure to disclose the use of such material vitiates petitioner's statutory right of appeal. For no appeal procedure can be 'fair' where only one side has had an opportunity to present its case.

406 U.S. 356

Syllabus 
A warrantless arrest for robbery was made of appellant at his home on the basis of identification from photographs, and he was committed by a magistrate.  Thereafter he appeared in a lineup, at which he was represented by counsel, and was identified by the victim of another robbery.  He was tried for the latter offense before a 12-man jury and convicted by a nine-to-three verdict, as authorized by Louisiana law in cases where the crime is necessarily punishable at hard labor.  Other state law provisions require unanimity for five-man jury trials of offenses in which the punishment may be at hard labor and for 12-man jury trials of capital cases.  The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, rejecting appellant's challenge to the jury trial provisions as violative of due process and equal protection and his claim that the lineup identification was a forbidden fruit of an invasion of appellant's Fourth Amendment rights.  Appellant conceded that, under Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, which was decided after his trial began and which has no retroactive effect, the Sixth Amendment does not apply to his case.
Held:
1. The provisions of Louisiana law requiring less than unanimous jury verdicts in criminal cases do not violate the Due Process Clause for failure to satisfy the reasonable doubt standard.  Pp.  406 U. S. 359-363.
(a) The mere fact that three jurors vote to acquit does not mean that the nine who vote to convict have ignored their instructions concerning proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or that they do not honestly believe that guilt has been thus proved.  Pp.  406 U. S. 360-362.
(b) Want of jury unanimity does not alone establish reasonable doubt.  Pp.  406 U. S. 362-363.
2. The Louisiana legal scheme providing for unanimous verdicts in capital and five-man jury cases, but for less than unanimous verdicts otherwise, and which varies the difficulty of proving guilt with the gravity of the offense, was designed to serve the rational purposes of ""facilitat[ing], expedit[ing], and reduc[ing] expense in the administration of justice,"" and does not constitute an invidious classification violative of equal protection.  Pp.  406 U. S. 363-365. 
Page 406 U. S. 357

3. Since no evidence constituting the fruit of an illegal arrest was used at appellant's trial, the validity of his arrest is not at issue, and the lineup was conducted not by the ""exploitation"" of the arrest, but under the authority of appellant's commitment by the magistrate, which purged the lineup procedure of any ""primary taint.""

Syllabus 
Petitioners, who were found guilty of committing felonies, by less than unanimous jury verdicts, which are permitted under Oregon law in noncapital cases, claim that their convictions, upheld on appeal, contravene their right to trial by jury under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  406 U. S. 410-414,  406 U. S. 369-380.
1 Ore.App. 483, 462 P.2d 691, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that:
1. The Sixth Amendment guarantee of a jury trial, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth (Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145), does not require that the jury's vote be unanimous.  Pp.  406 U. S. 410-412.
(a) The Amendment's essential purpose of ""interpos[ing] between the accused and his accuser . . . the common sense judgment of a group of laymen"" representative of a cross-section of the community, Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78,  399 U. S. 100, is served despite the absence of a unanimity requirement.  Pp.  406 U. S. 410-411.
(b) Petitioners' argument that the Sixth Amendment requires jury unanimity in order to effectuate the reasonable doubt standard otherwise mandated by due process requirements is without merit, since that Amendment does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt at all.  Pp.  406 U. S. 411-412.
2. Jury unanimity is not mandated by the Fourteenth Amendment requirements that racial minorities not be systematically excluded from the jury selection process; even when racial minority members are on the jury, it does not follow that their views will not be just as rationally considered by the other jury members as would be the case under a unanimity rule.  Pp.  406 U. S. 412-414.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL concluded that:
1. Although, on the basis of history and precedent, the Sixth Amendment mandates unanimity in a federal jury trial, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while requiring States to provide jury trials for serious crimes, does not incorporate 
Page 406 U. S. 405
 all the elements of a jury trial within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, and does not require jury unanimity.  Oregon's ""ten of twelve"" rule is not violative of due process.  Pp.  406 U. S. 369-377.
2. Nor is the Oregon provision inconsistent with the due process requirement that a jury be drawn from a representative cross-section of the community, as the jury majority remains under the duty to consider the minority viewpoint in the course of deliberation, and the usual safeguards exist to minimize the possibility of jury irresponsibility.  Pp.  406 U. S. 378-380.

Syllabus 
After appellant invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer questions concerning organized crime, racketeering, and political corruption in Long Branch, New Jersey, appellee Commission granted him statutory immunity
""from having such responsive answer given by him or such responsive evidence produced by him, or evidence derived therefrom used to expose him to criminal prosecution or penalty or to a forfeiture of his estate. . . .""
Appellant still refused to answer, contending that full transactional immunity was required, that the statutory ban on the use and derivative use of ""responsive"" answers is unconstitutionally vague, and that the immunity would not protect him from foreign prosecution, of which he has a real and substantial fear.  Appellant was adjudged to be in contempt, and the judgment was upheld on appeal.  The New Jersey Supreme Court, construing the responsiveness limitation, held that ""the statute protects the witness against answers and evidence he in good faith believed were demanded.""  Commission procedure provides for an advance statement of the subject matter of the questioning, and permits a witness to have counsel present at the hearing.
Held:
1. The New Jersey statutory immunity from use and derivative use is coextensive with the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination, and is sufficient to compel testimony.  Kastigar v. United States, ante, p.  406 U. S. 441.  Pp.  406 U. S. 474-476.

Syllabus 
Respondents, members of the Old Order Amish religion and the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church, were convicted of violating Wisconsin's compulsory school attendance law (which requires a child's school attendance until age 16) by declining to send their children to public or private school after they had graduated from the eighth grade.  The evidence showed that the Amish provide continuing informal vocational education to their children designed to prepare them for life in the rural Amish community.  The evidence also showed that respondents sincerely believed that high school attendance was contrary to the Amish religion and way of life, and that they would endanger their own salvation and that of their children by complying with the law.  The State Supreme Court sustained respondents' claim that application of the compulsory school attendance law to them violated their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:
1. The State's interest in universal education is not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on other fundamental rights, such as those specifically protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and the traditional interest of parents with respect to the religious upbringing of their children.  Pp.  406 U. S. 213-215.
2. Respondents have amply supported their claim that enforcement of the compulsory formal education requirement after the eighth grade would gravely endanger if not destroy the free exercise of their religious beliefs.  Pp.  406 U. S. 215-219
3. Aided by a history of three centuries as an identifiable religious sect and a long history as a successful and self-sufficient segment of American society, the Amish have demonstrated the sincerity of their religious beliefs, the interrelationship of belief with their mode of life, the vital role that belief and daily conduct play in the continuing survival of Old Order Amish communities, and the hazards presented by the State's enforcement of a statute generally valid as to others.  Beyond this, they have 
Page 406 U. S. 206
 carried the difficult burden of demonstrating the adequacy of their alternative mode of continuing informal vocational education in terms of the overall interest that the State relies on in support of its program of compulsory high school education.  In light of this showing, and weighing the minimal difference between what the State would require and what the Amish already accept, it was incumbent on the State to show with more particularity how its admittedly strong interest in compulsory education would be adversely affected by granting an exemption to the Amish.  Pp.  406 U. S. 212-29,  406 U. S. 234-236.
4. The State's claim that it is empowered, as parens patriae, to extend the benefit of secondary education to children regardless of the wishes of their parents cannot be sustained against a free exercise claim of the nature revealed by this record, for the Amish have introduced convincing evidence that accommodating their religious objections by forgoing one or two additional years of compulsory education will not impair the physical or mental health of the child, or result in an inability to be self-supporting or to discharge the duties and responsibilities of citizenship, or in any other way materially detract from the welfare of society.

Syllabus 
Wackenhut Corp., a company that had provided plant protection service for a Lockheed Aircraft Service Co. factory, had entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the United Plant Guard Workers (UPG), the union certified by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) as the representative of a majority of Wackenhut guards at the plant after an NLRB election.  A few months later, Wackenhut's service contract expired, and it was succeeded by Burns International Security Services, which knew of the collective bargaining agreement.  Burns employed 27 of the 42 Wackenhut guards, but refused to recognize UPG or to honor the agreement, and denied any obligation to bargain with UPG.  The NLRB found that Burns violated  8(a)(5) and 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act by failing to recognize and bargain with UPG and by refusing to honor the collective bargaining agreement, and ordered Burns to abide by the terms of the agreement and to
""give retroactive effect to all the clauses of said [Wackenhut] contract and, with interest of 6 percent, make whole its employees for any losses suffered by reason of Respondent's [Burns'] refusal to honor, adopt and enforce said contract.""
The Court of Appeals held that the NLRB had exceeded its powers in ordering Burns to honor the contract executed by Wackenhut
Held:
1. Where the bargaining unit remained unchanged and a majority of the employees hired by the new employer were represented by a recently certified bargaining agent, the NLRB correctly implemented the express mandates of  8(a)(5) and 9(a) of the Act by ordering the new employer, Burns, to bargain with the incumbent union, UPG.  Pp.  406 U. S. 277-281.

3. The NLRB's order for monetary restitution to Burns' employees cannot be sustained on the ground that Burns committed an unfair labor practice by unilaterally changing existing terms and conditions of employment.  Burns had no previous relationship to the unit and no outstanding terms and conditions of employment, so that Burns did not change its terms and conditions of employment when it specified the initial basis on which it would hire employees when it inaugurated its protection service at the plant.

 Eddie David COXv. UNITED STATES.No. 71-5910. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 15, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted of bank robbery after a trial in which the Government introduced over objection tape recordings of his telephone communications. These tape recordings had resulted from a federal court order which was issued pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. 2510-2520, and which permitted federal agents to wiretap. Although the order was limited to seizures of communications relating to narcotics offenses, the eavesdroppers discovered that the subjects were discussing a bank robbery and those conversations were recorded despite the limited scope of the order. 
 The petitioner challenged the introduction of these tapes on the ground that their subject matter was outside the scope of the warrant. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, reasoning that once the device was legitimately spliced into the designated telephone lines anything overheard was in 'plain view' and therefore could be seized lawfully. Said the Court of Appeals: 'Once the listening commences it becomes impossible to turn it off when a subject other than one which is authorized is overheard.' With all respect, that is precisely the point. As I said in Osborn v. United States, 385 U.S. 323, 353: 
Page 406 U.S. 934 , 935
 without regard to the nature of the conversations, or the participants. A warrant authorizing such devices is no different from the general warrants the Fourth Amendment was intended to prohibit.'
 I would grant this petition, reverse, and hold that Title III offends the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment. 
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL are of the opinion that certiorari should be granted.

Although the order was limited to seizures of communications relating to narcotics offenses, the eavesdroppers discovered that the subjects were discussing a bank robbery and those conversations were recorded despite the limited scope of the order. 
 The petitioner challenged the introduction of these tapes on the ground that their subject matter was outside the scope of the warrant. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, reasoning that once the device was legitimately spliced into the designated telephone lines anything overheard was in 'plain view' and therefore could be seized lawfully. Said the Court of Appeals: 'Once the listening commences it becomes impossible to turn it off when a subject other than one which is authorized is overheard.' With all respect, that is precisely the point. As I said in Osborn v. United States, 385 U.S. 323, 353: 
Page 406 U.S. 934 , 935
 without regard to the nature of the conversations, or the participants. A warrant authorizing such devices is no different from the general warrants the Fourth Amendment was intended to prohibit.'
 I would grant this petition, reverse, and hold that Title III offends the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment. 
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL are of the opinion that certiorari should be granted.

 By a 1903 Treaty the United States obtained a corridor across the Republic of Panama from the Caribbean to the Pacific. 33 Stat. 2234. But Art. VI of the Treaty provided that the grants to the United States shall not 'interfere with the rights of way over the public roads passing through the said zone . . . unless said rights of way or private rights shall conflict with rights herein granted to the United States in which case the rights of the United States shall be superior.' 33 Stat. 2234; 3 Canal Zone Code pp. 428, 431. 
 Petitioner is a Panamanion who has been operating buses in Panama for 23 years. His license to operate was granted by the Republic of Panama and his area of operation begins and ends in the Republic of Panama. Under a reciprocal agreement between the Canal Zone and Panama any motor vehicle inspected in Panama will be accepted in the Canal Zone and vice versa. 
 The public road travelled by petitioner crosses the Canal Zone and his operations in no way conflict with 'any rights granted to the United States' under the 1903 Treaty.

 The Canal Zone authorities decided to give all cross-Canal Zone public transportation to one Delaware corporation. The necessity of the Delaware corporation's meeting minimum wage requirements was said to be the reason. No hearings, however, were held. The petitioner and the other 'indigents' were given no notice and no opportunity to be heard. They were driven out of business by the ipse dixit of the Governor and petitioner stands criminally convicted. Petitioner is no fly-by-night operator. He operated 15 buses and employed 30 people and was in this business for 23 years. His crossing of the Canal Zone is guaranteed by the 1903 Treaty; and though one agrees arguendo that the right may be regulated as to times and circumstances, there is no defensible reason given why a person should be driven out of business with no chance to be heard.

No. 71-1024
Decided April 29, 1972*
406 U.S. 187

Syllabus 
A three-judge District Court found that the Minnesota Legislature was malapportioned, and reduced the number of legislative districts from 67, the number established in 1913, to 35, thereby reducing the number of senators by almost 50%, and the number of representatives by nearly 25%.  The court declared the entire 1966 apportionment act unconstitutional, and enjoined state officials from conducting elections thereunder, later modifying that injunction so as to enjoin any future elections under any plan other than the one adopted by the court ""or a constitutional plan adopted after this date by the State of Minnesota.""  Appellant, the Minnesota State Senate, intervened in the apportionment challenge below.
Held:
1. The appellant had the right to intervene, as the District Court's orders directly affected the senate, which is an appropriate legal entity for the purpose of intervention.  Silver v. Jordan, 241 F.Supp. 576, aff'd, 381 U. S. 415.
2. The District Court's injunction with respect to the statutory sections fixing the number of legislative districts and the number of senators and representatives is sufficient to justify a direct appeal under 28 U.S.C.  1253.
3. A federal reapportionment court should accommodate the relief ordered to the appropriate provisions of state statutes relating to the legislature's size as far as possible, and the action of the District Court here in so drastically changing the number of districts and the size of the houses of the state legislature is not required by the Federal Constitution, and is not justified as an exercise of federal power.

Syllabus 
In a contract disputes procedure, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) approved claims of its contractor for additional compensation.  In response to an AEC certifying officer's request for advice as to one item, however, the General Accounting Office (GAO) ruled that the claims could not be certified for payment.  When the AEC then refused to pay the compensation, the contractor brought suit in the Court of Claims alleging that the GAO had no authority to overturn the AEC approval.  The Government, through the Department of Justice, defended on the ground that the AEC determination was not final, but was subject to judicial review under the standards specified in  321 of the Wunderlich Act,
""[t]hat . . . the same is fraudulent or capricious or arbitrary or so grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith, or is not supported by substantial evidence.""
The Court of Claims held that
""the Government has the right to the same extent as the contractor to seek judicial review of an unfavorable administrative decision on a contract claim.""
Held:
1.

The State of Illinois has filed a motion for leave to file a bill of complaint against four Wisconsin cities and two local sewerage commissions for allegedly polluting Lake Michigan.  Illinois seeks to invoke the Court's original jurisdiction on the ground that the defendants are instrumentalities of Wisconsin, and that this suit is therefore one against the State that must be brought in this Court under Art. III,  2, cl. 2, of the Constitution, which confers original jurisdiction on the Court ""[i]n all cases . . . in which a State shall be a party,"" and 28 U.S.C.  1251(a)(1), which provides that the Court shall have ""original and exclusive jurisdiction of [all] controversies between two or more States. . . .""  Under 28 U.S.C.  1251(b)(3), the Court has ""original but not exclusive"" jurisdiction of actions by a State against citizens of another State, and under  1331(a), a district court has original jurisdiction ""of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds $10,000 . . . and [arises] under the Constitution [or] laws . . . of the United States.""

1. Though Wisconsin could be joined as a defendant here under appropriate pleadings, it is not mandatory that it be made one, and its political subdivisions are not ""States"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1251(a)(1).

2. In this case, the appropriate federal district court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1331(a) to give relief against the nuisance of interstate water pollution and is the proper forum for litigation of the issues here involved.  Pp.  406 U. S. 98-101.
(a) The jurisdictional amount requirement of  1331(a) is satisfied in this action involving the purity of interstate waters.  P.  406 U. S. 98.

Syllabus 
Eighteen States have filed a motion for leave to file a bill of complaint against the Nation's four major automobile manufacturers and their trade association, alleging a conspiracy in violation of the federal antitrust laws a common law conspiracy in restraint of trade to restrain the development of motor vehicle air pollution control equipment, and a public nuisance in violation of state and federal common law.  Those States seek an injunction, inter alia, requiring the defendants to accelerate a research and development program to produce effective pollution control devices and pollution-free engines and to install anti-pollution equipment in all vehicles they manufactured during the alleged conspiracy.
Held:  Though the Court has original but not exclusive jurisdiction, it exercises discretion to avoid impairing its ability to administer its appellate docket.  In view of the nature of the relief requested and the availability of the federal district courts as an alternative forum, the Court declines to assume jurisdiction.  As a matter of law as well as of practical necessity, remedies for air pollution must be considered in the context of local situations, making it advisable that this controversy be resolved in the appropriate federal district courts.

The Ute Partition Act was designed to provide for the partition and distribution of the tribe's assets between the mixed-blood and full-blood members; for termination of federal supervision over the trust and restricted property of mixed-bloods; and for a development program for the full-bloods with a view toward terminating federal supervision of them.  In addition to cash and land, the tribe owned oil, gas, and mineral rights (principally oil shale deposits underlying the reservation) and unadjudicated and unliquidated claims against the Government.  The Act provided that, upon publication of the final membership rolls, the tribal business committee (representing the full-bloods) and the mixed-bloods' ""authorized representatives"" were to start dividing assets that could be practicably distributed, based upon the relative number of persons in each group, with a further plan to be prepared for distributing the mixed-bloods' assets to individual members.  After each mixed-blood had received his distributive share, federal restrictions were to be removed except as to the remaining interest in tribal property.  The assets not practicably distributable were to be jointly managed by the committee and the mixed-bloods' representatives.  Under the Act, the mixed-bloods, by way of selecting their representatives, organized the Affiliated Ute Citizens (AUC) as an unincorporated association which, as authorized by the statute, created the Ute Distribution Corp. (UDC) to manage (jointly with the committee) the oil, gas, and mineral rights and unadjudicated or unliquidated claims against the Government as part of the plan for distributing assets to individual mixed-bloods.  UDC issued 10 shares of its stock in the name of each mixed-blood and made an agreement with First Security Bank of Utah (the bank) for the bank to become the UDC stock transfer agent, the bank to hold the stock certificates and issue receipts to the shareholders.  Under UDC's articles, a mixed-blood shareholder desiring to dispose of his stock prior to August 27, 1964, had to give first-refusal rights to tribe members, absent which no stock sale was valid.  A sale could be made to a nonmember 
Page 406 U. S. 129
 only if no member accepted the offer, and the price could be no lower than that offered to members.  The UDC certificates were to bear a stamp revealing these conditions, along with a caveat that the certificates did not represent ordinary corporate shares; that the stock's future value could not be determined; and that the stock should be retained for the shareholder's benefit.  Upon the sale to a nonmember, the seller was to furnish an affidavit to the reservation superintendent stating the amount he received.  The federal trust relationship involving the divided assets contemplated by the Act was terminated by proclamation of the Secretary of the Interior effective August 27, 1961.  AUC Case.  AUC, acting for itself and its 490 mixed-blood members, in April, 1968, sued the United States for a pro rata distribution to the individual members of the mixed-bloods' 27% of the mineral estate underlying the reservation and for a determination that AUC, and not UDC, was entitled to manage that property jointly with the committee.  Jurisdiction was asserted under 25 U.S.C.  345 and 28 U.S.C.  1399 and 2409.  The District Court granted the Government's motion to dismiss, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Reyos Case.  In February, 1965, a group of mixed-bloods (12 of whom were selected as ""bell-wether plaintiffs"" for initial trial purposes) sued the bank, two bank employees (Gale and Haslem) and (under the Tort Claims Act) the United States, charging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the SEC's Rule 10b-5, which prohibits ""any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud"" in connection with securities transactions.  The claimed violations involved plaintiffs' sales of UDC shares in 1963 and 1964 (some made before, and some after, August 27).  The District Court, inter alia, found that mixed-bloods had sold 1,387 shares of UDC stock to nonmembers, Haslem buying 50 shares (after August 27, 1964) and Gale 63 (44 before that date and 19 after).  The 12 plaintiffs sold 120 shares, Gale buying 10 and Haslem six.  Thirty-two other whites bought shares from mixed-bloods during the 1963-1964 period.  In 1964-1965 mixed-bloods sold shares at $300 to $700 per share, while the price range on transfer between whites was $500 to $700.  Gale and Haslem received various commissions for their services in connection with transfers of UDC stock from mixed-bloods to nonmembers, solicited contracts for open purchases of UDC stock on bank premises during business hours, and prepared the necessary affidavits and other papers, using, at best, ""informal"" procedures.  The District Court 
Page 406 U. S. 130
 concluded that the Government had reason to know of the sales to non-Indians and failed to perform its duty to the mixed-bloods to discourage and prevent the sales; that Gale and Haslem had devised a scheme to acquire for themselves and others UDC shares at less than their fair value; and that the bank had notice of the employees' improper activities.  The court found that each of the defendants (with certain exceptions applicable to the Government) was liable to each of the 12 plaintiffs, and assessed damages by using a $1,500-per-share value for the UDC stock as of the times of the sales.  The court reached that figure after taking account of the oil shale deposits underlying the reservation, along with gas, coal, and other minerals; petitioners' remaining interests in an Indian Claims Commission award; unadjudicated claims against the Government; the specific prices for UDC share sales by mixed-bloods to whites; the fact that mixed-bloods (who were under heavy selling pressure) were not so well informed about the stock's potential value as were whites; the influence of Gale's and Haslem's improper activities on selling prices; opinion evidence as to worth above $700 per share; and other factors.  The measure of damages for each seller, the court held, was the difference between the fair value of the UDC shares at the time of sale and the fair value of what the seller received.  The Court of Appeals reversed in substantial part, holding that, after the 1961 termination, the Government owed petitioners no duty in connection with the UDC stock sales; that Gale and Haslem were liable only where they personally purchased shares for their own accounts or for resale to an undisclosed principal at a higher price, but not in other instances, where their actions were held to be only ministerial; and that the bank's liability did not extend beyond Gale's and Haslem's.  The District Court's valuation of the UDC stock was held to lack record support, and the proper measure of damages was held to be ""the profit made by the defendant on resale"" or, absent a resale, ""the prevailing market price at the time of the purchase from the plaintiffs.""  A petition for certiorari covering both the AUC case and the Reyos case was granted.
Held:
The AUC Case 
1. The AUC case was properly dismissed for want of jurisdiction as an unconsented suit against the United States.  Pp.  406 U. S. 141-143.
(a) Though, under 25 U.S.C.  345, the Government has consented to suits to enforce an Indian's right to an allotment of land, the AUC's claimed interest in the mineral estate has not been made subject to an allotment.  Pp.  406 U. S. 142-143. 
Page 406 U. S. 131

(b) Title 28 U.S.C.  1399 and 2409 are inapplicable, since those provisions confer jurisdiction with respect to partition suits where the United States is a tenant in common or a joint tenant, which is not the situation here.  P.  406 U. S. 143.
2. The UDC, and not the AUC, is entitled to manage jointly with the full-bloods the oil, gas, and mineral rights underlying the reservation.  Pp.  406 U. S. 143-144.
The Reyos Case 
3. The Ute Partition Act and the 1961 termination proclamation ended federal supervision over the trust and the mixed-bloods' restricted property, including the UDC shares, and the right of first refusal specified in the UDC corporate articles created no duty on the Government's part to the terminated mixed-bloods seeking to sell their shares.  Pp.  406 U. S. 149-150.
4. The Court of Appeals correctly determined that Gale and Haslem violated Rule 10b-5 by making misstatements of material fact, namely, that the prevailing market price of the UDC shares was the figure at which their purchases were made, but the court erred in holding that there was no violation of the Rule unless the record disclosed evidence of reliance on the misrepresentations.  All that is necessary is that the facts withheld be material in the sense that a reasonable investor might have considered them important in the making of his decision.  Pp.  406 U. S. 150-154.
5. The bank's liability is coextensive with that of Gale and Haslem.  P.  406 U. S. 154.
6. The correct measure of damages under  28 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is the difference between the fair value of what the mixed-blood seller received for his stock and what he would have received had there been no fraudulent conduct (except where the defendant received more than the seller's actual loss, in which case the defendant's profit is the amount of damages).  Pp.  406 U. S. 154-155.
7. The District Court's valuation of $1,500 per UDC share has adequate record support.  Pp.  406 U. S. 155-156.
431 F.2d 1349, affirmed; 431 F.2d 1337, affirmed in part, reversed in part.

Syllabus 
Decedent, who died as a result of injuries received during the course of his employment, had maintained a household with four legitimate minor children, one unacknowledged minor child, and petitioner, to whom he was not married.  His wife had been committed to a mental hospital.  A second illegitimate child was born posthumously.  Under Louisiana's workmen's compensation law unacknowledged illegitimate children are not within the class of ""children,"" but are relegated to the lesser status of ""other dependents,"" and may recover only if there are not enough surviving dependents in the preceding classes to exhaust the maximum benefits.  The four legitimate children were awarded the maximum allowable compensation, and the two illegitimate children received nothing.  The Louisiana courts sustained the statutory scheme, holding that Levy v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 68, was not controlling.
Held:  Louisiana's denial of equal recovery rights to the dependent unacknowledged illegitimate children violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as the inferior classification of these dependent children bears no significant relationship to the recognized purposes of recovery that workmen's compensation statutes were designed to serve.

405 U.S. 707

Syllabus 
In No. 70-99, respondents challenged a ""use and service charge"" of $1 ""for each passenger enplaning any commercial aircraft operated from the Dress Memorial Airport"" in Evansville, Indiana.  The funds were to be used for the improvement and maintenance of the airport.  The Indiana Supreme Court, upholding the lower court, held the charge to be an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce in violation of Art. I,  8, of the Constitution.  In No. 70-212, a New Hampshire statute levied a service charge of $1 for each passenger enplaning a schedule commercial airliner weighing 12,500 pounds or more, and a 50 charge for each passenger enplaning a scheduled aircraft weighing less than 12,500 pounds.  Fifty percent of the funds were allocated to the State's aeronautical fund, with the balance going to the municipalities or airport authorities owning the public landing areas.  The New Hampshire Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of the statute.
Held:  The charges imposed in these cases are constitutional.  Pp.  405 U. S. 711-722.
(a) A charge designed to make the user of state-provided facilities pay a reasonable fee for their construction and maintenance may constitutionally be imposed on interstate and intrastate users alike.  Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, distinguished.  Pp.  405 U. S. 711-717.
(b) The charges, applicable to both interstate and intrastate flights, do not discriminate against interstate commerce and travel.  P.  405 U. S. 717.
(c) Although not all users of the airport facilities are subject to the fees, and there are distinctions among different classes of passengers and aircraft, the charges reflect a fair, albeit imperfect, 
Page 405 U. S. 708
 approximation of the use of the facilities by those for whose benefit they are imposed, and the exemptions are not wholly unreasonable.  Pp.  405 U. S. 717-719.
(d) The airlines have not shown the charges to be excessive in relation to the costs incurred by the taxing authorities in constructing and maintaining airports with public funds.  New Hampshire's decision to reimburse local expenditures through unrestricted revenues is not a matter of concern to the airlines.  Pp.  405 U. S. 719-720.
(e) The charges do not conflict with any federal policies furthering uniform national regulation of air transportation.  Pp.  405 U. S. 720-721.

Syllabus 
In No. 70-99, respondents challenged a ""use and service charge"" of $1 ""for each passenger enplaning any commercial aircraft operated from the Dress Memorial Airport"" in Evansville, Indiana.  The funds were to be used for the improvement and maintenance of the airport.

No. 70-34
Argued November 17, 1971
Decided April 19, 1972
405 U.S. 727

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a membership corporation with ""a special interest in the conservation and sound maintenance of the national parks, game refuges, and forests of the country,"" brought this suit for a declaratory judgment and an injunction to restrain federal officials from approving an extensive skiing development in the Mineral King Valley in the Sequoia National Forest.  Petitioner relies on  10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, which accords judicial review to a
""person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or [who is] adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.""
On the theory that this was a ""public"" action involving questions as to the use of natural resources, petitioner did not allege that the challenged development would affect the club or its members in their activities, or that they used Mineral King, but maintained that the project would adversely change the area's aesthetics and ecology.  The District Court granted a preliminary injunction.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the club lacked standing, and had not shown irreparable injury.
Held:  A person has standing to seek judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act only if he can show that he himself has suffered or will suffer injury, whether economic or otherwise.  In this case, where petitioner asserted no individualized harm to itself or its members, it lacked standing to maintain the action.  Pp.  405 U. S. 731-741.

No. 70-14
Argued November 16, 1971
Decided April 18, 1972
405 U.S. 676

Syllabus 
Appellee's employment at the Boston State Hospital was terminated when she refused to take the following oath required of all public employees in Massachusetts:
""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and that I will oppose the overthrow of the government of the United States of America or of this Commonwealth by force, violence, or by any illegal or unconstitutional method.""
Appellee challenged the constitutionality of the oath statute.  A three-judge District Court concluded that the attack on the ""uphold and defend"" clause was foreclosed by Knight v. Board of Regents, 390 U. S. 36, but found the ""oppose the overthrow"" clause ""fatally vague and unspecific,"" and thus violative of the First Amendment.  In response to a remand from this Court, the District Court concluded that the case was not moot, and reinstated its earlier judgment.
Held:  The Massachusetts oath is constitutionally permissible.  Pp.  405 U. S. 679-687.
(a) The oath provisions of the United States Constitution, Art. II,  1, cl. 8, and Art. VI, cl. 3, are not inconsistent with the First Amendment.  Pp.  405 U. S. 681-682.
(b) The District Court properly held that the ""uphold and defend"" clause, a paraphrase of the constitutional oath, is permissible.  P.  405 U. S. 683.
(c) The ""oppose the overthrow"" clause was not designed to require specific action to be taken in some hypothetical or actual situation, but was to assure that those in positions of public trust were willing to commit themselves to live by the constitutional processes of our government.  Pp.  405 U. S. 683-685.
(d) The oath is not void for vagueness.  Perjury, the sole punishment, requires a knowing and willful falsehood, which removes the danger of punishment without fair notice, and there is no problem of punishment inflicted by mere prosecution, as there has been no prosecution under the statute since its enactment, nor has any been planned.  Pp.  405 U. S. 685-686. 
Page 405 U. S. 677

(e) There is no constitutionally protected right to overthrow a government by force, violence, or illegal or unconstitutional means, and therefore there is no requirement that one who refuse to take Massachuetts' oath be granted a hearing for the determination of some other fact before being dicharged.  Pp. 686-687.

Syllabus 
Respondent, a New York corporation, brought suit for $66,000 on a promissory note against petitioner, a citizen of Texas, in a Texas state court, and petitioner filed a cross-action for $25,000 seeking damages for slander, conversion, and conspiracy in restraint of trade.  A later cross-action included the United States, which held a judgment against petitioner, as a party defendant.  The action was removed to the Federal District Court for trial of the issues, on petition of the United States.  The District Court, without objection, considered all the issues and awarded petitioner $20,000 judgment against respondent.  The Court of Appeals, sua sponte, held that the District Court lacked jurisdiction, and ordered the case returned to the state court.
Held:  Where, after removal, a case is tried on the merits without objection, and the federal court enters a judgment, the issue on appeal is not whether the case was properly removed, but whether the District Court would have had original jurisdiction if the case had been filed in that court.  Here there was diversity jurisdiction in the District Court if the action had been brought there originally.  Pp.  405 U. S. 702-706.

 Mr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, concurring in the judgment. 
 A gas station attendant was shot to death during the course of a holdup in Dawson County, Texas, on a February night in 1956. Five years later the petitioner was arrested, tried, and convicted of the crime. The prosecution's case against the petitioner rested almost totally upon the testimony of the county sheriff. The sheriff testified to the authenticity of a written confession that he said had been dictated and signed with an 'X' by the petitioner. The witness insisted on cross-examination that, although the petitioner could not read or write, and had some difficulty speaking and understanding English, he had indeed dictated the rather complex confession and had understood what he was signing. Only one other witness, who corroborated a part of the sheriff's testimony, connected the petitioner with the crime. 
 The county sheriff, however, played a dual role at the trial. For he was not only the key prosecution witness 
Page 405 U.S. 1052 , 1053
 against the petitioner, but the bailiff of the jury as well. In the latter capacity, he was responsible for the care and protection of the jurors. He had, therefore, substantial and continuing contact with and authority over them during the entire course of the trial. On several occasions, he conducted them in and out of the courtroom on the instructions of the judge. Once, the judge even asked him to step down from the witness stand, where he was undergoing cross-examination, in order to retire the jury. [Footnote 1] In his role as bailiff, the sheriff walked with the jurors to a local restaurant for lunch, conversing with them on the way. At the restaurant, he ate with them in a private room, where the conversations continued. Late in the afternoon, while the jurors were deliberating in the case that turned so largely on their assessment of the sheriff's credibility, they asked the sheriff, as bailiff, to bring them soft drinks in the jury room, which he did. 
 The petitioner has now sought federal habeas corpus relief, claiming that the sheriff's dual role as key prosecution witness and jury bailiff and his substantial association with the jurors during the trial infringed the petitioner's right to due process of law under the doctrine of Turner v.

No. 70-5026
Argued December 6-7, 1971
Decided April 3, 1972
405 U.S. 625

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a Negro, attacks his rape conviction in Lafayette Parish, which was affirmed by the Louisiana Supreme Court, contending that the grand jury selection procedures followed in his case were invidiously discriminatory against Negroes and, because of a statutory exemption provision, against women.  The jury commissioners (all white) sent out questionnaires (including a space for racial designation) to those on a list compiled from nonracial sources.  Of the 7,000-odd returns, 1,015 (14%) were from Negroes, though Negroes constituted 21% of the parish population presumptively eligible for grand jury service.  By means of two culling-out procedures, when racial identifications that the commissioners had attached to the forms were plainly visible, the pool was reduced to 400, of whom 27 (7%) were Negro, from which group the 20-man grand jury venires were drawn.  Petitioner's venire included one Negro (5%), and the grand jury that indicted him had none.  There was no evidence of conscious racial selection, and one commissioner testified that race was no consideration.
Held:
1. Petitioner made out a prima facie case of invidious racial discrimination in the selection of the grand jury that indicted him -- not only on a statistical basis but by a showing that the selection procedures were not racially neutral -- and the State, which did not adequately explain the disproportionately low number of Negroes throughout the selection process, did not meet the burden of rebutting the presumption of unconstitutionality in the procedures used.  Cf. Avery v. Georgia, 345 U. S. 559; Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U. S. 545.  Pp.  405 U. S. 628-632.
2. Petitioner's contentions regarding discrimination against women in the selection of grand jurors are not reached.  Pp.  405 U. S. 633-634.

Petitioner, a Negro, attacks his rape conviction in Lafayette Parish, which was affirmed by the Louisiana Supreme Court, contending that the grand jury selection procedures followed in his case were invidiously discriminatory against Negroes and, because of a statutory exemption provision, against women.  The jury commissioners (all white) sent out questionnaires (including a space for racial designation) to those on a list compiled from nonracial sources.  Of the 7,000-odd returns, 1,015 (14%) were from Negroes, though Negroes constituted 21% of the parish population presumptively eligible for grand jury service.  By means of two culling-out procedures, when racial identifications that the commissioners had attached to the forms were plainly visible, the pool was reduced to 400, of whom 27 (7%) were Negro, from which group the 20-man grand jury venires were drawn.  Petitioner's venire included one Negro (5%), and the grand jury that indicted him had none.  There was no evidence of conscious racial selection, and one commissioner testified that race was no consideration.
Held:
1. Petitioner made out a prima facie case of invidious racial discrimination in the selection of the grand jury that indicted him -- not only on a statistical basis but by a showing that the selection procedures were not racially neutral -- and the State, which did not adequately explain the disproportionately low number of Negroes throughout the selection process, did not meet the burden of rebutting the presumption of unconstitutionality in the procedures used.  Cf. Avery v. Georgia, 345 U. S. 559; Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U. S. 545.  Pp.  405 U. S. 628-632.
2. Petitioner's contentions regarding discrimination against women in the selection of grand jurors are not reached.  Pp.  405 U. S. 633-634.

405 U.S. 645

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an unwed father whose children, on the mother's death, were declared state wards and placed in guardianship, attacked the Illinois statutory scheme as violative of equal protection.  Under that scheme, the children of unmarried fathers, upon the death of the mother, are declared dependents without any hearing on parental fitness and without proof of neglect, though such hearing and proof are required before the State assumes custody of children of married or divorced parents and unmarried mothers.  The Illinois Supreme Court, holding that petitioner could properly be separated from his children upon mere proof that he and the dead mother had not been married and that petitioner's fitness as a father was irrelevant, rejected petitioner's claim.
Held:
1. Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment petitioner was entitled to a hearing on his fitness as a parent before his children were taken from him.  Pp.  405 U. S. 647-658.
(a) The fact that petitioner can apply for adoption or for custody and control of his children does not bar his attack on the dependency proceeding.  Pp.  405 U. S. 647-649.
(b) The State cannot, consistently with due process requirements, merely presume that unmarried fathers in general, and petitioner, in particular, are unsuitable and neglectful parents.  Parental unfitness must be established on the basis of individualized proof.  See Bell v. Burson, 402 U. S. 535.  Pp.  405 U. S. 649-658.
2. The denial to unwed fathers of the hearing on fitness accorded to all other parents whose custody of their children is challenged by the State constitutes a denial of equal protection of the laws.  P.  405 U. S. 658.

No. 70-113
Argued November 18, 1971
Decided March 29, 1972
405 U.S. 562

Syllabus 
In this divestiture action under  7 of the Celler-Kefauver Antimerger Act, the Government challenged the acquisition by appellant, Ford, the second largest automobile manufacturer, of certain assets of Electric Autolite Co. (Autolite), an independent manufacturer of spark plugs and other automotive parts.  The acquisition included the Autolite trade name, Autolite's only domestic spark plug plant, and extensive rights to its nationwide distribution organization for spark plugs and batteries.  The brand used in the spark plug replacement market (aftermarket) has historically been the same as the original equipment (OE) brand.  Autolite and other independents had furnished manufacturers with OE plugs at or below cost, seeking to recoup their losses by profitable aftermarket sales.  Ford, which previously had bought all its spark plugs from independents and was the largest purchaser from that source, made the Autolite acquisition in 1961 for the purpose of participating in the aftermarket.  At about that time, General Motors (GM) had about 30% of the domestic spark plug market.  Autolite had 15%, and Champion, the only other major independent, had 50% (which declined to 40% in 1964, and 33% in 1966).  The District Court found that the industry's oligopolistic structure encouraged maintenance of the OE tie, and that spark plug manufacturers, to the extent that they are not owned by auto makers, will compete more vigorously for private brand sales in the aftermarket.  The court held that the acquisition of Autolite violated  7, since its effect ""may be substantially to lessen competition"" in automotive spark plugs because:  (1) ""as both a prime candidate to manufacture and the major customer of the dominant member of the oligopoly,"" Ford's pre-acquisition position was a moderating influence on the independent companies, and (2) the acquisition significantly foreclosed to independent spark plug manufacturers access to the purchaser of a substantial share of the total industry output.  After hearings, the court ordered the divestiture of the Autolite plant and trade name because of the industry's oligopolistic structure, which encouraged 
Page 405 U. S. 563
 maintenance of the OE tie.  The court stressed that it was in the self-interest of the OE spark plug manufacturers to discourage private brand sales, but noted that changes in marketing methods indicated a substantial growth in the private brand sector of the spark plug market, which, if allowed to develop without unlawful restraint, may account for 17% of the total aftermarket by 1980.  Additionally, the court enjoined Ford for 10 years from manufacturing spark plugs; ordered it for five years to buy one-half its annual requirements from the divested plant under the ""Autolite"" name, during which time it was prohibited from using its own name on spark plugs; and, for 10 years, ordered it to continue its policy of selling to its dealers at prices no less than its prevailing minimum suggested jobbers' selling price.  In contesting divestiture, Ford argued that under its ownership Autolite became a more effective competitor against Champion and GM than it had been as an independent, and that other benefits resulted from the acquisition.
Held:
1. The District Court correctly held that the effect of Ford's acquisition of the Autolite spark plug assets and trade name may be substantially to lessen competition in the spark plug business, and thus to violate  7 of the Celler-Kefauver Antimerger Act; and that the alleged beneficial effects of the merger did not save it from illegality under that provision, United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U. S. 321.  Pp.  405 U. S. 569-571.
2. The relief ordered by the District Court was proper.  Pp.  405 U. S. 571-578.
(a) Divestiture is necessary to restore the pre-acquisition market structure, in which Ford was the leading purchaser from independent sources, and in which a substantial segment of the market was open to competitive selling.  After the divestiture, with Ford again as a purchaser of spark plugs, competitive pressures for its business will be generated and the anti-competitive consequences of its entry as a manufacturer will be eliminated.  Pp.  405 U. S. 573-575.
(b) The ancillary injunctive provisions are necessary to give the divested plant an opportunity to reestablish its competitive position and to nurture the competitive forces at work in the marketplace.  Pp.  405 U. S. 575-578.

405 U.S. 596

Syllabus 
The United States brought this injunction action charging a violation of  1 of the Sherman Act by appellee, Topco, a cooperative association of about 25 small and medium-sized independent regional supermarket chains operating in 33 States.  As its members' purchasing agent, appellee procures more than 1,000 different items, most of which have brand names owned by Topco.  The members' combined retail sales in 1967 were 2.3 billion, exceeded by only three national grocery chains.  A member's average market share in its area is about 6%, and its competitive position is frequently as strong as that of any other chain.  The members own equal amounts of Topco's common stock (the voting stock), choose its directors, and completely control the association's operations.  Topco's bylaws establish an ""exclusive"" category of territorial licenses, under which most members' licenses are issued, and the two other membership categories have proved to be de facto exclusive.  Since no member under this system may sell Topco brand products outside the territory in which it is licensed, expansion into another member's territory is, in practice, permitted only with the other member's consent, and, since a member, in effect, has a veto power over admission of a new member, members can control actual or potential competition in the territorial areas in which they are concerned.  Topco members are prohibited from selling any products supplied by the association at wholesale, whether trademarked or not, without securing special permission, which is not granted without the consent of other interested licensees (usually retailers), and then the member must agree to restrict Topco product sales to a specific area, and under certain conditions.  The Government charged that Topco's scheme of dividing markets violates the Sherman Act because it operates to prohibit competition in Topco brand products among retail grocery chains, and also challenged Topco's restrictions on wholesaling.  Topco contended that it needs territorial divisions to maintain its private label program and to enable it to compete with the larger chains; that the association could not exist if the territorial divisions were not exclusive; and that the restrictions on competition in Topco brand sales enable members to meet larger chain competition.   
Page 405 U. S. 597
 The District Court, agreeing with Topco, upheld the restrictive practices a reasonable and pro-competitive.
Held:  The Topco scheme of allocating territories to minimize competition at the retail level is a horizontal restraint constituting a per se violation of  1 of the Sherman Act, and the District Court erred in applying a rule of reason to the restrictive practices here involved.

United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U. S. 350.  Topco's limitations upon reselling at wholesale are for the same reason per se invalid under  1.  Pp. 606-612.
319 F.Supp. 1031, reversed and remanded.
MARSHALL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which DOUGLAS, BRENNAN STEWART, and WHITE, JJ., joined.  BLACKMUN, J., filed an opinion concurring in the result, post, p.  405 U. S. 612.  BURGER, C.J., filed a dissenting opinion, post, p.  405 U. S. 613.  POWELL and REHNQUIST, JJ., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case."|

 The appeal is dismissed for failure to docket the case within the time prescribed by Rule 13(1). 
 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Mr. Justice REHNQUIST joins, concurring. I join the Court's dismissal of this appeal for failure to docket within the prescribed time. I do so despite the fact that the Court apparently has not consistently enforced the provisions of its Rule 13(1) and, on occasion, has permitted appeals despite untimely docketing. See, for example, another Mississippi voting rights case, Whitley v. Williams, one of the cases decided sub nom. Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544 (1969). Compare Johnson v. Florida, 391 U.S. 596, 598n (1968), and United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 84-86, 561-563 (1947), with Pittsburgh Towing Co. v.

 Lionel Adolph JOSEPHv. UNITED STATES.No. 70-251. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 27, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 After this Court granted the writ of certiorari in this case, the Solicitor General, in his Memorandum for the United States on the merits, took a position different from that previously asserted by the United States in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and in his opposition to the petition for a writ of certiorari. We, therefore, vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that court for consideration in light of the position now asserted by the Solicitor General.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL concurs, dissenting. 
 While I think the judgment should be vacated and the case remanded, I would not do so on the Solicitor General's confession of error, but rather for the reason that meaningful administrative and judicial review of selective service classification decisions is impossible where the service does not state reasons for its actions. 
 Joseph, then classified I-A, applied for a conscientious objector exemption in April, 1967. He stated in his conscientious objector form ( SSS Form 150) that he believed in a Supreme Being, that he was a member of the Nation of Islam (Black Muslims), and that he had joined Muhammed's Mosque No. 12, in Philadelphia, in April 1965, at the age of 17. He represented the views of the Black Muslims regarding participation in war as follows: 
Page 405 U.S. 1006 , 1007
 wars which take the lives of humans. We do not believe this nation should force us to take part in such wars, for we have nothing to gain from it unless America agrees to give us the necessary territory wherein we may have something to fight for.'
 Joseph's board met on June 8, 1967. Based on the information in the SSS Form 150 and in the rest of Joseph's file, but without the benefit of a meeting with Joseph, the board voted unanimously to retain him in Class I-A, and sent him a notice of classification (SSS Form 110) to this effect. No reasons were given for the classification decision. 
 The Solicitor General argues from the premise that when the board acted, it effectively 're-opened' Joseph's classification. According to the Solicitor General, the applicable regulations then in force prohibited a board from reopening a classification without first determining that a prima facie case had been made out. See 32 CFR 1625.2, 1625.4. '[N]ot prepared to assume' that the board violated the reopening regulations, the Solicitor General reasons that the fact of reopening must therefore mean that the board had concluded (albeit erroneously) that Joseph had made out a prima facie case, and denied the claim because it questioned his sincerity. 
 The first difficulty with this argument is that a local board may well have the power to reopen a classification on a lesser showing than a prima facie case. See, e.g., United States v. Stephens, 445 F.2d 192, 196 ( CA3 1971). Second, the Solicitor General's argument rests on the intent of the board. If the board did not think that it was reopening, there would have been no reason for it to worry about the prima facie case requirements allegedly contained in the re-opening regulations. And the Solicitor General concedes that 'some confusion' as to whether the June 8 action was a 'reopening' developed at trial. Memorandum for the United States, pp. 18-19. [405 U.S. 1006 , 1008]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 27, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal of California, First Appellate District. 
 It appearing that the state court decision is not final, the petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 Petitioner operates a bookstore in Fremont, California. On two occasions, a police officer visited the store and purchased four magazines and one paperback novel. While in the store the second time, the officer also 'looked at parts' of 12 additional magazines and 14 other paperback books which were on petitioner's shelves. Based upon a reading of the four magazines, portions of the book, and the officer's conclusory affidavit, a magistrate issued an ex parte search warrant authorizing the seizure of the publications the officer had earlier purchased or perused. The warrant was executed and 7, copies of 35 different titles were seized. Among the items seized were 19 copies of nine magazines not specified in the warrant and apparently not previously evaluated by a magistrate. 
 Petitioner was charged with the sale or distribution of obscene matter in violation of Cal.Penal Code 311.2. Petitioner made a motion under 1538.5, 1539, 1540 of the Cal.Penal Code to suppress the evidence and to return the property seized. The municipal court ordered the return of the books which had not been specified in the warrant and of one book which it found not to be obscene. [Footnote 1] It denied petitioner's motion in all other res- 
Page 405 U.S. 1020 , 1021
 pects. On appeal, the Appellate Department of the Superior Court ordered the suppression of those items which had been seized without a prior adversary hearing on their obscenity vel non but affirmed the municipal court with regard to the materials which had been purchased. The State then appealed and the Court of Appeal reversed in part the judgment of the Appellate Department and vacated in part the judgment of the municipal court, thereby allowing the admission into evidence of all the items except the one which had been determined not to be obscene. 17 Cal.App.3d 865, 95 Cal.Rptr. 242. The Supreme Court of California denied a hearing and petitioner now seeks a writ of certiorari. 
 Our jurisdiction to review decisions of state courts is limited to '[ f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had . . ..' 28 U.S.C. 1257. The finality requirement, which has been with us since the Judiciary Act of 1789, 25, 1 Stat. 73, 85, is '[d]esigned to avoid the evils of piecemeal review,' Republic Natural Gas Co. v.

 Mr. Justice BRENNAN would grant the petition and set case for argument. 
 MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were suspected of maintaining an illicit whiskey still in violation of federal tax statutes. To secure evidence against them the Treasury Department 
Page 405 U.S. 1026 , 1027
 planted in their midst an undercover agent who posed as a truck driver of their vendee. After gaining their confidence, this agent on 17 occasions in 1968, after our decision in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, telephoned either petitioner James Williamson or a coconspirator, one Hutcheson, for the ostensible purpose of finalizing arrangements for the delivery of their product. During their conversations, the agent was in a position to shape and guide the content and direction of their discussions and to elicit damaging admissions. All of these communications were intercepted and recorded by another federal officer who acted without a warrant and without the petitioner's knowledge, but, of course, with the full cooperation of the Treasury plant. After the officers obtained satisfactory evidence against the pair, they were arrested, indicted, and convicted after a trial, at which all of the recordings were played, over objection, for the jury. 
 As I have discussed before, electronic eavesdropping early crept into our law as a means of combating ""fifth column"" activities during wartime. Later, it was said that this weapon was essential in the battle against organized crime. Now we learn that the omnipresent electronic ear is stalking the hill country in search of moonshiners. Apparently, no suspect is too unimportant to escape its reach.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
 MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring. 
 I concur in the denial of certiorari in this case, but solely out of considerations of timing. Questions of great importance to the Washington D.C., area are presented by the petition, not the least of which is whether the Court of appeals has, for a second time, unjustifiably

It seems preferable, therefore, that we stay our hand. In these circumstances Congress may, of course, take any further legislative action it deems necessary to make unmistakably clear its intentions with respect to the project, even to the point of limiting or prohibiting judicial review of its directives in this respect. 
 * Certain of the provisions of 23 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 were apparently enacted in response to the decision in D.C. Federation of Civic Assns., Inc. v. Airis, 129 U.S. App. D.C. 125, 391 F.2d 478, in which it was held that the planning and construction of this project had to be carried out in strict compliance with the procedural requirements of Title 7 of the D.C. Code. Section 23(a) of the Act provides that ""[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, or any court decisions ... to the contrary, the Secretary of Transportation and the government of the District of Columbia shall ... construct"" certain specified ""routes on the Interstate System within the District of Columbia ."" (Emphasis added.) In 23(b), Congress singled out four particular projects, including this one, for special treatment by providing that work on those projects was to commend ""[n]ot later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this section."" In an earlier phase of the litigation involved in the instant petition, the Court of Appeals rejected the petitioners' contention that 23 rendered inapplicable the pre- construction planning and public hearing requirements set out in various sections of Title 23 of the United States Code. D.C. Federation of Civic Assns., Inc. v. Volpe, 140 U.S. App. D.C. 162, 434 F.2d 436. On remand following that decision, the District Court found that the petitioners had complied with all applicable provisions of Title 23 except those of 128 relating to public hearings and those of 109 relating to safety standards and other requirements. The Court of Appeals, in the decision that we are now being asked to review, reversed in part, holding that the petitioners had failed to comply with a number of additional pre- construction provisions of Title 23.

405 U.S. 538

Syllabus 
Appellee Household Finance Corp. sued appellant Lynch in state court alleging nonpayment of a promissory note, and, prior to serving her with process, garnished her savings account under Connecticut law authorizing summary pre-judicial garnishment.  Appellant challenged the validity of the state statutes under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U.S.C.  1343(3).  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the grounds (1) that it lacked jurisdiction under  1343(3), as that section applies only if ""personal"" rights, as opposed to ""property"" rights, are impaired, and (2) that relief was barred by 28 U.S.C.  2283, proscribing injunctions against state court proceedings.
Held:
1. There is no distinction between personal liberties and proprietary rights with respect to jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1343(3).  Pp.  405 U. S. 542-552.
(a) Neither the language nor the legislative history of that section distinguishes between personal and property rights.  Pp.  405 U. S. 543-546.
(b) There is no conflict between that section and 28 U.S.C.  1331, and the legislative history of  1331 does not provide any basis for narrowing the scope of  1343(3) jurisdiction.  Pp.  405 U. S. 546-550.
(c) It would be virtually impossible to apply a ""personal liberties"" limitation on  1343(3), as there is no real dichotomy between personal liberties and property rights.  It has long been recognized that rights in property are basic civil rights.  Pp.  405 U. S. 550-552.
2. Prejudgment garnishment under the Connecticut statutes is levied and maintained without the participation of the state courts, and thus an injunction against such action is not barred by the provisions of 28 U.S.C.  2283.  Pp.  405 U. S. 552-556.

405 U.S. 438

Syllabus 
Appellee attacks his conviction of violating Massachusetts law for giving a woman a contraceptive foam at the close of his lecture to students on contraception.  That law makes it a felony for anyone to give away a drug, medicine, instrument, or article for the prevention of conception except in the case of (1) a registered physician administering or prescribing it for a married person or (2) an active registered pharmacist furnishing it to a married person presenting a registered physician's prescription.  The District Court dismissed appellee's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  The Court of Appeals vacated the dismissal, holding that the statute is a prohibition on contraception per se, and conflicts ""with fundamental human rights"" under Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479.  Appellant, inter alia, argues that appellee lacks standing to assert the rights of unmarried persons denied access to contraceptives because he was neither an authorized distributor under the statute nor a single person unable to obtain contraceptives.
Held:
1. If, as the Court of Appeals held, the statute under which appellee was convicted is not a health measure, appellee may not be prevented, because he was not an authorized distributor, from attacking the statute in its alleged discriminatory application to potential distributees.  Appellee, furthermore, has standing to assert the rights of unmarried persons denied access to contraceptives because their ability to obtain them will be materially impaired by enforcement of the statute.  Cf. Griswold, supra; Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U. S. 249.  Pp.  405 U. S. 443-446.
2. By providing dissimilar treatment for married and unmarried persons who are similarly situated, the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  405 U. S. 446-455.
(a) The deterrence of fornication, a 90-day misdemeanor under Massachusetts law, cannot reasonably be regarded as the purpose of the statute, since the statute is riddled with exceptions making contraceptives freely available for use in premarital sexual 
Page 405 U. S. 439
 relations and its scope and penalty structure are inconsistent with that purpose.  Pp.  405 U. S. 447-450.
(b) Similarly, the protection of public health through the regulation of the distribution of potentially harmful articles cannot reasonably be regarded as the purpose of the law, since, if health were the rationale, the statute would be both discriminatory and overbroad, and federal and state laws already regulate the distribution of drugs unsafe for use except under the supervision of a licensed physician.  Pp.  405 U. S. 450-452.
(c) Nor can the statute be sustained simply as a prohibition on contraception per se, for, whatever the rights of the individual to access to contraceptives may be, the rights must be the same for the unmarried and the married alike.  If, under Griswold, supra, the distribution of contraceptives to married persons cannot be prohibited, a ban on distribution to unmarried persons would be equally impermissible, since the constitutionally protected right of privacy inheres in the individual, not the marital couple.  If, on the other hand, Griswold is no bar to a prohibition on the distribution of contraceptives, a prohibition limited to unmarried persons would be underinclusive, and invidiously discriminator.  Pp.  405 U. S. 452-455.

Syllabus 
For the purpose of impeaching petitioner's credibility, the prosecutor in petitioner's 1947 rape trial was permitted to interrogate him about his previous criminal record.  Petitioner admitted four felony convictions during the period 1931-1940.  He was found guilty by the jury and was sentenced to a term of 50 years.  He filed a petition for habeas corpus in Federal District Court alleging that the previous convictions were constitutionally invalid under Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, because he had been denied the assistance of counsel.  The District Court denied relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, stating that the
""fact that there are possible infirmities in the evidence does not necessarily raise an issue of constitutional proportions which would require reversal.""
Held:  The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings.  Pp.  405 U. S. 480-485.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE concluded that, although the Court of Appeals erred, on remand, that court does not necessarily have to set petitioner's conviction aside.  There remain unresolved issues:  whether petitioner was represented by counsel at his earlier trials, and, if not, whether he waived counsel; and the possibility of a finding of harmless error, all of which should be considered in the first instance by the lower court.

Decided March 22, 1972
405 U.S. 504

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum sentence of one year.  In lieu of sentence, he was committed to the ""sex deviate facility"" in the state prison, for a potentially indefinite period, pursuant to the Wisconsin Sex Crimes Act.  That Act provides that, when a court finds that a convicted person was ""probably directly motivated by a desire for sexual excitement,"" it may commit the defendant to the Department of Health and Social Services for a social, physical, and mental examination, and, if the Department recommends specialized treatment, the court must hold a hearing on the need therefor.  If the State establishes the need for treatment, the court must commit the defendant for treatment in lieu of sentence for a period equal to the maximum sentence authorized for the crime.  At the end of that period, the Department may petition for a renewal of the commitment for five years.  After notice and hearing, the court may renew the commitment if it finds that discharge would be ""dangerous to the public.""  Further five-year renewals may be similarly obtained. Petitioner is subject to a five-year renewal order, obtained at the expiration of his one-year sentence.  He challenges the original and renewal commitment procedures.  He argues that commitment for compulsory treatment under the Sex Crimes Act, at least after the original commitment, is essentially equivalent to commitment under Wisconsin's Mental Health Act, which provides for jury determinations, and that his commitment without jury action deprives him of equal protection of the laws.  He also claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at both hearings and the opportunity to be present and to confront the State's witnesses at the renewal hearing. He charges equal protection and due process violations as a result of his commitment to state prison, rather than to a mental hospital, as provided by the Mental Health Act.  At the renewal hearing, his counsel argued that a new commitment would constitute double jeopardy, and indicated a broad constitutional challenge to the Sex Crimes Act.  However, no further action on petitioner's behalf was taken.  The District Court dismissed 
Page 405 U. S. 505
 his habeas corpus petition on the grounds that his claims were lacking in merit, and that they had been waived by failure to present them adequately to the state courts.  The Court of Appeals refused to certify probable cause for an appeal, on the ground that the claims were frivolous.
Held:
1. Petitioner's claims are substantial enough to warrant an evidentiary hearing.  Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U. S. 107; Specht v. Patterson, 386 U. S. 605.  Pp.  405 U. S. 508-514.
(a) The renewal proceedings bear substantial resemblance to the post-sentencing proceedings in Baxstrom, supra, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court has held that even the initial commitment is not just a sentencing alternative, but an independent commitment for treatment, comparable to commitment under the Mental Health Act.  Pp.  405 U. S. 508-511.
(b) The Mental Health Act and the Sex Crimes Act are apparently not mutually exclusive, and an equal protection claim would be persuasive if it develops on remand that petitioner was deprived of a jury determination or other procedural protections merely by the arbitrary decision to seek commitment under one Act, rather than the other.  P.  405 U. S. 512.
(c) Remand will provide ample opportunity to develop facts relevant to respondent's claim of mootness, as well as to petitioner's other constitutional claims.  Pp.  405 U. S. 512-514.
2. Federal habeas corpus is not barred by every state procedural default, and an evidentiary hearing is required to determine whether petitioner knowingly and intelligently made a deliberate strategic waiver of his claims in state court.  Pp.  405 U. S. 514-517.
Reversed and remanded to District Court.

No. 70-5004
Argued December 7, 1971
Decided March 22, 1972
405 U.S. 504

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum sentence of one year.  In lieu of sentence, he was committed to the ""sex deviate facility"" in the state prison, for a potentially indefinite period, pursuant to the Wisconsin Sex Crimes Act.  That Act provides that, when a court finds that a convicted person was ""probably directly motivated by a desire for sexual excitement,"" it may commit the defendant to the Department of Health and Social Services for a social, physical, and mental examination, and, if the Department recommends specialized treatment, the court must hold a hearing on the need therefor.  If the State establishes the need for treatment, the court must commit the defendant for treatment in lieu of sentence for a period equal to the maximum sentence authorized for the crime.  At the end of that period, the Department may petition for a renewal of the commitment for five years.  After notice and hearing, the court may renew the commitment if it finds that discharge would be ""dangerous to the public.""  Further five-year renewals may be similarly obtained. Petitioner is subject to a five-year renewal order, obtained at the expiration of his one-year sentence.  He challenges the original and renewal commitment procedures.  He argues that commitment for compulsory treatment under the Sex Crimes Act, at least after the original commitment, is essentially equivalent to commitment under Wisconsin's Mental Health Act, which provides for jury determinations, and that his commitment without jury action deprives him of equal protection of the laws.  He also claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at both hearings and the opportunity to be present and to confront the State's witnesses at the renewal hearing. He charges equal protection and due process violations as a result of his commitment to state prison, rather than to a mental hospital, as provided by the Mental Health Act.

405 U.S. 330

Syllabus 
Tennessee closes its registration books 30 days before an election, but requires residence in the State for one year and in the county for three months as prerequisites for registration to vote.  Appellee challenged the constitutionality of the durational residence requirements, and a three-judge District Court held them unconstitutional on the grounds that they impermissibly interfered with the right to vote and created a ""suspect"" classification penalizing some Tennessee residents because of recent interstate movement.  Tennessee asserts that the requirements are needed to insure the purity of the ballot box and to have knowledgeable voters.
Held:  The durational residence requirements are violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as they are not necessary to further a compelling state interest.  Pp.  405 U. S. 335-360.
(a) Since the requirements deny some citizens the right to vote, ""the Court must determine whether the exclusions are necessary to promote a compelling state interest.""  Kramer v. Union Free School District, 395 U. S. 621,  395 U. S. 627 (emphasis added).  Pp.  405 U. S. 336-337.
(b) Absent a compelling state interest, Tennessee may not burden the right to travel by penalizing those bona fide residents who have recently traveled from one jurisdiction to another.  Pp.  405 U. S. 338-342.
(c) A period of 30 days appears to be ample to complete whatever administrative tasks are needed to prevent fraud and insure the purity of the ballot box.  Pp.  405 U. S. 345-349.
(d) Since there are adequate means of ascertaining bona fide residence on an individualized basis, the State may not conclusively presume nonresidence from failure to satisfy the waiting period requirements of durational residence laws.  Pp.  405 U. S. 349-354.
(e) Tennessee has not established a sufficient relationship between its interest in an informed electorate and the fixed durational residence requirements.  Pp.  405 U. S. 354-360.

Argued October 12, 1971
Decided March 21, 1972
405 U.S. 365

Syllabus 
Following petitioner's classification as a conscientious objector by his local Selective Service Board, the State Director requested an appeal.  Petitioner was notified, but was not furnished with the basis for the appeal or given an opportunity to reply.  The appeal board unanimously classified petitioner I-A and rejected his conscientious objector claim without stating any reasons therefor.  Petitioner was not entitled under the regulations to appeal to the national board, but the National Director, on petitioner's request, did note an appeal.  The national board unanimously classified petitioner I-A, with no reasons given.  There is no outstanding induction order for petitioner, who brought this pre-induction suit challenging, on due process grounds, the constitutionality of his Selective Service appeal procedures.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, finding the suit barred by  10(b)(3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  That section provides that a classification decision of the local board ""shall be final, except where an appeal is authorized,"" and that the classification decision on appeal also ""shall be final.""  It further provides that
""[n]o judicial review shall be made of the classification or processing of any registrant . . . except as a defense to a criminal prosecution . . . after the registrant has responded either affirmatively or negatively to an order to report for induction,""
and then the review ""shall go to the question of the jurisdiction . . . only when there is no basis in fact, for the classification.""  By statute enacted in September, 1971, after petitioner's trial, a registrant is entitled to a personal appearance before a local or appeal board, and, on request, to a statement of reasons for any adverse decision.  Ensuing changes in regulation, effective December, 1971, and March, 1972, provide the procedural features that petitioner complained were lacking.
Held:
1. Section 10(b)(3) forecloses pre-induction judicial review where the board has used its discretion and judgment in determining facts and arriving at a classification for the registrant.  Clark

Decided March 21, 1972
405 U.S. 394

Syllabus 
Respondent banks were subsidiaries of a holding company that also controlled a management company, an insurance agency, and, from 1954, an insurance company (Security Life).  In 1948, the banks began to offer to arrange credit life insurance for their borrowers, placing the insurance with an independent insurance carrier.  National banking laws were deemed to prohibit the banks from receiving sales commissions, which were paid by the carrier to the insurance agency subsidiary.  The commissions were reported as taxable income for the 1948-1954 period by the management company.  After 1954, when Security Life was organized, the credit life insurance on the banks' customers was placed with an independent carrier, which reinsured the risks with Security Life, the latter retaining 85% of the premiums.  No sales commissions were paid.  Security Life reported all the reinsurance premiums on its income tax returns for the period 1955 to 1959, at the preferential tax rate for insurance companies.  Petitioner, pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  482, granting him power to allocate gross income among controlled corporations in order to reflect the actual incomes of the corporations, determined that 40% of Security Life's premium income was allocable to the banks as commission income earned for originating and processing the credit life insurance.  The Tax Court affirmed petitioner's action, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Since the banks did not receive and were prohibited by law from receiving sales commissions, no part of the reinsurance premium income could be attributed to them, and petitioner's exercise of the  482 authority was not warranted.  Pp.  405 U. S. 403-407.

Petitioner was found guilty of murder following a jury trial in which police officers testified as to the detailed confession that he had given to them and in which one officer related a statement made to him by petitioner's codefendant, who did not testify, which tended to undermine petitioner's initial (but later abandoned) version and to corroborate certain details of petitioner's confession.

No. 70-52
Argued January 10, 1972
Decided March 6, 1972
405 U.S. 298

Syllabus 
Respondent taxpayers are cooperative associations within the meaning of the Agricultural Marketing Act, and thus qualify for membership in one of the Banks for Cooperatives established by the Farm Credit Act of 1933, which provides that members may borrow money from their Banks.  Respondents secured membership in the New Orleans Bank and elected to borrow.  They were required by the Farm Credit Act of 1955 to make quarterly purchases of $100 par value Class C stock of the Bank equal to not less than 10% nor more than 25% of the amount of the quarterly interest paid to the Bank on their loans.  During the relevant period, the rate set by the Bank was 15%.  Respondents claimed a $99 interest expense deduction on their tax returns for each $100 stock purchase required by the statute.  The deductions were disallowed, and respondents filed this suit for refunds.  The Government contended that the stock is a capital asset as defined by 26 U.S.C.  1221, and is nondeductible, while respondents asserted that the purchase price is part of ""the amount [they] contracted to pay for the use of the borrowed money,"" and is deductible as interest.  The District Court found for the respondents, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  It is clear from the legislative scheme that the Class C stock is a capital asset having a long-term value.  Its cost is, therefore, not deductible as an interest expense.  Pp. 302-312.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 6, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Once again, this Court is confronted with a challenge to the constitutionality of the presidential war which has raged in Southeast Asia for nearly a decade. [Footnote 1] Once again, it denies certiorari. Once again, I dissent. 
 I have expressed at length my view that the constitutional questions raised by conscription for a presidential war are both substantial and justiciable. See, e. g., Massachusetts v. Laird, 400 U.S. 886 (Douglas, J., dis- 
Page 405 U.S. 979 , 980

McNamara, 389 U.S. 934, 935, 283 (Douglas J., dissenting); Mitchell v. United States, 386 U.S. 972, 18 L. Ed.2d 132 (Douglas, J., dissenting). 
 The circuits are in conflict as to the justiciability of these questions. Compare Massachusetts v. Laird, 451 F.2d 26 (CA1 1971) (Mass. II) and Orlando v. Laird, 443 F.2d 1039 (CA2 1971), with Velvel v. Nixon, 415 F.2d 236 (CA10 1970) and Luftig v. McNamara, 126 U.S. App.D.C. 4, 373 F.2d 664 (1967). 
 This Court, of course, should give defense to the coordinate branches of the Government. But we did not defer in the Prize Cases, 2 Black 635 when the issue was presidential power as Commander in Chief to order a blockade. We did not defer in the Steel Seizure Case,2 when the issue was presidential power, in time of armed international conflict, to order the seizure of domestic steel mills. Nor should we defer here, when the issue is presidential power to seize, not steel, but people. See Mass. I, supra, 400 U.S., at 891-900-132. 
 The Constitution gives Congress the power 'To declare war,' Art. I, 8; and it is argued that the Constitution gives to Congress the exclusive power to determine when it has declared war. But if there is such a 'textually demonstrable constitutional commitment,' Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 , 710, it is for this Court to determine its scope. Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 521, 1964. See Mass. I, supra, 400 U.S., at 892. 
 While we debate whether to decide the constitutionality of this war, our countrymen are daily compelled to undergo the physical and psychological tortures of armed [405 U.S. 979 , 981]

No. 70-70
Argued November 15, 1971
Decided March 1, 1972
405 U.S. 233

Syllabus 
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) entered a cease and desist order against Sperry & Hutchinson Co. (S&H), the largest and oldest trading stamp company, on the ground that it unfairly attempted to suppress the operation of trading stamp exchanges and other ""free and open"" redemption of stamps.  S&H argued in the Court of Appeals that its conduct was beyond the reach of  5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which it claimed permitted the FTC to restrain only such practices as are either in violation of the antitrust laws, deceptive, or repugnant to public morals.  The Court of Appeals reversed the FTC, holding that the FTC had not demonstrated that S&H's conduct violated  5 because it had not shown that the conduct contravened either the letter or the spirit of the antitrust laws.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in its construction of  5.  Congress, as previously recognized by this Court, see FTC v. R. F. Keppel & Bro., 291 U. S. 304, defines the powers of the FTC to protect consumers as well as competitors, and authorizes it to determine whether challenged practices, though posing no threat to competition within the letter or spirit of the antitrust laws, are nevertheless either unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices.  The Wheeler-Lea Act of 1938 reaffirms this broad congressional mandate.  Pp.  405 U. S. 239-244.
2. Nonetheless, the FTC's order cannot be sustained.  The FTC does not challenge the Court of Appeals' holding that S&H's conduct violates neither the letter nor the spirit of the antitrust laws, and its opinion is barren of any attempt to rest its order on the unfairness of particular competitive practices or on considerations of consumer interests.  Nor did the FTC articulate any standards by which such alternative assessments might be made.  Pp.  405 U. S. 245-249.
3. The judgment of the Court of Appeals setting aside the FTC's order is affirmed, but, because that court erred in its construction of  5, its judgment is modified to the extent that the case is remanded with instructions to return it to the FTC for

Petitioner was employed in a newsstand which sold ""girlie"" magazines.  He was charged with the sale of two allegedly obscene magazines -- ""Body Shop"" and ""The Erotic Cinema"" -- in violation of Florida's obscenity statute [Footnote 1] and, on November 3, 1970, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts.  On January 12, 1971, the trial court orally pronounced its judgment of guilty and imposed a sentence of either a $1,000 fine or six months' imprisonment on each count plus costs.  That same day, petitioner filed his notice of appeal and a motion for supersedeas.  On January 18, the trial court entered its written order nunc pro tunc January 12.  This order recited that petitioner's notice of appeal was filed after the entry of judgment.  Because he was challenging the constitutionality of a state statute, petitioner's appeal was transferred by the First District Court of Appeal of Florida to the Florida Supreme Court.

 On petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioner brought this civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1985 to recover damages from agents of the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division of the Treasury Department. He alleged that they had conducted un- 
Page 405 U.S. 965 , 966
 lawful searches of his property beyond the scope of their warrants. Both lower courts denied the petitioner, a pauper, permission to proceed n forma pauperis. The terse orders simply stated that the unlawful search issue was frivolous. [Footnote 1] Yet there is no doubt that a civil rights damage action is apprpriate where federal agents ransack one's premises without authority. Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). The Solicitor General, however, contends that the order of the Court of Appeals was nonetheless correct because the agents' searches had already been validated in the previous and finalized criminal proceeding. [Footnote 2] 

 This action, brought to vindicate deprivations of Fourth Amendment privileges, is akin to that of the remedy of federal habeas corpus. The latter relief is not barred merely because the grounds relied on have been rejected on direct review of the conviction. [Footnote 3] Inasmuch as both 42 [405 U.S. 965 , 967]

No. 70-128
Argued November 17, 1971
Decided February 24, 1972
405 U.S. 134

Syllabus 
Appellees who sought to become candidates for local office in the Texas Democratic primary election challenged in the District Court the validity of the Texas statutory scheme which, without write-in or other alternative provisions, requires payment of fees ranging as high as $8,900.  Appellees claimed that they were unable to pay the required fees, and were therefore barred from running. Under the Texas statute, the party committee estimates the total cost of the primary and apportions it among candidates according to its judgment of what is ""just and equitable,"" in light of ""the importance, emolument, and term of office.""  The fees for local candidates tend appreciably to exceed those for state-wide candidates.  Following a hearing, the District Court declared the fee system invalid and enjoined its enforcement.  Appellants contend that the filing fees are necessary both to regulate the primary ballot and to finance elections.
Held:  The Texas primary election filing fee system contravenes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  405 U. S. 140-149.
(a) Since the Texas statute imposes filing fees of such magnitude that numerous qualified candidates are precluded from filing, it falls with unequal weight on candidates and voters according to their ability to pay the fees, and therefore it must be ""closely scrutinized"" and can be sustained only if it is reasonably necessary to accomplish a legitimate state objective, and not merely because it has some rational basis.  Pp.  405 U. S. 140-144.
(b) Although a State has an interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot and eliminating those who are spurious, it cannot attain these objectives by arbitrary means such as those called for by the Texas statute, which eliminates legitimate potential candidates, like those involved here, who cannot afford the filing fees.  Pp.  405 U. S. 144-147.
(c) The apportionment of costs among candidates is not the only means available to finance primary elections, and the State can identify certain bodies as political parties entitled to sponsorship if the State itself finances the primaries, as it does general

No. 69-5
Argued November 9, 1971

405 U.S. 174

Syllabus 
After a corporation (Overmyer) had defaulted in its payments for equipment manufactured and being installed by respondent company (Frick), and Overmyer, under a post-contract arrangement, had made a partial cash payment and issued an installment note for the balance, Frick completed the work, which Overmyer accepted as satisfactory.  Thereafter Overmyer again asked for relief and, with counsel for both corporations participating in the negotiations, the first note was replaced with a second, which contained a ""cognovit"" provision in conformity with Ohio law at that time whereby Overmyer consented in advance, should it default in interest or principal payments, to Frick's obtaining a judgment without notice or hearing, and issued certain second mortgages in Frick's favor, Frick agreeing to release three mechanic's liens, to reduce the monthly payment amounts and interest rate, and to extend the time for final payment.  When Overmyer, claiming a contract breach, stopped making payments on the new note, Frick, under the cognovit provision, through an attorney unknown to, but on behalf of, Overmyer, and without personal service on or prior notice to Overmyer, caused judgment to be entered on the note.  Overmyer's motion to vacate the judgment was overruled after a post-judgment hearing, and the judgment court's decision was affirmed on appeal against Overmyer's contention that the cognovit procedure violated due process requirements.
Held:  Overmyer, for consideration and with full awareness of the legal consequences, waived its rights to prejudgment notice and hearing, and, on the facts of this case, which involved contractual arrangements between two corporations acting with advice of counsel, the procedure under the cognovit clause (which is not unconstitutional per se) did not violate Overmyer's Fourteenth Amendment rights.

Appellants (hereafter plaintiffs), purporting to act on behalf of a class consisting of all Pennsylvania residents who signed documents containing cognovit provisions leading, or that could lead, to confessed judgments in Philadelphia, brought this action challenging the Pennsylvania system as unconstitutional on its face as violative of due process.  The three-judge District Court held that:  the Pennsylvania system leading to confessed judgments and execution complies with due process only if ""there has been an understanding and voluntary consent of the debtor in signing the document""; plaintiffs did not sustain their burden of proof with respect to lack of valid consent in the execution of bonds and warrants of attorney accompanying mortgages; the record did not establish that the action could be maintained on behalf of natural persons with incomes over $10,000, but an action could be maintained for those who earn less than $10,000 and who signed consumer financing or lease contracts containing cognovit provisions; there was no intentional waiver of known rights by members of that class in executing confession of judgment clauses; and no judgment by confession might be entered after November 1, 1970, as to a member of the recognized class unless it is shown that the debtor ""intentionally, understandingly, and voluntarily waived"" his rights; and the court declared the Pennsylvania practice of confessing judgments to be unconstitutional, prospectively effective as noted, as applied to the designated class, and enjoined entry of any confessed judgment against a member of the class absent a showing of the required waiver.  The plaintiffs appealed, claiming that the entire Pennsylvania scheme is unconstitutional on its face.
Held:
1. The Pennsylvania rules and statutes relating to cognovit provisions are not unconstitutional on their face, as, under appropriate circumstances, a cognovit debtor may be held effectively and legally to have waived the rights he would possess if the document he signed had contained no cognovit provision.

No. 70-66
Argued December 13, 1971
Decided February 23, 1972*
405 U.S. 15

Syllabus 
Incumbent Senator Hartke was certified by the Indiana Secretary of State to the Governor as the winner of the close 1970 Indiana senatorial election.  Candidate Roudebush filed a timely recount petition in state court.  The state court denied Hartke's motion to dismiss on the grounds of conflict with the Indiana and Federal Constitutions, and granted the petition for a recount.  Hartke sought an injunction against the recount in United States District Court, invoking jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1343(3) and claiming that the recount was barred by Art. I,  5, of the Federal Constitution, delegating to the Senate the power to judge the elections, returns, and qualifications of its members.  The three-judge District Court issued the requested injunction.  After appeals were filed here, the Senate seated Hartke
""without prejudice to the outcome of an appeal pending in the Supreme Court . . . and without prejudice to the outcome of any recount that the Supreme Court might order.""
Hartke then moved to dismiss the appeals as moot.
Held:
1. The issue here, whether a recount is a valid exercise of the State's power to prescribe the times, places, and manner of holding elections, pursuant to Art. I,  4, of the Constitution, or is a forbidden infringement on the Senate's power under Art. I,  5, is not moot, as the Senate has postponed making a final determination of who is entitled to the office of Senator pending the outcome of this action.  Pp.  405 U. S. 18-19.
2. The District Court was not barred from issuing an injunction by 28 U.S.C.  2283, which generally prohibits a federal court from enjoining state court proceedings.  Pp.  405 U. S. 20-23.
(a) That section does not restrict a federal court from enjoining a state court acting in a nonjudicial capacity.  P.  405 U. S. 21.
(b) The state court's recount functions are nonjudicial, as they consist merely of determining that the recount petition is correct as to form and appointing recount commissioners.  Pp.  405 U. S. 21-22. 
Page 405 U. S. 16

(c) The complaint did not seek to enjoin the action of the state court, but rather to enjoin the recount commission from proceeding after the court had appointed member of the commission.  P.  405 U. S. 22.
3. Article I,  5, does not prohibit a recount of the ballots by Indiana, as the recount will not prevent an independent Senate evaluation of the election any more than the original count did, and it would be mere speculation to assume that Indiana's procedure would impair the Senate's ability to make an independent final judgment.  Pp.  405 U. S. 23-26.

Decided February 23, 1972
405 U.S. 56

Syllabus 
Appellants, month-to-month tenants of appellee Normet. refused to pay their monthly rent unless certain substandard conditions were remedied, and appellee threatened eviction.  Appellants filed a class action seeking a declaratory judgment that the Oregon Forcible Entry and Wrongful Detainer (FED) Statute was unconstitutional on its face, and an injunction against its continued enforcement.  Appellants attacked principally (1) the requirement of trial no later than six days after service of the complaint unless security for accruing rent is provided, (2) the limitation of triable issues to the tenant's default, defenses based on the landlord's breach of duty to maintain the premises being precluded, and (3) the requirement of posting bond on appeal, with two sureties, in twice the amount of rent expected to accrue pending appellate decision, this bond to be forfeited if the lower court decision is affirmed.  The District Court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint, concluding that the statute did not violate the Due Process or the Equal Protection Clause.
Held:
1. Neither the early trial provision nor the limitation on litigable issues is invalid on its face under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  405 U. S. 64-69.
(a) The time for trial preparation is not unduly short where the issue is simply whether the tenant has paid or has held over, and the requirement for rent security for a continuance of the action is not irrational or oppressive.  Pp.  405 U. S. 64-65.
(b) Appellants are not denied due process because rental payments are not suspended while the alleged wrongdoings of the landlord are litigated, as Oregon may treat the tenant's undertakings and those of the landlord as independent covenants.  P.  405 U. S. 68.
(c) Appellants are not foreclosed from instituting suit against the landlord and litigating their right to damages and other relief in that action, nor have they shown that Oregon excludes any ""available"" defenses on the limited questions at issue in an FED suit.  Pp.  405 U. S. 65-66,  405 U. S. 69.

2. Neither the early trial provision nor the limitation on litigable issues is invalid on it face under the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  405 U. S. 69-74.

(b) Absent constitutional mandate, the assurance of adequate housing and the definition of landlord-tenant relationships is a legislative function.  P.  405 U. S. 74.

Syllabus 
Respondent taxpayer owned 44% of the stock of a closely held construction corporation, with an original investment of 38,900, and received an annual salary of $12,000 for serving as president on a part-time basis.  His total income was about $40,000 a year.  He advanced money to the corporation and signed an indemnity agreement with a bonding company, which furnished bid and performance bonds for the construction contracts.  The corporation defaulted on contracts in 1962, and the taxpayer advanced over $158,000 to the corporation and indemnified the bonding company to the extent of more than $162,000.  The corporation went into receivership and he obtained no reimbursement for thee sums.  On his 1962 income tax return, the taxpayer took his loss on direct loans to the corporation as a nonbusiness bad debt, but he claimed the indemnification loss as a business debt and deducted it against ordinary income and asserted net loss carrybacks for the portion unused in 1962, pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  172.  Treasury Regulations provide that, if, at the time of worthlessness, the debt has a ""proximate"" relationship to the taxpayer' business, the debt qualifies as a business bad debt.  In his suit for a tax refund, the taxpayer testified that his sole motive for signing the indemnification agreement was to protect his $12,000-a-year employment with the corporation.  The jury was asked to determine whether signing the agreement ""was proximately related to his trade or business of being an employee"" of the corporation.  The court refused the Government's request for an instruction that the applicable standard was that of dominant motivation and charged the jury that significant motivation satisfies the Regulations' requirement of proximate relationship.  The jury's verdict was for the taxpayer

Held:
1. In determining whether a bad debt has a ""proximate"" relation to the taxpayer's trade or business, and thus qualifies as a business bad debt, the proper standard is that of dominant motivation, rather than significant motivation.  Pp.  405 U. S. 103-105.

224 Tenn. 712, 462 S.W.2d 491, certiorari dismissed as improvidently granted.
PER CURIAM.
We granted certiorari in this case, 404 U.S. 821, to consider questions seemingly presented under the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy.  After briefing and oral argument, it now appears that those questions are so interrelated with rules of criminal pleading peculiar to the State of Tennessee, the constitutionality of which is not at issue, as not to warrant the exercise of the certiorari jurisdiction of this Court.  See, e.g., Wilson v. State, 200 Tenn. 309, 292 S.W.2d 188 (1956); Young v. State, 185 Tenn. 596, 206 S.W.2d 805 (1947).  See U.S.Sup.Ct.Rule 19(1)(a).  The writ is, therefore, dismissed as having been improvidently granted.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.
In dismissing the writ of certiorari in this case, the Court lets stand a conviction secured in violation of petitioner's right, under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, not to be placed in jeopardy twice for a single criminal offense.  The infringement of this 
Page 405 U. S. 128

			"|"Duncan v. Tennessee
No. 70-5122.
Argued January 13, 1972
Decided February 23, 1972
405 U.S. 127

224 Tenn. 712, 462 S.W.2d 491, certiorari dismissed as improvidently granted.
PER CURIAM.
We granted certiorari in this case, 404 U.S. 821, to consider questions seemingly presented under the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy.  After briefing and oral argument, it now appears that those questions are so interrelated with rules of criminal pleading peculiar to the State of Tennessee, the constitutionality of which is not at issue, as not to warrant the exercise of the certiorari jurisdiction of this Court.  See, e.g., Wilson v. State, 200 Tenn. 309, 292 S.W.2d 188 (1956); Young v. State, 185 Tenn. 596, 206 S.W.2d 805 (1947).  See U.S.Sup.Ct.Rule 19(1)(a).  The writ is, therefore, dismissed as having been improvidently granted.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.
In dismissing the writ of certiorari in this case, the Court lets stand a conviction secured in violation of petitioner's right, under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, not to be placed in jeopardy twice for a single criminal offense.  The infringement of this

405 U.S. 9

Syllabus 
Petitioner refused to answer a grand jury's questions despite a grant of immunity.  A trial judge found the questions to be proper and directed petitioner to answer.  Petitioner refused, and the judge found that, by
""his contumacious and unlawful refusal . . . to answer any legal and proper interrogatories and for his willful disobedience to the lawful mandate of this Court,""
petitioner had ""committed a criminal contempt of court"" in violation of N.Y.Judiciary Law  750.  He was sentenced to 30 days and fined $250.  His offer to testify thereafter was refused, and he paid his fine and served his sentence.  Petitioner was then indicted under N.Y.Penal Law  600 ""for his contumacious and unlawful refusal . . . to answer legal and proper interrogatories.""  The trial court dismissed the indictment on double jeopardy grounds, but the appellate court reversed . The New York Court of Appeals, sustaining the reversal, held that there were two acts of contempt, one before the grand jury and the other the refusal to obey the court order, and that the trial judge had committed petitioner for civil, not criminal, contempt.
Held:  Petitioner was penalized for criminal contempt for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, and, in view of the state court's misconception of the nature of the contempt judgment, and the substantial question of state law arising from the State's response that it considers the two acts of contempt as being partially intertwined, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the state court.

 This is a direct appeal from the order of a three-judge District Court, convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281,1, denying appellants' prayer for injunctive relief.

 ysis leads me to conclude that a three-judge court was not required, so I would dismiss this appeal. 
 The controversy involves the efforts of appellant Native American Church of Navajoland, Inc., to obtain a certificate of incorporation from the Arizona Corporation Commission. According to Arizona law, 'Any number of persons may associate themselves together and become incorporated for the transaction of any lawful business.' Ariz.Rev.Stat. 10-121 (emphasis supplied). The Commission refused to issue the certificate for the reason that it believed appellant's proposed Articles of Incorporation revealed that the organization had an unlawful purpose for incorporating, that being 'to work for unity in the use of Peyote as a Sacrament and as a means of Divine healing through its Divine power.' It appears to be conceded that the Commission's decision was prompted by the fact that the use, possession, and sale of Peyote is made a misdemeanor by Ariz.Rev.Stat . 36-1061, and because Peyote is subject to regulation as a 'dangerous drug' under Ariz.Rev.Stat. 32-1964, subsec. A par. 7, 32-1965, and 32- 1975. Appellants then sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the District Court. 
 Two injunctions were sought. The first asked that the Corporation Commission be enjoined from refusing to grant appellants a certificate of incorporation 'for failure to comply with Ariz.Rev.Stat. 10-121 and 36- 1061.' Insofar as this prayer asked to enjoin Commission action taken under color of Ariz.Rev.Stat. 10-121, however, it was insufficient to require a three-judge court. Nowhere in their complaint did appellants attack the constitutionality of 10-121, either on its face or as applied.

 Oliver A. ROSENGARTv. Melvin R. LAIRD, Secretary of Defense, et al.No. 71-298. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 22, 1972
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for reconsideration in light of the suggestions of the Solicitor General and upon an independent examination of the entire record.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST concur, dissenting. 
 The Court vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals and directs that the Court of Appeals consider the views of the United States presented in this case. Finding the suggestions of the United States unacceptable, I dissent from today's judgment. 
 In its memorandum filed October 13, 1971, in response to the petition for certiorari, the United States, asserted that in passing on petitioner's conscientious objector's claim the Army considered petitioner's opposition to war to be sincere and rejected the claim solely because peti- 
Page 405 U.S. 908 , 909
 tioner's views did not qualify as religious under the standards of Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333 (1970). It was therefore error, the United States urged, for the Court of Appeals to have put aside the Welsh issue and to have affirmed the denial of habeas corpus on insincerity grounds after making an 'independent search of the administrative record' to discover a basis in fact for such a judgment. 
 These assertions were incredible. The Army Review Board, in its final order entered on September 10, 1970, denying the conscientious objector claim, unanimously found that '1LT Rosengart's purported conscientious objector beliefs are not truly held; and that any objection to war in any form he might sincerely hold is based soley on philosophical and sociological experiences.' The plain meaning of this order is that the Board both found that petitioner was not sincere and determined that his views were solely philosophical and sociological. 
 The Court of Appeals so read the Board's order, saying '[t]he Board found that any conscientious objection held by Rosengart was based solely on philosophical views and sociological experiences (a curious finding in light of Welsh) and that Rosengart's 'purported conscientious objector beliefs are not truly held."" The Court of Appeals then put aside the issue of whether defendant's beliefs were religious within the meaning of the Act and affirmed the denial of habeas corpus after agreeing with the District Court that there was a basis in fact for a conclusion of insincerity because the record 'cast a cloud upon the sincerity of his professed deeply-held beliefs of conscientious objection.' 
 There was nothing untoward in the way the Court of Appeals approached the case, particularly since the United States in its October 13 memorandum flatly asserted that there was indeed sufficient evidence in the record to support the judgment of insincerity and that 'under normal circumstances, such evidence would, in our view, provide ample factual basis for a denial of petitioner's application for discharge.' 
 When asked for further response, the United States filed a supplemental memorandum on December 10, 1971, modifying its position. It now concedes the dual basis of the Board's order and that '[v]iewed solely in light of the September 10 Board decision, the majority's conclusion in this regard is not unwarranted.' It also reveals that '[i]ndeed, such a result was suggested by the government's argument below . . ..' Nevertheless, although again not disagreeing 'with the conclusion reached by the majority below that there was basis in fact on this record to sustain a finding of 'insincerity' with respect to petitioner's claimed opposition to war,' the Government's position in the Court of Appeals is characterized as placing 'undue emphasis on the final recommendation of the Army Review [909-Continued.] 
Board.' It is now urged that the Board's September 10 decision be read in conjunction with earlier decisions and that in context the Board be deemed to have found petitioner to be sincere. 
 I find nothing to commend the Government's position in this case. It would be one thing if it forthrightly supported petitioner's sincerity. It is quite another thing to assert that the record supports a judgment of insincerity, and then, notwithstanding this concession, to urge setting aside the final order of the Army Review Board which plainly found petitioner insincere and which the United States does not straightforwardly argue was beyond the power of the Board.

No. 71-221
Decided January 24, 1972
404 U.S. 549

Syllabus 
Appellants challenge a federal court-ordered reapportionment plan for the 1971 elections of Mississippi state legislators, which permitted a total variance of approximately 19% between the largest and smallest House and Senate districts.  The court plan also provided for temporary multi-member districts to fill about one-fifth of the seats in 1971, but ordered the appointment of a Special Master in January, 1972, to determine the feasibility of dividing these into equal-population districts for the 1975 and 1979 elections.
Held:
1. Even if it be assumed that congressional redistricting decisions of this Court, which appellants rely on, are controlling here, it does not follow that the 1971 elections should be invalidated, and, in the circumstances of this case, those elections will not be disturbed.
2. Further consideration is inappropriate until completion of the proceedings to consider creation of single-member districts.

Appellee, a nonprofit religious corporation, brought this refund suit, claiming that it was entitled to tax exempt status under  501(c)(3) of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code.  The District Court held that, under the facts adduced at trial, appellee qualified for exemption.  It went on, however, to conclude that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in revoking that exemption, violated (1) free exercise requirements by analyzing each activity of appellee and classifying it as ""religious"" or ""political,"" and (2) due process requirements by singling appellee out, among all other religious organizations, for investigation and exemption revocation without supporting evidence.
Held:  This Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the direct appeal that the Government seeks to take under 28 U.S.C.  1252 from the District Court's decision, which did not hold  501(c)(3) unconstitutional as a whole or as applied, but was merely directed at the method and means by which the IRS enforced  501(c)(3) in this case.

2. Intervention under Rule 24(a) is warranted for this petitioner, as he may have a valid complaint about the performance of the Secretary, who protects not only the rights of individual union members, but also the public interest in free and democratic union elections, two functions that may not always dictate the same approach to the conduct of the litigation.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 17, 1972
 The judgment is affirmed.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 The Black students in this case want nothing more than to receive the same quality of education from our public schools as is enjoyed by the Whites. To deny them that equality is to sanction the dispensation of public benefits according to the invidious classification of race. 
Page 404 U.S. 1027 , 1028
 Appellants sought to convene a three-judge District Court in order to challenge the constitutionality of New Jersey's statutory scheme establishing the boundaries of school districts. They argue that by establishing school district lines to coincide with the boundaries of the State's political subdivisions, cf. N.J.Stat. 18A:8-1, the State imposed upon the public schools patterns of racial imbalance in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. 1983. It is said in reply that New Jersey only prescribes school district boundaries in conformity with municipal boundaries. There is, however, a showing that at times a Black has to walk further to his school than the White school in his neighborhood. The remedy is redistricting. We have sponsored that process to protect the right to vote. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533. The right to education in the environment of a multi- racial community seems equally fundamental. 
 The result, according to appellants, is an inferior education for students of minority races-something this Court has long condemned. McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637; Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629; Sipuel v. Board of Regents of University of Oklahoma, 332 U.S. 631; Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U.S. 337. See also Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537; Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356. Appellants sought either a redistricting or an appropriate racial balance in the public schools so that educational opportunity would not be determined by race, cf. Gomperts v. Chase, 404 1237, 1240, 18 (1971), or compensatory educational programs to correct for the inferior schooling given minority students. The District Court rejected this approach, however, and dismissed the complaint, finding refuge in de facto segregation. 326 F.Supp. 1235.

Chase, 404 1237, 1240, 18 (1971), or compensatory educational programs to correct for the inferior schooling given minority students.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 17, 1972
 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 In the 1970 Ohio primary election, appellant voted as a Republican and was a candidate for the Republican nomination to the House of Representatives from the 22d Congressional District of Ohio. Political allegiances change and, in the upcoming election, appellant seeks the nomination to Congress of the American Independence Party. He is prevented from pursuing this nomination, however, by an intricate statutory scheme. Central to this scheme is a statute which provides, with various exceptions not relevant here, e. g., Ohio Rev.Code 3517.013 et seq. ( Page Supp.1970), that '[n]o person shall be a candidate for nomination or election at a party primary if he voted as a member of a different political party at any primary election within the next preceding four calendar years.' Ohio Rev.Code 3513.191 (Page 1960). Other provisions also being attacked require those working for primary candidates or signing their nominating petitions to be members of the party in which nomination is sought, id., 3513.05. 
Page 404 U.S. 1032 , 1033
 No one disputes that Ohio's statutory scheme prevents appellant from seeking the nomination of the party of his choice before 1974. Appellees, however, defend this limitation of freedom, saying that it is necessary to ensure 'the formation of recognizable, relatively stable political parties with their own leadership, goals and philosophies.' They conclude, 'The protection of these purposes is a legitimate State concern.' The District Court adopted this rationale, 
 Not only does the denial of appellant's right to seek the nomination of the American Independence Party in 1972 seriously impair his right of political expression, but the 'compelling state interest' advanced by the appellees and accepted by the court below seems alien to our political and constitutional heritage. The right to run for public office seems a fundamental one. 
 The Ohio laws deny appellant that liberty, insofar as the 1972 election is concerned. 
 While I doubt that any state interest can be so compelling as to justify an impairment of associational freedoms in the area of philosophy- political or other- [404 U.S. 1032 , 1034]

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 It seems incredible that under our federalism a State can deny a student education in its public school system unless his hair style comports with the standards of the school board. Some institutions in Asia require their enrollees to shave their heads. Would we sustain that regulation if imposed by a public school? Would we sustain a public school regulation requiring male students to have crew cuts? The present regulation-to some at least-seems as extreme as the examples given. It provides: 
 Robert Olff, a 15-year-old boy speaking through his mother, has a full panoply of constitutional rights, though he is a minor. We said in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503, 511, 739: 'Students in school as well as out of school are 'persons' under our Constitution. They are possessed of fundamental rights which the State must respect, just as they themselves must respect their obligations to the State.' Moreover, a parent's control over the child, though not absolute as witness our decisions placing sanctions against child labor, is pervasive. We said in Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166, 442: 'It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose

 primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder. . . . And it is in recognition of this that these decisions have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.' 
 Hair style is highly personal,1 an idiosyncracy which I had assumed was left to family or individual control and was of no legitimate concern to the State. It seems to me to be as much a purely private choice as was the family-student decision, sustained against a State's prohibition, to study the German language in a public school. Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390. That family-student right, the Court held, was included within 'liberty' as the word is used in the Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at 400.

Respondent highway carriers filed this civil action under  4 of the Clayton Act for injunctive relief and damages against petitioner highway carriers charging that petitioners conspired to monopolize the transportation of goods by instituting state and federal proceedings to resist and defeat applications by respondents to acquire, transfer, or register operating rights.  Respondents alleged that the purpose of the conspiracy was
""putting their competitors . . . out of business, of weakening such competitors, of destroying, eliminating and weakening existing and potential competition, and of monopolizing the highway common carrier business in California and elsewhere,""
and deterring respondents from having free and unlimited access to the agencies and the courts.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  While any carrier has the right of access to administrative agencies and courts to defeat applications of competitors for certificates as highway carriers, and its purpose to eliminate an applicant as a competitor may be implicit in such opposition, its First Amendment rights are not immunized from regulation when they are used as an integral part of conduct violative of the antitrust laws.  If the allegations that petitioners combined to harass and deter respondents from having ""free and unlimited access"" to agencies and courts, and to defeat that right by massive, concerted, and purposeful group activities are established as facts, a violation of the antitrust laws will have been demonstrated, and it is immaterial that the means used in violation may be lawful.

No. 70-5037
Argued November 11, 1971
Decided January 12, 1972
404 U.S. 477

Syllabus 
Following a pretrial suppression hearing at which conflicting evidence was presented as to the voluntariness of a confession that petitioner had given the police, the trial judge, presumably applying the Illinois preponderance of the evidence standard, held the confession admissible, and it was introduced into evidence at the trial, which resulted in petitioner's conviction.  The judge had instructed the jury as to the prosecution's burden of proving guilt, but did not instruct that the jury had to find the confession voluntary before it could be used in reaching its verdict.  In a habeas corpus proceeding petitioner challenged his conviction.  The District Court denied relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Petitioner contends, relying upon In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, that the trial judge should have found the confession voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt before admitting it into evidence, or, alternatively, that the admissibility of the confession as evidence in a criminal trial (quite apart from its probative value) had to be determined by a reasonable doubt standard to protect the values that exclusionary rules are designed to serve.  Petitioner also urges that, even though the trial judge ruled on his coercion claim, he was entitled, under Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, to have the jury decide that issue anew.
Held:
1. The hearing on the voluntariness of a confession required by this Court's decision in Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368, is not designed to implement the presumption of innocence and enhance the reliability of jury verdicts, but to prevent the use of a coerced confession as violative of due process quite apart from its truth or falsity.  Consequently, determining the admissibility of a confession by a preponderance of the evidence is not inconsistent with the mandate of In re Winship, supra.  Pp.  404 U. S. 482-487.
2. Petitioner has not demonstrated that admissibility rulings based on the preponderance of evidence standard are unreliable or that imposition of any higher standard under expanded exclusionary rules would be sufficiently productive to outweigh the 
Page 404 U. S. 478
 public interest in having probative evidence available to juries.  pp.  404 U. S. 487-489.
3. The procedure followed here comported with the requirements of Jackson, supra, and petitioner was not entitled to have the voluntariness issue which had been resolved by the trial judge also submitted to a jury for its separate consideration.  Nor did Duncan, supra, change the rule that determining the admissibility of evidence is a function of the court, rather than of the jury.  Pp.  404 U. S. 489-490.
Affirmed.

			"|"Lego v. Twomey
No. 70-5037
Argued November 11, 1971
Decided January 12, 1972
404 U.S. 477

Syllabus 
Following a pretrial suppression hearing at which conflicting evidence was presented as to the voluntariness of a confession that petitioner had given the police, the trial judge, presumably applying the Illinois preponderance of the evidence standard, held the confession admissible, and it was introduced into evidence at the trial, which resulted in petitioner's conviction.  The judge had instructed the jury as to the prosecution's burden of proving guilt, but did not instruct that the jury had to find the confession voluntary before it could be used in reaching its verdict.  In a habeas corpus proceeding petitioner challenged his conviction.  The District Court denied relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Petitioner contends, relying upon In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, that the trial judge should have found the confession voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt before admitting it into evidence, or, alternatively, that the admissibility of the confession as evidence in a criminal trial (quite apart from its probative value) had to be determined by a reasonable doubt standard to protect the values that exclusionary rules are designed to serve.  Petitioner also urges that, even though the trial judge ruled on his coercion claim, he was entitled, under Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, to have the jury decide that issue anew.
Held:
1. The hearing on the voluntariness of a confession required by this Court's decision in Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368, is not designed to implement the presumption of innocence and enhance the reliability of jury verdicts, but to prevent the use of a coerced confession as violative of due process quite apart from its truth or falsity.  Consequently, determining the admissibility of a confession by a preponderance of the evidence is not inconsistent with the mandate of In re Winship, supra.  Pp.  404 U. S. 482-487.
2. Petitioner has not demonstrated that admissibility rulings based on the preponderance of evidence standard are unreliable or that imposition of any higher standard under expanded exclusionary rules would be sufficiently productive to outweigh the 
Page 404 U. S. 478
 public interest in having probative evidence available to juries.  pp.  404 U. S. 487-489.
3. The procedure followed here comported with the requirements of Jackson, supra, and petitioner was not entitled to have the voluntariness issue which had been resolved by the trial judge also submitted to a jury for its separate consideration.  Nor did Duncan, supra, change the rule that determining the admissibility of evidence is a function of the court, rather than of the jury.  Pp.  404 U. S. 489-490.

The Court of Appeals, overruling the contentions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), held that it had jurisdiction to review the SEC's ""extremely dubious"" determination not to oppose the Dow Chemical Co.'s refusal of respondent shareholder's request to include its proposal for a corporate charter amendment in Dow's proxy statement.  Thereafter, Dow acquiesced in the request, and, at its annual meeting, less than 3% of the voting stockholders supported the respondent's proposal, as a result of which the company, under an SEC rule, may exclude the proposal from its proxy material for a three-year period.

 Mr. Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Mr. Justice BLACKMUN and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 I am constrained to express my profound disagreement with what the Court does in these three cases on the basis of Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518 (1972). 
 The important underlying aspect of these cases goes really to the function of law in preserving ordered liberty. Civilized people refrain from 'taking the law into their own hands' because of a belief that the government, as their agent, will take care of the problem in a organized, orderly way with as nearly a uniform response as human skills can manage. History is replete with evidence of what happens when the law cannot or does not provide a collective response for conduct so widely regarded as impermissible and intolerable. 
 It is barely a century since men in parts of this country carried guns constantly because the law did not afford protection. In that setting, the words used in these cases, if directed toward such an armed civilian, could well have led to death or serious bodily injury. When we undermine the general belief that the law will give protection against fighting words and profane and abusive language such as the utterances involved in these cases, we take steps to return to the law of the jungle. These three cases, like Gooding, are small but symptomatic steps. If continued, this permissiveness will tend further to erode public confidence in the law- that subtle but indispensable ingredient of ordered liberty. [408 U.S. 901 , 903]

 Application for stay. 
 The application for stay of judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut presented to Mr. Justice MARSHALL and by him referred to the Court is granted.

 Appellant seeks to stay the judgment of a three-judge Federal District Court which held unconstitutional Connecticut's plan for apportioning its state legislature. 341 F.Supp. 139. The plan was adopted in September 1971, and was only in the preliminary stages of implementation when it was struck down as violative of the Equal Protection Clause on March 30, 1972. An appeal from that decision has been docketed in this Court. Gaffney v. Cummings, No. 71-1476.

 We denied a motion for expedited consideration of that appeal on May 22, 1972. 406 U.S. 942. Appellant promptly moved the lower court for a stay of its

 March 30th decision, and when that stay was denied on May 26, 1972, appellant came here. 
 Earlier this Term, in another reapportionment case, Mr. Justice Powell articulated the considerations involved in our review of applications for a stay of lower court judgments: 
 There is 'irreparable injury' in a different sense if the court's order striking down a state apportionment is handed down so near the upcoming election that it is administratively impractical to implement an orderly election. Here, there is no serious claim that irreparable injury, in this sense, would result if a stay is not granted. The court below found as fact that there is ample time before the Fall election to implement the plan submitted by the Special Master on May 26, 1972, or any proposed substitute which the State or appellant might submit within a reasonable time.

 June 19, 1972
 On petitions for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The motion to dispense with printing the FPC opinion in No. 71-1219 to conform with Rule 39 is granted. The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 These petitions should be granted to consider whether the Federal Power Commission complied with its obligations under 101 and 102 of the National Environ-

 mental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4331 and 4332, in granting a license to Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., for the construction of a pumped storage power project on Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River. 
 Under 101 of the Act federal agencies are instructed to take environmental consequences into account in their decisionmaking. [Footnote 1] That mandate was aimed partly at eliminating the excuse which had often been offered by bureaucrats that their statutory authority did not authorize consideration of such factors in their policy decisions.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 At the trial in this case there was much evidence of corrupt practices by the mayoral administration of petitioner Addonizio during his tenure as mayor of Newark, New Jersey. But the question posed to the 
Page 405 U.S. 936 , 937
 jury below was not whether these petitioners had engaged in corrupt practices but the narrower issue of whether these defendants had entered into and executed a criminal agreement to extract kickbacks from public contractors through threats of physical harm or economic ruin in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1951.1 Although the petitioners were charged with 65 substantive acts of coercive extraction of kickbacks, the key issue in the trial was who, if anyone, had conspired to commit these acts. Absent a finding that such a confederation had been formed most of the evidence which damaged the petitioners could not have been introduced at all inasmuch as this evidence was hearsay admitted provisionally under the so- called coconspirator exception. That the jury found a conspiracy to have existed, however, was under the circumstances of this trial the unsurprising and virtually inevitable result of the many disabilities imposed upon an accused by the ordeal of a multi-defendant, conspiracy prosecution.
