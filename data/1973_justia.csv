Syllabus 
A labor union's offer to waive initiation fees for all employees who sign union authorization cards before a certification election under the National Labor Relations Act interferes with the employees' right to refrain from union activities guaranteed by  7 of the Act, does not comport with the principle of ""fair and free choice of bargaining representatives by employees"" that is inherent in  9(c)(1)(A), NLRB v.

|414 u.s. 313|"Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona
No. 72-397
Argued October 15, 1973
Decided December 17, 1973
414 U.S. 313

Syllabus 
Certain land abutting the east bank of the Colorado River was conveyed in 1910 by federal patent to a railroad company.  Upon admission to the Union in 1912, Arizona succeeded the Federal Government to title to the bed of the Colorado River.  The river's gradual eastward movement submerged the subject land by erosion so that title was mechanically transferred to the State as part of the riverbed.  In 1955, petitioner cattle company acquired title to the original railroad grant, most of which by that time was covered by water.  In 1959, the subject land was abandoned by the Colorado as a result of a federal rechanneling project.  Petitioner cattle company filed this action to quiet title and prevailed in the lower courts, but the Arizona Supreme Court reversed, holding that, under the equal-footing doctrine and the Submerged Lands Act, Arizona held title to the beds of all navigable waters within its borders, and thus to the subject land as a result of the river's gradual eastward movement.
Held:
1. Ownership of the subject land is governed by federal law.  The issue here is not what rights the State has accorded private owners in lands that the State holds as sovereign, but how far the State's sovereign right extends under the equal-footing doctrine and the federal Submerged Lands Act, i.e., whether the State retains title to lands formerly beneath the Colorado or whether title thereto is defeasible by withdrawal of those waters.  Pp.  414 U. S. 317-321.
2. The equal-footing doctrine does not support the State's claim, since, when the water receded from the disputed land, there was no longer a public purpose to be served by the State, as sovereign, holding title thereto.  Pp.  414 U. S. 321-324.
3. Nor does the Submerged Lands Act, which did not abrogate the federal law of accretion, support the State's claim, since that Act does not extend to the States any interest in the beds of navigable rivers beyond those afforded by the equal-footing doctrine.  Pp.  414 U. S. 324-325.
4. Title to the subject land, under the applicable federal common law, is vested in petitioner as riparian landowner, and not in the State as owner of the riverbed.  Pp.  414 U. S. 325-332.
(a) Analysis of the interests of the State and petitioner, in 
Page 414 U. S. 314
 light of the rationales for the federal common law doctrines of accretion and avulsion, compels the conclusion that, as between the State, as owner of the riverbed, and petitioner, as riparian owner, the surfacing of the subject land should be treated as an accretion; hence, title to the disputed land should be vested in petitioner.  Pp.  414 U. S. 325-330.
(b) The doctrine of avulsion (whereby an avulsive change caused by a stream suddenly and perceptively abandoning its old channel does not affect title and the boundary established by the former river stream remains at that line, even if the result is to cut off a landowner's riparian rights) does not apply here, because of the limited interests of the State in the subject property.  Pp.  414 U. S. 328-329.

No. 72-936
Argued October 9, 1973
Decided December 11, 1973
414 U.S. 218

Syllabus 
Having, as a result of a previous check of respondent's operator's permit, probable cause to arrest respondent for driving while his license was revoked, a police officer made a full custody arrest of respondent for such offense.  In accordance with prescribed procedures, the officer made a search of respondent's person, in the course of which he found in a coat pocket a cigarette package containing heroin.  The heroin was admitted into evidence at the District Court trial, which resulted in respondent's conviction for a drug offense.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the heroin had been obtained as a result of a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
Held:  In the case of a lawful custodial arrest, a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a ""reasonable"" search under that Amendment.  Pp.  414 U. S. 224-237.
(a) A search incident to a valid arrest is not limited to a frisk of the suspect's outer clothing and removal of such weapons as the arresting officer may, as a result of such frisk, reasonably believe and ascertain that the suspect has in his possession, and the absence of probable fruits or further evidence of the particular crime for which the arrest is made does not narrow the standards applicable to such a search.  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, distinguished.  Pp.  414 U. S. 227-229; 23235.
(b) A custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment and, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification, such as the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would, in fact, be found upon the suspect's person; and whether or not there was present one of the reasons supporting the authority for a search of the person incident to a lawful arrest need not be litigated in each case.  P.  414 U. S. 235.
(c) Since the custodial arrest here gave rise to the authority

 to search, it is immaterial that the arresting officer did not fear the respondent or suspect that he was armed.  Pp.  414 U. S. 236-237.

Syllabus 
During the course of a pat-down search of the person of petitioner, who had been arrested for not having his driver's license in his possession, the arresting officer seized marihuana cigarettes, for the unlawful possession of which petitioner was subsequently tried and convicted.  The State Supreme Court upheld the conviction, concluding that the search leading to the discovery of the marihuana, which was used as evidence in petitioner's trial, was not unreasonable.
Held:  The full search of the person of the suspect made incident to a lawful custodial arrest did not violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, United States v. Robinson, ante, p.  414 U. S. 218, and it is of no constitutional significance that, contrary to the situation in Robinson, police regulations did not require that petitioner be taken into custody or establish the conditions under which a full-scale body search should be conducted, nor, as in Robinson, is it relevant that the arresting officer had no subjective fear of petitioner or suspicion that he was armed, since it is the fact of custodial arrest that gives rise to the authority to search.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL concurs, dissenting. 
 Petitioners are male Pawnee Indians who are students at Pawnee Junior High School, a public school in Oklahoma. They sought to wear their hair parted in the middle with a long braid on each side so that, in their words, they could follow the 'old traditional ways' 
Page 414 U.S. 1097 , 1098
 and because such a hairstyle was 'one way of telling people that I am proud [to be an Indian].' Others testified that young Indians sought to wear braided hair because of a new-found pride in their heritage, in an attempt to 'regain their tradition, to learn their culture.' 
 These youth were suspended from school indefinitely on April 24, 1972, 1 for being in violation of a school hair-length regulation, which forbids hair reaching the shirt collar or ears. The Court of Appeals justified the suspension on the ground that the regulation was rational in that it sought to achieve the objective of 'instilling pride and initiative among the students leading to scholarship attainment and high school spirit and morale.' The court stressed testimony from one school superintendent that a school system cannot countenance different groups and still remain one organization. 
 Petitioners claim, inter alia, that the school hair-length restriction unjustifiably impinges on the freedom of expression guaranteed them by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This Court has consistently, over my dissents, refused to review lower court decisions passing on the constitutionality of school hair-length regulations, whether such regulations have been upheld or struck down, and regardless of the grounds on which the lower courts have reached their conclusions. I have noted the deep division among the Circuits on this issue, and have thought that it is an issue of particular personal interest to many and of considerable constitutional importance. See Freeman v. Flake, 405 U.S. 1032; Olff v. East Side Union High School District, 404 U.S. 1042. [414 U.S. 1097 , 1099]

|414 u.s. 156|"North Dakota Board of Pharmacy v. Snyder's Drug Stores, Inc.,
No. 72-1176
Argued November 6, 1973
Decided December 5, 1973
414 U.S. 156

Syllabus 
The North Dakota Supreme Court, relying on Liggett Co. v. Baldridge, 278 U. S. 105, held unconstitutional a state statute under which respondent had been denied a pharmacy operating permit, requiring that an applicant for such a permit be ""a registered pharmacist in good standing"" or
""a corporation or association, the majority stock in which is owned by registered pharmacists in good standing, actively and regularly employed in and responsible for the management, supervision, and operation of such pharmacy.""
The court remanded the case so that petitioner Board could conduct an administrative hearing ""sans the constitutional issue,"" on respondent's alleged failure to meet certain structural and safety standards on which petitioner had also rested its permit denial.
Held:
1. This Court does not lack jurisdiction to review the State Supreme Court's judgment, which is ""final"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1257, for it is not apparent how petitioner Board would be able to preserve the constitutional issue now ready for adjudication without defying the State Supreme Court.

No. 72-1176
Argued November 6, 1973
Decided December 5, 1973
414 U.S. 156

Syllabus 
The North Dakota Supreme Court, relying on Liggett Co. v. Baldridge, 278 U. S. 105, held unconstitutional a state statute under which respondent had been denied a pharmacy operating permit, requiring that an applicant for such a permit be ""a registered pharmacist in good standing"" or
""a corporation or association, the majority stock in which is owned by registered pharmacists in good standing, actively and regularly employed in and responsible for the management, supervision, and operation of such pharmacy.""
The court remanded the case so that petitioner Board could conduct an administrative hearing ""sans the constitutional issue,"" on respondent's alleged failure to meet certain structural and safety standards on which petitioner had also rested its permit denial.
Held:
1. This Court does not lack jurisdiction to review the State Supreme Court's judgment, which is ""final"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1257, for it is not apparent how petitioner Board would be able to preserve the constitutional issue now ready for adjudication without defying the State Supreme Court.  Pp.  414 U. S. 159-164.
2. The North Dakota statutory requirements for permitting the operation of a pharmacy do not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

No. 72-702
Argued October 11, 1973
Decided December 5, 1973
414 U.S. 168

Syllabus 
Petitioner All American Beverages, Inc. (All American), purchased the soft drink bottling and distribution business of petitioner Golden State Bottling Co. (Golden State) after the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had ordered Golden State, ""its officers, agents, successors, and assigns"" to reinstate with backpay a driver-salesman whose discharge by Golden State was found to have been an unfair labor practice.  In a subsequent back-pay specification proceeding to which both firms were parties, upon finding that All American, after the acquisition, continued the business without interruption or substantial change in operations, employee complement, or supervisory personnel, and that, hence, All American, having acquired the business with knowledge of the outstanding NLRB order, was a ""successor"" for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) liable for the reinstatement of the driver-salesman with backpay, the NLRB ordered All American to reinstate him and both firms jointly or severally to pay him a specified sum of backpay.  The Court of Appeals enforced the order.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals did not err in determining that, on the record as a whole, substantial evidence supported the NLRB's finding that All American purchased the business with knowledge of the unfair labor practice litigation, since it cannot be said on the basis of the record that the Court of Appeals ""misapprehended or grossly misapplied"" the standard of review.  Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U. S. 474.  Pp.  340 U. S. 172-174.
2. The issuance of a reinstatement and backpay order against a bona fide successor that did not itself commit the unfair labor practice does not exceed the NLRB's remedial powers under  10(c) of the NLRA, since such powers include broad discretion to fashion and issue such an order in order to achieve the ends and effectuate the policies of the Act.  Pp.  414 U. S. 175-177. 
Page 414 U. S. 169

3. Federal Rule Civ.Proc. 65(d), which provides that injunctions and restraining orders shall be binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order, does not bar judicial enforcement of the NLRB order running to All American, since a bona fide successor, acquiring, with knowledge that the wrong remains unremedied, the employing enterprise which was the locus of the unfair labor practice, may be considered in privity with its predecessor for purposes of Rule 65(d).  Pp.  414 U. S. 177-181.
4. The NLRB properly exercised its discretion in issuing the order against All American by striking an equitable balance among the conflicting legitimate interests of the bona fide successor, the public, and the affected employee for purposes of effectuating the national labor policies of avoiding labor strife, preventing a deterrent effect on the exercise of rights guaranteed employees by  7 of the NLRA, and protecting the victimized employee, such policies being achieved at a relatively minimal cost to the bona fide successor.  Pp.  414 U. S. 181-185.
5. The NLRB did not err in ordering both firms jointly or severally to pay the driver-salesman a specified sum of backpay, since an offending predecessor employer should at least be required to make the dischargee whole for any loss of pay suffered by reason of the discharge until such time as he secures substantially equivalent employment, since joint and several liability will more fully insure that the employee is fully recompensed by protecting him against, e.g., the successor's insolvency, and since the possibility that the successor will unjustifiably delay reinstatement to the predecessor's prejudice can be met by a protective provision in the contract of sale.  Pp.  414 U. S. 186-187.
6. The fact that the driver-salesman, but for his discharge as an ordinary employee would, under Golden State's policy, have become a distributor about a year later, and, as an independent contractor, would have been excluded from NLRA coverage, did not preclude the NLRB from including in the gross backpay computation the dischargee's putative earnings as a distributor, since a reinstatement and backpay order is aimed at restoring the status quo that would have obtained but for the employer's unfair labor practice.  Pp.  414 U. S. 187-189.

No. 72-844
Argued October 11, 1973

Syllabus 
Respondent brought this action to enjoin petitioners (hereafter D & F), a fully integrated partnership managing apartment complexes for a fixed percentage of the gross rentals collected from each project, from minimum wage and other violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, adopting D & F's contentions that it does not have a $500,000 ""annual gross volume of sales made or business done,"" and thus does not come within the term ""enterprise engaged in commerce"" as defined in  3(s) of the Act, and that it is not an employer, within the meaning of  3(d), of the maintenance personnel who are paid from the rentals received at the apartment complexes where they work.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that D & F met the statutory definition of ""employer"" and that, in determining whether the enterprise satisfies the dollar volume limitation, it is the gross rentals (which exceed $500,000 annually) that D & F collects at all the apartment complexes that must be considered, rather than the gross commissions that D & F receives from the apartment owners.
Held:
1. D & F, whose managerial responsibilities at each of the buildings give it substantial control of the terms and conditions of the work of employees at those buildings, is an ""employer"" under the expansive definition of the term in  3(d) of the Act.  P.  414 U. S. 195.
2. D & F sells only its professional management services, and the gross rentals it collects as part of those services do not represent sales attributable to its enterprise.  D & F's commissions are therefore the relevant measure of its gross sales made or business done for purposes of the dollar volume limitation in  3(s)(1).  Thus, though D & F is an ""enterprise"" under 3(r), Brennan v. Arnheim & Neely, Inc., 410 U. S. 512, the Act does not apply to D & F, as its commissions are below the  3(s)(1) limitation.

Syllabus 
When respondent voluntarily terminated his employment as an account executive in petitioner securities broker's San Francisco office for a similar position with a competitor, petitioner determined, pursuant to a forfeiture clause of its employees' profit-sharing plan, that respondent, by entering competitive employment, had forfeited all rights to the plan's benefits.  Respondent sought a declaratory judgment in a California state court that the forfeiture clause was unlawful under  16600 of the California Business and Professions Code, which invalidates every contract restraining a person from engaging in a lawful business.  Petitioner answered, inter alia, that a condition of respondent's employment with petitioner was approval by the New York Stock Exchange; that respondent, at the time of his employment, applied on an Exchange form for such approval, as required by Exchange Rule 345(a)(1), pledging to abide by Exchange rules; and, as required by Rule 347(b), agreed to submit to arbitration any controversy arising out of termination of his employment.  On petitioner's appeal from the denial of its petition for an order directing arbitration, the California Court of Appeal held that a written agreement to arbitrate did exist, but that the forfeiture clause of the profit-sharing plan was invalid as in restraint of trade under California law when applied to California residents, and petitioner's contributions under the plan were wages under provisions of the California Labor Code giving wage earners a right of action for wages due and unpaid despite any private agreement to arbitrate.
Held:  Exchange Rules 345(a)(1) and 347(b), promulgated as self-regulatory measures pursuant to  6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act), and respondent's pledge to abide by those rules do not preempt the avenues of wage relief otherwise available to respondent under California law.  Pp.  414 U. S. 125-140.
(a) Rule 347(b) does not fall under the Exchange's mandate to protect the investing public and to insure just and equitable trade practices set forth in  6(d) and 19(b) of the Act, so as 
Page 414 U. S. 118
 to require preemption of contrary state law by such rule, there being nothing in the Act or any SEC rule or regulation specifying arbitration as a favored means of resolving employer employee disputes, and it being clear that Rule 347(b) would not be subject to the SEC's modification or review under  19(b).  Pp.  414 U. S. 134-136.
(b) Rule 347(b) cannot be categorized as part of a need for uniform national regulation, there being no revelation in the Act or in any SEC regulation that nationwide uniformity of an exchange's housekeeping affairs is necessary, and it not being shown that national uniformity in the area of wage claims is vital to federal securities policy.  Pp.  414 U. S. 136-137.
(c) The ""applicable state laws"" referred to in  6(c) of the Act, which subjects exchange rules to a requirement of consistency with the Act, ""and the applicable laws of the State in which it is located,"" are not, in this instance, merely because the New York Stock Exchange is in New York City, the laws of New York so as to require the California court to apply New York law compelling arbitration of this dispute and validating the forfeiture clause of the profit-sharing plan, since  6(c) has no independent existence creating some sort of spurious uniformity of application for all States, but merely requires that any exchange rule adopted outside the Act's context comport with the laws of the State in which the exchange is located.

Syllabus 
At respondent's Oregon criminal trial, the trial judge charged, in accordance with a state statutory provision:
""Every witness is presumed to speak the truth.  This presumption may be overcome by the manner in which the witness testifies, by the nature of his or her testimony, by evidence affecting his or her character, interest, or motives, by contradictory evidence or by a presumption.""

Syllabus 
At respondent's Oregon criminal trial, the trial judge charged, in accordance with a state statutory provision:
""Every witness is presumed to speak the truth.  This presumption may be overcome by the manner in which the witness testifies, by the nature of his or her testimony, by evidence affecting his or her character, interest, or motives, by contradictory evidence or by a presumption.""

Two suits were brought charging petitioner, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with, inter alia, violating the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and failure to enforce its own rules.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted in state court of armed robbery, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and assault and battery with intent to murder. Petitioner and his codefendants were young Negroes. Their victim was a white, uniformed security guard employed by Boston University. Petitioner requested the trial judge to direct a specific question concerning racial prejudice to the prospective jurors on voir dire. [Footnote 1] The trial judge refused; instead, he made only the general inquiry mandated by Massachusetts law, whether members of the array had 'expressed or formed an opinion, or were sensible of any bias or prejudice.' The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed the conviction. Ross v. Massachusetts, Mass., 282 N.E.2d 70 (1972). 
Page 414 U.S. 1080 , 1081
 Petitioner sought certiorari on the grounds that he had been denied the opportunity to have the jurors examined as to racial bias, a right this Court guaranteed in Aldridge v. United States, 283 U.S. 308 (1931). We granted certiorari and remanded for reconsideration in light of Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.S. 524, 35 L.E.2d 46 (1973). On remand, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts again upheld the conviction. Ross v. Massachusetts, Mass., 296 N.E.2d 810 (1973).

 This case involves the sufficiency and objectivity of an Environmental Impact Statement prepared in connection with the construction of the Reef Runway Project at Honolulu International Airport. The project is a 12,000-foot runway to be built off-shore on filled reef- land in the Keehi Lagoon. The construction will involve the dredging of some 14 million cubic yards of coral and silt, consuming over 1,200 acres of ocean coral reef.

Syllabus 
Appellee, a qualified Chicago voter who voted in a February 1971 Republican primary involving nominations for municipal officers, challenges the constitutionality of  7-43(d) of the Illinois Election Code, under which she was barred from voting in a March 1972 Democratic primary.  Section 7-43(d) prohibits a person from voting in the primary election of a political party if he has voted in the primary of any other party within the preceding 23 months, an exception being made if the primary is of a ""political party within a city . . . only.""  Appellants contended, inter alia, that the three-judge District Court, which held the statute invalid, should have abstained, because the state courts might have found the statutory exception applicable to the 1971 primary.
Held:
1. The District Court did not err in declining to abstain from making a constitutional ruling in view of an Illinois Supreme Court adjudication confining the statutory exception to political parties entitled to nominate only for city offices and making it inapplicable to the Democratic and Republican parties.  Appellee is thus not relieved of the bar of the 23-month rule.  Pp.  414 U. S. 53-56.
2. Section 7-43(d) unconstitutionally infringes upon the right of free political association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments by ""locking"" the voter in his preexisting party affiliation for a substantial period of time following his participation in any primary election, and the State's legitimate interest in preventing party ""raiding"" cannot justify the substantial restraint of the 23-month rule.

No. 72-331
Argued October 10, 1973

414 U.S. 70

Syllabus 
New York statutes require public contracts to provide that, if a contractor refuses to waive immunity or to testify concerning his state contracts, his existing contracts may be canceled and he shall be disqualified from further transactions with the State for five years, and further require disqualification from contracting with public authorities upon a person's failure to waive immunity or answer questions respecting his state transactions.  Appellees, New York-licensed architects, when summoned to testify before a grand jury investigating various criminal charges, refused to sign waivers of immunity, whereupon various contracting authorities were notified of appellees' conduct and had their attention called to the applicable disqualification statutes.  Appellees thereafter brought this action challenging the statutes as violative of their constitutional privilege against compelled self-incrimination.  A three-judge District Court declared the statutes unconstitutional under the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments.
Held:
1. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is not inapplicable simply because the issue arises in the context of official inquiries into the job performance of a public contractor.  The ordinary rule is that the privilege is available to witnesses called before a grand jury as these appellees were, and the State's legitimate interest in maintaining the integrity of its civil service and of its transactions with independent contractors, like other state concerns, cannot override the requirements of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  414 U. S. 77-79.
2. The State could not compel testimony that had not been immunized, and the waiver sought by the State, under threat of loss of contracts, would have been no less compelled than a direct request for the testimony without resort to the waiver device, Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U. S. 493; Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U. S. 273; Sanitation Men v. Sanitation Comm'r, 392 U.

Page 414 U. S. 71

3. Under a proper accommodation between the interest of the State and the Fifth Amendment, the State can require employees or contractors to respond to inquiries, but only if it offers them immunity sufficient to supplant their Fifth Amendment privilege.

Decided November 19, 1973
414 U.S. 86

Syllabus 
Petitioners, Mr. and Mrs. Espinoza, brought suit after exhausting their administrative remedies with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that respondent's refusal to hire Mrs. Espinoza in its San Antonio division because of her Mexican citizenship violated  703 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire any individual because of his race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment, relying primarily on an EEOC guideline providing that a lawful alien resident may not be discriminated against on the basis of citizenship.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  An employer's refusal to hire a person because he is not a United States citizen does not constitute employment discrimination on the basis of ""national origin"" in violation of  703.  Pp.  414 U. S. 88-96.
(a) In light of the statute's legislative history and the longstanding practice of requiring federal employees to be United States citizens, it is clear that Congress did not intend the term ""national origin"" to embrace citizenship requirements.  Pp.  414 U. S. 88-91.
(b) The EEOC's guideline, though perhaps significant in a wide range of other situations, does not apply here or support the premise that discrimination on the basis of citizenship is tantamount to discrimination on the basis of national origin, since there is no showing that respondent (96% of whose San Antonio division employees are Mexican-Americans) discriminated against persons of Mexican origin.  Pp.  414 U. S. 92-95.
(c) Though the Act protects aliens against illegal discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, it does not proscribe discrimination on the basis of alienage.  P.  414 U. S. 95.

			"|"Espinoza v. Farah Manufacturing Co., Inc.
No. 72-671
Argued October 10-11, 1973
Decided November 19, 1973
414 U.S. 86

Syllabus 
Petitioners, Mr. and Mrs. Espinoza, brought suit after exhausting their administrative remedies with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that respondent's refusal to hire Mrs. Espinoza in its San Antonio division because of her Mexican citizenship violated  703 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire any individual because of his race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment, relying primarily on an EEOC guideline providing that a lawful alien resident may not be discriminated against on the basis of citizenship.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  An employer's refusal to hire a person because he is not a United States citizen does not constitute employment discrimination on the basis of ""national origin"" in violation of  703.  Pp.  414 U. S. 88-96.
(a) In light of the statute's legislative history and the longstanding practice of requiring federal employees to be United States citizens, it is clear that Congress did not intend the term ""national origin"" to embrace citizenship requirements.  Pp.  414 U. S. 88-91.
(b) The EEOC's guideline, though perhaps significant in a wide range of other situations, does not apply here or support the premise that discrimination on the basis of citizenship is tantamount to discrimination on the basis of national origin, since there is no showing that respondent (96% of whose San Antonio division employees are Mexican-Americans) discriminated against persons of Mexican origin.  Pp.  414 U. S. 92-95.
(c) Though the Act protects aliens against illegal discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, it does not proscribe discrimination on the basis of alienage.  P.  414 U. S. 95.
462 F.2d 1331, affirmed.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 19, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL concurs, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted of two counts of distributing heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1); he later pleaded guilty to a third count. After petitioner's plea on the third count, the District Court sentenced him to concurrent 15-year terms on the three counts, recommending that petitioner be given drug addition treatment at the Federal Youth Center at Ashland, Kentucky. 
Page 414 U.S. 1045 , 1046
 It refused, however, to sentence petitioner under the provisions of the Narcotics Addict Rehabilitation Act, 18 U.S.C. 4251 et seq. Petitioner claims that in the circumstances of this case the trial judge abused his discretion in refusing to sentence him under the NARA. 
 The three charges against petitioner grew out of three transactions in which he acted as a middleman, purchasing heroin from two different wholesalers for a federal agent. Petitioner received only a total of $15 from the three sales, which was used to buy heroin for his own personal use. Petitioner also retained some of the drug he had purchased for his own personal use. 
 The District Court refused to sentence petitioner under the NARA with the possibility of early release to the community because he had 'sold' heroin, and was not just a user. [Footnote 1] 

 Under 4251 of the NARA, individuals are generally not 'eligible' for NARA sentencing if they have sold narcotics; Congress, however, created an express exception for those who sold primarily to support their own addiction. Section 4252, on which the Court of Appeals relied in affirming the District Court, provides that if a court believes an eligible offender to be an addict, it 'may' place him in the custody of the Attorney General to determine whether he is an addict likely to be rehabilitated through treatment. Section 4253 provides that if a court, after this study, finds that an offender is an addict and rehabilitatable, it 'shall' sentence him under the NARA, with exceptions not here relevant.

 Martin J. FITZPATRICKv. State of NEW YORK.No. 73-5370. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 19, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of New York. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Martin Fitzpatrick was convicted for the first-degree murder of two police officers in Sherrill, New York. The police followed reliable leads and located a house owned by Fitzpatrick in Syracuse. After attempting to get a response from inside, the police entered the house through a door which had been left ajar. As they came to a room on the second floor, petitioner called out from a closet in which he was hiding- 'Don't shoot. I give up.' The officers seized and handcuffed him, and took him out into the hall. The police then questioned Fitzpatrick about the gun he had used, after advising him of his rights. He stated that it was in the closet where he had been found. The gun was retrieved from the closet and it was subsequently identified as the murder weapon at trial. At a suppression hearing, the trial judge determined that petitioner had not been sufficiently apprised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), and ruled petitioner's oral statements to the police inadmissible. The trial court nevertheless admitted the gun into evidence, rejecting petitioner's contention that it be excluded as fruit of the poisonous tree. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963). The trial court adopted what has been termed the rule of 'inevitable discovery,' stating 'proper police investigation would [in any event] have resulted in a search of that closet and [the gun's] discovery.' The New York Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the search was not inconsistent with Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969), and also adopted the inevitable discovery rule. 
Page 414 U.S. 1050 , 1051
 Chimel held that a search of premises incident to arrest was justified when limited to 'a search of the arrestee's person and the area 'within his immediate control'-construing that phrase to mean the area within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.' Id., at 763. This limitation lends substance to petitioner's claim that this search, of a closet in a room, while an arrestee is handcuffed in a hall in the presence of police, cannot be justified. At the very least, a substantial issue of compliance with Chimel is posed and is deserving of this Court's attention. 
 Of equal importance is the adoption by the New York Court of Appeals of the inevitable discovery rule. The rejection of that rule by the Second Circuit, United States v. Paroutian, 299 F.2d 486 (CA2 1962), where evidence was discovered as the 'fruit' of an illegal search, may pose a dilemma for law enforcement officials in the State of New York. Moreover, if the fruits doctrine applies to exclude evidence obtained as a result of statements made after improper Miranda warnings, compare Miranda, supra, 384 U.S., at 476-477, with Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222 (1971), it is a significant constitutional question whether the 'independent source' exception to inadmissibility of fruits, Wong Sun, supra, 371 U.S., at 487-488, encompasses a hypothetical as well as an actual independent source. 
 Because in important respects the decision is arguably at odds with decisions of this Court, I would grant the petition for certiorari.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was sentenced to eight years imprisonment upon his plea of guilty to a charge of burglary. Later on the same day, the same conduct was the basis of a charge of theft for which he received a consecutive eight-year sentence when he also pleaded guilty to that charge. Although neither conviction was directly appealed, petitioner sought state habeas corpus, claiming that, since both charges arose out of the same criminal transaction, his second conviction for theft violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy. Petitioner's application was denied by the 179th District Court of Harris County and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeal. 
 Respondent's Brief in opposition, p. 2, conceded that the charges of burglary and theft arose out of the same criminal transaction. That, in my opinion, requires that we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse, for I adhere to the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Missouri. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 After petitioner and one Edward Johnson forcefully entered a St. Louis apartment occupied by Mrs. Hermine Rohs, her son Willy Rohs, and his wife Marilyn Rohs, robbed them, raped both women, and finally stabbed all three to death, petitioner was indicted on three separate charges of murder in the first degree.* The State proceeded first with the trial of petitioner for the murder of Marilyn Rohs, seeking the death penalty. The jury convicted petitioner of first-degree murder, but assessed punishment at life imprisonment. Subsequently, the State tried petitioner for the murder of Willy Rohs, again seeking the death penalty. Again the jury found petitioner guilty of first-degree murder and assessed life imprisonment. The trial judge specified that the second life sentence would run consecutive to the first and the State thereupon entered a plea of nolle prosequi on the third indictment. The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed both convictions, rejecting petitioner's claim that the second prosecution violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy. See State of Missouri v. Smith, 491 S.W.2d 257 (Mo.1973). 
 Although both charges of murder clearly arose out of the same transaction or episode, they were prosecuted by the State in separate proceedings. That, in my 
Page 414 U.S. 1031 , 1032
 opinion, requires that we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse, for I adhere to the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v.

The jury convicted petitioner of first-degree murder, but assessed punishment at life imprisonment. Subsequently, the State tried petitioner for the murder of Willy Rohs, again seeking the death penalty. Again the jury found petitioner guilty of first-degree murder and assessed life imprisonment. The trial judge specified that the second life sentence would run consecutive to the first and the State thereupon entered a plea of nolle prosequi on the third indictment. The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed both convictions, rejecting petitioner's claim that the second prosecution violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy. See State of Missouri v. Smith, 491 S.W.2d 257 (Mo.1973). 
 Although both charges of murder clearly arose out of the same transaction or episode, they were prosecuted by the State in separate proceedings. That, in my 
Page 414 U.S. 1031 , 1032
 opinion, requires that we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse, for I adhere to the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 ( 1969), requires the prosecution, except in extremely limited circumstances not present here, 'to join at one trial all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode or transaction.' Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 453-454, 25 L. Ed.2d 469 (1970) (concurring opinion); see Miller v. Oregon, 405 U.S. 1047 (1972) (dissenting opinion); Harris v. Washington, 404 U.S. 55, 57 (1971) ( concurring opinion); Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 395 (1970) (concurring opinion). 
[Footnote *] Edward Johnson, who was also indicted, tried, and convicted for first-degree murder, has not petitioned this Court to review his conviction.

 November 5, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN join, dissenting. 
 By an earlier per curiam opinion in this case, this Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals which had affirmed a district court judgment granting Delle Rose's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. See LaVallee v. Delle Rose, 410 U.S. 690 (1973). In the view of a majority of the Court, the courts below erred in holding that the state courts had not made an 'adequate' determination within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 2254(d) that Delle Rose's confession was voluntary. Since an 'adequate' state court determination had been made, the District Court was wrong in imposing on the State the burden of showing voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence. Rather, under the terms of the presumption in 2254(d), the burden was on Delle Rose 'to establish in the District Court by convincing evidence that the state courts' determination was erroneous.' 410 U.S., at 695. The Court therefore remanded the case 'for further proceedings consistent with this opinion'-presumably referring to a redetermination by the District Court of the voluntariness issue under a corrected allocation of the burden of proof. 
 Upon receiving the mandate from this Court, however, the Court of Appeals did not remand the case to the District Court for such a redetermination. Instead, without explanation it remanded with instructions to dismiss the petition. In my view, the Court of Appeals thereby not only misconstrued this Court's opinion, but also deprived petitioner of his constitutional and statutory right to attempt 'to establish by convincing evidence 
Page 414 U.S. 1014 , 1015
 that the factual determination by the State court was erroneous.' 28 U.S.C . 2254(d). 
 At the outset, it seems clear from a reading of the earlier per curiam decision that this Court never even addressed, let alone decided, the question of whether petitioner had satisfied his burden of proving erroneous the state court finding of voluntariness. Nor would it have been proper to have done so. Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals had yet confronted the question, having mistakenly placed the burden of proof on the State. As we have said in similar circumstances, 'it is not our function to deal with this issue in the first instance.' Swenson v. Stidham, 409 U.S. 224, 231 (1972). 
 This case would not be so troublesome bur for the fact that the record indicates that the District Court might well find the confession involuntary, even were the burden of proof assigned to petitioner. Indeed, in granting the petition in the first place, the District Court remarked: 'Far from satisfying the State's burden of showing voluntariness by a preponderance, the evidence preponderates heavily the other way.' United States ex rel. Delle Rose v. LaVallee, SDNY, 342 F.Supp. 567, 574 ( citation omitted). And certainly there is ample evidence in the record to support that factual finding.

 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 It is my view that, 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the state and federal governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.' Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (dissenting opinion). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 311.2(a) is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore vacate so much of the judgment of the District Court as is the subject of the appeal and remand [414 U.S. 946 , 948]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 23, 1973
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 Appellants sought in the 44th Judicial District Court of Dallas County, Texas, to enjoin pending and future prosecutions uner Vernon's Ann. Texas Penal Code Art. 527, 3, arising out of the seizure of motion picture films alleged to be 'obscene matter' within 3. All parties agree that Texas law permits equitable intervention in a criminal proceeding if the criminal statute involved is unconstitutional, or otherwise void, and enforcement would result in irreparable injury to property rights. See State ex rel. Flowers v. Woodruff, 150 Tex.Cr.R. 255, 200 S.W.2d 178 (1947 ). Appellants challenged the constitutionality under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of Art. 527, 9(h) of the Texas Penal Code, enacted as an aid to the enforcement of 3, which is Texas' basic criminal obscenity statute. Section 9(h) provides as follows: 
Page 414 U.S. 951 , 952
 sion or seizure may file a notice in writing with the magistrate within 10 days of the date of the seizure alleging that the matter is not obscene and the magistrate shall set a hearing within one day after request therefor, or at such time as the requesting party might agree, and at such hearing evidence may be presented as to the obscenity of the matter seized and at the conclusion of such additional hearing, the magistrate shall make a further determination as to the obscenity or nonobscenity of the matter. If at such hearing the magistrate finds the matter to be obscene, then it shall be returned to the person or persons from whom it was seized.'
 Obscenity for purposes of Art. 527 is defined in 1: 
 The 44th Judicial District Court denied appellants' request for relief. The Texas Court of Civil Appeals affirmed, holding that the appellants had failed to establish the unconstitutionality of 9(h). Procaccini v. Jones, 488 S.W.2d 543 (Tex.Civ.App. [414 U.S. 951 , 953]

 Opinion on remand, 216 N.W.2d 650.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioners in this case were convicted of selling obscene books and distributing obscene motion pictures in violation of a local ordinance. They argue that, in the absence of evidence of pandering, selling to minors, or the affronting of unwilling recipients, their convictions are violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In support of the convictions, respondent relies on United States v. Reidel, 402 U.S. 351, and United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. 363. 
 In Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, this Court laid to rest the notion that a State may, consistent with the First Amendment, enforce an approved reading list delineating what materials the citizenry will be allowed privately to peruse. Wholly aside from my own views on what the constitution demands with respect to obscenity regulation, I fail to comprehend how the right to possession enunciated in Stanley has any meaning when States are allowed to outlaw the commercial transactions which give rise to such possession and to prosecute any merchant who attempts to sell materials to all the Stanleys in this country. I would therefore grant this petition and reverse the convictions on the basis of Stanley v. Georgia, supra. 

 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were convicted on charges of selling allegedly obscene books and displaying allegedly obscene motion pictures in violation of St. Paul Legislative Code 476.01, which provides as follows:

 The Court today remands this case for reconsideration in light of last June's obscenity decisions. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals will now decide whether the publications here are obscene in accordance with standards that no one could have predicted at the time that these publications were sold. It must determine whether the sale of these publications, which were never offered to minors, never displayed publicly to unwilling bystanders, for which purchase was never solicited, could constitutionally be prohibited because they 'appealed to the prurient interest' of the average person applying local community standards, were 'patently offensive' under such standards, and lacked 'serious' literary, artistic, political or scientific value. (413 U.S. 15, 37 L. Ed.2d 419.)

 I adhere to my dissent in United States v.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 23, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN concurs, dissenting. 
 Petitioner's husband, a ticket agent of the respondent railroad, was required to open the ticket office of the Mineola, Long Island, station in the early hours of a Sunday morning. In order to open the steel shutter covering the ticket window it was necessary to leave the security of the ticket office and enter the passenger waiting room. Since there was no peephole in the shutter or in the door leading to the waiting room, there was no way for the agent to view the waiting room from the 
Page 414 U.S. 980 , 981
 ticket office. Upon entering the waiting room, petitioner's husband encountered armed robbers who shot and killed him. Petitioner brought this suit to recover damages under the Federal Employer's Liability Act, 45 U.S. C. 51 et seq. 
 In Lillie v. Thompson, 332 U.S. 459, this Court held that the Act provides relief for breach by a railroad of its duty to protect employees from foreseeable third party assaults. In order to demonstrate foreseeability in this case, petitioner offered to prove 10 robberies or attempted robberies at respondent's stations located between five and 30 miles of the Mineola station. All had occurred within four years and two occurred in the month immediately preceding the Mineola holdup. Petitioner further offered to prove communications between the ticket agent's union and respondent relating the dangers of armed robbery and requesting the installation of peepholes and silent alarms. Since none of the prior robberies occurred at the Mineola station and none of the union communications made specific reference to the dangers at that particular station, the evidence was excluded. 
 After finding that petitioner had 'introduced no evidence showing that [respondent] should have reasonably foreseen the possibility of a holdup at the Mineola Station,' the District Court granted respondent's motion for a directed verdict. 
 As this Court has repeatedly pointed out, Congress expressed a strong preference for jury determinations of actions arising under the Act. See Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 508d 493. When the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to petitioner, I conclude that a fair-minded juror could well conclude that failure to provide a peephole was negligence and that this negligence played some part in the agent's [414 U.S. 980 , 982]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 15, 1973
 Rehearing Denied Dec. 3, 1973. 
 See 414 U.S. 1086. 
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 On the basis of Turner v. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346d 567 (1970), I concur in the dismissal of appellant's facial attack on Georgia's jury selection statutes. However, I would treat the jurisdiction statement as a petition for certiorari in respect of the second question presented,* see 28 U.S.C. 2103 (1964 ed.); Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502, 512 (1966), and to that extent set the case for oral argument. 
 Appellant alleges that the application by the jury commissioners of Coweta County of the Georgia jury selection statutes violated the Fourteenth Amendment in that such application resulted in blacks, women, and 
Page 414 U.S. 886 , 887
 young adults age 18 30 being underrepresented on the venire from which his grand and petit juries were impaneled. The relevant Georgia statutes, Ga. Code Ann. 59 106, 59 201, require the county board of jury commissioners, at least biennially, to compile a jury list of 'intelligent and upright citizens,' who represent a fair cross section of the county, to serve as petit jurors. From this list, the commissioners are required to select the 'most experienced, intelligent, and upright citizens,' not exceeding two fifths of the whole number, to serve as grand jurors. 
 Appellant, a white male 24 years of age, challenged the array of the grand and petit juries which indicted and convicted him, on the ground that the jury list comprising the venire was compiled in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. The jury commissioners testified that a juror was not selected for either grand or petit jury service unless the juror was known personally by at least one commissioner. Appellant argues that this selection procedure permits the jury commissioners to know the race, sex, and approximate age of every juror before the venire is selected, and that as a consequence, a clear and ready opportunity for discrimination inheres in the selection procedure. Appellant buttresses this conclusion with uncontroverted statistical evidence that the population of Coweta County is composed of 28.3% eligible blacks, 53.3% eligible women, and 26.2% eligible young adults aged 18 30. Yet, the 2,138 names placed on the petit jury list included only 10.85% blacks, 16.23% women, and 3.09% young adults. Of the 400 persons found to be the 'most experienced' and placed on the grand jury list, only 14.25% were blacks, 4.5% were women, and 1.25% were young adults.

 October 15, 1973
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Appellants were part of a group of 25 to 60 blacks congregating about the center of a small Mississippi town. A local police officer approached the crowd and asked them to disperse. The crowed was not interfering with traffic; the officer had received no complaints; and the only person he knew to be bothered by the crowd was himself. The officer attempted to arrest appellant A. B. Thompson for disturbing the peace after A. B. cursed and acted 'real tough.' The officer testified that the crowd 'started around' him and he pulled his gun.* 
Page 414 U.S. 890 , 891
 He left the crowd and returned with two more officers, again attempting to arrest. A. B. after the youth 'hurled a vile obscenity' at him. A. B. resisted and in the resulting scuffle was shot. Along with his brother Leon who entered the scuffle when A. B. was shot and Davis Stewart who was 'riling up the crowd,' A. B. was convicted of riot under a statute the constitutionality of which is here challenged. Mississippi Code 2361.5- 01, subd. A provides: 
 Appellants complain of the vagueness and overbreadth in the phrase 'disturbing the public peace.' 
 According to the court below the 'riot' was underway when the officer returned and attempted to arrest A. B., the officer's actions being referred to as an attempt to 'quell a riot that had been instigated and encouraged by this appellant's cursing and obscence language to excite the crowd.' Miss., 269 So.2d 641. Since appellants challenge the facial constitutionality of a statute which, according to the Mississippi Supreme Court, defines the congregation of blacks in this case as a 'riot,' the fact that A. B. and Leon Thompson forcefully resisted the police intervention does not end the case. The fact that their action might fall within the statute if it were constitutionally narrowed, does not negate their ability to challenge the statute. Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518, 521.

 Supreme Court of the United States

 Rehearing Denied Dec. 3, 1973. 
 See 414 U.S. 1087. 
 The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Treating the papers whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for a writ of certiorari, certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE concurs, dissenting. 
 Petitioner,1 a 50-year-old inmate in the Kentucky prison system, brought a pro se action for damages under 42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging that prison officials had violated his civil rights. Petitioner alleged that on two separate occasions, Kentucky prison officials notified him of a transfer from one institution to another at 2:30 or 3:00 in the afternoon, and that he was moved later on the same day. On the occasion of the first of these transfers on short notice (apparently on October 8, 1970, from the Kentucky State Reformatory in LaGrange to the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville), officers allegedly refused to give petitioner time to recover two books on auto mechanics which he had been compiling for two years. On the occasion of the second of these transfers ( apparently on August 14, 1972, back to the Reformatory), prison officials did not allow petitioner to recover a book in which he had alphabetized legal cases, laboring on weekends for a year. [Footnote 2] 
Page 414 U.S. 893 , 894
 Petitioner contends that the First Amendment gives him the right 'to read and write. To think and put it on paper.' He argues, also, that the action of the prison officials violated the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments, which are applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. 
 The District Court dismissed petitioner's action and deemed any appeal 'frivolous' on the ground that alleged loss of property could not establish jurisdiction under the Civil Rights Act. We put such reasoning to rest in Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, on the ground that 'the petitioner-appellant voluntarily relinquished possession of the prsonal property in question.' 
 The assertion that petitioner voluntarily abandoned books on which he had labored for two years not only defies belief, but it is also unsupported by the record. The respondent's prison officials do not contest petitioner's factual allegations, but rather state lamely that it is 'clear from the facts' that petitioner voluntarily gave up his property. And even if he did not, respondents argue that:

Petitioner alleged that on two separate occasions, Kentucky prison officials notified him of a transfer from one institution to another at 2:30 or 3:00 in the afternoon, and that he was moved later on the same day. On the occasion of the first of these transfers on short notice (apparently on October 8, 1970, from the Kentucky State Reformatory in LaGrange to the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville), officers allegedly refused to give petitioner time to recover two books on auto mechanics which he had been compiling for two years. On the occasion of the second of these transfers ( apparently on August 14, 1972, back to the Reformatory), prison officials did not allow petitioner to recover a book in which he had alphabetized legal cases, laboring on weekends for a year. [Footnote 2] 
Page 414 U.S. 893 , 894
 Petitioner contends that the First Amendment gives him the right 'to read and write. To think and put it on paper.' He argues, also, that the action of the prison officials violated the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments, which are applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. 
 The District Court dismissed petitioner's action and deemed any appeal 'frivolous' on the ground that alleged loss of property could not establish jurisdiction under the Civil Rights Act. We put such reasoning to rest in Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, on the ground that 'the petitioner-appellant voluntarily relinquished possession of the prsonal property in question.' 
 The assertion that petitioner voluntarily abandoned books on which he had labored for two years not only defies belief, but it is also unsupported by the record. The respondent's prison officials do not contest petitioner's factual allegations, but rather state lamely that it is 'clear from the facts' that petitioner voluntarily gave up his property. And even if he did not, respondents argue that: "|

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Mr. Justice Holmes in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 470 (dissenting), called wire-tapping 'dirty business.' That decision was rendered in 1928. Since that time 'dirty business' has become the apt phrase describing the regime under which we now live. The warrant requirement which this Court imposed as a condition to that kind of surveillance, Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, and the Act of Congress which implemented that decision, 18 U.S.C. 2510-2520, United States v. United States District Court, 407 U.S. 297, have been flouted. We who live in the District of Columbia know that electronic surveillance is commonplace. I am indeed morally certain that the Conference Room of this Court has been 'bugged'; and President Johnson during his term in the White House asserted to me that even his phone was tapped. 
 We deal with a disease that has permeated our society. Certainly Ms. Heutsche is an 'aggrieved' person within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 3504(a)( 1).1 That section 
Page 414 U.S. 898 , 899
 does not restrict its protection to conversations of an accused. It should be liberally construed as it deals with the right of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment. The conversation of one's lawyer over the telephone may be as helpful to Big Brother as the conversation of the accused herself. The lawyer preparing the defense may in his telephone conversations reveal concessions made by the accused or his trial strategy or clues to the defense which will be proferred that may be extremely helpful to the prosecution. If electronic surveillance were strictly employed by the Executive Branch, we might be chary in enlarging its duties as requested here. But since we live in a regime where the 'dirty business' of wiretapping runs rampant, I would apply the statute liberally to check the disease which almost every newspaper tells us has poisoned out body politic. 
 We are told that in this case the applicant's lawyers did discuss her case with persons other than herself over the telephone. Is Big Brother to have a ringside seat where he can listen to all the confidences of lawyers who defend an accused? If so, what happens to the valued right of counsel protected by the Sixth Amendment? 
 On June 26, 1972, Margaret Heutsche, the applicant herein, was arrested by the FBI on charges relating to the removal and destruction of Government property from a Selective Service System office. Although a preliminary hearing resulted in a finding of probable cause, she remained free on her own recognizance and heard nothing further on the case until called to testify before a federal grand jury nearly a year later. When she invoked her constitutional right to refrain from testifying the Government obtained a grant of use immunity pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 6002 and an order from the District Court compelling the applicant to testify.

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 In C.C.2d 409, which was interpreted in many quarters as a prohibition on the playing of 'drug related' songs by licensees. [Footnote 1] That belief was strengthened five weeks later when the Commission's Bureau of Complaints and Compliance provided broadcasters with the names of 22 songs labelled 'drug oriented' on the basis of their lyrics.

 well. Some announcers were fired for playing suspect songs. 
 In April the Commission denied a petition for reconsideration, but attempted to 'clarify' its previous order. 32 F.C.C.2d 377. But although it repudiated the list of banned songs, it reiterated the basic threat by noting that 'the broadcaster could jeopardize his license by failing to exercise licensee responsibility in this area.' The nature of that responsibility was unclear. The new statement indicated reaffirmation of the prior decision, yet two concurring commissioners indicated that it restored the status quo to the March notice. It seems clear however that the Commission majority intended to coerce broadcasters into refusing to play songs that in the Commission's judgment were somehow 'drug related.' The April order suggested the prescreening of songs as one method of compliance. And in subsequent testimony before Congress, the Chairman of the Commission stated that if a licensee was playing songs that in the Commission's judgment 'promote the use of drugs,' 'I know what I would do, I would probably vote to take the license away.'3

 The petitioner here was convicted in district court of conspiring to transport forged securities in interstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. 2314, and of aiding and abetting the substantive crime. The trial judge's instruction to the jury did not clearly require that they find that defendant had knowledge of the interstate character of the transaction. Regardless of whether the substantive count requires such knowledge, it seems clear that

United States, 412 U.S. 837 ( 1973), we deal with an offense traditionally treated as a local law question; it becomes federal only through the nexus with interstate commerce.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 In 1969 the petitioner was indicted for obstructing an investigation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and he was convicted by a jury. Both in pre-trial motions and on appeal the defendant insisted that the Government had obtained an identical indictment in 1966 but had for some reason kept it secret, and that therefore there was a three-year post indictment delay which denied the defendant his right to a speedy trial. The Government would not confirm or deny this allegation, and the defendant was unable to produce substantiating evidence. The conviction was affirmed, the Court of Appeals concluding that in any case no prejudice was shown by the defendant. (United States v. Alo, 439 F.2d 751, 755-756 (CA2 1971).) The present proceeding arises from petitioner's motion to vacate sentence, based on newly discovered evidence confirming the petitioner's earlier suspicions and revealing motivations for the delay which the District Court found were 'unworthy and discreditable.' The motion was denied however, again for the reason that no prejudice had been shown, and the Court of Appeals again affirmed. (United States v. Alo.) 
 As revealed in part by a Justice Department memorandum made available to the District Court, the Govern- 
Page 414 U.S. 919 , 920
 ment embarked on a conscious mission to conceal the 1966 indictment to prevent disclosure of an illegal wiretap on a member of the Bar. At first the indictment was sealed. Two years later the Chief of the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division wrote a confidential memorandum to the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Division. He pointed out that the indictment was sealed because of its factual relationship to another indictment returned the same day against a Miami attorney, who had been the subject of the 'electronic surveillance.' The memorandum continued: 'Immediately after the return of the indictments, United States Attorney Morgenthau expressed great concern over the disclosure of these logs, because he did not want to spread on the record that the Department had engaged in electronic surveillance of a member of the bar. Assistant United States Attorney Givens now proposes the dismissal of the indictment as to [the attorney] and the opening of the Alo indictment . . ..' The memorandum then went to state why it might be possible to prevent disclosure of the wiretap in a prosecution of Alo, the petitioner here, an associate of the overheard attorney. 
 For reasons still unknown, the Government never did proceed with the 1966 indictment against the petitioner; instead it kept that indictment secret and proceeded with the new indictment, more than three years after the original 1966 indictment. Although the suspicions of the defense were aroused, as indicated above the Government was able to keep the earlier indictment and the embarrassing wiretaps secret throughout petitioner's trial. 
 In Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 533 ( 1972), we noted that speedy trial is 'a fundamental right of the accused' that is 'specifically affirmed in the Constitution.' In determining whether that right had been denied, we looked primarily to four factors: 'Length [414 U.S. 919 , 921]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 15, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal of California, First Appellate District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 This case involves a libel suit based on statements made in the heat of the vigorous 1966 campaign for the office of governor of California. Respondent published a poll indicating that, of the candidates in the Republican primary, petitioner was favored by only 1% of the voters. Petitioner responded by saying that he believed, based on reports from a reliable source, that the poll was corrupt, dishonest, and rigged as a result of a brible paid by one of the other candidates. Respondents instituted a libel action and recovered $300,000 in damages. 
 Respondents concede public figure status and the libel award is thus based on the 'malice' with which petitioner made the statements. See Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, 403 U.S. 29; Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130; New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254d 686. But '[t]he requirement that malice be proved provides 
Page 414 U.S. 922 , 923
 at best an evanescent protection for the right to critically discuss public affairs and certainly does not measure up to the sturdy safeguard embodied in the First Amendment.' New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra, at 293. (Black, J., concurring). In my opinion the First Amendment prohibits the use of civil libel laws to impose damages for the discussion of public affairs or criticism of public figures, and this prohibition is in no way dependent upon the results of uncertain speculation as to the 'malicious' mental state of the speaker. Freedom of speech does not admit of differentiation limiting its applicability to those possessed of judicially approved states of mind. 
 I would grant this petition and reverse the judgment below.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

 The petitioner brought this action in district court for securities fraud against Rodman & Renshaw, a registered broker dealer in securities and member firm of the New York Stock Exchange, William Rothbart, a partner in the firm, and Jordan Rothbart, William's son. After bench trial the District Court found all three defendants liable. Respondent 
Page 414 U.S. 926 , 927
 Rodman & Renshaw then appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed, 474 F.2d 32 (CA7 1973), finding no basis on which to hold Rodman liable for the concededly illegal and fraudulent scheme. 
 Both Sennott and Jordan were members of the Chicago Board of Trade, although Sennott had little experience in securities investments. They became acquainted and Jordan urged Senott to open an account at Rodman through him, saying that his father had made money for other Board of Trade members. Ultimately Sennott agreed and between 1964 and 1966 his trading volume in the accounts at Rodman was more than $2 million, 70% of which was through accounts opened by Jordan. [Footnote 1] 

 Unknown to Sennott during this period, Jordan's employment by Rodman had been terminated because of his questionable integrity, and he had no official connection with the firm after 1958. The Securities and Exchange Commission had held in a 1962 order that between 1955 1957 Jordan, while employed by another broker dealer, had violated various anti fraud provisions of the Securities Act. In 1958 his registration as a representative of a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers had been revoked because of deceptive practices. 
 In early 1964 Jordan induced Sennott to invest in a secondary offering by Skyline Homes, Inc., that Rodman was handling. Soon after Jordan encouraged him to buy additional shares of Skyline through stock options made available to William, his father, for his services in underwriting the secondary offering.

 Richard J. SENNOTT et ux.v. RODMAN & RENSHAW.No. 72 1740. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 15, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACKMUN concurs, dissenting. 
 The petitioner brought this action in district court for securities fraud against Rodman & Renshaw, a registered broker dealer in securities and member firm of the New York Stock Exchange, William Rothbart, a partner in the firm, and Jordan Rothbart, William's son. After bench trial the District Court found all three defendants liable. Respondent 
Page 414 U.S. 926 , 927
 Rodman & Renshaw then appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed, 474 F.2d 32 (CA7 1973), finding no basis on which to hold Rodman liable for the concededly illegal and fraudulent scheme. 
 Both Sennott and Jordan were members of the Chicago Board of Trade, although Sennott had little experience in securities investments. They became acquainted and Jordan urged Senott to open an account at Rodman through him, saying that his father had made money for other Board of Trade members. Ultimately Sennott agreed and between 1964 and 1966 his trading volume in the accounts at Rodman was more than $2 million, 70% of which was through accounts opened by Jordan. [Footnote 1]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 15, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal of California, Fourth Appellate District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, convicted of arson, bribery and conspiracy, argues that the introduction of incriminating extra- 
judicial statements of a codefendant when the codefendant was unavailable to testify because of his claim of Fifth Amendment privilege constituted a violation of petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. As in Dutton v. Evans, 400 U.S. 74, where this Court rejected a similar claim, I feel that the Sixth Amendment prohibits the State from putting damaging statements before the jury when the defendant has no opportunity to test those statements for truthfulness and meaning through cross-examination of the declarent. See Dutton v. Evans, supra, at 104 (Marshall, J., dissenting).[ Montoya v. California 414 U.S. 931 (1973) ]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 15, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL concurs, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Perales, originally convicted of a drug offense, successfully moved for a new trial. In the First trial the prosecutor had waived the habitual offender provision for a mandatory life sentence in exchange for the petitioner's agreement to waive his right to jury trial. On retrial, petitioner exercised his right to jury trial and the prosecutor refused to waive the habitual offender sentence enhancement provisions. As a consequence petitioner received a mandatory life sentence upon conviction. The prosecutor has stipulated that: 
Page 414 U.S. 932 , 933
 would have again waived the 'habitual count' . . ..' (R. 38, emphasis added.)
 It is well established that 'if the only objective of a state practice is to discourage the assertion of constitutional rights it is 'patently unconstitutional."" Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, 32 n. 20; Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 631; United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570, 581. 
 We thus held in United States v. Jackson, supra, that the death penalty clause in the Federal Kidnaping Statute, 18 U.S.C. 1201(a), which essentially insulated from the death penalty those defendants who waived the right to jury trial or pled guilty, imposed an impermissible burden on the exercise of Sixth Amendment rights. 
 Such express statutory schemes, however, are not the only mechanism for positing with an accused the necessity of determining whether the risk of greater punishment attending the exercise of constitutional rights makes that exercise too costly. A guilty plea constitutes a waiver of several fundamental rights, among them the right to jury trial. See Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 264 ( Douglas, J., concurring). Plea bargaining, the extreme importance of which was recognized in Santobello, leaves with the prosecutor the power to set the price for the exercise of those rights. Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, held a guilty plea voidable if induced by the prosecutor's threat to bring additional prosecutions. Yet plea bargaining would be eliminated if an accepted plea to a lesser offense was rendered constitutionally vulnerable by the prosecutor's expressed intent to otherwise proceed to trial on the crime charged.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 15, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Common Pleas of Connecticut, Appellate Division. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN concurs, dissenting. 
 In Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, we struck down a Georgia statute which provided for the suspension of the licenses of drivers involved in accidents who were uninsured and were unable to post security without any presuspension consideration of fault for the accident. Petitioner's license was suspended under an essentially identical statute, and petitioner was arrested for driving without a license, prior to our decision in Bell. During his trial, he raised Bell as a defense to the criminal charge, but the Connecticut courts rejected the defense because the events complained of, the suspension and subsequent arrest, occurred prior to Bell. Refusal to apply Bell to petitioner's case on this ground is in error in view of the fact that this Court vacated and remanded for further proceedings in light of Bell at least three lower federal court cases challenging license suspensions which had occurred prior to our 
Page 414 U.S. 934 , 935
 decision in Bell. See Gaytan v. Cassidy, 403 U.S. 902, 29 L. Ed.2d 677, vacating and remanding, 317 F.Supp. 46; Pollion v. Lewis, 403 U.S. 902, vacating and remanding, 320 F.Supp. 1343; Latham v. Tynan, 404 U.S. 807 vacating and remanding. 435 F.2d 1248. 
 The State also argues that petitioner cannot raise Bell as a defense to his criminal charge because he has chosen not to challenge his suspension by seeking available judicial review of the suspension itself, so that he has not raised his contentions in the proper state forum. Since the state court explicitly chose not to reach this argument, we need not reach it in this Court. 
 Therefore, I dissent from denial of certiorari.

 Petitioner and three friends observed a case of whiskey being placed into a truck. A short time later petitioner encouraged Richard Anderson, who had not been present to see the case being put into the vehicle, to steal the spirits. Later in the day, Anderson removed the case from the truck and gave eight bottles to one of petitioner's friends, who in turn delivered three bottles to petitioner. Petitioner was arrested and convicted in the 
Page 414 U.S. 940 , 941
 Justice of the Peace Court for Platte County, Wyoming, of the misdemeanor offense of being a minor in possession of alcoholic beverages. A few months later petitioner was charged and convicted in the District Court of Platte County with feloniously counselling and encouraging Anderson to commit grand larceny. The Supreme Court of Wyoming affirmed, rejecting petitioner's claim that the second prosecution violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy, Mullin v. State, Wyo., 505 P.2d 305 ( 1973). 
 Although both the misdemeanor and felony charges arose out of the 'same transaction or occurrence,' they were prosecuted by the State in separate proceedings. That, in my opinion, requires that we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse, for I adhere to the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v.

 Petitioner, while attempting to enter the United States at San Ysidro, California, was subjected to a vaginal search which yielded approximately one ounce of heroin and petitioner 
Page 414 U.S. 941 , 942
 was convicted of importing the substance. Conceding that the police were justified in causing her to submit to a body cavity search under the present 'clear indication' standard,1 petitioner urges the adoption of a rule that body cavity searches must be authorized by a warrant when time permits. It has long been held that the ordinary necessity for obtaining a warrant prior to a domestic search does not apply with full force to border searches. See Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 623; Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 154. But the stark contrast between permitting a minor customs official to make a warrantless search of baggage and permitting that same official to determine the instances in which intrusive and degrading vaginal and rectal searches will be conducted demonstrates the necessity for a delineation by this Court of the exact parameters of the border search exception. [Footnote 2] The record in Thompson v. United States, 9 Cir., 411 F.2d 946, 948, indicated that 80% to 85% of all those subjected to body cavity searches at the border are innocent of the suspected wrongdoing. This statistic shows the desirability of positing ultimate decision-making responsibility for this type of highly intrusive search with a 'neutral and detached magistrate' rather than a zealous officer 'engaging in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.'3

 Alvin R. MEINHOLD v. Glen C. TAYLOR et al.No. 72-6979. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 15, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Nevada. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL concurs, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was a public school teacher in Nevada. He had taught in the Clark County School District for seven years, and in his present position at one of the district's junior high schools for five years. He was notified in March 1971 that his contract would not be renewed for the following school year. The dismissal was upheld by a professional review committee after a hearing, and by by board. In affirming their actions, the Navada Supreme Court relied on the charge of 'unprofessional conduct,' which was supported solely by certain allegations concerning petitioner's views on the State's compulsory attendance laws. 
 The petitioner does not believe in compulsory attendance laws, and he did not bend his views in the hearing before the committee. He had been quoted as saying that schools are bad for children. But he never aired those views in his classroom, and he was never charged with encouraging his students to be truant. 
 We have held that teachers may not 'constitutionally be compelled to relinquish the First Amendment rights they would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on matters of public interest in connection with the operation of the public schools in which they work.' Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 568, 20 L.ed.2d 811 (1968). There we found that the school board's dismissal of a teacher for publishing a letter critical of the board's allocation of funds and its handling of a bond issue, was constitutionally impermissible. See also Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479 (1960). Just recently we 
Page 414 U.S. 943 , 944
 reaffirmed that principle, pointing out it did not rely on any contractual duties: 'For at least a quarter-century, this Court has made clear that . . . the government . . . may not deny a benefit of a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests-especially, his interest in freedom of speech.' Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972). 
 The Court below does not directly question these principles. Instead, admitting no advocacy of truancy in the classroom, it found that 'a teacher's right to teach cannot depend solely upon his conduct in the schoolroom.' It then reached into the petitioner's family relationship, justifying the dismissal because of the expression of his views on attendance laws to his children, thereby 'encouraging his daughters not to attend school.' In thus 'carrying out' his views on compulsory attendance laws the Court below found that he had forfeited his rights to employment. 
 May Pickering publish his criticisms in the local newspaper with impunity while the petitioner must keep his views secret from his children, lest they adopt them? 
 I would grant the petition for certiorari and set the case for argument.

 Alvin R. MEINHOLD v. Glen C. TAYLOR et al.No. 72-6979. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 15, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Nevada. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL concurs, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was a public school teacher in Nevada. He had taught in the Clark County School District for seven years, and in his present position at one of the district's junior high schools for five years. He was notified in March 1971 that his contract would not be renewed for the following school year. The dismissal was upheld by a professional review committee after a hearing, and by by board. In affirming their actions, the Navada Supreme Court relied on the charge of 'unprofessional conduct,' which was supported solely by certain allegations concerning petitioner's views on the State's compulsory attendance laws. 
 The petitioner does not believe in compulsory attendance laws, and he did not bend his views in the hearing before the committee. He had been quoted as saying that schools are bad for children. But he never aired those views in his classroom, and he was never charged with encouraging his students to be truant. 
 We have held that teachers may not 'constitutionally be compelled to relinquish the First Amendment rights they would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on matters of public interest in connection with the operation of the public schools in which they work.' Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 568, 20 L.ed.2d 811 (1968). There we found that the school board's dismissal of a teacher for publishing a letter critical of the board's allocation of funds and its handling of a bond issue, was constitutionally impermissible. See also Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479 (1960). Just recently we 
Page 414 U.S. 943 , 944
 reaffirmed that principle, pointing out it did not rely on any contractual duties: 'For at least a quarter-century, this Court has made clear that . . . the government . . . may not deny a benefit of a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests-especially, his interest in freedom of speech.' Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972). 
 The Court below does not directly question these principles. Instead, admitting no advocacy of truancy in the classroom, it found that 'a teacher's right to teach cannot depend solely upon his conduct in the schoolroom.' It then reached into the petitioner's family relationship, justifying the dismissal because of the expression of his views on attendance laws to his children, thereby 'encouraging his daughters not to attend school.'

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the District Court of Appeals of Florida for the Second District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
 The stay order heretofore entered by this Court on June 18, 1973, is hereby vacated.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 Convicted by a St. Petersburg Municipal Court of violating local ordinances, in removing a canvas mural from a wall inside the City Hall of St. Petersburg, Florida, and carrying the mural through the city streets, petitioner, was subsequently convicted on charges of grand larceny for the same conduct. We granted certiorari, vacated the latter judgment, and remanded for further proceedings, holding that the state appellate court erred when it ruled that a State and its municipalities were separate sovereigns for purposes of the double jeopardy provisions of the Fifth Amendment, and for that reason rejected petitioner's double jeopardy claim. Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387 (1970). On remand, the Circuit Court of Pinellas County rejected petitioner's assertion of double jeopardy on grounds-not previously reached by the state courts due to their reliance on the dual sovereignty theory-that the violations of the local ordinances and grand larceny were not the 'same offense.' The Florida District Court of Appeal, Second District, affirmed the judgment of conviction, Waller v. State, Fla.App., 270 So.2d 26 (1972), and the Florida Supreme Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari. At all times it has been conceded that the municipal and state charges arose out of the 'same transaction or occurrence.' See Waller v. Florida, supra, at 388. It is my view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the States 
Page 414 U.S. 945 , 946
 through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S. Ct. 2056 (1969), requires the prosecution, except in most limited circumstances, not present here, 'to join at one trial all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction.' Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 453- 454 (1970) (concuring opinion); see Miller v. Oregon, 405 U.S. 1047 (1972) (dissenting opinion); Harris v. Washington, 404 U.S. 55, 57 (1971) (concurring opinion); Waller v. Florida, supra, at 395 (concurring opinion). Under this 'same transaction' test, all charges against petitioner should have been brought in a single prosecution, unless this case fell within one of the test's exceptions. See, e. g., Ashe v. Swenson, supra, at 453 n. 7, 455 n. 11. I would therefore grant the petition for certiorari and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views expressed in my concurrence in Ashe v.

No. 72-77
Argued February 20-21, 1973
Decided June 25, 1973
413 U.S. 455

Syllabus 
A three-judge District Court sustained the validity of a Mississippi statutory program, begun in 1940, under which textbooks are purchased by the State and lent to students in both public and private schools, without reference to whether any participating private school has racially discriminatory policies.  The number of private secular schools in Mississippi, with a virtually all-white student population, has greatly increased in recent years.
Held:
1. Private schools have the right to exist and to operate, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, but the State is not required by the Equal Protection Clause to provide assistance to private schools equivalent to that it provides to public schools without regard to whether the private schools discriminate on racial grounds.  Pp.  413 U. S. 461-463.
2. Free textbooks, like tuition grants directed to students in private schools, are a form of tangible financial assistance benefiting the schools themselves, and the State's constitutional obligation requires it to avoid not only operating the old dual system of racially segregated schools but also providing tangible aid to schools that practice racial or other invidious discrimination.  Pp.  413 U. S. 463-468.
3. Assistance carefully limited so as to avoid the prohibitions of the ""effect"" and ""entanglement"" tests may be confined to the secular functions of sectarian schools and does not substantially promote the religious mission of those schools in violation of the Establishment Clause.  In this case, however, the legitimate educational function of private discriminatory schools cannot be isolated from their alleged discriminatory practices; discriminatory treatment exerts a pervasive influence on the entire educational process.  Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483.  The Establishment Clause permits a greater degree of state assistance to sectarian schools than may be given to private schools which engage in discriminatory practices.  Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U. S. 1, and Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, distinguished.  Pp.  413 U. S. 468-470. 
Page 413 U. S. 456

4. Proper injunctive relief can be granted without implying that all the private schools alleged to be receiving textbook aid have restrictive admission policies.  The District Court can direct appellees to submit for approval a certification procedure whereby schools may apply for textbooks on behalf of pupils, affirmatively declaring admission policies and practices, and stating the number of their racially and religiously identifiable minority students, and other relevant data. Certification of eligibility will be subject to judicial re.view.  Pp.  413 U. S. 470-471.
340 F.Supp. 1003, vacated and remanded.

The New York Legislature appropriated $28,000,000 to reimburse nonpublic schools in the State
""for expenses of services for examination and inspection in connection with administration, grading and the compiling and reporting of the results of tests and examinations, maintenance of records of pupil enrollment and reporting thereon, maintenance of pupil health records, recording of personnel qualifications and characteristics and the preparation and submission to the state of various other reports. . . .""
Tests and examinations, the most expensive of these mandated services, are of two kinds:  (a) state-prepared tests, such as ""Regents examinations"" and ""Pupil Evaluation Program Tests,"" and (b) traditional teacher-prepared tests, which constitute the overwhelming majority of tests in nonpublic schools.  Qualifying schools receive annually, per pupil, $27 (grades one through six) and $45 (grades seven through 12), and are not required to account for the moneys received and how they are spent.  While the Act states that it shall not be construed to authorize payments for religious worship or instruction, church-sponsored schools are eligible to receive payments thereunder.  The three-judge District Court found the Act unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause and permanently enjoined its enforcement.  The court rejected appellants' argument that payments are made only for ""secular, neutral, or nonideological"" services.  The court held that the greatest portion of the funds is paid for the services of teachers in testing students and that testing is an integral part of the teaching process.  The court dismissed as ""fanciful"" the contention that a State may reimburse church-related schools for costs incurred in performing any service ""mandated"" by state law.
Held:

1. The statute constitutes an impermissible aid to religion contravening the Establishment Clause, since no attempt is made and no means are available to assure that internally prepared tests, which are ""an integral part of the teaching process,"" are free of religious instruction and avoid inculcating students in the religious precepts of the sponsoring church. Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, post, p.  413 U. S. 756.  Pp.  413 U. S. 479-481.
2.

No. 71-1043
Argued November 14, 1972
Decided June 25, 1973
413 U.S. 483

Syllabus 
Petitioner was manager of a movie theater where a sexually explicit film was exhibited.  After police officers saw part of the film, an assistant district attorney requested a New York Criminal Court judge to view it.  Upon seeing the entire performance, the judge signed warrants for seizure of the film and for petitioner's arrest on the ground that the film was obscene.  Exhibition of an obscene film violates New York Penal Law  235.05.  No pretrial motion was made for return of the single film copy seized or for its suppression as evidence.  There was no showing below that the seizure prevented exhibition of the film by use of another copy, and the record does not indicate whether another copy was available.  Petitioner's trial was held 47 days after his arrest and the film seizure, and he was convicted.  He argued that seizure of the film without a prior adversary hearing violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  He also challenged his conviction on substantive grounds, arguing that he was convicted under standards of obscenity both overbroad and unconstitutionally vague, and that films shown only to consenting adults in private are constitutionally protected.  The New York Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction, holding that an adversary hearing prior to seizure of the film was not required and that an ex parte warrant, issued after a judicial determination of obscenity, was constitutionally sufficient.
Held:
1. Where a film is seized for the bona fide purpose of preserving it as evidence in a criminal proceeding, and it is seized pursuant to a warrant issued after a determination of probable obscenity by a neutral magistrate, and following the seizure a prompt judicial determination of the obscenity issue in an adversary proceeding is available at the request of any interested party, the seizure is constitutionally permissible.  On a showing to the trial court that other copies of the film are not available for exhibition, the court should permit the seized film to be copied so that exhibition can be continued pending judicial resolution of the obscenity issue in an adversary proceeding.  Otherwise, the film must be returned.  
Page 413 U. S. 484
 With such safeguards, a pre-seizure adversary hearing is not mandated by the First Amendment.  Pp.  413 U. S. 488-493.
2. The case is remanded to afford the state courts an opportunity to reconsider petitioner's substantive challenges in light of Miller v. California, ante, p.  413 U. S. 15, and Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, ante, p.  413 U. S. 49, which establish guidelines for the lawful state regulation of obscene material.  P.  413 U. S. 494.

413 U.S. 496

Syllabus 
A county sheriff viewed a sexually explicit film at a local drive-in theater.  At the conclusion of the showing, he arrested petitioner, the theater manager, for exhibiting an obscene film in violation of Kentucky law, and seized, without a warrant, one copy of the film for use as evidence.  There was no prior judicial determination of obscenity.  Petitioner's motion to suppress the film as evidence on the ground of illegal seizure was denied, and he was convicted.  The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the concededly obscene film was properly seized incident to a lawful arrest.
Held:  The seizure by the sheriff, without the authority of a constitutionally sufficient warrant, was unreasonable under Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment standards.  The seizure is not unreasonable simply because it would have been easy to secure a warrant, but rather because prior restraint of the right of expression, whether by books or films, calls for a higher hurdle in the evaluation of reasonableness.  Lee Art Theatre v. Virginia, 392 U. S. 636; Marcus v. Search Warrant, 367 U. S. 717.

413 U.S. 508

Syllabus 
Appellees challenge the constitutionality of  5(b) of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, as amended in 1971, providing that
""[a]ny household which includes a member who has reached his eighteenth birthday and who is claimed as a dependent child for Federal income tax purposes by a taxpayer who is not a member of an eligible household, shall be ineligible to participate in any food stamp program . . . during the tax period such dependency is claimed and for a period of one year after the expiration of such tax period.""
This provision was generated by congressional concern over nonneedy households participating in the food stamp program, and abuses of the program by ""college students"" and ""children of wealthy parents.""  The District Court held the provision unconstitutional, finding that it went far beyond the congressional goal, and operated inflexibly to deny stamps to households, containing no college students, that had established clear eligibility for stamps and remained in dire need, only because a member of the household 18 years or older is claimed by someone as a tax dependent.
Held:   The tax deduction taken for the benefit of the parent in a prior year is not a rational measure of the need of a different household with which the child of the tax deducting parent lives, and the administration of the Act allows no hearing to show that the tax deduction is irrelevant to the need of the household.

Syllabus 
Section 3(e) of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, as amended in 1971, generally excludes from participation in the food stamp program any household containing an individual who is unrelated to any other household member.  The Secretary of Agriculture issued regulations thereunder rendering ineligible for participation in the program any ""household"" whose members are not ""all related to each other.""  Congress stated that the purposes of the Act were
""to safeguard the health and wellbeing of the Nation's population and raise levels of nutrition among low income households . . . [and] that increased utilization of food in establishing and maintaining adequate national levels of nutrition will promote the distribution . . . of our agricultural abundance and will strengthen cur agricultural economy. . . .""
The District Court held that the ""unrelated person"" provision of  3(e) creates an irrational classification in violation of the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Held:   The legislative classification here involved cannot be sustained, the classification being clearly irrelevant to the stated purposes of the Act and not rationally furthering any other legitimate governmental interest.  In practical operation, the Act excludes not those who are ""likely to abuse the program,"" but, rather, only those who so desperately need aid that they cannot even afford to alter their living arrangements so as to retain their eligibility.

Syllabus 
Some individual federal employees, an employees' union, and certain local Democratic and Republican political committees filed this action challenging as unconstitutional on its face the prohibition in  9(a) of the Hatch Act, 5 U.S.C.  7324(a)(2), against federal employees' taking ""an active part in political management or in political campaigns.""  The section defines the phrase as
""those acts of political management or political campaigning which were prohibited on the part of employees in the competitive service before July 19, 1940, by determinations of the Civil Service Commission under the rules prescribed by the President.""
The three-judge District Court recognized the ""well established governmental interest in restricting political activities by federal employees,"" but held that the statutory definition of ""political activity,"" the constitutionality of which was left open in United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, was vague and overbroad, and thus unconstitutional.
Held:
1. The holding of Mitchell, supra, that federal employees can be prevented from holding a party office, working at the polls, and acting as party paymaster for other party workers is reaffirmed.  Congress can also constitutionally forbid federal employees from engaging in plainly identifiable acts of political management and political campaigning, such as organizing a political party or club; actively participating in fund-raising activities for a partisan candidate or political party; becoming a partisan candidate for, or campaigning for, an elective public office; actively managing the campaign of a partisan candidate for public office; initiating or circulating a partisan nominating petition or soliciting votes for a partisan candidate for public office; or serving as a delegate, alternate, or proxy to a political party convention.  Pp.  413 U. S. 554-567.
2. It is the Civil Service Commission's regulations regarding political activity, the legitimate descendants of the 1940 restatement adopted by the Congress, and, in most respects the reflection

(b) There is nothing fatally overbroad about the statute considered in connection with the Civil Service Commission's construction of its terms represented by the current regulations.  The restrictions on endorsements in advertisements, broadcasts, and literature, and on speaking at political party meetings in support of partisan candidates for public or party office, the major areas of difficulty, are clearly stated, are normally performed only in the context of partisan campaigns by one taking an active role in them, and are sustainable just as the other acts of political campaigning are constitutionally proscribable.

No. 71-1639
Argued March 26, 1973
Decided June 25, 1973
413 U.S. 601

Syllabus 
Appellants, state employees charged by the Oklahoma State Personnel Board with actively engaging in partisan political activities (including the solicitation of money) among their coworkers for the benefit of their superior, in alleged violation of  818 of the state merit system Act, brought this suit challenging the Act's validity on the grounds that two of its paragraphs are invalid because of overbreadth and vagueness.  One paragraph provides that no classified service employee
""shall directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, or in any manner be concerned in soliciting or receiving any assessment . . . or contribution for any political organization, candidacy or other political purpose.""
The other provides that no such employee shall belong to ""any national, state or local committee of a political party"" or be an officer or member of a committee or a partisan political club, or a candidate for any paid public office, or take part in the management or affairs of any political party or campaign ""except to exercise his right as a citizen privately to express his opinion and . . . vote.""  The District Court upheld the provisions.
Held:  Section 818 of the Oklahoma statute is not unconstitutional on its face.  CSC v. Letter Carriers, ante, p.  413 U. S. 548.  Pp.  413 U. S. 607-618.
(a) The statute, which gives adequate warning of what activities it proscribes and sets forth explicit standards for those who must apply it, is not impermissibly vague.  Pp.  413 U. S. 607-608.
(b) Although appellants contend that the statute reaches activities that are constitutionally protected as well as those that are not, it is clearly constitutional as applied to the conduct with which they are charged, and, because it is not substantially overbroad, they cannot challenge the statute on the ground that it might be applied unconstitutionally to others, in situations not before the Court.  Appellants' conduct falls squarely within the proscriptions of  818, which deals with activities that the State has ample power to regulate, United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75; 
Page 413 U. S. 602

			"|"Broadrick v. Oklahoma
No. 71-1639
Argued March 26, 1973
Decided June 25, 1973
413 U.S. 601

Syllabus 
Appellants, state employees charged by the Oklahoma State Personnel Board with actively engaging in partisan political activities (including the solicitation of money) among their coworkers for the benefit of their superior, in alleged violation of  818 of the state merit system Act, brought this suit challenging the Act's validity on the grounds that two of its paragraphs are invalid because of overbreadth and vagueness.  One paragraph provides that no classified service employee
""shall directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, or in any manner be concerned in soliciting or receiving any assessment . . . or contribution for any political organization, candidacy or other political purpose.""
The other provides that no such employee shall belong to ""any national, state or local committee of a political party"" or be an officer or member of a committee or a partisan political club, or a candidate for any paid public office, or take part in the management or affairs of any political party or campaign ""except to exercise his right as a citizen privately to express his opinion and . . . vote.""  The District Court upheld the provisions.
Held:  Section 818 of the Oklahoma statute is not unconstitutional on its face.  CSC v. Letter Carriers, ante, p.  413 U. S. 548.  Pp.  413 U. S. 607-618.
(a) The statute, which gives adequate warning of what activities it proscribes and sets forth explicit standards for those who must apply it, is not impermissibly vague.  Pp.  413 U. S. 607-608.
(b) Although appellants contend that the statute reaches activities that are constitutionally protected as well as those that are not, it is clearly constitutional as applied to the conduct with which they are charged, and, because it is not substantially overbroad, they cannot challenge the statute on the ground that it might be applied unconstitutionally to others, in situations not before the Court.  Appellants' conduct falls squarely within the proscriptions of  818, which deals with activities that the State has ample power to regulate, United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75;

Syllabus 
Section 53 of the New York Civil Service Law provides that only United States citizens may hold permanent positions in the competitive class of the state civil service.  The District Court concluded that the statute was violative of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause, and granted injunctive relief.
Held:
1. Section 53 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment since, in the context of New York's statutory civil service scheme, it sweeps indiscriminately, and is not narrowly limited to the accomplishment of substantial state interests.  Pp.  413 U. S. 638-643.
2. The ""special public interest"" doctrine has no applicability in this case.  Pp.  413 U. S. 643-645.

4. While the State has an interest in defining its political community, and a corresponding interest in establishing the qualifications for persons holding state elective or important nonelective executive, legislative, and judicial positions, the broad citizenship requirement established by  53 cannot be justified on this basis.

Decided June 25, 1973*
413 U.S. 665

Syllabus 
In No. 71-6314, petitioner was tried by court-martial and convicted of rape.  His conviction was affirmed by the Air Force Board of Review, and the Court of Military Appeals denied a petition for review.  At no time during the trial and review proceedings did petitioner question the jurisdiction of the military tribunal.  Thereafter, following the decision in O'Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258 (holding that, when a serviceman is charged with a crime that is not ""service connected"" he is entitled to indictment by a grand jury and trial by jury in a civilian court), petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court which was denied, the court concluding that the standards promulgated in Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293, precluded retroactive application of O'Callahan.  On appeal, in face of the Government's concession that the offense was not service connected, the Court of Appeals affirmed.  In No. 71-1398, respondent, while absent without leave in 1944, was apprehended in Pennsylvania while in an automobile stolen in New Jersey.  He was tried by court-martial in New York on charges of unauthorized absence from his duty station during wartime and theft of an automobile from a civilian.  He pleaded guilty, and after serving two years' confinement was dishonorably discharged in 1946.  He instituted suit in 1970, relying on O'Callahan, seeking to compel the Secretary of the Navy to overturn his court-martial conviction for auto theft and to correct his military records with respect to his dishonorable discharge.  The District Court held that the car theft was not service connected in the O'Callahan sense and that O'Callahan was to be applied retroactively.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment in No. 71-6314 is affirmed, and the judgment in No. 71-1398 is reversed.  Pp.  413 U. S. 672-693.

No. 71-6314, 450 F.2d 753, affirmed; No. 71-1398, 458 F.2d 544, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that:
1. The question in O'Callahan was the appropriateness of the exercise of jurisdiction by a military forum, pursuant to an Act of Congress, over a nonservice-connected offense when balanced against the guarantees of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  Pp.  413 U. S. 672-678.
2. Application of the three-pronged test of Stovall v. Denno, supra,
""(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards,""
requires that O'Callahan be accorded prospective effect only.  Pp.  413 U. S. 678-685.
3. Respondent's claim in No. 71-1398 that he was deprived of the right to trial in the vicinage, as guaranteed by Art. III,  2, cl. 3, not raised before the military court, lacks merit.  General court-martial jurisdiction, derived from Art. I, is not restricted territorially to a particular State or district; the vicinage requirement has primary relevance to trial by jury; and respondent has not demonstrated prejudice.  Pp.  413 U. S. 685-686.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concluded, in No. 71-6314, that the case should be reargued on the question whether the ""jurisdiction"" of the military tribunal, not having been initially contested, had become res judicata; and in No. 71-1398, that respondent committed a ""service-connected"" crime.  Pp.  413 U. S. 686-691.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST concluded, in No. 71-6314, that, although the prior Court decisions do not support the holding that O'Callahan should not be applied retroactively, O'Callahan was wrongly decided, and should be overruled, and, in No. 71-1398, that any crime committed by a serviceman during the time of declared war is ""service-connected,"" and that he can be validly tried by court-martial for that offense.  P.  413 U. S. 692.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART concluded, in No. 71-1398, that respondent, a serviceman who deserted his post during a time of congressionally declared war and stole an automobile was guilty of a ""service-connected"" offense and was properly tried before a court-martial under O'Callahan.  P.  413 U. S. 693.

Syllabus 
In this action for injunctive and declaratory relief appellant challenges the South Carolina Educational Facilities Authority Act as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment insofar as it authorizes a proposed financing transaction involving the issuance of revenue bonds benefiting a Baptist controlled college.  The Act establishes an Educational Facilities Authority to assist (through the issuance of revenue bonds) higher educational institutions in constructing and financing projects, such as buildings, facilities, and site preparation, but not including any facility for sectarian instruction or religious worship.  Neither the State nor the Authority is obligated, directly or indirectly, to pay the principal of or interest on the bonds; nor is the State's taxing power pledged or implicated.  All expenses of the Authority also must be paid solely from the revenues of the projects.  The Authority gave preliminary approval to an application submitted by the college, only 60% of whose students are Baptists.  As subsequently modified, the application requests the issuance of revenue bonds to be used for refinancing capital improvements and completing the dining hall.  Under the statutory scheme, the project would be conveyed to the Authority, which would lease it back to the college, with reconveyance to the college on full payment of the bonds.  The lease agreement would contain a clause obligating the institution to observe the Act's restrictions on sectarian use and enabling the Authority to conduct inspections.  The provision for reconveyance would restrict the project to nonsectarian use.  The trial court denied appellant relief, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.  After this Court had vacated the judgment and remanded the case for reconsideration in the light of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, and other intervening decisions, the State Supreme Court adhered to its earlier decision.
Held:  The Act as construed by the South Carolina Supreme Court does not, under the guidelines of Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra, at  403 U. S. 612-613, violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  413 U. S. 741-749.
(a) The purpose of the Act is secular, the benefits of the statute being available to all institutions of higher education in the 
Page 413 U. S. 735
 State, whether or not they have a religious affiliation.  Pp.  413 U. S. 741-742.
(b) The statute does not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.  The college involved has no significant sectarian orientation, and the project must be confined to a secular purpose, with the lease agreement, enforced by inspection provisions, forbidding religious use.  Pp.  413 U. S. 742-745.
(c) The statute does not foster an excessive entanglement with religion.  The record here does not show that religion so permeates the college that inspection by the Authority to insure that the project is not used for religious purposes would necessarily lead to such entanglement.  The Authority's statutory power to participate in certain management decisions also does not have that effect, in view of the narrow construction by the State Supreme Court, limiting such power to insuring that the college's fees suffice to meet bond payments.  Absent default, the lease agreement would leave full responsibility with the college regarding fees and general operations.  Pp.  413 U. S. 745-749.

The first section provides for direct money grants to ""qualifying"" nonpublic schools to be used for ""maintenance and repair"" of facilities and equipment to ensure the students' ""health, welfare and safety.""  A ""qualifying"" school is a nonpublic, nonprofit elementary or secondary school serving a high concentration of pupils from low income families.  The annual grant is $30 per pupil, or $40 if the facilities are more than 25 years old, which may not exceed 50% of the average per-pupil cost for equivalent services in the public schools.  Legislative findings concluded that the State ""has a primary responsibility to ensure the health, welfare and safety of children attending . . . nonpublic schools""; that the
""fiscal crisis in nonpublic education . . . has caused a diminution of proper maintenance and repair programs, threatening the health, welfare and safety of nonpublic school children""
in low income urban areas; and that ""a healthy and safe school environment"" contributes ""to the stability of urban neighborhoods.""  Section 2 establishes a tuition reimbursement plan for parents of children attending nonpublic elementary or secondary schools.  To qualify, a parent's annual taxable income must be less than $5,000.  The amount of reimbursement is $50 per grade school child and $100 per high school student so long as those amounts do not exceed 50% of actual tuition paid.  The legislature 
Page 413 U. S. 757
 found that the right to select among alternative educational systems should be available in a pluralistic society, and that any sharp decline in nonpublic school pupils would massively increase public school enrollment and costs, seriously jeopardizing quality education for all children.  Reiterating a declaration contained in the first section, the findings concluded that ""such assistance is clearly secular, neutral and nonideological.""  The third program, contained in  3, 4, and 5 of the challenged law, is designed to give tax relief to parents failing to qualify for tuition reimbursement.  Each eligible taxpayer-parent is entitled to deduct a stipulated sum from his adjusted gross income for each child attending a nonpublic school.  The amount of the deduction is unrelated to the amount of tuition actually paid, and decreases as the amount of taxable income increases.  These sections are also prefaced by a series of legislative findings similar to those accompanying the previous sections.  Almost 20% of the State's students, some 700,000 to 800,000, attend nonpublic schools, approximately 85% of which are church-affiliated.  While practically all the schools entitled to receive maintenance and repair grants ""are related to the Roman Catholic Church and teach Catholic religious doctrine to some degree,"" institutions qualifying under the remainder of the statute include a substantial number of other church-affiliated schools.  The District Court held that  1, the maintenance and repair grants, and  2, the tuition reimbursement grants, were invalid, but that the income tax provisions of  3, 4, and 5 did not violate the Establishment Clause.
Held:
1. The propriety of a legislature's purpose may not immunize from further scrutiny a law that either has a primary effect that advances religion or fosters excessive church-state entanglements.  Pp.  413 U. S. 772-774.
2. The maintenance and repair provisions of the New York statute violate the Establishment Clause because their inevitable effect is to subsidize and advance the religious mission of sectarian schools.  Those provisions do not properly guarantee the secularity of state aid by limiting the percentage of assistance to 50% of comparable aid to public schools.  Such statistical assurances fail to provide an adequate guarantee that aid will not be utilized to advance the religious activities of sectarian schools.  Pp.  413 U. S. 774-780.
3. The tuition reimbursement grants, if given directly to sectarian schools, would similarly violate the Establishment Clause, and the fact that they are delivered to the parents, rather than the schools, does not compel a contrary result, as the effect of the aid 
Page 413 U. S. 758
 is unmistakably to provide financial support for nonpublic, sectarian institutions.  Pp.  413 U. S. 780-789.
(a) The fact that the grant is given as reimbursement for tuition already paid, and that the recipient is not required to spend the amount received on education, does not alter the effect of the law.  Pp.  413 U. S. 785-787.
(b) The argument that the statute provides ""a statistical guarantee of neutrality,"" since the tuition reimbursement is only 15% of the educational costs in nonpublic schools and the compulsory education laws require more than 15% of school time to be devoted to secular courses, is merely another variant of the argument rejected as to maintenance and repair costs.  Pp.  413 U. S. 787-788.
(c) The State must maintain an attitude of ""neutrality,"" neither ""advancing"" nor ""inhibiting"" religion, and it cannot, by designing a program to promote the free exercise of religion, erode the limitations of the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  413 U. S. 788-789.
4. The system of providing income tax benefits to parents of children attending New York's nonpublic schools also violates the Establishment Clause because, like the tuition reimbursement program, it is not sufficiently restricted to assure that it will not have the impermissible effect of advancing the sectarian activities of religious schools.  Walz v. Tax Comm'n, 397 U. S. 664, distinguished.  Pp.  413 U. S. 789-794.
5. Because the challenged sections have the impermissible effect of advancing religion, it is not necessary to consider whether such aid would yield an entanglement with religion.  But it should be noted that, apart from any administrative entanglement of the State in particular religious programs, assistance of the sort involved here carries grave potential for entanglement in the broader sense of continuing and expanding political strife over aid to religion.  Pp.  413 U. S. 794-798.

413 U.S. 825

Syllabus 
Subsequent to Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, Pennsylvania enacted the ""Parent Reimbursement Act for Nonpublic Education,"" providing funds to reimburse parents for a portion of tuition expenses incurred in sending their children to nonpublic schools.  The three-judge District Court held that the law violated the Establishment Clause, granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and permanently enjoined disbursement of any funds under the Act.  The Court also indicated that
""more than 900 of the children attending nonpublic schools in . . . Pennsylvania are enrolled in schools that are controlled by religious organizations or that have the purpose of propagating and promoting religious faith,""
and ruled that the Act could not properly be viewed as containing a separable provision for aid to parents whose children attended nonsectarian, nonpublic schools.
Held:
1. There is no constitutionally significant difference between Pennsylvania's tuition grant scheme, with its intended consequence of preserving and supporting religion-oriented institutions, and New York's tuition reimbursement program held violative of the Establishment Clause in Committee for Public Education & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, ante, p.  413 U. S. 756.  Pp.  413 U. S. 828-833.
2. The Act is not severable, but even if it were clearly severable, valid aid to nonpublic, nonsectarian schools can provide no basis for sustaining aid to sectarian schools.

 June 25, 1973
 The judgment is vacated and the case remanded to the United States District Court for the District of Idaho for further consideration in light of Mahan v. Howell, 410 U.S. 315 (1973 ); Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735 (1973), and White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755 (1973).
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting. 
 This case should be affirmed. The jurisdictional statement fails to identify any substantial factual or legal error committed by the District Court and does not warrant a remand for further consideration in the light of recently decided reapportionment cases. 
 Appellant complains of a maximum total deviation of 19.41% from the ideal population figure, resulting from one district allegedly being 10.62% overrepresented and 
Page 413 U.S. 906 , 907
 another 8.79% underrepresented (appellant asserts the deviations actually were 10.57% overrepresentation and 8.88% underrepresentation, with a total variation of 19.45%). The jurisdictional statement asserts that the 10.62% overrepresentation exists in District No. 20 and that it was sought to be justified by the State on the grounds that the population of Mountain Home Air Force Base, located in the District, had increased by 2,000 since the 1970 census, that an irrigation project would cause further population growth in the District and that detaching certain areas from a particular county was undesirable. 
 The appellant asserts, in conclusory manner, that 'the population growth at Mountain Home Air Force Base is disputed' and that 'the anticipated growth in population was not projected with a high degree of accuracy.' The District Court, however, accepted the justification, specifically referring to increases in population as being among the justifications offered for various population deviations. 342 F.Supp. 288, 289 (1972). In any event, I find no basis in the jurisdictional statement for our disagreeing with the District Court or with the legislature. If there had been a 2,000 increase in population since 1972 the legislature was quite right in taking it into account, and the alleged deviation disappears. Also, if population increases were correctly anticipated, they need not have been ignored. 
 The alleged underrepresentation is claimed to exist in District No. 28 because of improper exclusion from the population count of 'out-of- state and foreign students' attending a private college within the District. Appellant complains that there should have been more effort to determine whether each individual student so excluded had in fact satisfied the residence requirements for voting.

No. 71-1553
Argued March 19, 1973
Decided June 21, 1973
413 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Respondents filed this action on behalf of themselves and all other students at a state university, claiming that, during a period of civil disorder on the campus in May, 1970, the National Guard, called by the Governor to preserve order, violated students' rights of speech and assembly and caused injury and death to some students.  They sought injunctive relief to restrain the Governor in the future from prematurely ordering Guard troops to duty in civil disorders and an injunction to restrain Guard leaders from future violation of students' rights.  They also sought a declaratory judgment that  2923.55 of the Ohio Revised Code is unconstitutional.  The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal with respect to both injunctive relief against the Governor's ""premature"" employment of the Guard and the validity of the state statute, but held that the complaint stated a cause of action with respect to one issue, which was remanded to the District Court with directions to resolve the question whether there was and is
""a pattern of training, weaponry and orders in the Ohio National Guard which . . . require . . . the use of fatal force in suppressing 
Page 413 U. S. 2
 civilian disorders when the total circumstances are such that nonlethal force would suffice to restore order. . . .""
Since the complaint was filed, the named respondents have left the university; the officials originally named as defendants no longer hold offices in which they can exercise authority over the Guard; the Guard has adopted new and substantially different ""use of force"" rules; and the civil disorder training of Guard recruits has been revised.
Held:
1. The case is resolved on the basis of whether the claims alleged in the complaint, as narrowed by the Court of Appeals' remand, are justiciable, rather than on possible mootness.  Pp.  413 U. S. 5.
2. No justiciable controversy is presented in this case, as the relief sought by respondents, requiring initial judicial review and continuing judicial surveillance over the training, weaponry, and standing orders of the National Guard, embraces critical areas of responsibility vested by the Constitution, see Art. I,  8, cl. 16, in the Legislative and Executive Branches of the Government.  Pp.  413 U. S. 5-12.

Reargued November 7, 1972
Decided June 21, 1973
413 U.S. 15

Syllabus 
Appellant was convicted of mailing unsolicited sexually explicit material in violation of a California statute that approximately incorporated the obscenity test formulated in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413,  383 U. S. 418 (plurality opinion).  The trial court instructed the jury to evaluate the materials by the contemporary community standards of California.  Appellant's conviction was affirmed on appeal.  In lieu of the obscenity criteria enunciated by the Memoirs plurality, it is held:
1. Obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment.  Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, reaffirmed.  A work may be subject to state regulation where that work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in sex; portrays, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and, taken as a whole, does not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.  Pp.  413 U. S. 23-24.
2. The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be:  (a) whether ""the average person, applying contemporary community standards"" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, Roth, supra, at  354 U. S. 489, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.  If a state obscenity law is thus limited, First Amendment values are adequately protected by ultimate independent appellate review of constitutional claims when necessary.  Pp.  413 U. S. 24-25.
3. The test of ""utterly without redeeming social value"" articulated in Memoirs, supra, is rejected as a constitutional standard.  Pp.  413 U. S. 24-25.
4. The jury may measure the essentially factual issues of prurient appeal and patent offensiveness by the standard that prevails in the forum community, and need not employ a ""national standard.""  Pp.  413 U. S. 30-34.

No. 71-1051
Argued October 19, 1972
Decided June 21, 1973
413 U.S. 49

Syllabus 
Respondents sued under Georgia civil law to enjoin the exhibiting by petitioners of two allegedly obscene films.  There was no prior restraint.  In a jury-waived trial, the trial court (which did not require ""expert"" affirmative evidence of obscenity) viewed the films and thereafter dismissed the complaints on the ground that the display of the films in commercial theaters to consenting adult audiences (reasonable precautions having been taken to exclude minors) was ""constitutionally permissible.""  The Georgia Supreme Court reversed, holding that the films constituted ""hard core"" pornography not within the protection of the First Amendment.
Held:
1. Obscene material is not speech entitled to First Amendment protection.  Miller v. California, ante p.  413 U. S. 15; Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476.  P.  413 U. S. 54.
2. The Georgia civil procedure followed here (assuming use of a constitutionally acceptable standard for determining what is unprotected by the First Amendment) comported with the standards of Teitel Film Corp. v. Cusack, 390 U. S. 139; Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51; and Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown, 354 U. S. 436.  Pp.  413 U. S. 54-55.
3. It was not error to fail to require expert affirmative evidence of the films' obscenity, since the films (which were the best evidence of what they depicted) were themselves placed in evidence.  P.  413 U. S. 56.
4. States have a legitimate interest in regulating commerce in obscene material and its exhibition in places of public accommodation, including ""adult"" theaters.  Pp.  413 U. S. 57-69.
(a) There is a proper state concern with safeguarding against crime and the other arguably ill effects of obscenity by prohibiting the public or commercial exhibition of obscene material.  Though conclusive proof is lacking, the States may reasonably determine that a nexus does or might exist between antisocial behavior and obscene material, just as States have acted on unprovable assumptions in other areas of public control.  Pp.  413 U. S. 57-63.
(b) Though States are free to adopt a laissez-faire policy toward commercialized obscenity, they are not constitutionally obliged to do so.  P.  413 U. S. 64. 
Page 413 U. S. 50

(c) Exhibition of obscene material in places of public accommodation is not protected by any constitutional doctrine of privacy.  A commercial theater cannot be equated with a private home; nor is there here a privacy right arising from a special relationship, such as marriage.  Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557; Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, distinguished.  Nor can the privacy of the home be equated with a ""one"" of ""privacy"" that follows a consumer of obscene materials wherever he goes.  United States v. Orito, post, p.  413 U. S. 139; United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, post, p. 123.  Pp.  413 U. S. 65-67.
(d) Preventing the unlimited display of obscene material is not thought control.  Pp.  413 U. S. 67-68.
(e) Not all conduct directly involving ""consenting adults"" only has a claim to constitutional protection.  Pp.  413 U. S. 68-69.
5. The Georgia obscenity laws involved herein should now be reevaluated in the light of the First Amendment standards newly enunciated by the Court in Miller v. California, ante, p. 15.  Pp.  413 U. S. 69-70.

No. 71-1422
Argued October 19, 1972
Decided June 21, 1973
413 U.S. 115

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a proprietor of an ""adult"" bookstore, was convicted of violating a California obscenity statute by selling a plain-covered unillustrated book containing repetitively descriptive material of an explicitly sexual nature.  Both sides offered testimony as to the nature and content of the book, but there was no ""expert"" testimony that the book was ""utterly without redeeming social importance.""  The trial court used a state community standard in applying and construing the statute.  The appellate court, affirming, held that the book was not protected by the First Amendment.
Held:
1. Obscene material in book form is not entitled to First Amendment protection merely because it has no pictorial content.  A State may control commerce in such a book, even distribution to consenting adults, to avoid the deleterious consequences it can reasonably conclude (conclusive proof is not required) result from the continuing circulation of obscene literature.  See Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, ante p.  413 U. S. 49.  Pp.  413 U. S. 118-120.
2. Appraisal of the nature of the book by ""the contemporary community standards of the State of California"" was an adequate basis for establishing whether the book here involved was obscene.   See Miller v. California, ante, p.  413 U. S. 15.  P.  413 U. S. 121.
3. When, as in this case, material is itself placed in evidence, ""expert"" state testimony as to its allegedly obscene nature, or other ancillary evidence of obscenity, is not constitutionally required.  Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, supra.  P.  413 U. S. 121.

Appellee was charged with knowingly transporting obscene material by common carrier in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1462.  The District Court granted his motion to dismiss, holding the statute unconstitutionally overbroad for failing to distinguish between public and nonpublic transportation.  Appellee relies on Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557.
Held:   Congress has the power to prevent obscene material, which is not protected by the First Amendment, from entering the stream of commerce.  The zone of privacy that Stanley protected does not extend beyond the home.  See United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, ante p.  413 U. S. 123; Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, ante, p.  413 U.

No. 71-507
Argued October 12, 1972
Decided June 21, 1973
413 U.S. 189

Syllabus 
Petitioners sought desegregation of the Park Hill area schools in Denver and, upon securing an order of the District Court directing that relief, expanded their suit to secure desegregation of the remaining schools of the Denver school district, particularly those in the core city area.  The District Court denied the further relief, holding that the deliberate racial segregation of the Park Hill schools did not prove a like segregation policy addressed specifically to the core city schools and requiring petitioners to prove de jure segregation for each area that they sought to have desegregated.  That court nevertheless found that the segregated core city schools were educationally inferior to ""white"" schools elsewhere in the district and, relying on Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, ordered the respondents to provide substantially equal facilities for those schools.  This latter relief was reversed by the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Park Hill ruling and agreed that Park Hill segregation, even though deliberate, proved nothing regarding an overall policy of segregation.
Held:
1. The District Court, for purposes of defining a ""segregated"" core city school, erred in not placing Negroes and Hispanos in the same category, since both groups suffer the same educational inequities when compared with the treatment afforded Anglo students.  Pp. 195-198.
2. The courts below did not apply the correct legal standard in dealing with petitioners' contention that respondent School Board had the policy of deliberately segregating the core city schools.  Pp.  413 U. S. 198-213.
(a) Proof that the school authorities have pursued an intentional segregative policy in a substantial portion of the school district will support a finding by the trial court of the existence of a dual system, absent a showing that the district is divided into clearly unrelated units.  Pp.  413 U. S. 201-203.
(b) On remand, the District Court should decide initially whether respondent School Board's deliberately segregative policy

 respecting the Park Hill schools constitutes the whole Denver school district a dual school system.  Pp.  413 U. S. 204-205.
(c) Where, as in this case, a policy of intentional segregation has been proved with respect to a significant portion of the school system, the burden is on the school authorities (regardless of claims that their ""neighborhood school policy"" was racially neutral) to prove that their actions as to other segregated schools in the system were not likewise motivated by a segregative intent.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a Mexican citizen and holder of a valid work permit, challenges the constitutionality of the Border Patrol's warrantless search of his automobile 25 air miles north of the Mexican border.  The search, made without probable cause or consent, uncovered marihuana, which was used to convict petitioner of a federal crime.  The Government seeks to justify the search on the basis of  287(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides for warrantless searches of automobiles and other conveyances ""within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States,"" as authorized by regulations to be promulgated by the Attorney General.  The Attorney General's regulation defines ""reasonable distance"" as ""within 100 air miles from any external boundary of the United States.""  The Court of Appeals upheld the search on the basis of the Act and regulation.
Held:   The warrantless search of petitioner's automobile, made without probable cause or consent, violated the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  413 U. S. 269-275.
(a) The search cannot be justified on the basis of any special rules applicable to automobile searches, as probable cause was lacking; nor can it be justified by analogy with administrative inspections, as the officers had no warrant or reason to believe that petitioner had crossed the border or committed an offense, and there was no consent by petitioner.

Syllabus 
Sections 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, are designed to prohibit the use of tests or devices, or the alteration of voting qualifications or procedures, when the purpose or effect is to deprive a citizen of his right to vote.  Sections 4 and 5 apply in any State or political subdivision thereof which the Attorney General determines maintained on November 1, 1964, or November 1, 1968, any ""test or device,"" and with respect to which the Director of the Census Bureau determines that less than half the voting-age residents were registered, or that less than half voted in the presidential election of that November.  These determinations are effective on publication and are not judicially reviewable.  Publication suspends the effectiveness of the test or device, which may not then be utilized unless a three-judge District Court for the District of Columbia determines that no such test or device has been used during the 10 preceding years ""for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.""  Section 4(a) provides for direct appeal to the Supreme Court.  The State or political subdivision may also institute an action pursuant to  5 in the District Court for the District of Columbia, for a declaratory judgment that a proposed alteration in voting qualifications or procedures ""does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.""  The statute also permits the change to be enforced without the court proceeding if it has been submitted to the Attorney General and he has not interposed an objection within 60 days.  Neither the Attorney General's failure to object nor a  5 declaratory judgment bars a subsequent private action to enjoin enforcement of the change.  Such an action shall also be determined by a three-judge court and is appealable to the Supreme

 Court.  The Attorney General, on July 31, 1970, filed with the Federal Register his determination that New York on November 1, 1968, maintained a test or device as defined in the Act, and this was published the next day.  On March 27, 1971, the Federal Register published the Census Director's determination that in the counties of Bronx, Kings, and New York, ""less than 50 per centum of the persons of voting age residing therein voted in the presidential election of November 1968.""  New York State filed an action on December 3, 1971, seeking a judgment declaring that, during the preceding 10 years, the three counties had not used the State's voting qualifications ""for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color,"" and that  4 and 5 were thus inapplicable to the counties. Pursuant to stipulation, the United States filed its answer on March 10, 1972, alleging, inter alia, that it was without knowledge or information to form a belief as to the truth of New York's allegation that the literacy tests were not administered discriminatorily.  On March 17, New York filed a motion for summary judgment, supported by affidavits, and, on April 3, the United States formally consented to the entry of the declaratory judgment sought by the State.  Appellants filed their motion to intervene on April 7.  New York opposed the motion claiming that:  it was untimely, as the suit had been pending for more than four months; it had been publicized in early February, and appellants did not deny that they knew the action was pending; appellants failed to allege appropriate supporting facts; no appellant claimed to be a victim of voting discrimination; appellants' interests were adequately represented by the United States; delay would prejudice impending elections; and appellants still could raise discrimination issues in the state and federal courts of New York.  On April 13, the three-judge court denied the motion to intervene and granted summary judgment for New York.  While the appeal was pending, it was disclosed that the attorney who executed affidavits for appellants had not begun employment with appellant NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund, Inc., until March 9, 1972, and that Justice Department attorneys met with two individual appellants in January, 1972, during the course of their investigation.
Held:
1. The words ""any appeal"" in  4(a) encompass an appeal by a would-be, but unsuccessful, intervenor, and appellants' appeal properly lies to this Court.  Pp.  413 U. S. 353-356.
2. The motion to intervene was untimely, and, in the light of that fact and all the other circumstances of this case, the District

New York State filed an action on December 3, 1971, seeking a judgment declaring that, during the preceding 10 years, the three counties had not used the State's voting qualifications ""for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color,"" and that  4 and 5 were thus inapplicable to the counties. Pursuant to stipulation, the United States filed its answer on March 10, 1972, alleging, inter alia, that it was without knowledge or information to form a belief as to the truth of New York's allegation that the literacy tests were not administered discriminatorily.  On March 17, New York filed a motion for summary judgment, supported by affidavits, and, on April 3, the United States formally consented to the entry of the declaratory judgment sought by the State.  Appellants filed their motion to intervene on April 7.  New York opposed the motion claiming that:  it was untimely, as the suit had been pending for more than four months; it had been publicized in early February, and appellants did not deny that they knew the action was pending; appellants failed to allege appropriate supporting facts; no appellant claimed to be a victim of voting discrimination; appellants' interests were adequately represented by the United States; delay would prejudice impending elections; and appellants still could raise discrimination issues in the state and federal courts of New York.  On April 13, the three-judge court denied the motion to intervene and granted summary judgment for New York.  While the appeal was pending, it was disclosed that the attorney who executed affidavits for appellants had not begun employment with appellant NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund, Inc., until March 9, 1972, and that Justice Department attorneys met with two individual appellants in January, 1972, during the course of their investigation.
Held:
1. The words ""any appeal"" in  4(a) encompass an appeal by a would-be, but unsuccessful, intervenor, and appellants' appeal properly lies to this Court.  Pp.  413 U. S. 353-356.
2. The motion to intervene was untimely, and, in the light of that fact and all the other circumstances of this case, the District

 Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.  Pp. 364 369.

413 U.S. 376

Syllabus 
Following a complaint and hearing, respondent Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations held that petitioner had violated a city ordinance by using an advertising system in its daily newspaper whereby employment opportunities are published under headings designating job preference by sex.  On appeal from affirmance of the Commission's cease and desist order, the court below barred petitioner from referring to sex in employment headings, unless the want ads placed beneath them relate to employment opportunities not subject to the ordinance's prohibition against sex discrimination.  Petitioner contends that the ordinance contravenes its constitutional rights to freedom of the press.
Held:   The Pittsburgh ordinance, as construed to forbid newspapers to carry sex-designated advertising columns for nonexempt job opportunities, does not violate petitioner's First Amendment rights.  Pp.  413 U. S. 381-391.
(a) The advertisements here, which did not implicate the newspaper's freedom of expression or its financial viability, were ""purely commercial advertising,"" which is not protected by the First Amendment.  Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52,  316 U. S. 54.  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, distinguished.  Pp.  413 U. S. 384-387.
(b) Petitioner's argument against maintaining the Chrestensen distinction between commercial and other speech is unpersuasive in the context of a case like this, where the regulation of the want ads was incidental to and coextensive with the regulation of employment discrimination.  Pp.  413 U. S. 387-389.
(c) The Commission's order, which was clear and no broader than necessary, is not a prior restraint endangering arguably protected speech.  Pp.  413 U. S. 389-390.

Decided June 21, 1973*
413 U.S. 405

Syllabus 
The 1967 amendments to the Social Security Act included the Federal Work Incentive Program (WIN), designed to help individuals on welfare become wage-earning members of society.  The States were required to incorporate this program into their Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program, to provide that certain ""employable"" individuals, as a condition for receiving aid, shall register for manpower services, training, and employment.  In 1971, New York enacted provisions of its Social Welfare Law, commonly referred to as the New York Work Rules, which similarly required cooperation by employable individuals to continue to receive assistance.  Appellees, New York public assistance recipients subject to the Work Rules, challenge those Rules as having been preempted by the WIN provisions of the Social Security Act.  The three-judge District Court ruled that, ""for those in the AFDC program, WIN preempts the New York Work Rules.""
Held:
1. The WIN provisions of the Social Security Act do not preempt the New York Work Rules of the New York Social Welfare Law.  Pp.  413 U. S. 412-423.
(a) There is no substantial evidence that Congress intended, either expressly or impliedly, to preempt state work programs.  More is required than the apparent comprehensiveness of the WIN legislation to show the ""clear manifestation of [congressional] intention"" that must exist before a federal statute is held ""to supersede the exercise"" of state action.  Schwartz v. Texas, 344 U. S. 199,  344 U. S. 202-203.  Pp.  413 U. S. 412-417.
(b) Affirmative evidence exists to establish Congress' intention not to terminate all state work programs and foreclose future state cooperative programs:  WIN is limited in scope and application; 
Page 413 U. S. 406
 it is a partial program, with state supplementation, as illustrated by New York; and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, responsible for administering the Social Security Act, has never considered WIN as preemptive.  Pp.  413 U. S. 417-421.
(c) Where coordinate state and federal efforts exist within a complementary administrative framework in the pursuit of common purposes, as here, the case for federal preemption is not persuasive.  Pp.  413 U. S. 421-422.

Syllabus 
Respondent had a one-car accident near a small Wisconsin town, while driving a rented Ford.  The police had the car towed to a garage seven miles from the police station, where it was left unguarded outside.  Respondent was arrested for drunken driving.  Early the next day, an officer, looking for a service revolver which respondent (who had identified himself as a Chicago policeman) was thought to possess, made a warrantless search of the car and found in the trunk several items, some bloodied, which he removed.  Later, on receipt of additional information emanating from respondent, a blood-stained body was located on respondent's brother's farm in a nearby county.  Thereafter, through the windows of a disabled Dodge which respondent had left on the farm before renting the Ford, an officer observed other bloodied items.  Following issuance of a search warrant, materials were taken from the Dodge, two of which (a sock and floor mat) were not listed in the return on the warrant among the items seized.  Respondent's trial for murder, at which items seized from the cars were introduced in evidence, resulted in conviction which was upheld on appeal.  In this habeas corpus action, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and held that certain evidence at the trial had been unconstitutionally seized.
Held:
1. The warrantless search of the Ford did not violate the Fourth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.  The search was not unreasonable, since the police had exercised a form of custody of the car, which constituted a hazard on the highway, and the disposition of which by respondent was precluded by his intoxicated and later comatose condition; and the revolver search was standard police procedure to protect the public from a weapon's possibly falling into improper hands.  Preston v. United States, 376 U. S. 364, distinguished; Harris v. United States, 390 U. S. 234, followed.  Pp.  413 U. S. 439-448.
2. The seizure of the sock and floor mat from the Dodge was not invalid, since the Dodge, the item ""particularly described,"" was the subject of a proper search warrant.  It is not constitutionally significant that the sock and mat were not listed in the 
Page 413 U. S. 434
 warrant's return, which (contrary to the assumption of the Court of Appeals) was not filed prior to the search, and the warrant was thus validly outstanding at the time the articles were discovered.  Pp.  413 U. S. 448-450.

Petitioners, convicted for committing acts of ""record piracy"" or ""tape piracy"" in 1970-1971, challenge the California statute proscribing such practices, as violative of the ""Copyright Clause,"" Art. I,  8, cl. 8, of the Constitution, and the federal statutes enacted thereunder.  The state appellate court upheld the validity of the statute.
Held:
1. Article I,  8, cl. 8, does not expressly or by inference vest all power to grant copyright protection exclusively in the Federal Government.  Pp.  412 U. S. 552-561.
(a) Although the objective of the Copyright Clause was to facilitate the granting of rights national in scope, it does not indicate that all ""Writings"" are of national interest or that protective state legislation is, in all cases, unnecessary or precluded.  Pp.  412 U. S. 555-558.
(b) No substantially prejudicial interstate conflicts result where some States grant copyright protection within their own jurisdictions, while other States do not.  Pp.  412 U. S. 558-559.
(c) Conflicts will not necessarily arise between state enactments and congressional policy when States grant copyright protection.  P.  412 U. S. 559.
(d) Unless Congress determines that the national interest requires federal protection or freedom from restraint as to a particular category of ""Writings,"" state protection of that category is not precluded.  P.  412 U. S. 559.
(e) The durational limitation imposed by the Copyright Clause on Congress does not invalidate state laws, like the one here, that have no such limitation.  Pp.  412 U. S. 560-561.
2. The California statute does not violate the Supremacy Clause by conflicting with federal copyright law.  Pp.  412 U. S. 561-570.
(a) Congress did not, in passing the Copyright Act of 1909, determine that recordings, as original writings, were unworthy of all copyright protection.  Pp.  412 U. S. 563-566.
(b) Nor did Congress in 17 U.S.C.  4, which provides that ""the works for which copyrights may be secured under this Act shall include all writings of an author,"" or in  5, preempt state control over all works to which the term ""writings"" might apply.

The 10-year period expired without the extension conditions being met.  Respondents continued to claim the mineral rights, relying on Louisiana Act 315 of 1940, which, as applied retroactively, provides that mineral rights reserved in land conveyances to the United States shall be ""imprescriptible,"" thus, in effect, extending indefinitely the former owners' mineral reservations.  The Government brought this suit to quiet title.  The District Court entered summary judgment for the respondents, concluding that Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United States, 329 F.2d 85, was dispositive of the issues, notwithstanding that that judgment had been vacated by this Court and the case remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint as moot.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Under settled principles governing the choice of law by federal courts, Louisiana's Act 315 of 1940 does not apply to the mineral reservations agreed to by the parties in 1937 and 1939.  Pp.  412 U. S. 590-604.
(a) Here, where the land acquisition to which the United States is a party arises from and bears heavily upon a federal regulatory program, the choice of law task is a federal one for federal courts, as defined by Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U. S. 363.  Pp.  412 U. S. 590-593.
(b) Absence of a provision dealing with choice of law in the Migratory Bird Conservation Act does not limit the reach of federal law, as interstitial federal lawmaking is a basic responsibility of the federal courts.  P.  412 U. S. 593.

 as retroactively applied, may not, because, in determining the appropriateness of ""borrowing"" state law, specific aberrant or hostile state rules do not provide appropriate standards for federal law.  Under Act 315, land acquisitions explicitly authorized by federal statute are made subject to a rule of retroactive imprescriptibility, a rule plainly hostile to the United States, and one that deprives the United States of bargained-for contractual interests.  Pp.  412 U. S. 594-597.
(d) To permit state legislation to abrogate the explicit terms of a prior federal land acquisition would seriously impair federal statutory programs and the certainty and finality that are indispensable to land transactions.  Pp.  412 U. S. 597-599.

412 U.S. 609

Syllabus 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended in 1962, establishes a system of pre-marketing clearance for drugs and prohibits in  505(a) the introduction into commerce of any ""new drug"" unless a new drug application (NDA) filed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was effective with respect to such drug.  Under the Act, procedures were established for filing ""new drug"" applications not only for the safety of drugs but for their efficacy as well.  Standards were provided under which, after notice and hearing, FDA could refuse to allow an NDA to become effective, or could suspend an NDA in effect on the basis of new evidence that the drug was not effective.  FDA is directed to refuse approval of an NDA and to withdraw prior approval if ""substantial evidence"" ( 505(d)) that the drug is effective for its intended use is lacking.  All NDA's ""effective"" prior to 1962 were deemed ""approved,"" and manufacturers were given two years to develop substantial evidence of effectiveness during which previously approved NDA's could not be withdrawn by FDA for the drug's lack of effectiveness.  The 1962 Act also contained a ""grandfather"" clause exempting from the effectiveness requirements any drug which, on the day preceding enactment, (1) was commercially used or sold in the United States, (2) was not a ""new drug"" as defined in the 1938 Act, and (3) ""was not covered by an effective application"" for a new drug under the 1938 Act.  FDA had permitted more than 9,000 NDA's to become effective between 1938 and 1962, of which some 4,000 were still on the market.  Additionally, manufacturers have marketed thousands of ""me-too"" drugs without applying for clearance, drugs similar or identical to drugs with effective NDA's, marketed in reliance on 
Page 412 U. S. 610
 the ""pioneer"" drug application approved by FDA.  To aid it in fulfilling the statutory mandate to review all marketed drugs, whether or not previously approved, for their efficacy, FDA retained the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC) to create expert panels to review by class the efficacy of each approved drug.  Holders of NDA's were invited to furnish the panels with the best available data to establish efficacy and FDA announced that it would apply NASNRC efficacy findings to all drugs, including the ""me-too"" drugs.  Respondent in No. 72-394 (Hynson) had filed an application for a drug called Lutrexin under the 1938 Act.  FDA informed Hynson that the studies submitted with the application were not sufficiently well controlled to justify the claims of effectiveness, but allowed the application to become effective, since the 1938 Act permitted evaluation of a new drug solely on the basis of its safety.  When the 1962 amendments became effective, Hynson submitted evidence of the efficacy of the drug, but the NAS-NRC panel reported that Hynson had not satisfied the requirements.  Notice of an intention to withdraw approval of the NDA's covering the drug was given by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.  Before the hearing, Hynson brought suit in the District Court for a declaratory judgment that the drug was exempt from the efficacy review provisions of the 1962 Act, or that there was no lack of substantial evidence of the drug's efficacy.  Petitioners' motion to dismiss was granted.  While the District Court litigation was pending, the Commissioner denied Hynson's request for a hearing based on claims of ""substantial evidence"" of Lutrexin's effectiveness, and withdrew the NDA for the drug, ruling that it was not exempt from the 1962 amendments and that Hynson had not submitted adequate evidence that the drug was not a new drug or was effective.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, while the drug was not exempt, Hynson was entitled to a hearing on the substantial evidence issue.  No. 72-414 is a cross-petition by Hynson from the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which suggested that only a district court has authority to determine whether Lutrexin is a ""new drug.""  While Hynson agrees that the Commissioner has authority to determine new drug status in proceedings to withdraw approval of the product's NDA, some manufacturers, parties to other suits in this group of cases, advance the contrary view.
Held:
1. The 1962 amendments and the regulations issued thereunder, which express well established principles of scientific investigation, 
Page 412 U. S. 611
 in their reduction of the ""substantial evidence"" standard to detailed guidelines for the protection of the public, make FDA's so-called administrative summary judgment procedure appropriate.  Pp.  412 U. S. 617-619.
2. FDA's procedure, whereby it will not provide a formal hearing when it is apparent at the threshold that the applicant has not tendered any evidence which, on its face, meets the statutory standards as particularized by the regulations, is valid.  United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U. S. 192; FPC v. Texaco, 377 U. S. 33.  Pp.  412 U. S. 620-622.
3. In No. 72-394, the Court of Appeals' holding that Hynson was entitled to a hearing on whether its submission of evidence satisfied its threshold burden of providing ""substantial evidence"" is affirmed.  Pp.  412 U. S. 622-623.
4. The heart of the statutory procedure is the grant of primary jurisdiction to FDA, subject to judicial review when administrative remedies are exhausted.  Pp.  412 U. S. 623-627.
5. Although a drug can be ""generally recognized"" by experts as effective for intended use within the meaning of the Act only when that expert consensus is founded upon ""substantial evidence,"" any ruling on Lutrexin's ""new drug"" status is premature, and must await the outcome of the hearing on whether Hynson submitted ""substantial evidence,"" as held in No. 72-394 (item 3, supra).  Pp.  412 U. S. 628-632.
6. Lutrexin is not exempt under the ""grandfather"" provisions of the 1962 Act, as held by FDA and the Court of Appeals, and their construction accords with the legislative history, which suggests that the exemption is afforded only for drugs that never had been subject to new drug regulation.  Pp.  412 U. S. 632-634.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT
Petitioner manufactures a drug called Ritonic Capsules, for which it filed a new drug application (NDA) that became effective in 1959, on the basis of the drug's safety.  After the enactment of the 1962 amendments to the Federal Food. Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrew approval of the NDA on the ground that there was no substantial evidence that the drug was effective as claimed, under  505 of the Act.  Petitioner sought review of the withdrawal order in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, as provided in  505(h), and that court affirmed the order.  Prior to the issuance of the withdrawal order, petitioner sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the District Court in New Jersey, which granted the Government's motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, holding that FDA was authorized to decide the jurisdictional question as an incident of its power to approve or withdraw approval for NDA's, that its decision was reviewable on direct appeal by a court of appeals, and, since the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had ruled against petitioner on that appeal, the jurisdictional issue could not be relitigated in a separate suit for a declaratory judgment.

Syllabus 
Respondent drug marketers filed suit for a declaratory judgment that their drugs containing pentylenetetrazol are generally recognized as safe and effective and thus are not ""new drugs"" within the meaning of  201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended.  They also sought exemption under  107(c)(4), the grandfather clause, of the 1962 amendments to the Act.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner, based on NAS-NRC panel reports, concluded that there was a lack of substantial evidence that the drugs were effective for their intended uses and gave notice of his intention to initiate proceedings to withdraw approval of the new drug applications (NDA's).  In light of FDA's position that withdrawal of approval of an NDA would operate to remove marketing approval for all drugs of similar composition, known as ""me-too"" drugs, whether or not expressly covered by an effective NDA, the Commissioner invited holders of NDA's for drugs containing pentylenetetrazol ""and any interested person who might be adversely affected by their removal from the market"" to submit ""adequate and well controlled studies"" to establish the effectiveness of the drugs.  Only one NDA holder submitted further evidence, which the Commissioner held did not satisfy the statutory standard.  He gave notice of intent to issue an order withdrawing approval of the NDA's, and only one NDA holder requested a hearing, but filed no supporting data.  The Commissioner issued orders withdrawing approval of the NDA's, and no appeal was taken.  Respondents here all market ""me-too"" drugs, none of which was expressly covered by an effective NDA.  The District Court held that FDA should resolve the ""new drug"" and ""grandfather"" issues in an administrative proceeding.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with directions to the District Court to determine whether the challenged drugs may lawfully be marketed without approved NDA's, holding that FDA has no jurisdiction, 
Page 412 U. S. 646
 primary or concurrent, to decide what is a ""new drug"" for which an NDA is required.
Held:   The District Court's referral of the ""new drug"" and ""grandfather"" issues to FDA was proper.  Pp.  412 U. S. 649-654.
(a) While an FDA order denying an NDA and withdrawing one is reviewable by the Court of Appeals under  505(h), an order declaring a ""new drug"" status under  201(p) is reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act by the District Court.  Pp.  412 U. S. 651-652.
(b) The reach of scientific inquiry under both  505(d) and  201(p) is the same, Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, Inc., ante, p.  412 U. S. 609, and it is implicit in the regulatory scheme that FDA has jurisdiction to decide with administrative finality, subject to judicial review, the ""new drug"" status of individual drugs or classes of drugs.  Pp.  412 U. S. 652-653.
(c) The ""new drug"" and ""grandfather"" issues are peculiarly suited to initial determination by FDA with its specialized competence and expertise.  Pp.  412 U. S. 653-654.

Respondent drug marketers filed suit for a declaratory judgment that their drugs containing pentylenetetrazol are generally recognized as safe and effective and thus are not ""new drugs"" within the meaning of  201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended.  They also sought exemption under  107(c)(4), the grandfather clause, of the 1962 amendments to the Act.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner, based on NAS-NRC panel reports, concluded that there was a lack of substantial evidence that the drugs were effective for their intended uses and gave notice of his intention to initiate proceedings to withdraw approval of the new drug applications (NDA's).  In light of FDA's position that withdrawal of approval of an NDA would operate to remove marketing approval for all drugs of similar composition, known as ""me-too"" drugs, whether or not expressly covered by an effective NDA, the Commissioner invited holders of NDA's for drugs containing pentylenetetrazol ""and any interested person who might be adversely affected by their removal from the market"" to submit ""adequate and well controlled studies"" to establish the effectiveness of the drugs.  Only one NDA holder submitted further evidence, which the Commissioner held did not satisfy the statutory standard.  He gave notice of intent to issue an order withdrawing approval of the NDA's, and only one NDA holder requested a hearing, but filed no supporting data.  The Commissioner issued orders withdrawing approval of the NDA's, and no appeal was taken.  Respondents here all market ""me-too"" drugs, none of which was expressly covered by an effective NDA.  The District Court held that FDA should resolve the ""new drug"" and ""grandfather"" issues in an administrative proceeding.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with directions to the District Court to determine whether the challenged drugs may lawfully be marketed without approved NDA's, holding that FDA has no jurisdiction, 
Page 412 U. S. 646
 primary or concurrent, to decide what is a ""new drug"" for which an NDA is required.
Held:   The District Court's referral of the ""new drug"" and ""grandfather"" issues to FDA was proper.  Pp.  412 U. S. 649-654.
(a) While an FDA order denying an NDA and withdrawing one is reviewable by the Court of Appeals under  505(h), an order declaring a ""new drug"" status under  201(p) is reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act by the District Court.  Pp.  412 U. S. 651-652.
(b) The reach of scientific inquiry under both  505(d) and  201(p) is the same, Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, Inc., ante, p.  412 U. S. 609, and it is implicit in the regulatory scheme that FDA has jurisdiction to decide with administrative finality, subject to judicial review, the ""new drug"" status of individual drugs or classes of drugs.  Pp.  412 U. S. 652-653.
(c) The ""new drug"" and ""grandfather"" issues are peculiarly suited to initial determination by FDA with its specialized competence and expertise.  Pp.  412 U. S. 653-654.
463 F.2d 363, reversed.

Syllabus 
Petitioner sells drug products containing citrus bioflavonoid, an extract from fruit skins, as a principal active ingredient.  In the 1950's new drug applications (NDA's) were filed and became effective for seven products, and two were sold without any NDA.  After the enactment of the 1962 amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, these products, together with a large number of other bioflavonoid products were examined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for effectiveness.  Based upon National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC) reports and its own evaluation, FDA gave notice of opportunity for hearing on its proposal to withdraw approvals of NDA's for all drugs containing these compounds, alone or in combination with other drugs.  Petitioner then brought suit in the District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that its drugs are exempt from the efficacy requirements under  107(c)(4), the so-called ""grandfather"" clause.  FDA refused a stay pending the judicial proceedings and went forward with its administrative action.  Petitioner submitted no evidence of ""adequate and well controlled investigations,"" as required by  505(d) to support its claims of effectiveness, and FDA withdrew petitioner's NDA's.  Section 107(c)(4) exempts from the effectiveness requirements any drug which, on the day preceding the 1962 enactment, (1) was commercially used or sold in the United States, (2) was not a ""new drug"" as defined in the 1938 Act, and (3) ""was not covered by an effective application"" for a new drug under the 1938 Act.  The District Court found that two of the products had never been covered by effective NDA's and that, while seven had been covered, their applications had later been withdrawn by petitioner.  It concluded that petitioner's drugs were not covered by effective applications, and hence were exempt from the effectiveness criterion.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the merits.  It held that petitioner's drugs were not entitled to an exemption, that an applicant could not withdraw an NDA once 
Page 412 U. S. 656
 it became effective, that the drugs were ""covered by an effective application,"" and that, although ""me-too"" drugs (similar drugs) of other manufacturers would be exempt, petitioner's ""me-too's"" were not exempt.
Held:
1. ""Any drug"" is used in  107(c)(4) in the generic sense, which means that the ""me-too's,"" whether the products of the same or of different manufacturers ""covered"" by an ""effective"" NDA, are not exempt from the efficacy requirement of  201(p).  Pp.  412 U. S. 663-665.
2. Prescription drugs on the market are subject to the 1962 efficacy requirements, for if the 1962 amendments are to be comprehensively meaningful,  107(c)(4) cannot be read so as to provide a loophole to permit the marketing of drugs previously subject to new drug regulation without demonstrating by the new statutory standards that they have the claimed efficacy.  Pp.  412 U. S. 665-666.
3. The congressional purpose was to exempt only those drugs that never had been subject to the new drug regulation, and therefore any drug for which an NDA had once been effective does not fall within the exempt category.  Pp.  412 U. S. 666-668.

Syllabus 
The Interstate Commerce Act permits railroads to file proposed freight rate increases, with at least 30 days' notice to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and the public before putting the new rates into effect.  The ICC may, pursuant to  15(7) of the Act, suspend the operation of the proposed rates for as long as seven months, in order to investigate the lawfulness of the rates.  At the end of the seven-month period, the carrier may put the suspended rates into effect unless the ICC has completed its investigation and found the rates unlawful.  Proceeding under the statutory scheme, substantially all the Nation's railroads sought a 2.5% surcharge on nearly all freight rates, as an emergency measure to obtain increased revenues pending adoption of selective rate increases on a permanent basis.  Shippers, competing carriers, and other interested persons requested the ICC to suspend the tariff for the statutory seven-month period.  Various environmental groups, including Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP) and the Environmental Defense Fund, appellees here, protested that failure to suspend the surcharge would cause their members ""economic, recreational and aesthetic harm,"" and specifically, that the new rate structure would discourage the use of ""recyclable"" materials and promote the use of raw materials that compete with scrap, thus adversely affecting the environment.  On February 1, 1972, the ICC issued an order announcing its decision not to suspend the surcharge for the seven-month period, and on April 24, 1972, ordered the proposed selective increases filed by the carriers to be suspended for the full seven-month period ending November 30, 1972, and permitted the collection of the surcharge until that date.  SCRAP filed the 
Page 412 U. S. 670
 present suit seeking, inter alia, an injunction to restrain enforcement of the February 1 and April 24 orders allowing the carriers to collect the surcharge. SCRAP, an unincorporated association formed by five law students to enhance the quality of the environment, claimed that its members
""suffered economic, recreational and aesthetic harm directly as a result of the adverse environmental impact of the railroad freight structure,""
that each of its members was caused to pay more for finished products, that each of its members uses the forests, rivers, mountains, and other natural resources of the Washington, D.C., area, and at his legal residence for camping, hiking, fishing, and other purposes, and that these uses have been adversely affected by increased freight rates.  The main thrust of SCRAP's complaint was that the ICC's orders were unlawful for failure to include a detailed environmental impact statement as required by  102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.  4332(2)(C).  The three-judge District Court found that appellees had standing to sue.  The court held that its power to grant an injunction was not barred by Arrow Transportation Co. v. Southern R. Co., 372 U. S. 658, because NEPA
""implicitly confers authority on the federal courts to enjoin any federal action taken in violation of NEPA's procedural requirements . . . so long as the review is confined to a determination as to whether the procedural requisites of NEPA have been followed.""
The court concluded that the ICC's decision not to suspend the surcharge for the seven-month period was a ""major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,"" and granted an injunction prohibiting the ICC ""from permitting"" and the railroads ""from collecting"" the surcharge ""insofar as that surcharge relates to goods being transported for purposes of recycling.""
Held:
1. Appellees' pleadings sufficiently alleged that they were ""adversely affected"" or ""aggrieved"" within the meaning of  10 of the Administrative Procedure Act to withstand a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of standing to sue.  Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, distinguished.  Pp.  412 U. S. 683-690.
(a) Standing is not confined to those who show economic harm, as ""[a]esthetic and environmental wellbeing, like economic wellbeing, are important ingredients of the quality of life in our society.""  Sierra Club, supra, at  405 U. S. 734.  P.  412 U. S. 686.
(b) Here, the appellees claimed that the specific and allegedly illegal action of the ICC would directly harm them in their use of the natural resources of the Washington area.  Pp.  412 U. S. 686-687. 
Page 412 U. S. 671

(c) Standing is not to be denied because many people suffer the same injury.  Pp.  412 U. S. 687-688.
(d) It cannot be said on these pleadings that appellees could not prove their allegations, which, if proved, would place them squarely among those persons injured in fact, by the ICC's action and entitled to review under Sierra Club, supra.  Pp.  412 U. S. 688-690.
2. The District Court lacked jurisdiction to issue the injunction.  Pp.  412 U. S. 690-698.
(a) Arrow Transportation, supra, held that Congress, in  15(7), had vested exclusive jurisdiction in the ICC to suspend rates pending its final decision on their lawfulness, and had deliberately extinguished judicial power to grant such relief; and the factual distinctions between the instant case and Arrow Transportation are inconsequential.  Pp.  412 U. S. 690-692.
(b) The alleged noncompliance by the ICC with NEPA did not give the District Court authority to grant the injunction, as NEPA was not intended to repeal by implication any other statute, and the policies identified in Arrow Transportation as the basis for  15(7) would be substantially undermined if the courts were found to have suspension powers simply because of noncompliance with NEPA.  Pp.  412 U. S. 692-698.

Decided June 18, 1973
412 U.S. 755

Syllabus 
In this litigation challenging the Texas 1970 legislative reapportionment scheme, a three-judge District Court held that the House plan, state-wide, contained constitutionally impermissible deviations from population equality, and that the multi-member districts provided for Bexar and Dallas Counties invidiously discriminated against cognizable racial or ethnic groups.  Though the entire plan was declared invalid, the court permitted its use for the 1972 election except for its injunction order requiring those two county multi-member districts to be reconstituted into single member districts.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1253 to consider the appeal from the injunction order applicable to the Bexar County and Dallas County districting, since the three-judge court had been properly convened, and this Court can review the declaratory part of the judgment below.  Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113.  Pp.  412 U. S. 759-761.
2. State reapportionment statutes are not subject to the stricter standards applicable to congressional reapportionment under Art. I,  2, and the District Court erred in concluding that this case, where the total maximum variation between House districts was 9.9%, but the average deviation from the ideal was 1.82%, involved invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Cf. Gaffney v. Cummings, ante, p.  412 U. S. 735.  Pp.  412 U. S. 761-764.
3. The District Court's order requiring disestablishment of the multi-member districts in Dallas and Bexar Counties was warranted in the light of the history of political discrimination against Negroes and Mexican-Americans residing, respectively, in those counties and the residual effects of such discrimination upon those groups.

No. 72-147
Argued February 26, 1973
Decided June 18, 1973
412 U.S. 755

Syllabus 
In this litigation challenging the Texas 1970 legislative reapportionment scheme, a three-judge District Court held that the House plan, state-wide, contained constitutionally impermissible deviations from population equality, and that the multi-member districts provided for Bexar and Dallas Counties invidiously discriminated against cognizable racial or ethnic groups.  Though the entire plan was declared invalid, the court permitted its use for the 1972 election except for its injunction order requiring those two county multi-member districts to be reconstituted into single member districts.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1253 to consider the appeal from the injunction order applicable to the Bexar County and Dallas County districting, since the three-judge court had been properly convened, and this Court can review the declaratory part of the judgment below.  Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113.  Pp.  412 U. S. 759-761.
2. State reapportionment statutes are not subject to the stricter standards applicable to congressional reapportionment under Art. I,  2, and the District Court erred in concluding that this case, where the total maximum variation between House districts was 9.9%, but the average deviation from the ideal was 1.82%, involved invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Cf. Gaffney v. Cummings, ante, p.  412 U. S. 735.  Pp.  412 U. S. 761-764.
3. The District Court's order requiring disestablishment of the multi-member districts in Dallas and Bexar Counties was warranted in the light of the history of political discrimination against Negroes and Mexican-Americans residing, respectively, in those counties and the residual effects of such discrimination upon those groups.  Pp.  412 U. S. 765-770.

 The Court today upholds statewide legislative apportionment plans for Connecticut and Texas, even though these plans admittedly entail substantial inequalities in the population of the representative districts, and even though the States have made virtually no attempt to justify their failure 'to construct districts . . . as nearly of equal population as is practicable.' Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 577, 1390 (1964).

 trict of Texas reaching a similar result as to the Texas plan. In the Texas case, the Court does affirm, however, the District Court's determination that the use of multimember districts in Dallas and Bexar Counties had the unconstitutional effect of minimizing the voting strength of racial groups.

With that latter conclusion I am in full agreement, as I also agree with and join Part I of the Court's opinion in No. 72-147, White v. Regester. But the decision to uphold the state apportionment schemes reflects a substantial and very unfortunate retreat from the principles established in our earlier cases, and I therefore must state my dissenting views.

No. 71-1623
Argued February 26, 1973
Decided June 18, 1973
412 U.S. 783

Syllabus 
Texas enacted Senate Bill One (S.B. 1) providing for congressional redistricting.  The State was divided into 24 districts, with an average deviation from the ideal district of .745%, and a maximum deviation of 2.43% above and 1.7% below the ideal.  Appellees alleged that the reapportionment violated their constitutional rights under Art. I,  2, and submitted Plan B, which, although cutting across more county lines, generally followed the district lines of S.B. 1.  Plan B had a total maximum deviation of .149%.  Shortly before the three-judge court hearing, appellees submitted, alternatively, Plan C.  That scheme, with a total maximum deviation of .284%, substantially disregarded the configuration of the districts in S.B. 1, using population as the only consideration.  The District Court found S.B. 1 unconstitutional, and ordered the adoption of Plan C, as being more compact and contiguous than the other plans.
Held:
1. Although the percentage deviations in S.B. 1 are smaller than those invalidated in Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U. S. 526, and Wells v. Rockefeller, 394 U. S. 542, they were not ""unavoidable,"" and the districts were not as mathematically equal as reasonably possible.  The argument that variances are justified if they necessarily result from the State's attempt to avoid fragmenting political subdivisions by drawing district lines along existing political subdivision lines is not legally acceptable.  Kirkpatrick, supra, at  394 U. S. 533-534.  Pp.  412 U. S. 790-791.
2. Though the drawing of district boundaries in a way that minimizes the number of contests between present incumbents does not of itself establish invidiousness, Burns v. Richardson, 384 U. S. 73,  384 U. S. 89 n. 16, it is not necessary to decide whether such state interest will justify the deviations in S.B. 1, since Plan B serves this purpose as well with less population variance.  Pp.  412 U. S. 791-792.
3. Population variances do invidiously devalue the individual's vote at some point or level in size, and this is especially noticeable in congressional districts, with their substantial populations.  Pp.  412 U. S. 792-793. 
Page 412 U. S. 784

4. Plan B, to a greater extent than Plan C, while eliminating population variances, adhered to the districting preferences of the state legislature, which has ""primary jurisdiction"" over legislative reapportionment.  Pp.  412 U. S. 793-797.

Syllabus 
The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), after hearings, approved imposition by appellant railroads of separate charges for inspection of grain while in transit, a service that had previously been provided under the line-haul rates.  Appellees thereupon brought this action in District Court contesting the validity of the ICC order.  That court found that the ICC had not adequately justified departure from its longstanding rule that such separate charges are unlawful unless the carriers can satisfy the burden that rests upon them of proving that their line-haul rates are insufficient to cover the total transportation service including the portion thereof for which separate charges are proposed.  The court ordered suspension of the in-transit charges unless otherwise ordered by the court, and remanded the case to the ICC.
Held:  The action of the District Court is affirmed as to the remand to the ICC and is reversed as to the injunction suspending the proposed charges.  Pp.  412 U. S. 806-826;  412 U. S. 828-829.
352 F.Supp. 365, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, in an opinion joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that:
1. The ICC, which justified its departure from its prior cases on the ground that the many rates involved rendered the previous requirement impractical, and the new charges, when added to the line-haul rates, would not exceed the ICC-prescribed maximum rate level, has not stated its reasons with sufficient clarity to facilitate proper judicial review of its approval of the in-transit inspection charges.  Pp. 806-817.
2. Equitable considerations, including the doctrine of primary jurisdiction as applied to the facts of this case, required that the District Court refrain from expressing a view upon what it 
Page 412 U. S. 801
 believed was permitted by national transportation policy before the ICC on remand could balance the conflicting interests of shippers, railroads, producers, and consumers in the proposed rate changes, cf. Arrow Transportation Co. v. Southern R. Co., 372 U. S. 658; hence, it was improper for the District Court to enjoin implementation of the proposed new charges.  Pp.  412 U. S. 817-825.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concurred in the affirmance of the remand to the ICC.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concurring in the reversal of the injunction, concluded that only the ICC was granted the statutory authority to suspend new freight rates for seven months, and the District Court has no power to extend that period.

Petitioner was convicted of possessing United States Treasury checks stolen from the mails, knowing them to be stolen; forging; and uttering the checks, knowing the endorsements to be forged.  The District Court instructed the jury that
""[p]ossession of recently stolen property, if not satisfactorily explained, is ordinarily a circumstance from which you may reasonably draw the inference and find, in the light of the surrounding circumstances shown by the evidence in the case, that the person in possession knew the property had been stolen.""
The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding no lack of ""rational connection"" between unexplained possession of recently stolen property and knowledge that the property was stolen.
Held:  The instruction comports with due process.  Pp.  412 U. S. 841-847.
(a) If a statutory inference submitted to the jury as sufficient to support conviction satisfies the reasonable doubt standard (i.e., the evidence necessary to invoke the inference is sufficient for a rational juror to find the inferred fact beyond a reasonable doubt) as well as the more-likely than-not standard, then it clearly accords with due process. Pp. 841-843.
(b) Here, where the evidence established that petitioner possessed recently stolen Treasury checks payable to persons he did not know and it provided no plausible explanation for such possession consistent with innocence, the traditional common law inference satisfies the reasonable doubt standard, the most stringent standard applied by the Court in judging permissive criminal law inferences, and, therefore, comports with due process.  Pp.  412 U. S. 843-846.
(c) Although the introduction of any evidence, direct or circumstantial, tending to implicate the defendant in the alleged crime increases the pressure on him to testify, the mere massing of evidence against him cannot be regarded as a violation of his privilege against self-incrimination.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Electronic surveillance has increasingly infected criminal trials. My hearing in the Pentagon Papers case last summer (Russo v. Byrne, 409 U.S. 1219; 409 U.S. 1013), was the beginning of vast disclosures which showed how seriously that trial had in fact been infected. The indictments involved in it were indeed later dismissed, in part on the grounds that the prosecution failed to disclose the existence and results of wiretaps.

 This case presents a related facet of the problem in Russo v. Byrne, supra. Here we are concerned with witnesses called to testify before the grand jury. See Tierney v. United States, 409 U.S. 1232, 34 L. Ed.2d 37 (Douglas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). This particular grand jury was investigating firearms transactions between certain Irish-Americans and the Irish Republican Army. The center of attention apparently was one Charles Farrell Malone, who, subsequent to the proceedings below, pleaded guilty to a federal firearms offense. Petitioners, one a friend of Malone's and the other a babysitter for his seven children, were subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury on October 25 and 26, 1972. Both appeared but refused to testify. Approximately one month later, the Government advised petitioners' counsel that it would apply for an order granting petitioners testimonial immunity, see 18 U.S.C . 6003, and in the event immunity were granted and petitioners still refused to testify, it would seek immediately to have petitioners held in contempt. 
 On November 28 petitioners were granted immunity, and the same morning they were brought before the grand jury. They refused to testify on the grounds, inter alia, that the questions propounded to them were the product of illegal electronic surveillance of themselves and their attorney.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 18, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Electronic surveillance has increasingly infected criminal trials. My hearing in the Pentagon Papers case last summer (Russo v. Byrne, 409 U.S. 1219; 409 U.S. 1013), was the beginning of vast disclosures which showed how seriously that trial had in fact been infected. The indictments involved in it were indeed later dismissed, in part on the grounds that the prosecution failed to disclose the existence and results of wiretaps. 
 It has become painfully apparent that wiretapping and electronic surveillance are a commonplace tool of those who pursue prosecution with zeal that knows no bounds, not even the clear mandate of our Constitution or laws. The Nation early eschewed this Machiavellian philosophy.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals of the United States. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 We are asked to review a decision of the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals holding that 210(a) of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970,1 84 Stat. 799, as amended, 85 Stat. 743, overrides the anti-injunction provisions of

 the Norris-LaGuardia Act,2 29 U.S.C. 101 et seq., permitting a district court to enjoin a work stoppage in violation of regulations of the Pay Board. 
 On January 14, 1972, respondent construction companies entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the United Mine Workers of American providing for a wage increase in excess of 18%. In accordance with the Economic Stabilization Act, this agreement was submitted to the Pay Board for approval, but the Board authorized an increase of only 9.54%. Subsequently, employees of the construction companies, members of three different locals of the United Mine Workers went out on strike in support of their demand for a wage increase as provided by the agreement. Pickets soon appeared at five coal mines operated by two other respondents, and the miners honored the picket lines. 
 The four employers affected by the work stoppages immediately sought preliminary injunctions from the District Court. The District Court issued the injunctions, and the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeal affirmed. [Footnote 3] It determined that the work stoppages constituted a violation of 1(a) of Executive [412 U.S. 958 , 960]

No. 72-5521
Argued April 24, 1973
Decided June 11, 1973
412 U.S. 434

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of a federal offense and was sentenced to a term of five years, to run concurrently with a sentence of one to three years that he was serving pursuant to a state court conviction.  Before trial, the District Court denied his motion to dismiss the federal charge on the ground that he had been denied a speedy trial.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that he had been denied a speedy trial, but that the ""extreme"" remedy of dismissal of the charges was not warranted.  The case was remanded to the District Court to reduce the sentence by 259 days to compensate for the unnecessary delay that had occurred between the return of the indictment and petitioner's arraignment.  The Government did not file a cross-petition for certiorari challenging the finding of denial of a speedy trial.
Held:  In this case, the only question for review is the propriety of the remedy fashioned by the Court of Appeals.  In light of the policies underlying the right to a speedy trial, dismissal must remain, as noted in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514,  407 U.

412 U.S. 441

Syllabus 
Connecticut requires nonresidents enrolled in the state university system to pay tuition and other fees at higher rates than state residents and provides an irreversible and irrebuttable statutory presumption that, because the legal address of a student, if married, was outside the State at the time of application for admission, or, if single, was outside the State at some point during the preceding year, he remains a nonresident as long as he is a student in Connecticut.  Appellees challenge that presumption, claiming that they have a constitutional right to controvert it by presenting evidence of bona fide residence in the State.  The District Court upheld their claim.
Held:   The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit Connecticut to deny an individual the opportunity to present evidence that he is a bona fide resident entitled to in-state rates, on the basis of a permanent and irrebuttable presumption of nonresidence, when that presumption is not necessarily or universally true in fact, and when the State has reasonable alternative means of making the crucial determination.

412 U.S. 481

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a Yurok, or Klamath River, Indian, intervened in a forfeiture proceeding, seeking the return of five gill nets confiscated by a California game warden.  He alleged that the nets were seized in Indian country, within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.  1151, and that the state statutes prohibiting their use did not apply to him.  The state trial court found that the Klamath River Reservation, in 1892, ""for all practical purposes, almost immediately lost its identity,"" and concluded that the area was not Indian country.  The State Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that, since the area had been opened for unrestricted homestead entry in 1892, the earlier reservation status of the land had terminated.  Indian country is defined by  1151 as including
""all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent.""
The Klamath River Reservation was established by Executive Order in 1855, and included the area in question.  In 1891, by Executive Order, the Klamath River Reservation was made part of the Hoopa Valley Reservation.  The Act of June 17, 1892, provided that ""all of the lands embraced in what was Klamath River Reservation"" reserved under the 1855 Executive Order, are
""declared to be subject to settlement, entry, and purchase under the laws of the United States granting homestead rights . . . Provided, That any Indian now located upon said reservation may, at any time within one year . . . apply to the Secretary of the Interior for an allotment of land. . . .  And the Secretary of the Interior may reserve from settlement, entry, or purchase any tract . . . upon which any village or settlement of Indians is now located, and may set apart the same for the permanent use and occupation of said village or settlement of Indians.""
The Act further provided that proceeds from the sale of the lands
""shall constitute a fund . . . for the maintenance and education of the Indians now residing on said lands and their children.""
Held:  The Klamath River Reservation was not 
Page 412 U. S. 482
 terminated by the Act of June 17, 1892, and the land within the reservation boundaries is still Indian country within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.  1151.  Pp.  412 U. S. 494-506.
(a) The allotment provisions of the 1892 Act, rather than indicating an intention to terminate the reservation, are completely consistent with continued reservation status.  Seymour v. Superintendent, 368 U. S. 351.  Pp.  412 U. S. 496-497.
(b) The reference in the Act to the Klamath River Reservation in the past tense did not manifest a congressional purpose to terminate the reservation, but was merely a convenient way of identifying the land, which had just recently been included in the Hoopa Valley Reservation.  Pp.  412 U. S. 498-499.
(c) The Act's legislative history does not support the view that the reservation was terminated, but, by contrast with the final enactment, it compels the conclusion that efforts to terminate by denying allotments to the Indians failed completely.  Pp.  412 U. S. 499-504.
(d) A congressional determination to terminate a reservation must be expressed on the face of the statute or be clear from the surrounding circumstances and legislative history, neither of which obtained here.  Pp.  412 U. S. 504-505.
(e) The conclusion that the 1892 Act did not terminate the Reservation is reinforced by repeated recognition thereafter by the Department of the Interior and by the Congress.  Congress has recognized the reservation's continued existence by extending, in 1942, the period of trust allotments, and, in 1958, by restoring to tribal ownership certain vacant and undisposed-of ceded lands in the reservation.

No. 72-658
Argued April 18, 1973
Decided June 11, 1973
412 U.S. 507

Syllabus 
Appellees, who, apparently because of alleged nude dancing at their retail liquor establishments, were denied renewal of their one-year liquor licenses, brought suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief against the cities of Racine and Kenosha.  Appellees claimed deprivation of procedural due process arising from the cities' failure to hold full-blown adversary hearings before refusing to issue license renewals, and the unconstitutionality of the local licensing scheme.  The Wisconsin Attorney General intervened as a party defendant in the proceedings.  The cases were submitted on cross-motions for summary judgment and stipulations of fact.  A three-judge District Court held that, in light of the ""equitable nature"" of the actions, it had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1343, and the court declared the statutory scheme unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement.
Held:
1. A city is not a ""person"" under 42 U.S.C.  1983 where equitable relief is sought, any more than it is where damages are sought, Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167,  365 U. S. 187, and the District Court, therefore, erred in concluding that it had jurisdiction over the complaints under 28 U.S.C.  1343 since only the two municipalities were named as defendants.  Pp.  412 U. S. 511-513.
2. The District Court, on remand, should consider the jurisdictional questions presented by the State Attorney General's intervention and the availability of 28 U.S.C.  1331 jurisdiction, as well as the decisions in Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, and Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, which are germane to the due process issue, and the supervening decision in California v. LaRue, 409 U.

No. 72-656
Argued April 24, 1973
Decided June 11, 1973
412 U.S. 521

Syllabus 
Petitioners, claiming that their son's suicide while he was confined as a federal prisoner in a county jail was proximately caused by the negligence of Government agents and employees, brought suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which establishes Government liability for negligent acts or omissions of an ""employee of the Government,"" defined, inter alia, as a person officially ""acting on behalf of a federal agency . . . with or without compensation.""  The Act excludes any contractor with the United States from the definition of federal agency.  Though finding that the county had contracted with the Federal Government to house federal prisoners in its jail, the District Court held that the Government was liable on the grounds that the sheriff's employees negligently failed to maintain adequate surveillance of the decedent (who had attempted suicide while initially incarcerated), and that the Deputy United States Marshal negligently failed specifically to arrange for constant surveillance.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the grounds that, under the ""contractor"" exclusion, the United States was not accountable for the negligence of the sheriff's employees, and those employees were not acting on behalf of a federal agency in an official capacity within the meaning of the Act.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that, contrary to petitioners' contention, the deputy marshal had no authority to control the activities of the sheriff's employees, and that the jail was a ""contractor,"" not a ""Federal agency,"" within the meaning of the Act; and the statutory authorization for the housing of federal prisoners in state facilities clearly contemplated that the day-to-day operation of the contractor's facilities was to be in the contractor's, not the Government's, hands.  Pp.  412 U. S. 526-530.
2. Petitioners' alternative contention that, even though the sheriff's employees might not be ""employees"" of a federal agency, they might nonetheless be ""acting on behalf of a Federal agency in an official capacity,"" and thus ""employee[s] of the Government"" within the meaning of the Act, is not consistent with the legislative purpose of the Act.  Pp.  412 U. S. 530-532.

3. The Court of Appeals, not having given consideration to the question of the deputy marshal's negligence apart from other issues, should address itself to that question on remand.  Pp.  412 U. S. 532-533.

No. 59, Orig.
Argued April 16, 1973
Decided June 11, 1973
412 U.S. 534

Syllabus 
The United States asks leave to file a bill of complaint against California and Nevada seeking a declaration of the respective rights of the parties in the Truckee River, which flows through part of California into Nevada, terminating in Pyramid Lake.  The complaint states that the United States created a reservation in 1859 for the Paiute Indian Tribe that included Pyramid Lake, and that the lake level has declined since 1906 due chiefly to upstream uses and diversions, making it imperative that the Government's prior right to sufficient water to maintain the lake be judicially declared.  By decree entered in 1944, in United States v. Orr Water Ditch Co., the Government was authorized to divert Truckee River water for a reclamation project upstream from Pyramid Lake, and its prior right was declared to sufficient Truckee River water to irrigate certain bottom land and bench land on the Pyramid Lake Reservation.  The defendant States have made a compact, which is the subject of bills pending in Congress, respecting their shares of Truckee River water.
Held:   The motion to file the bill of complaint is denied without prejudice to refiling it if the posture of the litigation should change in a manner that presents a more substantial basis for the exercise of original jurisdiction.  Pp.  412 U. S. 537-540.
(a) There being no controversy between California and Nevada, the dispute is between the United States and two States, over which the Court has original, but not exclusive, jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1251(b)(2).  P.  412 U. S. 537.
(b) The Court seeks to exercise its original jurisdiction sparingly, especially where the plaintiff has another adequate forum in which to settle his claim.  P.  412 U. S. 538.
(c) The disputes over the Orr Water Ditch decree and the existence of prior water rights concerning the Pyramid Lake Reservation involve competing claims within Nevada, over which the District Court has jurisdiction.  Any possible dispute between the United States and California respecting Pyramid Lake water rights is remote, and any dispute with California concerning water

The United States brought this action contesting the validity of appellee Tax Commission's regulation requiring out-of-state liquor distillers and suppliers to collect and remit to the Commission a wholesale markup on liquor sold to military officers' clubs and other nonappropriated fund activities located on bases within Mississippi, over two of which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction, and the remaining two of which concurrent jurisdiction.  Relying on the Twenty-first Amendment, the District Court upheld the regulation.
Held:
1. The Twenty-first Amendment does not empower a State to tax or otherwise regulate the importation of distilled spirits into a territory over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction, Collins v. Yosemite Park & Curry Co., 304 U. S. 518, regardless of whether some of the liquor may have been consumed off base.  Pp.  412 U. S. 369-378.
2. Whether the markup can be viewed as a sales tax to whose imposition in the context of the two exclusive jurisdiction bases the United States has consented under the Buck Act and whether, in any event, the markup unconstitutionally taxes federal instrumentalities, and violates the Supremacy Clause as conflicting with federal procurement regulations and policy are issues that the District Court did not reach and should consider initially on remand.

No. 72-90
Argued February 26, 1973
Decided June 4, 1973
412 U.S. 401

Syllabus 
In this refund suit, respondent railroad seeks to recover an alleged income tax overpayment resulting from its failure to take deductions for depreciation with respect to the cost of facilities constructed at highway-railroad intersections and elsewhere that were paid for not by respondent, but out of Government funds appropriated to further public safety and improve highway systems.  Respondent claimed that the subsidies qualified as contributions to its capital by a nonshareholder under  113(a)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, thereby permitting respondent to depreciate the Government's cost in the assets.  The Court of Claims ruled that respondent was entitled to the claimed depreciation deduction.
Held:   The governmental subsidies did not constitute contributions to respondent's capital within the meaning of  113(a)(8); the assets in question have a zero basis, and respondent cannot claim a depreciation allowance with respect to those assets.  As can be gleaned from Detroit Edison Co. v. Commissioner, 319 U. S. 98, and Brown Shoe Co. v. Commissioner, 339 U. S. 583, to qualify as a nonshareholder contribution to capital, the asset must become a permanent part of the transferee's working capital structure; may not be compensation for the transferee's services; must be bargained for; must benefit the transferee commensurately with its value; and ordinarily will be used to produce additional income.  Here, almost none of these criteria was met, since the facilities were not bargained for, and, but for the governmental subsidies, would not have been constructed.  No substantial incremental benefit in terms of income production was considered at the time the facilities were transferred, and such minor benefit as may have accrued to respondent from the facilities was merely peripheral to the railroad's business.  Nor would respondent's asserted obligation to replace the facilities warrant the claimed depreciation.  Pp.  412 U. S. 405-416.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who had been given a suspended sentence for manslaughter and placed on probation for four years, with a condition that ""all arrests for any reason must be reported without delay,"" was thereafter involved in an automobile accident in Arkansas, for which he received a traffic citation.  Eleven days later, he mentioned the citation to his probation officer, who notified respondent judge.  At a hearing, the prosecutor and the probation officer recommended continued probation but respondent, stating that the failure to report the accident and the citation was not in ""strict compliance with the terms of the probation,"" revoked probation and sentenced petitioner to jail on the original counts.  The Missouri Supreme Court denied a writ of prohibition.
Held:   The issuance of the traffic citation was not an ""arrest"" under either Missouri or Arkansas law, and the finding that petitioner had violated his probation conditions was so totally devoid of evidentiary support as to violate due process.  Even were it clear that respondent held Missouri law to be that a traffic citation is the equivalent of an arrest, such an unforeseeable holding, retroactively applied, would also deprive petitioner of due process.  Certiorari granted; 485 S.W.2d 609, reversed and remanded.

Democratic National Committee
No. 71-863
Argued October 16, 1972
Decided May 29, 1973*
412 U.S. 94

Syllabus 
The Democratic National Committee requested a declaratory ruling from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that the Communications Act or the First Amendment precluded a licensee from having a general policy of refusing to sell time to ""responsible entities"" to present their views on public issues.  The Business Executives' Move for Vietnam Peace filed a complaint with the FCC, alleging that a broadcaster had violated the First Amendment by refusing to sell it time to broadcast spot announcements expressing the group's views on the Vietnam conflict, and that the station's coverage of anti-war views did not meet the requirements of the Fairness Doctrine.  The FCC rejected the Fairness Doctrine challenge, and ruled that a broadcaster was not prohibited from having a policy of refusing to accept paid editorial advertisements by individuals and organizations like respondents.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that ""a flat ban on paid public issue announcements is in violation of the First Amendment, at least when other sorts of paid announcements are accepted,"" and remanded the causes to the FCC to develop regulations governing which, and how many, editorial announcements would be aired.
Held:  Neither the Communications Act nor the First Amendment requires broadcasters to accept paid editorial advertisements.  Pp.  412 U. S. 101-114;  412 U. S. 121-170.
146 U.S.App.D.C. 181, 450 F.2d 642, reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and IV, finding that:
1. The basic criterion governing use of broadcast frequencies is the right of the public to be informed; the manner by which this 
Page 412 U. S. 95
 interest is best served is dispositive of the respondents' statutory and First Amendment contentions.  Pp.  412 U. S. 101-114.
(a) In evaluating respondents' claims, great weight must be afforded the decisions of Congress and the experience of the FCC.  Pp.  412 U. S. 101-103.
(b) Congress has consistently rejected efforts to impose on broadcasters a ""common carrier"" right of access for all persons wishing to speak out on public issues.  Instead, it reposed in the FCC regulatory authority by which the Fairness Doctrine was evolved to require that the broadcaster's coverage of important public issues must be adequate and must fairly reflect differing viewpoints; thus, no private individual or group has a right to command the use of broadcast facilities.  Pp.  412 U. S. 103-114.
2. The ""public interest"" standard of the Communications Act, which incorporates First Amendment principles, does not require broadcasters to accept editorial advertisements.  Pp.  412 U. S. 121-131.
(a) The FCC was justified in concluding that the public interest, in having access to the marketplace of ""ideas and experiences,"" would not be served by ordering a right of access to advertising time.  There is substantial risk that such a system would be monopolized by those who could and would pay the costs, that the effective operation of the Fairness Doctrine itself would be undermined, and that the public accountability which now rests with the broadcaster would be diluted.  Pp.  412 U. S. 121-125.
(b) The difficult problems involved in implementing an absolute right of access would inevitably implicate the FCC in a case-by-case determination of who should be heard and when, thus enlarging the involvement of the Government in broadcasting operations.  The FCC could properly take into account the fact that listeners and viewers constitute a kind of ""captive audience,"" and that the public interest requires that a substantial degree of journalistic discretion must remain with broadcasters.  Pp.  412 U. S. 126-130.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded, in Part III, that a broadcast licensee's refusal to accept a paid editorial advertisement does not constitute ""governmental action"" for First Amendment purposes.  The Government is neither a ""partner"" to the action complained of nor engaged in a ""symbiotic relationship"" with the licensee.  Pp.  412 U. S. 114-121.
(a) Under the Communications Act, a broadcast licensee is vested with substantial journalistic discretion in deciding how to meet its statutory obligations as a ""public trustee.""  Pp.  412 U. S. 114-117. 
Page 412 U. S. 96

(b) The licensee's policy against accepting editorial advertising is compatible with the Communications Act and with the broadcaster's obligation to provide a balanced treatment of controversial questions.  Pp.  412 U. S. 118-121.
(c) The FCC has not fostered the licensee policy against accepting editorial advertisements; it has merely declined to command acceptance because the subject was a matter within the area of journalistic discretion.  P.  412 U. S. 118.
BURGER, C.J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered an opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and IV, in which WHITE, BLACKMUN, POWELL, and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined, and in which as to Parts I, II, and III STEWART and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined.

Decided May 29, 1973
412 U.S. 291

Syllabus 
Over respondent's protest and without a warrant, police in the course of station house questioning in connection with a murder took samples from the respondent's fingernails and discovered evidence used to convict him.  Respondent had come to the station house voluntarily, and had not been arrested, although he was detained and there was probable cause to believe that he had committed the murder.  In reversing the District Court's denial of habeas corpus, the Court of Appeals concluded that, absent arrest or other exigent circumstances, the search was unconstitutional.
Held:   In view of the station house detention upon probable cause, the very limited intrusion undertaken to preserve highly evanescent evidence was not violative of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  412 U. S. 293-296.

Argued December 13, 1972
Decided May 29, 1973
412 U.S. 306

Syllabus 
Petitioners, parents of District of Columbia (D.C.) school children, brought this action seeking damages and declaratory and injunctive relief for invasion of privacy that they claimed resulted from the dissemination of a congressional report on the D.C. school system that included identification of students in derogatory contexts.  The named defendants included members of a House committee, Committee employees, a Committee investigator, and a consultant; the Public Printer and the Superintendent of Documents; and officials and employees connected with the school system.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the complaint on the grounds that the first two categories of defendants were immune by reason of the Speech or Debate Clause, and that the D.C. officials and the legislative employees were protected by the official immunity doctrine recognized in Barr v. Matteo, 360 U. S. 564.
Held:
1. The congressional committee members, members of their staff, the consultant, and the investigator are absolutely immune under the Speech or Debate Clause insofar as they engaged in the legislative acts of compiling the report, referring it to the House, or voting for its publication.  Pp.  412 U. S. 311-313.
2. The Clause does not afford absolute immunity from private suit to persons who, with authorization from Congress, perform the function, which is not part of the legislative process, of publicly distributing materials that allegedly infringe upon the rights of individuals.  The Court of Appeals, therefore, erred in holding that respondents who (except for the Committee members and personnel) were charged with such public distribution were protected by the Clause.  Pp.  412 U. S. 313-318.
3. The Public Printer and the Superintendent of Documents are protected by the doctrine of official immunity enunciated in Barr v. Matteo, supra, for publishing and distributing the report only to the extent that they served legitimate legislative functions in doing so, and the Court of Appeals erred in holding that their immunity extended beyond that limit.  Pp.  412 U. S. 318-324.

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of violating 26 U.S.C.  7206(1), which makes it a felony when one ""[w]illfully makes and subscribes any return . . . which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter,"" after the District Court refused a lesser included offense jury charge under  7207, which makes it a misdemeanor when one ""willfully delivers or discloses"" to the Internal Revenue Service any return or document ""known by him to be fraudulent or to be false as to any material matter.""  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that ""willfully,"" as used in  7206, implied an evil motive and bad faith, but the same word, as used in  7207, required only a showing of unreasonable, capricious, or careless disregard for the truth.
Held:   The word ""willfully"" has the same meaning in  7206(1) and 7207, connoting the voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty, and the distinction between the statutes is found in the additional misconduct that is essential to the violation of the felony provision; hence, the District Court properly refused the requested lesser included offense instruction based on respondent's erroneous contention that the word ""willfully"" in the misdemeanor statute implied less scienter than the same word in the felony statute.

Syllabus 
Respondent, expelled from his union for deliberate and malicious vilification of union management following his resolutions unsuccessfully condemning that management's alleged undemocratic actions and shortsighted policies, regained his union membership in a suit under  102 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) and was awarded $5,500 in legal fees.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Respondent's suit under  102 of the LMRDA vindicated not only his own rights of free speech guaranteed by the statute but furthered the interests of the union and its members as well.  As a result, the award to respondent of attorneys' fees under these circumstances comported with the trial court's inherent equitable power of making such an award whenever ""overriding considerations indicate the need for such a recovery.""

Upon retrial following the reversal of his conviction, petitioner was again found guilty and sentenced by the jury to a greater term than had been imposed by the first jury.

Syllabus 
Where the Union's constitution and bylaws are silent on the subject of voluntary resignation from the Union, the Union committed an unfair labor practice when it sought court enforcement of fines imposed for strike-breaking activities by employees who had resigned from the Union, even though the Union constitution expressly prohibited members from strike-breaking.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 21, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was 16 years old at the time of his arrest and at the time of his indictment for armed robbery of a post office. He was charged as an adult under 16 D.C.Code 2301(3)(A).* He 
Page 412 U.S. 909 , 910
 moved to dismiss the indictment, alleging that the statutory basis for prosecuting him as an adult failed to provide him with procedural due process. The District Court, 330 F.Supp. 34, dismissed the indictment and the Court of Appeals, 472 F.2d 1329, by a divided vote reversed that judgment. 
 Under the statute of the District of Columbia involved in Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541, a juvenile, age 16 or older, who is charged with a felony might be held for trial as though he were an adult, if the Juvenile Court waived jurisdiction. Kent held that the Act, read in light of 'the essentials of due process and fair treatment,' Id., at 562, 557, 86 S.Ct. at 1057, required a hearing on whether the Juvenile Court should waive its exclusive jurisdiction over the juvenile and transfer him to the criminal court of the District. And in In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, we held that where under a state junvenile court act a juvenile is declared 'delinquent' and either confined or held for regular criminal prosecution, there must be a due process hearing on the issue of 'delinquency.' 
 The District of Columbia Act was modified after Kent so as to give the U. S. Attorney the power to remove a juvenile from the statutory category of 'child' merely by charging him with a designated felony. The House Report No. 91-907, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., at 50, explains the reason for the change:

Syllabus 
After the District Court refused respondent's offers of proof of reliance on Army Corps of Engineers regulations limiting violations to those impeding navigation, respondent was convicted of violating  13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 by discharging industrial pollutants into a navigable river.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that  13 did not apply absent formalized permit procedures or, alternatively, that respondent should have been allowed to prove that it was affirmatively misled by the Corps of Engineers' regulations to believe that no permit was needed for these industrial pollutants.
Held:
1. Section 13 prohibitions apply without regard to formalized permit procedures that it authorizes but does not mandate, and Congress did not intend to permit discharges specifically prohibited by  13 when it enacted the 1965 and 1970 water quality acts directing States to create pollution prevention and abatement programs.  Pp.  411 U. S. 662-670.
2. Although  13 bars all discharges of pollutants, and not only those that constitute obstructions to navigation, the Corps of Engineers consistently limited its regulations to such obstructions, and thus may have deprived respondent of fair warning as to what conduct the Government intended to make criminal.

Syllabus 
A married woman Air Force officer (hereafter appellant) sought increased benefits for her husband as a ""dependent"" under 37 U.S.C.  401, 403, and 10 U.S.C.  1072, 1076.  Those statutes provide, solely for administrative convenience, that spouses of male members of the uniformed services are dependents for purposes of obtaining increased quarters allowances and medical and dental benefits, but that spouses of female members are not dependents unless they are in fact, dependent for over one-half of their support.  When her application was denied for failure to satisfy the statutory dependency standard, appellant and her husband brought this suit in District Court, contending that the statutes deprived servicewomen of due process.  From that Court's adverse ruling, they took a direct appeal.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  411 U. S. 682-691;  411 U. S. 691-692.

No. 72-10
Argued February 27, 1973
Decided May 14, 1973
411 U.S. 693

Syllabus 
Petitioners Moor and Rundle brought damages actions in the District Court against respondents, several law enforcement officers and Alameda County.  Against the County they alleged federal causes of action under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C.  1983 and 1988, and pendent state claims under the state tort claims statute, the federal, as well as the state, causes of action being grounded on the theory that the County was vicariously liable under state law for the officers' acts.  Both petitioners alleged federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1343 and Moor, additionally, on diversity grounds.  The County moved to dismiss in each case, contending that, as to the Civil Rights Act claims, it was not a suable ""person"" under Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167; that, absent a claim against it as to which there exists an independent basis of federal jurisdiction, application of the pendent jurisdiction doctrine with respect to the state law claims would be inappropriate; and that, in Moor's suit, it was not a ""citizen"" for federal diversity purposes.  The District Court granted the motions to dismiss, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Section 1988, as is clear from its legislative history, does not independently create a federal cause of action for the violation of federal civil rights, and to apply that provision here by imposing vicarious liability upon the County would contravene the holding in Monroe v. Pape, supra, and Congress' intent to exclude a State's political subdivision from civil liability under  1983.  Pp.  411 U. S. 698-710.
2.

			"|"Moor v. County of Alameda
No. 72-10
Argued February 27, 1973
Decided May 14, 1973
411 U.S. 693

Syllabus 
Petitioners Moor and Rundle brought damages actions in the District Court against respondents, several law enforcement officers and Alameda County.  Against the County they alleged federal causes of action under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C.  1983 and 1988, and pendent state claims under the state tort claims statute, the federal, as well as the state, causes of action being grounded on the theory that the County was vicariously liable under state law for the officers' acts.  Both petitioners alleged federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1343 and Moor, additionally, on diversity grounds.  The County moved to dismiss in each case, contending that, as to the Civil Rights Act claims, it was not a suable ""person"" under Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167; that, absent a claim against it as to which there exists an independent basis of federal jurisdiction, application of the pendent jurisdiction doctrine with respect to the state law claims would be inappropriate; and that, in Moor's suit, it was not a ""citizen"" for federal diversity purposes.  The District Court granted the motions to dismiss, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Section 1988, as is clear from its legislative history, does not independently create a federal cause of action for the violation of federal civil rights, and to apply that provision here by imposing vicarious liability upon the County would contravene the holding in Monroe v. Pape, supra, and Congress' intent to exclude a State's political subdivision from civil liability under  1983.  Pp.  411 U. S. 698-710.
2. Even assuming, arguendo, that the District Court had judicial power to exercise pendent jurisdiction over petitioners' state law claims which would require that the County be brought in as a new party defendant, against which petitioners could not state a federally cognizable claim, in addition to the individual defendants against whom they could assert such a claim, the court did not abuse its discretion in not exercising that power in view of unsettled questions of state law that it would have been called upon to resolve and the likelihood of jury confusion resulting from

No. 71-1178
Argued December 5, 1972
Decided May 14, 1973
411 U.S. 747

Syllabus 
Following petitioner's application under  204 of the Federal Power Act to respondent Federal Power Commission (FPC) for authorization of a bond issue, two intervening cities opposed the authorization on the ground that the proceeds of the bond issue would be used to finance or refinance certain anticompetitive activities in violation of the antitrust laws, the Federal Power Act, and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.  Section 204(a) empowers the FPC to authorize a security issue only if the issue is found to be for some lawful purpose and compatible with the public interest.  The FPC granted the cities' petition to intervene, denied their request for a hearing, and authorized the bond issue, holding that the cities' allegations were irrelevant to a requested authorization of securities under  204.  The Court of Appeals remanded the case for consideration of the cities' claim, holding that, in line with the reasoning in Denver  R. G. W. R. Co. v. United States, 387 U. S. 485, the FPC should have considered the alleged competitive consequences of the bond issue in the  204 proceeding.
Held:
1. The FPC, as a general rule, must consider the anticompetitive consequences of a security issue under  204.  Pp.  411 U. S. 756-762.
(a) The Federal Power Act did not render antitrust policy irrelevant to the FPC's regulation of the electric power industry.  Pp.  411 U. S. 757-759.
(b) The fact that the FPC has broad authority under other provisions of the Act to determine whether a public utility's conduct is in the public interest does not mean that the same standard is not equally germane under  204.  P.  411 U. S. 759.
(c) Consideration of antitrust policies in the context of  204 provides a first line of defense against anticompetitive practices that might later become the subject of an antitrust proceeding.  P.  411 U. S. 760.
(d) The FPC, like the Interstate Commerce Commission, has broad regulatory authority, which includes responsibility for considering

 antitrust policy in discharging its statutory obligations.  Cf. Denver & R. G. W. R. Co. v. United States, supra.  Pp.  411 U. S. 760-762.
2. Though the FPC is not necessarily required to hold a hearing or make a full investigation in all cases, its summary disposition of proffered objections to the security issue requires strict scrutiny by a reviewing court in light of the Commission's obligations to protect the public interest and enforce the antitrust laws.

Syllabus 
Respondent, a felony probationer, was arrested after committing a burglary.  He admitted involvement in the crime, but later claimed that the admission was made under duress, and was false.  The probation of respondent, who was not represented by an attorney, was revoked without a hearing.  After filing a habeas corpus petition, he was paroled.  The District Court concluded that revocation of probation without hearing and counsel was a denial of due process.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Due process mandates preliminary and final revocation hearings in the case of a probationer under the same conditions as are specified in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, in the case of a parolee.  Pp.  411 U. S. 781-782.
2. The body conducting the hearings should decide in each individual case whether due process requires that an indigent probationer or parolee be represented by counsel.  Though the State is not constitutionally obliged to provide counsel in all cases, it should do so where the indigent probationer or parolee may have difficulty in presenting his version of disputed facts without the examination or cross-examination of witnesses or the presentation of complicated documentary evidence.  Presumptively, counsel should be provided where, after being informed of his right, the probationer or parolee requests counsel, based on a timely and colorable claim that he has not committed the alleged violation or, if the violation is a matter of public record or uncontested, there are substantial reasons in justification or mitigation that make revocation inappropriate.

No. 72-490
Argued March 28, 1973
Decided May 14, 1973
411 U.S. 792

Syllabus 
Respondent, a black civil rights activist, engaged in disruptive and illegal activity against petitioner as part of his protest that his discharge as an employee of petitioner's and the firm's general hiring practices were racially motivated.  When petitioner, who subsequently advertised for qualified personnel, rejected respondent's reemployment application on the ground of the illegal conduct, respondent filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charging violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The EEOC found that there was reasonable cause to believe that petitioner's rejection of respondent violated  704(a) of the Act, which forbids discrimination against applicants or employees for attempting to protest or correct allegedly discriminatory employment conditions, but made no finding on respondent's allegation that petitioner had also violated  703(a)(1), which prohibits discrimination in any employment decision.  Following unsuccessful EEOC conciliation efforts, respondent brought suit in the District Court, which ruled that respondent's illegal activity was not protected by  704(a) and dismissed the  703(a)(1) claim because the EEOC had made no finding with respect thereto.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the  704(a) ruling, but reversed with respect to  703(a)(1), holding that an EEOC determination of reasonable cause was not a jurisdictional prerequisite to claiming a violation of that provision in federal court.
Held:
1. A complainant's right to bring suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not confined to charges as to which the EEOC has made a reasonable cause finding, and the District Court's error in holding to the contrary was not harmless, since the issues raised with respect to  703(a)(1) were not identical to those with respect to  704(a), and the dismissal of the former charge may have prejudiced respondent's efforts at trial.  Pp.  411 U. S. 798-800.
2. In a private, non-class action complaint under Title VII charging racial employment discrimination, the complainant has the burden of establishing a prima facie case, which he can satisfy by showing that (i) he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) he 
Page 411 U. S. 793
 applied and was qualified for a job the employer was trying to fill; (iii) though qualified, he was rejected; and (iv) thereafter the employer continued to seek applicants with complainant's qualifications.  P.  411 U. S. 802.
3. Here, the Court of Appeals, though correctly holding that respondent proved a prima facie case, erred in holding that petitioner had not discharged its burden of proof in rebuttal by showing that its stated reason for the rehiring refusal was based on respondent's illegal activity.  But on remand, respondent must be afforded a fair opportunity of proving that petitioner's stated reason was just a pretext for a racially discriminatory decision, such as by showing that whites engaging in similar illegal activity were retained or hired by petitioner.  Other evidence that may be relevant, depending on the circumstances, could include facts that petitioner had discriminated against respondent when he was an employee or followed a discriminatory policy toward minority employees.

411 U.S. 475

Syllabus 
Respondents were state prisoners who had elected to participate in New York's conditional release program, by which a prisoner serving an indeterminate sentence may earn up to 10 days per month good behavior time credits toward reduction of his maximum sentence.  For in-prison disciplinary reasons, the good time credits of each were canceled.  Each respondent brought a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C.  1983, in conjunction with a habeas corpus action, claiming that his credits were unconstitutionally canceled and seeking their restoration.  The District Court in each case viewed the habeas corpus claim merely as an adjunct to the civil rights action, thus obviating the need for exhaustion of state remedies, and, on the merits, ruled for the respondent, a ruling that, in each case, entitled him to immediate release on parole.  The Court of Appeals consolidated the actions and affirmed.
Held:  When a state prisoner challenges the fact or duration of his physical imprisonment and, by way of relief, seeks a determination that he is entitled to immediate release or a speedier release, his sole federal remedy is a writ of habeas corpus.  Pp.  411 U. S. 488-499.
(a) Although the broad language of  1983 seems literally to apply, Congress' enactment of the specific federal habeas corpus statute, with its requirement that a state prisoner exhaust state remedies, was intended to provide the exclusive means of relief in this type of situation.  Pp.  411 U. S. 488-490.
(b) The policy of exhaustion in federal habeas corpus actions, which is rooted in considerations of federal state comity, has as much relevance in an attack on the actions of the state prison administration as it does in an attack on the actions of a state court; and that policy applies here, where respondents sought no damages, but only a ruling that they were entitled to immediate release or a speedier release.  Pp.  411 U. S. 490-494.
(c) Recent decisions of the Court relied on by respondents, upholding state prisoners' civil rights actions, are inapposite to the situation here, for the prisoners in those cases challenged only

Argued February 21-22, 1973
Decided May 7, 1973
411 U.S. 526

Syllabus 
On November 5, 1971, the State of Georgia submitted to the Attorney General for consideration under  5 of the Voting Rights Act its 1971 House reapportionment plan.  Two weeks later, the Attorney General requested additional information, which was received on January 6, 1972.  On March 3, the Attorney General, after citing the combination, inter alia, of multi-member districts, majority runoff elections, and numbered posts, objected to the plan, being unable to conclude that it did not have a discriminatory racial effect on voting.  The state legislature then enacted its superseding 1972 plan, which was submitted on March 15 and rejected by the Attorney General on March 24 as not overcoming previous objections.  The United States brought this suit to enjoin the holding of elections under the 1972 plan after the legislature decided against a new reapportionment.  A three-judge District Court held that the 1972 plan came under  5 of the Act, and issued an injunction.
Held:
1. Georgia's 1972 reapportionment changes, which have the potential for diluting Negro voting power, are ""standards, practices, or procedures with respect to voting"" within the meaning of  5 of the Voting Rights Act, cf. Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U. S. 544.  Pp.  411 U. S. 531-535.
2. The Attorney General, applying a permissible regulation, placed the burden on Georgia as the submitting party to prove that the plan did not have a racially discriminatory purpose or effect on voting, and the State failed to meet that burden.  Pp.  411 U. S. 536-539.
3. Georgia's claim that the Attorney General did not seasonably object to the 1971 plan may well be moot in view of his timely objection to the superseding 1972 plan, but, in any event, that claim lacks merit, as the Attorney General's regulation that the statutory 60-day period begins to run from the time that necessary information is furnished is reasonable, and comports with the Act.  Pp.  411 U. S. 539-541.
4. Elections having been conducted under the 1972 plan under this Court's stay order, new elections are not required, but future 
Page 411 U. S. 527
 elections under that plan will be enjoined until a plan withstanding  5 clearance procedures is submitted.  P.  411 U. S. 541.

Appellees, licensed optometrists employed by Lee Optical Co., who were not members of the Alabama Optometric Association (Association), were charged by the Association with unprofessional conduct within the meaning of the state optometry statute because of their employment with the company.  The complaint was filed with the Alabama Board of Optometry (Board), all members of which were Association members.  The Board deferred proceedings while a suit it had brought against Lee Optical and optometrists employed by it to enjoin the company from practicing optometry was litigated in the state trial court.  The charges against the individual defendants were dismissed but the court enjoined Lee Optical from engaging in the practice of optometry.  The company appealed.  When the Board revived the Association's charges against appellees, they sought an injunction in the Federal District Court under the Civil Rights Act claiming that the Board was biased.  The court concluded that it was not barred from acting by the federal anti-injunction statute, since only administrative proceedings were involved, and that exhaustion of administrative remedies was not mandated where the administrative process was biased in that the Board, by its litigation in the state courts, had prejudged the case against appellees, and the Board members had an indirect pecuniary interest in the outcome.  The District Court enjoined the Board proceedings, but, thereafter and before this appeal was taken, the State's highest court reversed the judgment against Lee Optical and held that the optometry law did not prohibit a licensed optometrist from working for a corporation.
Held:
1. The anti-injunction statute did not bar the District Court from issuing the injunction, since appellees brought suit under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Pp.  411 U. S. 572-575.
2. Nor did the rule of Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, or principles of comity require the District Court to dismiss appellees' suit in view of the pending Board proceeding, since the appellees 
Page 411 U. S. 565
 alleged and the District Court concluded that the Board's bias rendered it incompetent to adjudicate the issues.  Pp.  411 U. S. 575-577.
3. Since the Board was composed solely of private practitioners and the corporate employees it sought to bar from practice constituted half the optometrists in the State, the District Court was warranted in concluding that the Board members' pecuniary interest disqualified them from passing on the issues.  Pp.  411 U. S. 578-579.
4. Though the District Court did not abuse its discretion in not abstaining until the Lee Optical decision was rendered by the Alabama Supreme Court, the principles of equity, comity, and federalism warrant reconsideration of this case in the light of that decision.  Pp.  411 U. S. 579-581.

Syllabus 
During a tender offer campaign, respondent bought more than 10% of the outstanding stock of petitioner's predecessor (Old Kern).  Respondent was blocked in its takeover efforts by a defensive merger between Old Kern and Tenneco, in which Old Kern stockholders were to receive new Tenneco stock on a share-for-share basis.  Less than a month after its initial tender offer, respondent thereupon negotiated a binding option to sell to Tenneco at a date over six months after the tender offer expired all the new Tenneco stock to which respondent would be entitled when the merger took place.  Sale of the post-merger stock yielded respondent a profit of some $19 million, which petitioner sought to recover by a suit under  16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, prohibiting profitable short-swing speculation by statutory insiders.  The District Court's summary judgment for petitioner was reversed by the Court of Appeals.
Held:  The transactions, which were not based on a statutory insider's information and were not susceptible of the speculative abuse that  16(b) was designed to prevent, did not constitute ""sales"" within the meaning of that provision.  Pp.  411 U. S. 591-604.
(a) There was nothing in connection with respondent's tender offer acquisition of Old Kern stock or the exchange thereof for the Tenneco stock that gave respondent ""inside information,"" and once the merger, which respondent did not engineer, was approved, the Old Kern-Tenneco stock exchange was involuntary.  Pp.  411 U. S. 596-600.
(b) The option agreement was not of itself a ""sale""; the option was grounded on the mutual advantages to respondent as a minority stockholder that wanted to terminate an investment it had not chosen to make and Tenneco, whose management did not want a potentially troublesome minority stockholder; and the option was not a source of potential speculative abuse, since respondent had no inside information about Tenneco or its new stock.

 Rehearing Denied June 11, 1973. 
 See 412 U.S. 944. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN, Mr. Justice STEWART, and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted of larceny. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed. 241 A.2d 446. The United States Court of Appeals reversed the latter court, 133 U.S.APP.D.C. 337, 410 F.2d 1036, and remanded the case to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals for a ruling on the propriety of the trial court's instruction. That court held that the instructions had not been prejudicial and the United States Court of Appeals affirmed. Thereafter petitioner sought relief by way of coram nobis. The trial court dismissed the case without prejudice and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed. During the time petitioner's original or direct appeal was being considered by the court Frank Q. Nebeker was Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the Appellate Section in the office of the United States Attorney for the District. One of his duties was to review the appellate briefs submitted by that office of the appellate courts. His name was on the brief opposing petitioner on the appeal. He was named to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals by President Nixon in May of 1969. When the coram nobis action was brought to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals it was heard by a three-judge panel which included Nebeker. His prior role in the case was not brought to his attention and he doubtless was unaware of the fact that this case had been one of the fact that this he had processed while in the United States Attorney's office.

 Nonetheless Canon 3C(1)(b) of the recently adopted Code of Judicial Conduct provides: 
 This Canon, as it applies to this case, is merely a reflection of the basic concept of due process of law that a person should not serve as both prosecutor and judge. 
 The matter might not be considered of any great moment here if the three judges in the panel had taken part. But one of the three, Judge Yeagley, did not participate in the decision. Hence in one view there was only a single qualified judge sitting on the appeal. That fact makes singularly appropriate the suggestion of the Solicitor General that it may be just under the circumstances to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and remand for further proceedings. I would do just that. 
 Although this issue may not rise to the level of a constitutional question and there is no federal statute involved, we should take this action under our supervisory authority over the administration of justice in the federal courts. See, e. g., Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 452-453; McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 341; Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 341-342, 84 L.Ed.307.

 John R. GAYv. UNITED STATES.No. 72-5572. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 7, 1973
 Rehearing Denied June 11, 1973. 
 See 412 U.S. 944. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN, Mr. Justice STEWART, and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted of larceny. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed. 241 A.2d 446. The United States Court of Appeals reversed the latter court, 133 U.S.APP.D.C. 337, 410 F.2d 1036, and remanded the case to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals for a ruling on the propriety of the trial court's instruction. That court held that the instructions had not been prejudicial and the United States Court of Appeals affirmed. Thereafter petitioner sought relief by way of coram nobis. The trial court dismissed the case without prejudice and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed. During the time petitioner's original or direct appeal was being considered by the court Frank Q. Nebeker was Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the Appellate Section in the office of the United States Attorney for the District. One of his duties was to review the appellate briefs submitted by that office of the appellate courts. His name was on the brief opposing petitioner on the appeal.

Argued November 9, 1972

411 U.S. 356

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who contracted to purchase magazine subscriptions from respondent, brought this action in District Court, alleging that respondent had failed to comply with the disclosure provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, as implemented by Federal Reserve Board ""Regulation Z.""  The District Court found that respondent had failed to comply with Regulation Z, in that respondent had extended credit to petitioner, payable in more than four installments, without making the disclosures required by the Act.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Board had exceeded its statutory authority in issuing Regulation Z, since the regulation required disclosure in some credit transactions in which a finance charge had not been made, and, alternatively, that the regulation violated due process by creating a conclusive presumption that credit payments made in more than four installments included a finance charge.
Held:
1. The ""Four Installment Rule"" of Regulation Z is a valid exercise of the Federal Reserve Board's rulemaking authority under the Truth in Lending Act.  Pp.  411 U. S. 363-375.
(a) Congress, which was well aware that merchants could evade the disclosure requirements of the Act by concealing credit charges, gave the Board broad rulemaking power to prevent such evasion, and, in the exercise of that power, the Board issued the challenged rule to deal with the practice of concealing finance charges in the cash price of merchandise sold.  Pp.  411 U. S. 363-369.
(b) No conflict arises from the fact that the Act mentions disclosure only in regard to transactions in which a finance charge is imposed, while the disclosure requirements of the rule sometimes apply where no such charge exists, since Congress did not attempt to specify all types of situations under which the Board's regulations might apply, and the deterrent effect of the rule clearly implements the objectives of the Act.  Pp.  411 U. S. 372-373.
(c) The Board had authority to promulgate a general rule to 
Page 411 U. S. 357
 prevent circumvention, even if the rule embraces some transactions that the provisions of the Act might not, on their face, reach.  Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365.  Pp.  411 U. S. 373-374.
(d) Existence of penalty provisions in the Act does not require a narrow construction of the Act's nonpenalty provisions.  FCC v. American Broadcasting Co., 347 U. S. 284, distinguished.  Pp. 374-375.
2. Imposition, pursuant to  130 of the Act, of a minimum penalty of $100 in cases such as this where the finance charge is nonexistent or undetermined, but where disclosure has not been made, is a permissible sanction.  P.  411 U. S. 376.
3. In imposing a disclosure requirement on all members of a defined class to discourage evasion by a substantial portion of that class, the challenged regulation does not create a conclusive presumption violative of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  411 U. S. 376-377.

No. 72-11
Argued February 21, 1973
Decided April 24, 1973
411 U.S. 389

Syllabus 
Palmore was convicted of a felony in violation of the District of Columbia Code by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals, rejecting Palmore's contention that he was entitled to be tried by an Art. III judge with lifetime tenure and salary protection, affirmed, concluding that, under the plenary power to legislate for the District of Columbia conferred by Art. I,  8, cl. 17, of the Constitution, Congress had
""constitutional power to proscribe certain criminal conduct only in the District, and to select the appropriate court, whether it is created by virtue of article III or article I, to hear and determine . . . particular criminal cases within the District.""
Palmore seeks to invoke this Court's appellate jurisdiction on the basis of 28 U.S.C.  1257(2), which provides for an appeal to this Court from a final judgment upholding the validity of ""a statute of any state"" against a claim that it is repugnant to the Constitution.
Held:
1. The District of Columbia Code is not a state statute for purposes of  1257(2), and the lower court's upholding of the federal statute is therefore not reviewable by appeal, but by certiorari.  Pp.  411 U. S. 394-397.
2. Not every judicial proceeding that implicates a charge, claim, or defense based on an Act of Congress or a law made under its authority must be presided over by an Art. III judge.  Pp.  411 U. S. 397-410.
(a) The jurisdictional grant respecting ""such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish"" requires neither that only Art. III courts hear and decide cases within the judicial power of the United States nor that each inferior court be invested with all the jurisdiction flowing from Art. III, and federal criminal laws have been enforced by state, territorial, and military courts and judges who did not enjoy the Art. III protections.  Pp.  411 U. S. 397-404.
(b) The strictly local court system consisting of the Superior Court and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 23, 1973
 The motion to dispense with printing the jurisdictional statement is granted. The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN concurs, dissenting from dismissal. 
 Appellants, after exhausting administrative remedies, brought suit in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona to recover personal income tax assessments paid under protest for the years 1967-1969. The assessments in question were imposed on the income of the appellant 
Page 411 U.S. 941 , 942
 husband, which he earned while being employed first as a law clerk and then later as an attorney for the Navajo Tribe. Appellant's salary was paid out of Indian tribal funds. Appellants, who are not Indians, resided within the reservation. The Superior Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. 
 Appellant's employment was controlled by 25 U.S.C. 81, which governs the conditions under which contracts can be made with Indian tribes or Indians. Even more specifically, appellant's employment was subject to the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior in 25 CFR 72.1-72.25. Under these regulations, any attorney performing legal services for the Indian tribe must have his employment contract, which includes fees and expenses, approved by the Secretary of the Interior. (25 CFR 72.1.) In addition, in determining the appropriateness of the fees, the amount of tribal funds held in the tribal treasury, not otherwise appropriated and available for payment, must be considered. (25 CFR 72.5.) Tribal funds may not be used for payment of attorney fees and expenses in the absence of express authorization by Congress. (25 CFR 72. 6.) In order to be eligible to act as an attorney for an Indian tribe, the area director must review the applying attorney's references and qualifications and transmit a recommendation to the Secretary of the Interior. (25 CFR 72.4.) In order to be qualified to provide such representation, the attorney must be admitted to practice before the Department of the Interior and the bureaus thereof. (25 CFR 72.2.) An attorney performing legal services for an Indian tribe is subject to criminal penalties for the violation of the statutes governing attorney contracts with Indian tribes (18 U.S.C. 438), and can be fired by the Secretary of the Interior (Udall v.

 Edmund D. KAHN et ux.v. ARIZONA STATE TAX COMMISSION.No. 71-1263. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 23, 1973
 The motion to dispense with printing the jurisdictional statement is granted. The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN concurs, dissenting from dismissal. 
 Appellants, after exhausting administrative remedies, brought suit in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona to recover personal income tax assessments paid under protest for the years 1967-1969. The assessments in question were imposed on the income of the appellant 
Page 411 U.S. 941 , 942
 husband, which he earned while being employed first as a law clerk and then later as an attorney for the Navajo Tribe. Appellant's salary was paid out of Indian tribal funds. Appellants, who are not Indians, resided within the reservation. The Superior Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal. 
 Appellant's employment was controlled by 25 U.S.C. 81, which governs the conditions under which contracts can be made with Indian tribes or Indians. Even more specifically, appellant's employment was subject to the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior in 25 CFR 72.1-72.25. Under these regulations, any attorney performing legal services for the Indian tribe must have his employment contract, which includes fees and expenses, approved by the Secretary of the Interior. (25 CFR 72.1.) In addition, in determining the appropriateness of the fees, the amount of tribal funds held in the tribal treasury, not otherwise appropriated and available for payment, must be considered. (25 CFR 72.5.) Tribal funds may not be used for payment of attorney fees and expenses in the absence of express authorization by Congress. (25 CFR 72. 6.) In order to be eligible to act as an attorney for an Indian tribe, the area director must review the applying attorney's references and qualifications and transmit a recommendation to the Secretary of the Interior. (25 CFR 72.4.) In order to be qualified to provide such representation, the attorney must be admitted to practice before the Department of the Interior and the bureaus thereof. (25 CFR 72.2.) An attorney performing legal services for an Indian tribe is subject to criminal penalties for the violation of the statutes governing attorney contracts with Indian tribes (18 U.S.C. 438), and can be fired by the Secretary of the Interior (Udall v.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 23, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN concurs, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Petitioner was originally charged with removing a United States Treasury check from the mail, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1702, and uttering a forged United States check, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 495. After a jury trial, petitioner was convicted on the obstruction-of-the- mail charge but acquitted on the uttering charge. Thereafter, petitioner was granted a new trial. [Footnote 1] 

 Prior to the new trial, a superseding indictment was returned, which repeated the charge of removing a United States Treasury check from the mail in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1702, but charged forgery of a Treasury check in violation of 18 U.S.C. 495, rather than the uttering charge on which petitioner had been previously ac- 
Page 411 U.S. 952 , 953
 quitted. Petitioner moved to dismiss the forgery count, contending that his acquittal at the first trial on the charge of uttering a forged instrument barred the Government from proving, at a second trial, that he was the forger. The District Court denied the motion. The Government moved to dismiss the obstruction-of-the-mails charge. [Footnote 2] Petitioner waived his right to jury trial and on a stipulation to the facts alleged on this count was found guilty of forgery. 
 Petitioner urges that both the forgery and uttering charges should have been prosecuted in a single trial. I would agree. As was stated in the dissent in Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 452d 469. 'Given the tendency of modern criminal legislation to divide the phases of a criminal transaction into numerous separate crimes, the opportunities for multiple prosecutions for an essentially unitary criminal episode are frightening.' The instant action is a prime example of how the prosecution, with the hindsight of what developed at the initial trial, can thereafter choose another phase of the criminal transaction on which to indict a defendant and force him to go through the emotional and monetary strains of additional litigation. 
 I would adopt the interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause urged by the dissent in Ashe. Except in limited circumstances, the prosecution should be required to join in one trial all the charges against a single defendant which grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction. Only such an interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause will promote justice, economy, and convenience, as well as guard against [411 U.S. 952 , 954]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania for the Eastern District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 This case presents a question which this Court has not previously answered-under what circumstances a defendant, prior to sentencing, may withdraw a guilty plea. [Footnote 1] 
Page 411 U.S. 954 , 955
 Harold Neely, the petitioner, was indicted by a Berks County, Pennsylvania, grand jury on a charge of murder. [Footnote 2] Although petitioner initially pleaded not guilty at his arraignment on November 20, 1969, when his case was called for trial on March 23, 1970, he pleaded guilty on the advice of counsel and with the consent of the district attorney to the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter. There is no question that the trial judge, in accepting the plea, complied with the mandate of Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, that the record disclose that the plea was entered voluntarily and understandingly. At the same time, upon motion of the district attorney, the charge of murder was withdrawn. 
 On April 23, 1970, petitioner filed a petition for a rule to show cause why he would not be permitted to withdraw his plea. He alleged that the plea was induced upon advice of counsel 'that should the defendant take the witness stand in his own defense, he is the same as any other witness and his credibility is in issue, and that the Commonwealth therefore may introduce evidence of his prior criminal record of conviction . . ..'3 At the [411 U.S. 954 , 956]

Syllabus 
Petitioners, employees of state health facilities, brought suit for overtime pay due them under  16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and damages, which the District Court dismissed as being an unconsented action against the State of Missouri, and thus barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Although amendments to the FLSA in 1966 extended statutory coverage to state employees, the legislative history discloses no congressional purpose to deprive a State of its constitutional immunity to suit in a federal forum by employees of its nonprofit institutions, particularly since Congress made no change in  16(b), which makes no reference to suits by employees against the State.  Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184, distinguished.

411 U.S. 223

Syllabus 
Petitioners were convicted of transporting and conspiring to transport stolen goods in interstate commerce to their coconspirator, whose retail store was searched under a defective warrant while petitioners were in custody in another State.  The charges against petitioners were limited to acts committed before the day of the search.  At a pretrial hearing on petitioners' motion to suppress evidence seized at the store, petitioners alleged no proprietary or possessory interest in the store or the goods, and the District Court denied their motion for lack of standing.  At petitioners' trial, the seized goods were introduced into evidence.  In addition, police testimony as to statements by petitioners implicating each other were introduced into evidence in a manner contrary to Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the Bruton error was harmless in view of overwhelming independent proof of guilt, and affirmed the District Court's ruling on standing.
Held:
1. Petitioners had no standing to contest the admission of the evidence seized under the defective warrant, since they alleged no legitimate expectation of privacy or interest of any kind in the premises searched or the goods seized; they had no ""automatic"" standing under Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257, as the case against them did not depend on possession of the seized evidence at the time of the contested search and seizure, and they could not vicariously assert the personal Fourth Amendment right of the store owner in contesting admission of the seized goods.  Pp.  411 U. S. 227-230.
2. The testimony erroneously admitted was merely cumulative of other overwhelming and largely uncontroverted evidence properly before the jury, and the Bruton error was harmless.  Pp.  411 U. S. 230-232.

Decided April 17, 1973
411 U.S. 233

Syllabus 
Three years after his conviction for a federal crime, petitioner brought this collateral attack on the ground of unconstitutional discrimination in the composition of the grand jury that indicted him.  The District Court found that, though petitioner could have done so, he at no stage of the proceedings attacked the grand jury's composition, and it concluded that, under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 12(b)(2), he had waived his right to do so.  The court also determined that, since the challenged jury selection method had long obtained, the grand jury that indicted petitioner indicted his two white accomplices, and the case against petitioner was ""a strong one,"" there was no ""cause shown"" under the rule to grant relief from the waiver.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The waiver standard set forth in Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 12(b)(2) governs an untimely claim of grand jury discrimination, not only during the criminal proceeding, but also later on collateral review.

The court also determined that, since the challenged jury selection method had long obtained, the grand jury that indicted petitioner indicted his two white accomplices, and the case against petitioner was ""a strong one,"" there was no ""cause shown"" under the rule to grant relief from the waiver.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The waiver standard set forth in Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 12(b)(2) governs an untimely claim of grand jury discrimination, not only during the criminal proceeding, but also later on collateral review.  Shotwell Mfg. Co. v. United States, 371 U. S. 341, followed; Kaufman v. United States, 394 U. S. 217, distinguished.  Pp.  411 U. S. 236-243.
2. The District Court, in the light of the record in this case, did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner relief from the application of the waiver provision.  Pp.  411 U. S. 243-245.
455 F.2d 919, affirmed.

|411 u.s. 192|"Lemon v. Kurtzman
No. 71-1470
Argued November 8, 1972
Decided April 2, 1973
411 U.S. 192

Syllabus 
Following this Court's invalidation in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (Lemon I) of Pennsylvania's statutory program to reimburse nonpublic sectarian schools (hereafter school) for secular educational services, the District Court, on remand, enjoined any payments under the program for services rendered after Lemon I, but permitted Pennsylvania to reimburse the schools for service performed prior to that decision.  Appellants challenge the scope of this decree.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  411 U. S. 197-209.
348 F.Supp. 300, affirmed.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, in an opinion joined by MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Pennsylvania to reimburse the schools for services rendered and costs incurred in reliance on the statutory scheme prior to its invalidation in Lemon I.  Pp.  411 U. S. 197-209.
(a) An unconstitutional statute is not absolutely void, but is a practical reality upon which people rely.  Courts recognize that reality.  Pp.  411 U. S. 197-199.
(b) A trial court has wide latitude in shaping an equitable decree and reaching an accommodation between public and private needs.  Pp.  411 U. S. 200-201.
(c) The contested reimbursement will not contravene the constitutional principle of Lemon I of avoiding the ongoing entanglement of church and state, since only a final, ministerial post-audit is involved, and no further detailed state surveillance of the schools is required.  At the same time, however, supervision already conducted by Pennsylvania officials insures that the proposed reimbursement will not be used for sectarian purposes.  The proposed payment reflects only the schools' expenses incurred in expectation of reimbursement.  Pp.  411 U. S. 201-202.
(d) The schools relied in good faith on the state statute, which invited the contracts and authorized reimbursement for past services; and appellants, in self-styled ""sensible recognition of the 
Page 411 U. S. 193
 practical realities of the situation,"" may well have encouraged such reliance by the schools by not moving to have the payments enjoined before the contract service had been performed.  Pp.  411 U. S. 203-205.
(e) The schools could not have anticipated the Lemon I holding, which involved resolution of an issue of first impression that ""was not clearly foreshadowed.""  Pp.  411 U. S. 206-207.
(f) A State and those with whom it deals are not to be subjected to harsh retrospective relief merely because they act on the basis of presumptively valid legislation, in the absence of contrary judicial direction.  Pp.  411 U. S. 207-209.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE concurred in the judgment.
BURGER, C.J., announced the judgment of the Court and an opinion in which BLACKMUN, POWELL, and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined.  WHITE J., concurred in the judgment.

 Affirmed.
 
 PER CURIAM.
 
 The motion of American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, Inc., for leave to file a brief, as amicus curiae, is granted.
 On the ground that it was beyond its authority to grant the primary relief sought, the United States District Court dismissed appellants' suit which alleged that Art. IV, 6 (B), of the Ohio Constitution denied equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

			"|" OHIO MUNICIPAL JUDGES ASSN. ET AL. v. DAVIS ET AL. APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF  OHIO No. 72-1010. Decided March 26, 1973
 
 Appellants' challenge to state constitutional provision, which District Court dismissed for inability to grant relief sought, held to be without merit.
 Affirmed.
 
 PER CURIAM.
 
 The motion of American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, Inc., for leave to file a brief, as amicus curiae, is granted.
 On the ground that it was beyond its authority to grant the primary relief sought, the United States District Court dismissed appellants' suit which alleged that Art. IV, 6 (B), of the Ohio Constitution denied equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The judgment is affirmed, but on the ground that appellants' constitutional challenge to Art. IV, 6 (B), was without merit.

No. 71-1332
Argued October 12, 1972
Decided March 21, 1973
411 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
The financing of public elementary and secondary schools in Texas is a product of state and local participation.  Almost half of the revenues are derived from a largely state-funded program designed to provide a basic minimum educational offering in every school.  Each district supplements state aid through an ad valorem tax on property within its jurisdiction.  Appellees brought this class action on behalf of school children said to be members of poor families who reside in school districts having a low property tax base, making the claim that the Texas system's reliance on local property taxation favors the more affluent and violates equal protection requirements because of substantial inter-district disparities in per-pupil expenditures resulting primarily from differences in the value of assessable property among the districts.  The District Court, finding that wealth is a ""suspect"" classification and that education is a ""fundamental"" right, concluded that the system could be upheld only upon a showing, which appellants failed to make, that there was a compelling state interest for the system.  The court also concluded that appellants failed even to 
Page 412 U. S. 2
 demonstrate a reasonable or rational basis for the State's system.
Held:
1. This is not a proper case in which to examine a State's laws under standards of strict judicial scrutiny, since that test is reserved for cases involving laws that operate to the disadvantage of suspect classes or interfere with the exercise of fundamental rights and liberties explicitly or implicitly protected by the Constitution.  Pp.  411 U. S. 18-44.
(a) The Texas system does not disadvantage any suspect class.  It has not been shown to discriminate against any definable class of ""poor"" people or to occasion discriminations depending on the relative wealth of the families in any district.  And, insofar as the financing system disadvantages those who, disregarding their individual income characteristics, reside in comparatively poor school districts, the resulting class cannot be said to be suspect.  Pp.  411 U. S. 18-28.
(b) Nor does the Texas school financing system impermissibly interfere with the exercise of a ""fundamental"" right or liberty.  Though education is one of the most important services performed by the State, it is not within the limited category of rights recognized by this Court as guaranteed by the Constitution.  Even if some identifiable quantum of education is arguably entitled to constitutional protection to make meaningful the exercise of other constitutional rights, here there is no showing that the Texas system fails to provide the basic minimal skills necessary for that purpose.  Pp.  411 U. S. 29-39.
(c) Moreover, this is an inappropriate case in which to invoke strict scrutiny, since it involves the most delicate and difficult questions of local taxation, fiscal planning, educational policy, and federalism, considerations counseling a more restrained form of review.  Pp.  411 U. S. 40-44.
2. The Texas system does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Though concededly imperfect, the system bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose.  While assuring a basic education for every child in the State, it permits and encourages participation in and significant control of each district's schools at the local level.  Pp.  411 U. S. 44-53.

No. 71-1371
Argued December 13, 1972
Decided March 21, 1973
410 U.S. 752

Syllabus 
Petitioners challenge the constitutionality of New York Election Law  186, which requires a voter to enroll in the party of his choice at least 30 days before the general election in order to vote in the next party primary.  Though eligible to enroll before the previous general election, petitioners failed to do so, and were therefore ineligible to vote in the 1972 primary.  The Court of Appeals, reversing the District Court, upheld the New York scheme, which it found to be a permissible deterrent against the practice of primary election ""raiding"" by opposing party members.
Held:  New York's delayed-enrollment scheme did not violate petitioners' constitutional rights.  Pp.  410 U. S. 756-762.
(a) Section 186 did not absolutely prohibit petitioners from voting in the 1972 primary, but merely imposed a time deadline on their enrollment, which they chose to disregard.  Pp.  410 U. S. 756-758.
(b) The statute does not deprive voters of their right under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to associate with the party of their choice or subsequently to change to another party, provided that the statutory time limit for doing so is observed.  Pp.  410 U. S. 758-759.
(c) The cut-off date for enrollment, which occurs about eight months before a presidential, and 11 months before a nonpresidential, primary, is not arbitrary when viewed in light of the legitimate state purpose of avoiding disruptive party raiding.  Pp.  410 U. S. 760-761.

No. 71-1456
Argued January 8, 1973
Decided March 20, 1973
410 U.S. 719

Syllabus 
Appellee district exists for the purpose of acquiring, storing, and distributing water for farming in the Tulare Lake Basin.  Only landowners are qualified to elect the district's board of directors, votes being apportioned according to the assessed valuation of the lands.  A three-judge District Court, against challenge by appellants, held that the limitation of the franchise to landowners comported with equal protection requirements.
Held:
1. Restricting the voters to landowners who may or may not be residents does not violate the principle enunciated in such cases as Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, and Kramer v. Union School District, 395 U. S. 621, that governing bodies should be selected in a popular election in which every person's vote is equal.  Pp. 726- 410 U. S. 730.
(a) The activities of appellee district fall so disproportionately on landowners as a group that it is not unreasonable that the statutory framework focuses on the land benefited, rather than on people as such.  Pp.  410 U. S. 726-728.
(b) Although appellee district has some governmental powers, it provides none of the general public services ordinarily attributed to a governing body.  Pp.  410 U. S. 728-729.
2. Since assessments against landowners are the sole means by which expenses of appellee district are paid, it is not irrational to repose the franchise in landowners, but not residents.  Pp.  410 U. S. 730-731.
3. The exclusion of lessees from voting does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, since the short-term lessee's interest may be substantially less than that of a landowner and, the franchise being exercisable by proxy, other lessees may negotiate to have the franchise included in their leases.  Pp.  410 U. S. 731-733.
4. Weighting the vote according to assessed valuation of the land does not evade the principle that wealth has no relation to voter qualifications where, as here, the expense as well as the benefit is proportional to the land's assessed value.  Pp.  410 U. S. 733-735.

No. 72-905
Decided March 19, 1973
410 U.S. 690

Syllabus 
Respondent's conviction for murder was based on his two confessions that, in subsequent New York court proceedings, were found to have been voluntary.  In federal habeas corpus proceedings, the District Court, feeling unable to accord the state court the presumption of correctness because the state trial judge did not articulate to what extent he credited or rejected evidence and respondent's testimony, held its own hearing, found both confessions involuntary, and ordered respondent discharged from custody unless he was retried without the confessions.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that the state court's factual determination on the voluntariness issue did not meet the 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1) requirement that it be accorded a presumption of correctness unless it appeared that the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state court hearing.
Held:  The state trial judge's determination, on the totality of the circumstances, evidences that he applied correct voluntariness standards and, since the District Court could have been reasonably certain that he would have granted relief if he had believed respondent's testimony, the courts below erroneously concluded that the opinion of the trial court did not meet the requirements of  2254(d)(1).

The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that the state court's factual determination on the voluntariness issue did not meet the 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(1) requirement that it be accorded a presumption of correctness unless it appeared that the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state court hearing.
Held:  The state trial judge's determination, on the totality of the circumstances, evidences that he applied correct voluntariness standards and, since the District Court could have been reasonably certain that he would have granted relief if he had believed respondent's testimony, the courts below erroneously concluded that the opinion of the trial court did not meet the requirements of  2254(d)(1).

Syllabus 
1. A material witness who is incarcerated because unable to give bail is entitled under 28 U.S.C.  1821 to the same $20 per diem compensation as is allowed a nonincarcerated witness during the trial or other proceeding at which he is in ""attendance,"" i.e., has been summoned and is available to testify in a court in session, regardless of whether he is physically present in the courtroom.

2. The $1 statutory per diem plus subsistence in kind for incarcerated witnesses before trial does not violate the Just Compensation Clause, as detention of a material witness is not a ""taking"" under the Fifth Amendment; and the distinction between compensation for pretrial detention and for trial attendance is not so unreasonable as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, since Congress could determine that, in view of the length of pretrial confinement and the costs necessarily borne by the Government, only minimal compensation for pretrial detention is justified, particularly since the witness has a public duty to testify.

410 U.S. 605

Syllabus 
On May 6, 1971, petitioners were convicted and sentenced for narcotics offenses committed in March, 1971.  They received the minimum five-year sentences under a provision that was mandatory and made the sentences not subject to suspension, probation, or parole.  Effective May 1, 1971, that provision was repealed and liberalized by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970.  On petitioners' motion for vacation of their sentences and remand for resentencing, the Court of Appeals held that the new provisions were unavailable in view of the Act's saving clause, which made them inapplicable to ""prosecutions"" antedating the Act's effective date.
Held:
1. The word ""prosecutions"" in the saving clause is to be accorded its normal legal sense, under which sentencing is a part of the concept of prosecution.  Therefore, the saving clause barred the District Judge from suspending sentence or placing petitioners on probation.  Pp.  410 U. S. 607-610.
2. Under the saving clause, parole under 18 U.S.C.  4208(a) is likewise unavailable to petitioners, since, by its terms, that provision is inapplicable to offenses for which a mandatory penalty is provided; and, in any event, a decision to grant early parole under that provision must be made ""[u]pon entering a judgment of conviction,"" which occurs before the end of the prosecution.

Decided March 5, 1973
410 U.S. 623

Syllabus 
The Illinois use tax was applied to appellant's aviation fuel stored in the State and loaded aboard its aircraft there and consumed in interstate flights, the tax authorities having revised their previous ""burn off"" interpretation of a statutory exemption for temporary storage.  Under the ""burn off"" interpretation, only fuel consumed in flight over Illinois was used to measure the tax imposed for storage before loading, but under the reinterpretation, all fuel loaded was deemed to measure the tax on the ""use"" of storage or withdrawal from storage.  The Illinois Supreme Court upheld the statute against appellant's contention that the tax, as reinterpreted, impermissibly burdened interstate commerce.
Held:
1. The statute as authoritatively construed by the State's highest court to tax storage, and not consumption, does not place an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.  Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport, Inc., 289 U. S. 249; Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co. v. Wallace, 288 U. S. 249.  Cases allowing the taxation of storage of fuel before loading have not outlived their usefulness.  Pp.  410 U. S. 626-630.
2. The ""burn off"" rule is not unconstitutional, being distinguishable from a tax imposed on consumption such as was invalidated in Helson v. Kentucky, 279 U. S. 245.  Since some of the Illinois Supreme Court majority were under the mistaken impression that Helson precluded use of the ""burn off"" interpretation, the case is remanded to enable that court to construe the temporary storage provision under state law free from any constraint that such interpretation would not be constitutionally permissible.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 5, 1973
 Petition for rehearing. 
 The motion of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations for leave to file a brief, as amicus curiae, is granted. 
 The petition for rehearing is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN concur, dissenting. 
 By summarily denying this petition for rehearing, the Court finally disposes of important issues of constitutional law and statutory construction in a fashion which can only be characterized as bizarre. Although the case has now been before us on three separate occasions, by Brethren have yet to write so much as a single word in defense of a disposition which is seemingly inconsistent with a raft of our prior cases. See, e.g., Indiana Employment Security Division v. Burney, 409 U.S. 540 (1973); California Department of Human Resources Development v. Java, 402 U.S. 121 ( 1971); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 ( 1970). I cannot concur in this cavalier treatment of a question that is of vital importance to the thousands of citizens who, through no fault of their own, are temporarily unemployed. Even a brief chronological recitation of the tortured progression of this case makes plain that it has not been treated in accordance with the high standards that litigants before the Court have come to expect. Petitioners originally instituted this action in United States District Court to enjoin the enforcement of New York Labor Law McKinney's Consol. Laws, c. 31, 597, 598, and 620 'insofar as they authorize the suspension or termination of unemployment compensation benefits without a prior hearing.' They based their claim on the Due Process Clause, which had been interpreted in Goldberg v. Kelly, supra, to require a hearing prior to the suspension 
Page 410 U.S. 971 , 972
 of welfare benefits, and on the Social Security Act, which requires a state plan 'reasonably calculated to insure full payment of unemployment compensation when due.' 42 U.S.C. 503(a)(1). A three-judge court was convened, but that court, over a dissent by Judge Lasker, found both the constitutional and statutory claims to be without merit. 
 An appeal was timely noted and docketed in this Court. But before we had considered petitioner's jurisdictional statement, our decision in Department of Human Resources v. Java, supra, was handed down. In Java, a unanimous Court held that 42 U.S.C. 503(a)(1) invalidated a California statute which provided for the automatic suspension of unemployment compensation when the employer took an appeal from the initial eligibility determination. 
 Inasmuch as Java interpreted the very provision of the Social Security Act relied upon by the appellant in Torres, we entered an order vacating the District Court's decision in Torres and remanding for reconsideration in light of Java. See 402 U.S. 968d 133 (1971). When the case returned to the District Court, however, that court purported to find Java distinguishable from Torres and, in a brief per curiam, adhered to its prior decision. See Torres v. New York State Depart of Labor, 333 F.Supp. 341 (SDNY 1971). 
 Once again petitioners docketed an appeal in this Court, but this time an order was entered summarily affirming the District Court without the benefit of full briefing, oral argument, or an opinion. See 405 U.S. 949 (1972).* Shortly thereafter, however, the Court did note probable jurisdiction in Indiana Employment Security Division v. Burney, a case presenting iden- [410 U.S. 971 , 973]

Although the case has now been before us on three separate occasions, by Brethren have yet to write so much as a single word in defense of a disposition which is seemingly inconsistent with a raft of our prior cases. See, e.g., Indiana Employment Security Division v. Burney, 409 U.S. 540 (1973); California Department of Human Resources Development v. Java, 402 U.S. 121 ( 1971); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 ( 1970). I cannot concur in this cavalier treatment of a question that is of vital importance to the thousands of citizens who, through no fault of their own, are temporarily unemployed. Even a brief chronological recitation of the tortured progression of this case makes plain that it has not been treated in accordance with the high standards that litigants before the Court have come to expect. Petitioners originally instituted this action in United States District Court to enjoin the enforcement of New York Labor Law McKinney's Consol. Laws, c. 31, 597, 598, and 620 'insofar as they authorize the suspension or termination of unemployment compensation benefits without a prior hearing.' They based their claim on the Due Process Clause, which had been interpreted in Goldberg v. Kelly, supra, to require a hearing prior to the suspension 
Page 410 U.S. 971 , 972
 of welfare benefits, and on the Social Security Act, which requires a state plan 'reasonably calculated to insure full payment of unemployment compensation when due.' 42 U.S.C. 503(a)(1). A three-judge court was convened, but that court, over a dissent by Judge Lasker, found both the constitutional and statutory claims to be without merit. 
 An appeal was timely noted and docketed in this Court. But before we had considered petitioner's jurisdictional statement, our decision in Department of Human Resources v. Java, supra, was handed down. In Java, a unanimous Court held that 42 U.S.C. 503(a)(1) invalidated a California statute which provided for the automatic suspension of unemployment compensation when the employer took an appeal from the initial eligibility determination. 
 Inasmuch as Java interpreted the very provision of the Social Security Act relied upon by the appellant in Torres, we entered an order vacating the District Court's decision in Torres and remanding for reconsideration in light of Java. See 402 U.S. 968d 133 (1971). When the case returned to the District Court, however, that court purported to find Java distinguishable from Torres and, in a brief per curiam, adhered to its prior decision. See Torres v. New York State Depart of Labor, 333 F.Supp. 341 (SDNY 1971). 
 Once again petitioners docketed an appeal in this Court, but this time an order was entered summarily affirming the District Court without the benefit of full briefing, oral argument, or an opinion. See 405 U.S. 949 (1972).* Shortly thereafter, however, the Court did note probable jurisdiction in Indiana Employment Security Division v. Burney, a case presenting iden- [410 U.S. 971 , 973]

No. 71-6516
Argued December 5, 1972
Decided February 28, 1973
410 U.S. 484

Syllabus 
Petitioner, imprisoned in Alabama, applied to the District Court for the Western District of Kentucky for a writ of federal habeas corpus to compel the Commonwealth of Kentucky to grant him a speedy trial on an indictment returned by the grand jury of respondent court regarding which Kentucky had lodged a detainer with Alabama.  The District Court granted the writ, but the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that 28 U.S.C.  2241(a), which provides that ""[w]rits of habeas corpus may be granted by the . . . district courts . . . within their respective jurisdictions"" precluded granting the writ to a prisoner who was not physically present within the territorial limits of the district court.
Held:
1. Under Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54, which discarded the ""prematurity doctrine"" of McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131, the petitioner was ""in custody"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  2241(c)(3) for purposes of a habeas corpus attack on the Kentucky indictment underlying the detainer, even though he was confined in an Alabama prison.  Pp.  410 U. S. 488-489.
2. The exhaustion doctrine of Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, does not bar a petition for federal habeas corpus alleging, under Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374, a constitutional claim of present denial of a speedy trial, even though the petitioner has not yet been brought to trial on the state charge.  The petitioner must, however, have exhausted available state court remedies for consideration of that constitutional claim.  Pp.  410 U. S. 489-493.
3. The jurisdiction of a district court considering a habeas corpus petition requires only that the court issuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian of the prisoner.  Pp.  410 U. S. 494-495.
4. Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188, on which respondent relies, can no longer be viewed as requiring that habeas corpus petitions be brought only in the district of the petitioner's confinement.  Here, since respondent was properly served with process in the Western District of Kentucky, the Court of Appeals erred in concluding

 that the District Court should have dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction.  Pp.  410 U. S. 495-501.

Syllabus 
Respondent Falstaff, the Nation's fourth largest beer producer, which was desirous of achieving national status, agreed to acquire the largest seller of beer in the New England market rather than enter de novo.  The District Court dismissed the Government's resultant suit charging violation of  7 of the Clayton Act, finding that entry by acquisition, which the court found was the only way that respondent intended to penetrate the New England market, would not result in a substantial lessening of competition.
Held:  The District Court erred in assuming that, because respondent would not have entered the market de novo, it could not be considered a potential competitor.  The court should have considered whether respondent was a potential competitor in the sense that its position on the edge of the market exerted a beneficial influence on the market's competitive conditions.

Decided February 27, 1973
410 U.S. 431

Syllabus 
Respondent association (Wheaton-Haven) operates a community swimming pool, use of which is limited to white members and their white guests.  Under Wheaton-Haven's bylaws, a person residing within a geographic preference area, unlike one living outside that area, needs no endorsement for membership from a current member; receives priority (if the membership is full) over all but those who have first options; and (if an owner-member selling his house) can confer a first option for membership on his vendee.  Petitioners -- the Presses, a Negro couple who bought a home in the preference area from a nonmember, and were denied membership for racial reasons; a white couple, members of Wheaton-Haven, whose Negro guest was refused admission to the pool for racial reasons; and the guest -- brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief under the Civil Rights Acts of 1866, 1870, and 1964, 42 U.S.C.  1982, 1981, and 2000a et seq.  The District Court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, because Wheaton-Haven membership rights could not be leased or transferred, the case was distinguishable from Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229, making  1982 unavailable to the Presses, and agreeing with the District Court that Wheaton-Haven was a private club within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.  2000a(e), and therefore implied an exception to  1982.
Held:
1. Respondents' racially discriminatory membership policy violates 42 U.S.C.  1982.  The preferences for membership in Wheaton-Haven gave valuable property rights to white residents in the preference area that were not available to the Presses, and this case is therefore not significantly distinguishable from Sullivan, supra.

2. Wheaton-Haven is not a private club within the meaning of  2000a(e), since membership, until the association reaches its full complement, ""is open to every white person within the geographic area, there being no selective element other than

410 U.S. 441

Syllabus 
A medical partnership (Permanente), in which respondent physicians were partners, made an agreement to supply medical services to members of a health foundation (Kaiser).  A portion of Kaiser's compensation to Permanente was in the form of payments into a retirement trust for the benefit of Permanente's physicians, none of whom was eligible to receive the amounts in his tentative account prior to retirement after specified years of service.  No interest in the account was deemed to vest in a particular beneficiary before retirement, and a physician's pre-retirement severance from Permanente would occasion the forfeiture of his interest, with redistribution to the remaining participants.  Under no circumstances, however, could Kaiser recoup the payments once made.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a deficiency against each partner respondent for his distributive share of the amount paid by Kaiser, which he had not reported as taxable income.  In this refund suit the District Court, with the Court of Appeals affirming, held that the payments to the fund were not income to the partnership because it did not receive and had no ""right to receive"" them.
Held:  The retirement fund payments, notwithstanding the fact that they were contributed directly to the trust, were compensation for services that Permanente rendered under the medical service agreement, and should have been reported as income to Permanente; and the individual partners should have included their shares of that income in their individual returns, since the existence of conditions upon the actual receipt by a partner of income fully earned by the partnership is not a relevant factor in determining its taxability to him.

No. 71-692
Argued November 13, 1972
Decided February 27, 1973
410 U.S. 458

Syllabus 
Respondent was brought to trial under an indictment which, it developed before any evidence was presented, contained a defect that, under Illinois law, could not be cured by amendment and that, on appeal, could be asserted to overturn any judgment of conviction.

Syllabus 
Respondent was brought to trial under an indictment which, it developed before any evidence was presented, contained a defect that, under Illinois law, could not be cured by amendment and that, on appeal, could be asserted to overturn any judgment of conviction.  The trial judge declared a mistrial over respondent's objection, following which respondent was reindicted, tried, and convicted.  He thereafter petitioned for habeas corpus, which was ultimately granted on the ground that, jeopardy having attached when the jury was initially impaneled and sworn, the second trial constituted double jeopardy.

No. 71-991
Argued December 5, 1972
Decided February 22, 1973
410 U.S. 366

Syllabus 
In this Sherman Act suit, brought by the Government, the District Court enjoined as violative of  2 the following practices in which appellant, Otter Tail Power Co. (Otter Tail), engaged to prevent towns from establishing their own power systems when Otter Tail's retail franchises expired:  refusals to wholesale power to the municipal systems or transfer (""wheel"") it over Otter Tail's facilities from other sources, litigation intended to delay establishment of municipal systems, and invocation of transmission contract provisions to forestall supplying by other power companies.
Held:
l. Otter Tail is not insulated from antitrust regulation by reason of the Federal Power Act, whose legislative history manifests no purpose to make the antitrust laws inapplicable to power companies.  The essential thrust of the authority of the Federal Power Commission (FPC) is to encourage voluntary interconnections.  Though the FPC may order interconnections if ""necessary or appropriate in the public interest,"" antitrust considerations, though relevant under that standard, are not determinative.  Pp.  410 U. S. 372-375.
2. The District Court's decree does not conflict with the regulatory responsibilities of the FPC.  Pp.  410 U. S. 375-377.
(a) The court's order for wheeling to correct Otter Tail's anticompetitive and monopolistic practices is not counter to the authority of the FPC, which lacks the power to impose such a requirement.  Pp.  410 U. S. 375-376.
(b) Appellant's argument that the decree overrides FPC's power over interconnections is premature, there being no present conflict between the court's decree and any contrary ruling by the FPC.  Pp.  410 U. S. 376-377.
3. The record supports the District Court's findings that Otter Tail -- solely to prevent the municipal systems from eroding its monopolistic position -- refused to sell at wholesale or to wheel, and that Otter Tail, to the same end, invoked restrictive provisions in its contracts with the Bureau of Reclamation and other suppliers, the court correctly concluding that such provisions, per se, violated the Sherman Act.  Pp.  410 U. S. 377-379. 
Page 410 U. S. 367

4. The District Court should determine on remand whether the litigation that Otter Tail was found to have instituted for the purpose of maintaining its monopolistic position was ""a mere sham"" within the meaning of Eastern Railroad Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U. S. 127, so that the litigation would lose its constitutional protection in line with the Court's decision in California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508, which was decided after the District Court had entered its decree.  Pp.  410 U. S. 379-380.
5. The District Court's retention of jurisdiction to afford the parties ""necessary and appropriate relief"" provides an adequate safeguard against the possibility that compulsory interconnections or wheeling might threaten Otter Tail's ability adequately to serve the public.  Pp.  410 U. S. 380-382.

Syllabus 
Appellees challenge as violative of equal protection  230(3) of the New York Correction Law, which denies certain state prisoners good time credit toward parole eligibility for the period of their presentence county jail incarceration, whereas those released on bail prior to sentence received under the statute full allowance of good time credit for the entire period of their prison confinement.  A three-judge District Court, viewing the good time statutory scheme as primarily aimed at fostering prison discipline, upheld appellees' claim on the ground that there is no rational basis for the statutory distinction between jail and non-jail defendants in awarding good time credit.
Held:  Under the New York scheme, good time credit takes into account a prisoner's performance under the program of rehabilitation that is fostered under the state prison system, but not in the county jails, which serve primarily as detention centers.  Since the jails have no significant rehabilitation program, a rational basis exists for declining to give good time credit for the pretrial jail-detention period; and the statute will be sustained even if fostering rehabilitation was not necessarily the primary legislative objective, cf. South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301,  383 U. S. 331; Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471,  397 U. S. 486.  Pp.  410 U. S. 268-277.

Syllabus 
After petitioner was arrested for murder, another person (McDonald) made, but later repudiated, a written confession.  On three separate occasions, each time to a different friend, McDonald orally admitted the killing.  Petitioner was convicted of the murder in a trial that he claimed was lacking in due process because petitioner was not allowed to (1) cross-examine McDonald (whom petitioner had called as a witness when the State failed to do so), since, under Mississippi's common law ""voucher"" rule, a party may not impeach his own witness, or (2) introduce the testimony of the three persons to whom McDonald had confessed, the trial court having ruled their testimony inadmissible as hearsay.  The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  Under the facts and circumstances of this case, petitioner was denied a fair trial, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  410 U. S. 294-303.
(a) The application of the ""voucher"" rule prevented petitioner, through cross-examination of McDonald, from exploring the circumstances of McDonald's three prior oral confessions and challenging his renunciation of the written confession, and thus deprived petitioner of the right to contradict testimony that was clearly ""adverse.""  Pp.  410 U. S. 295-298.
(b) The trial court erred in excluding McDonald's hearsay statements, which were critical to petitioner's defense and which bore substantial assurances of trustworthiness, including that each was made spontaneously to a close acquaintance, that each was corroborated by other evidence in the case, that each was in a real sense against McDonald's interest, and that McDonald was present and available for cross-examination by the State.

The Virginia General Assembly in 1971 reapportioned the State for the election of state delegates and senators.  The apportionment statutes, on challenge by appellees, were invalidated by a three-judge District Court, which ruled the reapportionments impermissible violations of the ""one person, one vote"" principle.  The court substituted its own electoral districts, reducing to about 10% the percentage variation from the ideal district from the approximately 16% variation permitted by the legislature's plan but, contrary to that plan, in many instances not following political subdivision lines.
Held:
1. Reapportionment of electoral districts for Virginia's House of Delegates complied with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since the legislature's maximum population percentage variation, which was not excessive, resulted from the State's rational objective of preserving the integrity of political subdivision lines.  Pp.  410 U. S. 320-330.
(a) In the implementation of the basic constitutional principle that both houses of a bicameral state legislature be apportioned substantially on a population basis (Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533), more flexibility is permissible with respect to state legislative reapportionment than with respect to congressional redistricting.  Pp.  410 U. S. 320-325.
(b) The State's objective of preserving the integrity of political subdivision lines is rational, since it furthers the legislative purpose of facilitating enactment of statutes of purely local concern and preserves for the voters in the political subdivisions a voice in the state legislature on local matters.  Pp.  410 U. S. 325-328.
(c) Given the wider constitutional latitude in state legislative reapportionment, the population disparities reflected in the legislature's 
Page 410 U. S. 316
 maximum percentage deviation are within tolerable constitutional limits.  Pp.  410 U. S. 328-330.
2. The establishment by the legislature of three numerically ideal senatorial electoral districts by assigning to one of them about 36,700 persons who were ""home-ported"" at the U.S. Naval Station, Norfolk, regardless of where they actually resided, because that is where they were counted on official census tracts, was constitutionally impermissible discrimination against military personnel, cf. Davis v. Mann, 377 U. S. 678; and the District Court, which was under severe time pressures, did not abuse its discretion in prescribing an interim plan of combining the three districts into one multi-member district.  Pp.  410 U. S. 330-333.

Syllabus 
A grand jury subpoenaed about 20 persons, including respondent, to give voice exemplars for identification purposes.  Respondent, on Fourth and Fifth Amendment grounds, refused to comply.  The District Court rejected both claims and adjudged respondent in contempt.  The Court of Appeals agreed in rejecting respondent's Fifth Amendment claim but reversed on the ground that the Fourth Amendment required a preliminary showing of reasonableness before a grand jury witness could be compelled to furnish a voice exemplar and that, here, the proposed ""seizures"" would be unreasonable because of the large number of witnesses subpoenaed to produce the exemplars.
Held:
1. The compelled production of the voice exemplars would not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, since they were to be used only for identification purposes, and not for the testimonial or communicative content of the utterances.  Pp.  410 U. S. 5-7.
2. Respondent's Fourth Amendment claim is also invalid.  Pp.  410 U. S. 8-18.

410 U.S. 52

Syllabus 
Appellees, Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. and Glaxo Group Ltd., British drug companies engaged in the manufacture and sale of the fungicide griseofulvin, pooled their bulk- and dosage-form patents and sublicensed certain firms in the United States to practice the patents.  The pooling agreement contained a covenant to restrict bulk sales and resales, and sublicensing agreements prohibited bulk resales to third parties without the licensors' prior consent.  The United States filed a civil antitrust suit against appellees to restrain alleged violations of  1 of the Sherman Act, and the Government also attacked the validity of the dosage-form patents, and sought the relief of mandatory, nondiscriminatory bulk-form sales and reasonable-royalty licensing of the patents.  The District Court held that bulk-sales restrictions were per se violations of  1, and enjoined their future use, but refused the Government's request to order mandatory, nondiscriminatory sales of the bulk form of the drug and reasonable-royalty licensing of appellees' patents as part of the relief.  The court also refused to entertain the Government's claim of patent invalidity, since appellees did not rely on their patents in defense of the antitrust claims.
Held:
1. Where patents are directly involved in antitrust violations and the Government presents a substantial case for relief in the form of restrictions on the patents, the Government may challenge the validity of the patents regardless of whether the owner relies on the patents in defending the antitrust action.

2.

Decided January 22, 1973
410 U.S. 73

Syllabus 
Respondent Members of Congress brought suit under the Freedom of Information Act of 1966 to compel disclosure of nine documents that various officials had prepared for the President concerning a scheduled underground nuclear test.  All but three were classified as Top Secret or Secret under E.O. 10501, and petitioners represented that all were inter-agency or intra-agency documents used in the Executive Branch's decisionmaking processes.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment on the grounds that each of the documents was exempt from compelled disclosure by 5 U.S.C.  552(b)(1) (hereafter Exemption 1), excluding matters ""specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy,"" and  552(b)(5) (hereafter Exemption 5), excluding ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party . . . in litigation with the agency.""  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding (a) that Exemption 1 permits nondisclosure of only the secret portions of classified documents but requires disclosure of the nonsecret components if separable, and (b) that Exemption 5 shields only governmental ""decisional processes"" and not factual information unless ""inextricably intertwined with policymaking processes.""  The District Court was ordered to examine the documents in camera to determine both aspects of separability.
Held:
1. Exemption 1 does not permit compelled disclosure of the six classified documents or in camera inspection to sift out ""non-secret components,"" and petitioners met their burden of demonstrating that the documents were entitled to protection under that exemption.  Pp.  410 U. S. 79-84.
2. Exemption 5 does not require that otherwise confidential documents be made available for a district court's in camera inspection regardless of how little, if any, purely factual material they contain.  In implying that such inspection be automatic, the Court of Appeals order was overly rigid, and petitioners should be afforded the opportunity of demonstrating by means short of 
Page 410 U. S. 74
 in camera inspection that the documents sought are clearly beyond the range of material that would be available to a private part in litigation with a Government agency.  Pp.  410 U. S. 85-94.

All but three were classified as Top Secret or Secret under E.O. 10501, and petitioners represented that all were inter-agency or intra-agency documents used in the Executive Branch's decisionmaking processes.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment on the grounds that each of the documents was exempt from compelled disclosure by 5 U.S.C.  552(b)(1) (hereafter Exemption 1), excluding matters ""specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy,"" and  552(b)(5) (hereafter Exemption 5), excluding ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party . . . in litigation with the agency.""  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding (a) that Exemption 1 permits nondisclosure of only the secret portions of classified documents but requires disclosure of the nonsecret components if separable, and (b) that Exemption 5 shields only governmental ""decisional processes"" and not factual information unless ""inextricably intertwined with policymaking processes.""  The District Court was ordered to examine the documents in camera to determine both aspects of separability.
Held:
1. Exemption 1 does not permit compelled disclosure of the six classified documents or in camera inspection to sift out ""non-secret components,"" and petitioners met their burden of demonstrating that the documents were entitled to protection under that exemption.  Pp.  410 U. S. 79-84.
2. Exemption 5 does not require that otherwise confidential documents be made available for a district court's in camera inspection regardless of how little, if any, purely factual material they contain.  In implying that such inspection be automatic, the Court of Appeals order was overly rigid, and petitioners should be afforded the opportunity of demonstrating by means short of 
Page 410 U. S. 74
 in camera inspection that the documents sought are clearly beyond the range of material that would be available to a private part in litigation with a Government agency.  Pp.  410 U. S. 85-94.

Syllabus
A pregnant single woman (Roe) brought a class action challenging the constitutionality of the Texas criminal abortion laws, which proscribe procuring or attempting an abortion except on medical advice for the purpose of saving the mother's life.  A licensed physician (Hallford), who had two state abortion prosecutions pending against him, was permitted to intervene.  A childless married couple (the Does), the wife not being pregnant, separately attacked the laws, basing alleged injury on the future possibilities of contraceptive failure, pregnancy, unpreparedness for parenthood, and impairment of the wife's health.  A three-judge District Court, which consolidated the actions, held that Roe and Hallford, and members of their classes, had standing to sue and presented justiciable controversies.  Ruling that declaratory, though not injunctive, relief was warranted, the court declared the abortion statutes void as vague and overbroadly infringing those plaintiffs' Ninth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The court ruled the Does' complaint not justiciable.  Appellants directly appealed to this Court on the injunctive rulings, and appellee cross-appealed from the District Court's grant of declaratory relief to Roe and Hallford.
Held:
1. While 28 U.S.C.  1253 authorizes no direct appeal to this Court from the grant or denial of declaratory relief alone, review is not foreclosed when the case is properly before the Court on appeal from specific denial of injunctive relief and the arguments as to both injunctive and declaratory relief are necessarily identical.  P.  123.
2. Roe has standing to sue; the Does and Hallford do not.  Pp.  123-129.
(a) Contrary to appellee's contention, the natural termination of Roe's pregnancy did not moot her suit.  Litigation involving pregnancy, which is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review,"" is an exception to the usual federal rule that an actual controversy 
[114]
 must exist at review stages, and not simply when the action is initiated.  Pp.  124-125.
(b) The District Court correctly refused injunctive, but erred in granting declaratory, relief to Hallford, who alleged no federally protected right not assertable as a defense against the good faith state prosecutions pending against him.  Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66.  Pp.  125-127.
(c) The Does' complaint, based as it is on contingencies, any one or more of which may not occur, is too speculative to present an actual case or controversy.  Pp.  127-129.
3. State criminal abortion laws, like those involved here, that except from criminality only a life-saving procedure on the mother's behalf without regard to the stage of her pregnancy and other interests involved violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects against state action the right to privacy, including a woman's qualified right to terminate her pregnancy.  Though the State cannot override that right, it has legitimate interests in protecting both the pregnant woman's health and the potentiality of human life, each of which interests grows and reaches a ""compelling"" point at various stages of the woman's approach to term.  Pp.  147-164.
(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.  Pp.  163,  164.
(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.  Pp.  163,  164.
(c) For the stage subsequent to viability the State, in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life, may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.  Pp.  163-164;  164-165.
4. The State may define the term ""physician"" to mean only a physician currently licensed by the State, and may proscribe any abortion by a person who is not a physician as so defined.  P.  165.
5. It is unnecessary to decide the injunctive relief issue, since the Texas authorities will doubtless fully recognize the Court's ruling 
[115]
 that the Texas criminal abortion statutes are unconstitutional.  P.  166.

Syllabus 
Georgia law proscribes an abortion except as performed by a duly licensed Georgia physician when necessary in ""his best clinical judgment"" because continued pregnancy would endanger a pregnant woman's life or injure her health; the fetus would likely be born with a serious defect; or the pregnancy resulted from rape.   26-1202(a) of Ga. Criminal Code.  In addition to a requirement that the patient be a Georgia resident and certain other requirements, the statutory scheme poses three procedural conditions in  26-1202(b):  (1) that the abortion be performed in a hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH); (2) that the procedure be approved by the hospital staff abortion committee; and (3) that the performing physician's judgment be confirmed by independent examinations of the patient by two other licensed physicians.  Appellant Doe, an indigent married Georgia citizen, who was denied an abortion after eight weeks of pregnancy for failure to meet any of the  26-1202(a) conditions, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the Georgia laws were unconstitutional.  Others joining in the complaint included Georgia-licensed physicians (who claimed that the Georgia statutes ""chilled and deterred"" their practices), registered nurses, clergymen, and social workers.  Though holding that all the plaintiffs had standing, the District Court ruled that only Doe presented a justiciable controversy.  In Doe's case the court gave declaratory, but not injunctive, relief, invalidating as an infringement of privacy and personal liberty the limitation to the three situations specified in  26-1202(a) and certain other provisions, but holding that the State's interest in health protection and the existence of a ""potential of independent human existence"" justified regulation through  26-1202(b) of the ""manner of performance as well as the quality of the final decision to abort.""  The appellants, claiming entitlement to broader relief, directly appealed to this Court.
Held:
1. Doe's case presents a live, justiciable controversy and she has standing to sue, Roe v. Wade, ante p.  410 U. S. 113, as do the physician 
Page 410 U. S. 180
 appellants (who, unlike the physician in Wade, were not charged with abortion violations), and it is therefore unnecessary to resolve the issue of the other appellants' standing.  Pp.  410 U. S. 187-189.
2. A woman's constitutional right to an abortion is not absolute.  Roe v. Wade, supra.  P.  410 U. S. 189.
3. The requirement that a physician's decision to perform an abortion must rest upon ""his best clinical judgment"" of its necessity is not unconstitutionally vague, since that judgment may be made in the light of all the attendant circumstances.  United States v. Vuitch, 402 U. S. 62,  402 U. S. 71-72.  Pp.  410 U. S. 191-192.
4. The three procedural conditions in  26-1202(b) violate the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  410 U. S. 192-200.
(a) The JCAH accreditation requirement is invalid, since the State has not shown that only hospitals (let alone those with JCAH accreditation) meet its interest in fully protecting the patient; and a hospital requirement failing to exclude the first trimester of pregnancy would be invalid on that ground alone, see Roe v. Wade, supra.  Pp.  410 U. S. 193-195.
(b) The interposition of a hospital committee on abortion, a procedure not applicable as a matter of state criminal law to other surgical situations, is unduly restrictive of the patient's rights, which are already safeguarded by her personal physician.  Pp.  410 U. S. 195-198.
(c) Required acquiescence by two copractitioners also has no rational connection with a patient's needs, and unduly infringes on her physician's right to practice.  Pp.  410 U. S. 198-200.
5. The Georgia residence requirement violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause by denying protection to persons who enter Georgia for medical services there.  P.  410 U. S. 200.
6. Appellants' equal protection argument centering on the three procedural conditions in  26-1202(b), invalidated on other grounds, is without merit.  Pp.  410 U. S. 200-201.

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting from the grant of the stay by the Court. 
 I agree with Justice Black in his dissent in Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1, 20, that the power to regulate the right to travel is vested in Congress and not in the Executive Branch. There is no law barring the Berrigans from foreign travel to North Vietnam; there is no law barring paroled citizens from travel in foreign countries.* It is not enough to argue that the State Department has determined that the proposed foreign travel is not in the national interest. 
 The right to travel is a peripheral right of every citizen under the First Amendment. (Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1, 24.) Therefore, no travel could be prohibited except under a narrowly drawn statute. In my dissent in Zemel, I enumerated several national interests which might support a restriction on the right to travel; none of those interests exist here. To the contrary, the national interest embodied in the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and information would be furthered by such a visit. As in Zemel, the danger feared here is the contact of the Berrigans with a Communist regime. 'The world, however, is filled with Communist thought . . .. They are part of the world spectrum; and if we are to know them and under- 
Page 410 U.S. 902 , 903
 stand them, we must mingle with them. . . .' (Zemel v. Rusk, supra, at 25.) Keeping alive intellectual intercourse between seemingly opposing groups has always been important and is even more important in view of the bridges of communication long destroyed between this country and North Vietnam which are now being restored. Part of the restoration of these bridges has been the allowance by North Vietnam of many United States citizens to visit their country as well as the peace negotiations underway for some months. 
 The ability to understand this pluralistic world filled with clashing ideologies is a prerequisite of any hope for world peace. The late Pope John XXIII in his famous encyclical Pacem in Terris emphasized that without knowledge and understanding among all peoples there can be no hope for love and peace. One of the best ways to insure this knowledge and understanding is to allow the people of the world to mingle freely with one another. 
 I would allow the respondents their constitutional right to travel. 
[Footnote *] 28 CFR 2.28(c) provides that 'Board approval shall be required for travel outside the continental limits of the United States . . .' Like all action by federal governmental officials, the powers of the Parole Board may be exercised only with regard to constitutional restraints. No purpose of fleeing the country is even suggested.

 Kenneth TIERNEY et al.v. UNITED STATES.No. 72-623. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 22, 1973
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioners and other Irish-Americans living in New York were subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury sitting in the Northern District of Texas. Even though they had been granted immunity under 18 U.S. C. 6002 and 6003, petitioners refused to answer various questions regarding the purchase of firearms in the United States. Petitioners were held in civil contempt. Petitioners based their refusal to testify on the grounds that their counsel had been overheard on a Government wiretap two days prior to their appearance before the grand jury, and that the use immunity they had been granted under 18 U.S.C. 6002-6003 was ineffective to protect them against foreign prosecution. At the time the contempt hearing was held before the District Court, the Government alleged that there were no overhearings of the petitioners' counsel and the District Court held that there was no substantial possibility of foreign prosecution. By the time the appeal was heard by the Court of Appeals, the Government had disclosed the wiretapped conversation, which the Court of Appeals examined in camera, and determined was not relevant to the petitioners. The Court of Appeals sustained the determination of contempt. I granted petitioners bail pending the determination of their petition for certiorari on the grounds that the issues presented were substantial. (Tierney v. United States, 409 U.S. 1232, 34 L. Ed.2d 37.) I would grant certiorari for those same reasons. In my dissent from denial of certiorari in Russo v. Byrne, 409 U.S. 1219, I pointed out the Court's concern in Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, with the necessity of allowing the parties themselves to assess 
Page 410 U.S. 914 , 915
 and argue whether or not overhearings were relevant to their specific case. An in camera determination of relevancy will seldom, if ever, be a sufficient safeguard against the governmental interference with the constitutionally protected area of right to counsel. In the instant case, upon admitting that the overhearing had occurred, the Government stated that it was 'in connection with a separate aspect of the investigation.' If the overhearing had anything to do with the grand jury investigation for which petitioners were called as witnesses, no one but petitioners and their counsel were in a position to determine in what ways the conversation might relate to overall strategy or defenses. The right to counsel is especially important to a person involved with a grand jury investigation. Numerous and complex rights and liabilities are often involved, yet the average citizen may have even less knowledge of these rights than of his rights as a defendant in a criminal proceeding. Anything which undermines the effective assistance of counsel will severely handicap those who are forced to testify. 
 The Court itself in Zicarelli v. New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, 406 U.S. 472, 481, although not deciding the questions raised by the possibility of testimony for which a witness had been granted 6002-6003 immunity being used against him in foreign prosecution, indicated the constitutional importance of such questions. In the instant case the possibility of foreign prosecution is not insignificant. There are indications that the impetus for the grand jury investigation was the request of foreign powers.

No. 71-6316
Argued December 7, 1972
Decided January 17, 1973
409 U.S. 512

Syllabus 
Philadelphia County prisoners unable to make bail or being held on nonbailable offenses brought this class action, asserting the unconstitutionality of Pennsylvania Election Code provisions denying them the right to vote.  When the Commonwealth (but not the municipal) officials who were named as defendants conceded the Code provisions' unconstitutionality, the District Judge (deeming the Commonwealth officials the principal defendants) ruled the case nonjusticiable as not involving an Art. III case or controversy, and dismissed the complaint.  The Court of Appeals, though differing as to justiciability, affirmed on the ground that petitioners' constitutional claims were wholly insubstantial under McDonald v. Board of Election Comm'rs, 394 U. S. 802, and ruled that a three-judge district court was therefore not required under 28 U.S.C.  2281.
Held:
1. The Commonwealth officials' concession did not foreclose the existence of an Art. III case or controversy, since the municipal officials continue to assert the right to enforce the challenged Code provisions.  Pp.  409 U. S. 516-517.
2. McDonald, supra, unlike the situation alleged here, did not deal with an absolute prohibition against voting by the prisoners there involved, and that decision does not ""foreclose the subject"" of petitioners' challenge to the Pennsylvania statutory scheme.  The case may, if appropriate, therefore be heard by a three-judge district court.  Pp.  409 U. S. 518-523.

Petitioner, a civil rights worker, claims that the trial resulting in his drug conviction (which was affirmed by the South Carolina Supreme Court) was not fair because of the trial court's refusal to examine jurors on voir dire as to possible prejudice arising from the fact that petitioner is a Negro and that he wears a beard.
Held:  The trial court's refusal to make any inquiry of the jurors as to racial bias after petitioner's timely request therefor denied petitioner a fair trial in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

No. 71-827
Argued October 10, 1972
Decided January 10, 1973*
409 U.S. 363

Syllabus 
Trans World Airlines (TWA) brought this antitrust action against the Hughes Tool Co. (Toolco) and others for treble damages as a result of the manner in which Toolco had exercised its controlling interest in TWA, with particular reference to Toolco's asserted acts to control and dictate the acquisition and financing of aircraft by TWA.  As an organization engaged in phases of aeronautics, Toolco could not acquire control of an air carrier such as TWA without consent of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB).  In 1944, the CAB approved de facto control of TWA by Toolco as comporting with the provisions of  408 of the Federal Aviation Act.  That provision permits acquisitions of control that the CAB finds are not inconsistent with the public interest and that will not result in monopoly.  Section 414 immunizes from antitrust liability any conduct approved by a CAB order issued under  408.  The approval narrowly limited inter-company sales transactions without specific CAB approval, and required annual reporting.  A few years later, Toolco and TWA made an agreement permitting Toolco to obtain full legal control of TWA.  The CAB, after full hearings into the Toolco-TWA relationship, found that Toolco's financial and other support was of great importance to TWA, and concluded that ""the continued interest of Toolco in TWA appears essential to the best interests of the carrier and the public.""  The CAB's approval was made subject to the conditions of the 1944 order.  As a result, from 1944 to 1960, every acquisition and lease of aircraft by TWA from Toolco and each financing by TWA from Toolco received CAB approval pursuant to  408.  In 1960, Toolco's stock in TWA was placed in a voting trust in connection with a program for financing TWA's acquisition of jet equipment.  Shortly thereafter, TWA brought this suit.  As a defense, Toolco relied on Pan American World Airways v. United States, 371 U. S. 296.  The District Court entered a default judgment against 
Page 409 U. S. 364
 Toolco.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that Pan American was inapplicable because, unlike the situation in that case, the conduct challenged in TWA's complaint was ""unrelated to any specific function of the CAB,"" and not within the CAB's exclusive competence.
Held:  The transactions that TWA challenged as violative of the antitrust laws were under the CAB's control and surveillance, and, by virtue of  408 and 414 of the Federal Aviation Act, had immunity under the antitrust laws.  The Court of Appeals, therefore, erred in holding that Pan American, supra, is not controlling on the facts involved here.  Pp.  409 U. S. 366-389.

Syllabus 
Appellee, an indigent who filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, sought discharge without payment of the fees, aggregating no more than $50, that are a precondition to discharge in such a proceeding.  The District Court, relying primarily on Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371 (where the Court held that a State could not consistently with due process and equal protection requirements, deny access to divorce courts to indigents unable to pay filing and other fees), held the bankruptcy fee provisions, as applied to appellee, an unconstitutional denial of Fifth Amendment rights of due process, including equal protection.
Held:  This case is not controlled by Boddie, supra.  For here, access to courts is not the only conceivable relief available to bankrupts; the filing-fee requirement does not deny an indigent the equal protection of the laws, since there is no constitutional right to obtain a discharge of one's debts in bankruptcy; the right to a discharge in bankruptcy is not a ""fundamental"" right demanding a compelling governmental interest as a precondition to regulation; and there is a rational basis for the fee requirement.

Petitioner challenges an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) summons directing an accountant, an independent contractor with numerous clients, to produce business records that she had been giving to him for preparation of her tax returns from 1955 to 1968, when the summons was issued.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that the privilege against self-incrimination asserted by petitioner was not available.
Held:  On the facts of this case, where petitioner had effectively surrendered possession of the records to the accountant, there was no personal compulsion against petitioner to produce the records.  The Fifth Amendment therefore constitutes no bar to their production by the accountant, even though the IRS tax investigation may entail possible criminal, as well as civil, consequences.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 8, 1973
 The judgment is affirmed.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 The Louisiana constitutional provisions, which this Court today upholds against appellant's renewed constitutional attack, provide for the election of the State's Supreme Court Justices from election districts that are established without regard to population. Voters in five districts, composed of varying numbers of parishes, elect one justice each. A sixth district elects two justices. La. Const., Art. VII, 9. The record before the District Court indicated that there was 'considerable deviation between the population of some of the [election] districts,' 347 F.Supp., at 454,1 and that, therefore, the votes of some qualified voters, depending on the happenstance of residence, were of less value in electing justices than others, cast elsewhere. But the District Court refused even to consider this evidence and, relying on a few isolated sentences in Hadley v. Junior College District, 397 U.S. 50 (1970), concluded that 'the concept of one-man, one-vote apportionment does not apply to the judicial branch of the government.' 347 F.Supp., at 454. Summary judgment was entered against appellant, who had attacked the Louisiana scheme under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

 Betty WELLSv. Edwin EDWARDS et al.No. 72-621. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 8, 1973
 The judgment is affirmed.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 The Louisiana constitutional provisions, which this Court today upholds against appellant's renewed constitutional attack, provide for the election of the State's Supreme Court Justices from election districts that are established without regard to population. Voters in five districts, composed of varying numbers of parishes, elect one justice each. A sixth district elects two justices. La. Const., Art. VII, 9. The record before the District Court indicated that there was 'considerable deviation between the population of some of the [election] districts,' 347 F.Supp., at 454,1 and that, therefore, the votes of some qualified voters, depending on the happenstance of residence, were of less value in electing justices than others, cast elsewhere. But the District Court refused even to consider this evidence and, relying on a few isolated sentences in Hadley v. Junior College District, 397 U.S. 50 (1970), concluded that 'the concept of one-man, one-vote apportionment does not apply to the judicial branch of the government.' 347 F.Supp., at 454. Summary judgment was entered against appellant, who had attacked the Louisiana scheme under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
 In Hadley, we held that the one-person, one-vote principle extended to the election of trustees for a consolidated junior college district. In doing so, Mr. Justice Black, writing for the Court, stated broadly that, as a general rule, 'whenever a state or local government

|86 u.s. 468|"The Mayor v. Ray
86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 468

Syllabus 
A city corporation the charter of which gave to it the usual powers formerly given to such corporations but which did not give to it the power to borrow money, being and for some time having been pecuniarily embarrassed, issued its checks, in form negotiable and drawn by the mayor and recorder of the city on the city treasurer.  The checks were presented to the city treasurer and by him endorsed with his name and the date of his endorsement, it being the practice of that officer, in the then embarrassments of the city, thus to endorse checks when the city was not in funds to pay them, in order that the checks might thereafter draw interest, as it was understood that they would do.   The checks were then taken by the holder, and, according to a then prevalent custom to pay them for taxes, were paid to the treasurer of the board of education of the city in discharge of school taxes.  This officer (again, according to a then prevalent custom) sold them to A. (selling them for eighty cents on the dollar), and with the money discharged the salaries due by the city to the teachers of its public schools.
On suit by A. against the city, the court below excluded evidence tending to show fraud and want of consideration and authority to make them in the issue of the notes, and held that under its charter, the city could issue promissory notes, and that if signed by the proper officers and given for a good consideration, they would be legal and obligatory; that a usage to reissue such securities was good, and that though upon their face overdue, they were payable 
Page 86 U. S. 469
 so as to let in defenses against a subsequent holder, until the lapse of a reasonable time for making demand; that the reissue, if made with the sanction of the city authorities, would be valid, and that such sanction might be presumed from circumstances.  It gave judgment accordingly.
On the case's coming here, the judgment was reversed, five judges only out of eight of which the court was then composed concurring in the judgment of reversal.
Four of these judges placed the judgment on the broad grounds:
1. That municipal corporations have not the power, without legislative authority expressly or clearly implied, to borrow money or to issue notes, bills, or other securities of a commercial character free from equitable defenses in the hands of bona fide holders.
2. That such corporations are of a public character, instituted for purposes of local government, and constitute part of the domestic government of the state; that the power of taxation is given to them for the purpose of raising the means of carrying on their functions, and that the creation of such special power is exclusive of others.
3. That the officers of such a corporation cannot, like the officers of a private corporation, create by their acts an estoppel against the corporation, its taxpayers, or people so as to render illegal issues of ordinary city drafts or vouchers (not authorized by law) valid in the hands of holders for value; that such holders are affected with notice of the illegality.
4. That certificates of debt, city warrants, orders, checks, drafts, and the like used for giving to the public creditors evidence of the amount of their claims against the city treasury are valid instruments for that purpose, and may be transferred from hand to band, but that they are not commercial paper in the sense of creating an absolute obligation to pay them, free from legal and equitable defenses, and that the holder takes them subject to such defenses.
These judges admitted, however, and as of course, that when power to borrow money and to issue bonds or other securities of a commercial character therefor is given to a municipal corporation, such securities will possess the usual qualities attaching to like securities issued by private corporations.
The remaining one of the five justices -- not agreeing to all thus declared and holding that the city, unless clearly forbidden by its charter, could issue negotiable notes to pay its debts and that such notes would be subject to the law governing negotiable paper, and holding especially that the corporation, having received and still holding the money for the notes, could not repudiate its contract to pay -- put his concurrence in the reversal on the narrower grounds:
1. That the judge erred in charging that though the checks had been presented for payment and payment had been refused, and though the time of such presentation and refusal had been noted on them, the checks were not to be deemed dishonored so as to let in defenses between the corporation and a subsequent holder. 
Page 86 U. S. 470

2. That the plaintiff being thus not a holder bona fide, the court erred in excluding the offers to show fraud, corruption, or want of authority in the issue of the checks.
3. That it erred in charging that if it was the usage of the corporation to reissue its securities by sale in the market after such securities had been fully paid and satisfied, such reissued securities were obligatory upon the corporation.
Ray sued the Mayor and City Council of Nashville to recover the amount of nineteen corporation drafts or orders, ranging from a few dollars in amount to over $1,000, and together amounting, with interest, to over $9,000.  In form, they were drawn by the mayor and recorder upon the city treasurer, payable to some person named, or bearer, and were impressed with the city seal.  The following is one of the orders, and shows the form of them all.
image:a
This was the form in which all city dues were usually paid.  The endorsement by the treasurer was made when the orders were presented to him.  Evidence was given by the plaintiff tending to show that it had been the custom for many years, when the treasurer failed to pay such checks on presentation, for him to write his name on the back, with the date of presentation, and afterwards, in the payment of such checks, to allow interest from that date, and that it was usual to present such checks for endorsement to draw interest when it was known there were no funds for their payment; also, that it was the well known custom of the 
Page 86 U. S. 471
 proper collecting officers of the corporation to receive such checks for taxes and other dues of the corporation; that at the time these checks were issued and at the time they were bought by the plaintiff, the city was largely involved in debt, and that many such checks were outstanding unpaid, and were bought and sold in the market, and that nearly all the city taxes were paid therewith; that for some time before the plaintiff purchased the checks in question, the taxes for the support of public schools were collected and paid over to the treasurer of the board of education in such checks; and for about five months before, it had been the practice of such treasurer to sell such checks and to use the proceeds in payment of teachers; also that all the checks sued on (except one for $1,000 payable to Julius Sax), were so received for taxes, and paid to the said treasurer of the board of education, and by him sold soon after receiving them to one McCrory as agent of the plaintiff to buy the same at the rate of eighty cents on the dollar, and the proceeds paid to teachers; that the check payable to Sax was purchased from him by McCrory, as the plaintiff's agent, for $800, being one of sixteen checks of $1,000 each, issued by order of the chairman of the finance committee of the city council without any order of the council, and hypothecated with Sax as security for a loan of $12,000, payable in four months (half of which was made in city checks), power being given in the loan note to sell the hypothecated checks, if the loan was not paid when due. Sax sold the check in question to the plaintiff within a week after receiving it.  The plaintiff also offered the evidence of the city recorder to show that the checks sued on were made in the usual course of business of the corporation and for corporation purposes; also evidence tending to show that the city collector, in collecting checks for taxes, was in the habit, in making change, of paying out checks previously collected, and that the mayor and council were informed of the practice pursued by the collector of reissuing checks which he had received in payment of taxes by paying a portion of them over to the board of education, and knew of the practice 
Page 86 U. S. 472
 of issuing and hypothecating checks for loans and selling them for money.
The defendant introduced proof tending to show that McCrory, the agent of the plaintiff, when he purchased the eighteen checks, had notice that they had been received by the tax collector and reissued by him to the treasurer of the board of education (the evidence showing that the presentation and neglect to pay had in most instances been made nearly two months before, and in one instance nearly four months); also that the city council had no knowledge of the manner of making checks on the mere order of the chairman of the finance committee and their hypothecation and sale for money; and that some of them had no knowledge of the reissue of checks by the collector.
The charter and ordinances of the city were put in evidence, and were referred to on the argument before this Court.
The former was couched in the usual form of such charters, conferring upon the corporation power to receive, hold, and dispose of property, to levy taxes, appropriate money, and provide for the payment of the debts and expenses of the city; to establish hospitals, schools, waterworks, markets, and erect buildings necessary for the use of the city; to open, regulate, and light the streets; to establish a police, night watch &c., and to pass all ordinances necessary to carry out the intent of the charter.
It contained, however, no express power to borrow money.  But former laws (which were superseded by the charter) had authorized the issue of specific city bonds for that purpose; and such securities were outstanding in 1868, as appeared by an act of the legislature, passed March 16 of that year, by which it was provided that the taxes necessary to pay the coupons and interest on the bonds and funded debt of the city should be kept distinct and should be payable only in legal currency, and no checks or orders of the city were to be received therefor.  It was also enacted by the same statute that the amount necessary to be raised by tax for the sinking fund for paying said bonds, and for the support of the public schools, should be paid in the same manner. 
Page 86 U. S. 473

The public ordinances of the city were published in a book, and by these it was, among other things, provided that there should be a committee of improvements and expenditures, and that all propositions for improvements, or the expenditure of money, or the incurring of any liability, should be referred to this committee, who were to report to the city council, and that no liability should be incurred unless authorized by existing laws or by order of the city council, and that no check should be issued by the recorder upon the treasurer, unless by authority of the city council, or in pursuance of existing laws of the corporation.
The defendant offered proof tending to show that there was no evidence of any authority having ever been given by the city council for the issue or reissue of checks in the manner in which the checks in question were issued and reissued; and that one of them (specified) had been issued in virtue of a corrupt contract with a member of the council.  The proof was rejected under the defendant's exception.
The court charged in substance as follows:  that the charter of Nashville authorized the corporation to issue promissory notes and other securities for lawful debts; that the instruments in question, if signed by the proper officers and given for a good consideration, were in effect promissory notes, legal and obligatory; that by long usage, the corporation had sanctioned the authority of the officers to issue such instruments; that the purchasers thereof were authorized to presume that they were properly issued; that if it was the usage to reissue these securities by sale in the market, they would, when so sold, be obligatory on the corporation; and though upon their face overdue, they would be in law payable on demand, and not to be deemed dishonored so as to let in defenses against a subsequent holder of the paper until after the lapse of a reasonable time for making demand; that the reissue and sale of the securities in question by the treasurer of the board of education, if done by the consent and sanction of the mayor, aldermen, and council, made them valid obligations against the city; and that 
Page 86 U. S. 474
 such consent and sanction might be presumed from the publicity of the transactions, the want of other resources to support the schools, and the other circumstances of the case, without any formal official action taken on the subject; and that the common usage of the finance committee, to pledge the city checks as security for its notes, if known to the corporation, was binding upon it, and that the checks so pledged would be valid in the hands of a purchaser before maturity, not having notice of a premature sale or other irregularity in their issue.
This charge was excepted to in all its parts, and upon these exceptions the case was argued before this Court in reference to the following points:
1. Has a municipal corporation the power, without express legislative authority, to borrow money for any of the purposes of its incorporation?
2. Has it the power, without express legislative authority, to issue its paper clothed with all the attributes of negotiability?
3. Conceding the affirmative of these two queries, can the executive officers of a municipal corporation borrow money, or issue negotiable securities for the corporation, so as to bind it, without ""ordinance;"" that is to say, without express authority from the legislative department of the corporate government in its collective official capacity? [Footnote 1]
The case was elaborately argued, both upon principle and authorities, on these points by Messrs. W. F. and H. Cooper for the plaintiff in error and by Messrs. G. F. Edmunds and R. McP. Smith, contra, the latter counsel referring specially to Adams v. Memphis & Little Rock Railroad Company, in the Supreme Court of Tennessee, [Footnote 2] in which state the transactions now in question arose.

 Gordon MONTGOMERY et al.v. UNITED STATES.No. 72-6612. 
 Ross William MONTGOMERYv. UNITED STATES.No. 72-6840. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 15, 1973
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioners are members of the Pit River Indian Nation who, in order to construct Indian-style buildings, felled one Ponderosa pine growing on the public lands of the United States, but within the original boundaries of the lands occupied by their ancestors. They were prosecuted under 18 U. S.C. 1852, which provides in relevant part: 
 * * * * * 
Page 414 U.S. 935 , 936
 necessary to support his improvements, or the taking of timber for the use of the United States; nor shall it interfere with or take away any right or privilege under any existing law of the United States to cut or remove timber from any public lands.' (Emphasis added.)
 In their defense, petitioners claimed that the original 'aboriginal title' or 'Indian title' to their ancestral tribal lands constituted a right recognized by existing law. The Court of Appeals dismissed this claim, reasoning that the specific exemptions granted miners, farmers, and the United States negatived a reading of the 'existing law' clause which would include ancestral title, and noting that there was no 'relevant authority' for the defense raised by petitioners. 
 There is, of course, no 'relevant authority' for petitioners' claim, because the issue of whether the 'existing law' clause of 18 U.S.C. 1852 reaches aboriginal or Indian title has not been previously litigated. 
 But this Court has often held that the occupation of property by Indians' ancestors gives rise to Indian title, which, though not a property interest subject to Fifth Amendment protections, encompasses the right to occupancy and use-the right to fish, to hunt, and to cut timber sufficient for use on the land. See, e. g., Tee-Hit-Ton v. United States, 348 U.S. 272, 279; United States v. Santa Fe Pacific R. Co., 314 U.S. 339, 345; United States v. Cook, 19 Wall. 591, 86 U.S. 591, 593-594; Johnson v. M'Intosh, 8 Wheat. 543, 21 U.S. 543, 574, 584, 591 ( Marshall, C. J.). This, I think, is a right recognized by the 'existing law' of the United States. 
 A question strikingly similar to the issue in this case arose in Cramer v. United States, 261 U.S. 219, where a land grant by the United States to a railroad excepted lands 'reserved . . . or otherwise disposed of.' Some [414 U.S. 935 , 937]

 Gordon MONTGOMERY et al.v. UNITED STATES.No. 72-6612. 
 Ross William MONTGOMERYv. UNITED STATES.No. 72-6840. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 15, 1973
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioners are members of the Pit River Indian Nation who, in order to construct Indian-style buildings, felled one Ponderosa pine growing on the public lands of the United States, but within the original boundaries of the lands occupied by their ancestors. They were prosecuted under 18 U. S.C. 1852, which provides in relevant part: 
 * * * * * 
Page 414 U.S. 935 , 936
 necessary to support his improvements, or the taking of timber for the use of the United States; nor shall it interfere with or take away any right or privilege under any existing law of the United States to cut or remove timber from any public lands.' (Emphasis added.)
 In their defense, petitioners claimed that the original 'aboriginal title' or 'Indian title' to their ancestral tribal lands constituted a right recognized by existing law. The Court of Appeals dismissed this claim, reasoning that the specific exemptions granted miners, farmers, and the United States negatived a reading of the 'existing law' clause which would include ancestral title, and noting that there was no 'relevant authority' for the defense raised by petitioners. 
 There is, of course, no 'relevant authority' for petitioners' claim, because the issue of whether the 'existing law' clause of 18 U.S.C. 1852 reaches aboriginal or Indian title has not been previously litigated. 
 But this Court has often held that the occupation of property by Indians' ancestors gives rise to Indian title, which, though not a property interest subject to Fifth Amendment protections, encompasses the right to occupancy and use-the right to fish, to hunt, and to cut timber sufficient for use on the land. See, e. g., Tee-Hit-Ton v. United States, 348 U.S. 272, 279; United States v. Santa Fe Pacific R. Co., 314 U.S. 339, 345; United States v. Cook, 19 Wall. 591, 86 U.S. 591, 593-594; Johnson v.

 It is my view that, 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the state and federal governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.' Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (dissenting opinion). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 1021 is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my Paris Adult dissent, I would therefore grant certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with my Paris Adult dissent. 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that state obscenity regulation is prohibited by the Fourteenth and First Amendments (see Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 70 ( Douglas, J., dissenting)), would grant certiorari in each of these cases and reverse the judgments of conviction.

 Petitioners were convicted on charges of selling allegedly obscene materials in violation of 21 Oklahoma Statutes 1971, 1040.8 and 1040.13. Section 1040.8, among other things, makes it 'unlawful for any person to knowingly . . . sell . . . or otherwise distribute . . . any obscene book, magazine, . . . or other article which is obscene, filthy, indecent, lascivious, lewd or unfit, as defined in Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes 1040.12 . . ..' 1040.13, provides in relevant part that 'Every person who with knowledge of its contents, . . . sells, . . . any obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent article . . . is guilty of a misdemeanor . . .""
