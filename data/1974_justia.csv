|419 u.s. 1314|"Socialist Workers Party v. Attorney General
No. A-534
Decided December 27, 1974
419 U.S. 1314

Syllabus 
Applicants, the Socialist Workers Party, its youth organization (YSA), and various individuals, brought an action against various Government officials for alleged interference in their political activities and sought an injunction, which the District Court granted, barring FBI agents and informants from attending or otherwise monitoring the YSA national convention.  Except for upholding a bar against the FBI's transmitting to the Civil Service Commission (CSC) the names of persons attending the convention, the Court of Appeals vacated the injunction, noting that the convention was open to anyone under age 29 and that the only investigative method would be the use of informants who would attend meetings as the public would and that any ""chilling effect"" on applicants' rights was not sufficient to outweigh prejudice to the Government that compromising its informants would entail.  Applicants apply for a stay of the Court of Appeals' order and reinstatement of the District Court's injunction.
Held:  Although, unlike the situation in Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, applicants' allegations of a ""chilling effect"" are sufficiently specific to satisfy Art. III's jurisdictional requirements, nevertheless a stay would be improper, since the FBI has represented that it plans no disruptive activity at the convention and will not transmit information to nongovernmental entities, and since interim relief against disclosure of delegates' names to the CSC has been granted.

No. 73-5677
Argued October 23, 1974
Decided December 23, 1974
419 U.S. 256

Syllabus 
Petitioner, sentenced to death, under Art. 118 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, by a court-martial for murder, attacked the validity of a Presidential commutation to life imprisonment (under which petitioner had served 20 years) conditioned on petitioner's never being paroled.  The District Court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, additionally rejecting petitioner's contention that this Court's intervening decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, required that petitioner be resentenced to a life term with the possibility of parole, the alternative punishment for murder under Art. 118.
Held:  The conditional commutation of petitioner's death sentence was within the President's powers under Art. II,  2, cl. 1, of the Constitution to ""grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States.""  Pp.  419 U. S. 260-268.
(a) The executive pardoning power under the Constitution, which has consistently adhered to the English common law practice, historically included the power to commute sentences on conditions not specifically authorized by statute.  United States v. Wilson, 7 Pet. 150; Ex parte Wells, 18 How. 307.  Pp.  419 U. S. 260-266.
(b) Since the pardoning power derives from the Constitution alone, it cannot be modified, abridged, or diminished by any statute, including Art. 118, and Furman v. Georgia, supra, did not affect the conditional commutation of petitioner's sentence.  Pp.  419 U. S. 266-268.

No. 73-1055
Argued November 20, 1974
Decided December 23, 1974*
419 U.S. 281

Syllabus 
In 1969, hearing examiners for the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), following hearings in 1966 and 1967 and the subsequent filing of extensive briefs, rejected appellant motor carriers' applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity to transport general commodities between specified points in the Southwest and Southeast.  In 1971 the ICC, over the opposition of appellee competing motor carriers, authorized the issuance of the certificates.  Appellees then brought action in the District Court to set aside the ICC's order.  The District Court refused to enforce the order on the ground that the ICC had acted arbitrarily in refusing to credit certain evidence introduced by appellees.
Held:
1. The District Court erred in refusing to enforce the ICC's order.  Pp.  419 U. S. 284-294.
(a) Under the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard, the scope of review is a narrow one whereby a reviewing court must ""consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment,"" Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402,  401 U. S. 416.  Pp.  419 U. S. 285-286.
(b) The ICC's observation that appellees' exhibits as to the acceptability of their existing service covered periods subsequent to the ICC's notice of hearing supported its refusal to credit this evidence.  The ICC was entitled to regard such exhibits as nonrepresentative of the usual service, to reason that the shortcomings 
Page 419 U. S. 282
 were greater than the exhibits showed, and to conclude that service would be improved by granting the applications.  Pp.  419 U. S. 286-289.
(c) There was a rational basis for the ICC's attributing little significance to appellees' exhibits showing appellants' transit times over other routes.  The question was whether service on the routes at issue would be enhanced by new entry and, as to this, performance by prospective entrants on other routes was of limited relevance.  The ICC erred in not attributing the same qualification to appellants' transit time exhibits, but its finding that service would be improved by new entry was supported by other evidence.  Pp.  419 U. S. 289-292.
(d) The ICC's conclusion that consumer benefits of new entry outweighed any adverse impact upon the existing carriers reflects the kind of judgment that is entrusted to it, namely, the power to weigh the competing interests and arrive at a balance that is deemed ""the public convenience and necessity.""  Pp.  419 U. S. 292-294.
2. The lapse of time between the conclusion of evidentiary hearings and the ultimate agency decision in this case does not justify a reviewing court's requiring that the record be reopened.  Pp.  419 U. S. 294-296.
3. The ICC was entitled to take an approach, divergent from that of its examiners, favoring added competition among carriers.  Pp.  419 U. S. 297-299.
4. Whether or not the certificate granted appellant Bowman Transportation Co. conformed to the authority set forth in its application, an issue not briefed or argued in this Court, should be considered by the District Court on remand.  Pp.  419 U. S. 299-300.

No. 73-1270
Argued October 22, 1974
Decided December 23, 1974
419 U.S. 318

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an employee of a trucking company (PMT), was injured while transferring automobiles in respondent's railyard from respondent's railroad car to a PMT auto trailer, an operation that PMT performed under contract for respondent.  Although respondent's employees occasionally consulted with PMT employees about the operation, PMT supervisors controlled the day-to-day unloading process.  Petitioner, claiming that he was sufficiently under respondent's control to bring him under the coverage of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), which makes a covered railroad liable for negligently causing injury or death to any person ""while he is employed"" by the railroad, and that the accident resulted from respondent's negligence, brought suit against respondent under the FELA.  The District Court found that the relationship between petitioner and respondent sufficed to make the FELA apply, the court having concluded that:  PMT was serving generally as respondent's agent; PMT employees were respondent's agents for purposes of the unloading operation; and the work performed by petitioner fulfilled a nondelegable duty of respondent.  The Court of Appeals reversed, having concluded that the District Court's test for FELA liability was too broad.
Held:
1. The ""while employed"" language of the FELA requires not only that the FELA plaintiff be an agent of the rail carrier but the carrier's servant, and here the District Court erred in holding that petitioner (who according to the court's findings was neither a borrowed servant of respondent nor a dual servant of respondent and PMT) came within the coverage of the FELA, since those findings also did not establish a master-servant relationship between respondent and PMT that would be necessary to render petitioner a subservant of the railroad.  Nor was the District Court's conclusion that respondent was ""responsible"" for the unloading operation tantamount to a finding that the railroad controlled or had the right to control the physical conduct of PMT employees like petitioner in the unloading operation.  Pp.  419 U. S. 322-326. 
Page 419 U. S. 319

2. The District Court's findings that petitioner worked most of the time on respondent's premises and that respondent's employees were responsible for checking the safety conditions on the railroad cars showed only that the two companies' operations were closely related, not that respondent's employees supervised the unloading operation, and consequently the FELA's ""while employed"" requirement remains unsatisfied even under the proper test.  Pp.  419 U. S. 326-331.
3. The record should be reexamined by the District Court in light of the proper legal standard.  Pp.  419 U. S. 331-332.

No. 73-5845
Argued October 15, 1974
Decided December 23, 1974
419 U.S. 345

Syllabus 
Petitioner brought suit against respondent, a privately owned and operated utility corporation which holds a certificate of public convenience issued by the Pennsylvania Utility Commission, seeking damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983 for termination of her electric service allegedly before she had been afforded notice, a hearing, and an opportunity to pay any amounts found due.  Petitioner claimed that, under state law she was entitled to reasonably continuous electric service, and that respondent's termination for alleged nonpayment, permitted by a provision of its general tariff filed with the Commission, was state action depriving petitioner of her property without due process of law and giving rise to a cause of action under  1983.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's dismissal of petitioner's complaint.
Held:  Pennsylvania is not sufficiently connected with the challenged termination to make respondent's conduct attributable to the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, petitioner having shown no more than that respondent was a heavily regulated private utility with a partial monopoly and that it elected to terminate service in a manner that the Commission found permissible under state law.

No. 73-5520
Argued November 13, 1974
Decided December 18, 1974
419 U.S. 245

Syllabus 
Petitioners, a mother and her son, brought a diversity action against respondents, a newspaper publisher and a reporter, for invasion of privacy based on a feature story in the newspaper discussing the impact upon petitioners' family of the death of the father in a bridge collapse.  The story concededly contained a number of inaccuracies and false statements about the family.  The District Judge struck the claims for punitive damages for lack of evidence of malice ""within the legal definition of that term,"" but allowed the case to go to the jury on the ""false light"" theory of invasion of privacy, after instructing the jurors that liability could be imposed only if they found that the false statements were published with knowledge of their falsity or in reckless disregard of the truth, and the jury returned a verdict for compensatory damages.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Judge should have directed a verdict for respondents, since his finding of no malice in striking the punitive damages claims was based on the definition of ""actual malice"" established in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, and thus was a determination that there was no evidence of the knowing falsity or reckless disregard of the truth required for liability.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in setting aside the jury's verdict.  Pp.  419 U. S. 251-254.
(a) The record discloses that the District Judge, when he dismissed the punitive damages claims, was not referring to the New York Times ""actual malice"" standard, but to the common law standard of malice that is generally required under state tort law to support an award of punitive damages, and that, in a ""false light"" case, would focus on the defendant's attitude toward the plaintiff's privacy, and not on the truth or falsity of the material published, and thus was not determining that petitioners had failed to introduce evidence of knowing falsity or reckless disregard of the truth.  Pp.  419 U. S. 251-252. 
Page 419 U. S. 246

(b) Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to support jury findings that respondents had published knowing or reckless falsehoods about petitioners, particularly with respect to ""calculated falsehoods"" about petitioner mother's being present when the story was being prepared, and that respondent reporter's writing of the story was within the scope of his employment at the newspaper so as to render respondent publisher vicariously liable under respondeat superior for the knowing falsehoods in the story.

Respondent operators of a California ""hot plant,"" at which asphaltic concrete for surfacing highways is manufactured and sold entirely intrastate, alleging violations of, inter alia,  2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act (hereafter  2(a)), and  3 and 7 of the Clayton Act, brought suit against petitioner liquid asphalt producers and two of their subsidiaries, to which such asphalt is sold and which use it to manufacture and sell asphaltic concrete in competition with respondents.  Section 2(a) forbids ""any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce"" to discriminate in price ""where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce"" and the discrimination has substantial anticompetitive effects ""in any line of commerce.""  Section 3 makes it unlawful ""for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce"" to make tie-in sales or enter exclusive dealing arrangements where the effect ""may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.""  And  7 forbids certain acquisitions by a corporation ""engaged in commerce"" of the assets or stock ""of another corporation engaged also in commerce"" where the effect may be substantially to lessen competition ""in any line of commerce in any section of the country.""  The District Court held that it had no jurisdiction of the claims because the market for asphaltic concrete is exclusively and necessarily local, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the jurisdictional requirements of  2(a), 3, and 7 were satisfied by the fact that sales of asphaltic concrete are made for use in interstate highways.
Held:
1. The fact that interstate highways are instrumentalities of commerce does not render petitioners' conduct with respect to a material sold for use in constructing these highways ""in commerce"" as a matter of law for purposes of  2(a), 3, and 7 of the Clayton Act.  Overstreet v. North Shore Corp., 318 U. S. 125, and Alstate Construction Co. v. Durkin, 345 U. S. 13, distinguished.  Pp.  419 U. S. 193-199. 
Page 419 U. S. 187

2. The ""in commerce"" language of the Robinson-Patman and Clayton Act provisions in question does not extend on an ""effects on commerce"" theory to petitioners' sales and acquisitions.  Pp.  419 U. S. 199-203.
(a) In face of the longstanding judicial interpretation of the language of  2(a) requiring that ""either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination [be] in commerce,"" as meaning that  2(a) applies only where ""at least one of the two transactions which, when compared, generate a discrimination . . . cross[es] a state line,'"" Hiram Walker, Inc. v. A & S Tropical, Inc., 407 F.2d 4, 9; Belliston v. Texaco, Inc., 455 F.2d 175, 178, and the continued congressional silence on the subject, this Court is not warranted in extending  2(a) beyond its clear language to reach a multitude of local activities hitherto left to state and local regulation.  Pp.  419 U. S. 199-201.
(b) The ""effects on commerce"" theory, whereby  3 and 7 of the Clayton Act would be held to extend to acquisitions and sales having substantial effects on commerce, even if legally correct, fails here for want of proof, since respondents presented no evidence of effect on interstate commerce from the use of asphaltic concrete in interstate highways.

Respondents, an association representing stevedoring companies, and a shipper, sought injunctive relief in an Alabama state court against picketing of a foreign-flag ship by petitioner maritime unions which were protesting as substandard the wages paid the foreign crewmen who manned the ship.  The trial court issued a temporary injunction, and the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed.  Petitioners contend that the state courts were without jurisdiction to grant relief, and that the issuance of an injunction interfered with their free speech rights.

(a) Even if there is a dispute between petitioners and respondents independent of petitioners' dispute with foreign flag ships, it is subject to state court disposition unless it satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of the NLRA.  P.  419 U. S. 221.
(b) The fact that the state court's jurisdiction is invoked by stevedores and shippers, rather than by the foreign-ship owners as in Windward, supra, does not convert into ""commerce"" within the meaning of the NLRA's jurisdictional requirements, activities that plainly were not such in Windward.  Pp.  419 U. S. 221-225.
(c) Neither the shipper seeking to ship his products, the stevedores who contracted to unload the foreign flag vessel's cargo, nor the longshoremen employed to do the unloading, were, for the purposes of jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board over a dispute directly affecting the maritime operations of foreign flag vessels, ""engaged in or affecting commerce"" within the purview of the NLRA, and therefore petitioners' picketing did not even ""arguably"" constitute an unfair labor practice under  8(b)(4) of the Act, the secondary boycott provision.  Pp.  419 U. S. 225-228.
2. The Alabama courts' action in enjoining the picketing violated no right conferred upon petitioners by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, because that action is well within that

(b) The injunction is supported by a ""valid public policy.""

(c) Petitioners' contention that the record fails to support the conclusion that there was a substantial question whether the picketing constituted ""wrongful interference,"" is without merit, since the question whether evidence is sufficient to make out a cause of action created by state law and tried in the state courts is a matter for decision by those courts.

As a comprehensive solution to a national rail crisis precipitated by the entry into reorganization proceedings under  77 of the Bankruptcy Act of eight major railroads in the northeast and midwest region of the country, Congress supplemented  77 with the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (Rail Act).  Each railroad under a  77 reorganization must proceed under the Rail Act unless its reorganization court within specified times finds (a) that the railroad is reorganizable on an income basis within a reasonable time under  77 and that the public interest would be better served by a  77, rather than a Rail Act reorganization or (b) that the Rail Act does not provide a process that is fair and equitable to the estate of the railroad in reorganization (hereafter railroad).  207(b) of the Rail Act.  Appeals from  207(b) orders are provided to a Special Court, whose decision is final.  The Rail Act establishes a Government corporation, the United States Railway Association (USRA), which is directed to formulate a ""Final System Plan"" (Plan) by July 26, 1975, for restructuring the railroads into a ""financially self-sustaining rail service system.""  The Plan must provide for transfer of designated railroad properties to the Consolidated Rail Corp. (Conrail), a private state-incorporated corporation, in return for Conrail securities, plus up to $500 million of federally guaranteed USRA obligations and the other benefits accruing to the railroad from the transfer.  The Plan, which becomes effective if neither House of Congress disapproves it within 60 days, must be transmitted to the Special Court, which has exclusive jurisdiction of all proceedings concerning the Plan.   209.  Within 10 days after deposit 
Page 419 U. S. 103
 with it of Conrail securities and USRA obligations, the Special Court must order the railroad trustee to convey forthwith to Conrail the railroad's properties designated in the Plan.  303(b).  The Special Court then determines under  303(c), with an appeal extending to this Court, whether the conveyance is fair and equitable to the railroad's estate under  77 standards, or whether the transfer is more fair and equitable than a constitutional minimum requires (in which case necessary adjustments must be made).  If the Special Court finds the conveyance not fair and equitable, the court must reallocate, or order issuance of additional Conrail securities and USRA obligations, enter a judgment against Conrail, or combine such remedies.  Railroads may discontinue service and abandon properties not designated for transfer under the Plan, but, until the Plan becomes effective, may only discontinue service or abandon any line with USRA consent and absent reasonable state opposition.   304(f).  Parties with interests in Penn Central Transportation Co. (Penn Central) brought suits attacking the constitutionality of the Rail Act, contending that the Act violates the Fifth Amendment by taking Penn Central property without just compensation, on the grounds (1) that the Conrail securities and USRA obligations and other benefits would not be the constitutionally required equivalent of the rail properties whose transfer is compelled by  303(b) (the ""conveyance taking"" issue), and (2) that  304(f) compels continuation of rail operations pending the Plan's implementation even if erosion, beyond constitutional limits, of Penn Central's estate occurs during the interim period (the ""erosion taking"" issue).  While rejecting the ""conveyance taking"" issue as premature in view of a number of decisional steps required before the final conveyance, the District Court held that the ""erosion taking"" issue was not premature, and rejected the contention of the United States, USRA, and the Penn Central Trustees that, if the constitutional limit of permissible uncompensated erosion should be passed, the plaintiffs would have an adequate remedy at law under the Tucker Act, which gives the Court of Claims jurisdiction to render judgment ""upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress . . . ,"" the District Court finding that the Rail Act precluded a Tucker Act remedy.  The court therefore declared  304(f) invalid as violating the Fifth Amendment
""to the extent that it would require continued operation of rail services at a loss in violation of the constitutional rights of the owners and creditors of a railroad,""
and the court declared  303 invalid to the extent 
Page 419 U. S. 104
 it failed to compensate for interim erosion pending final implementation of the Plan.  In addition to other injunctive relief, the District Court enjoined USRA from certifying the Plan to the Special Court under  209(c).  The court further determined that the provision of  207(b) requiring dismissal of certain reorganization proceedings is constitutionally invalid as a geographically nonuniform law on the subject of bankruptcies.
Held:
1. The issue of the availability of a Tucker Act remedy if the Rail Act effects an ""erosion taking"" is ripe for adjudication in view of the distinct possibility that compelled continued rail operations by Penn Central, which in the past several years has sustained great losses and is not ""reorganizable on an income basis within a reasonable time under [ 77],"" would injure plaintiffs below without any assurance before the Plan is implemented of their being compensated.  Pp.  419 U. S. 122-125.
2. The Tucker Act remedy is not barred by the Rail Act, but is available to provide just compensation for any ""erosion taking"" effected by the Rail Act.  Pp.  419 U. S. 125-136.
(a) The correct issue is whether Congress intended to prevent recourse to the Tucker Act, and not, as the District Court held, whether the Rail Act affirmatively manifests a congressional intent to permit such recourse.  Pp.  419 U. S. 126-127.
(b) Rail Act provisions relied on as evincing a congressional determination that no federal funds beyond those expressly committed by the Act were to be paid for the rail properties, equally support the inference that Congress felt that the Rail Act provided at least the minimum compensation and gave no consideration to withdrawal of the Tucker Act remedy.  Pp.  419 U. S. 127-129.
(c) Section 601 of the Rail Act, which specifically deals with other statutes inconsistent with the Rail Act, does not mention the Tucker Act.  P.  419 U. S. 129.
(d) There is no legislative history supporting the argument that the Rail Act should be construed to withdraw the Tucker Act remedy.  Pp.  419 U. S. 129-133.
(e) Applicable canons of construction fortify the conclusion that the Rail Act does not withdraw the Tucker Act remedy.  Pp.  419 U. S. 133-136.
3. Certain basic ""conveyance taking"" issues are now ripe for adjudication.  Pp.  419 U. S. 136-148.
(a) Since, after the District Court's opinion, the Special Court reversed the Penn Central reorganization court's determination that the Rail Act did not provide a process that would be fair 
Page 419 U. S. 105
 and equitable to the estate, some of the ""conveyance taking"" issues must now be decided.  Pp.  419 U. S. 138-140.
(b) Implementation of the Rail Act will now lead inexorably to the final conveyance, though the exact date cannot now be determined, and the Special Court must order the conveyance of rail properties included in the Plan; since the conveyance is inevitable it is not relevant to the justiciable controversy issue that there will be a delay before the transfer occurs.  Pp.  419 U. S. 140-143.
(c) Several factors militate against the Court's deferring resolution of the constitutional issues here until a time closer to the occurrence of the disputed event and the Court will be in no better position later than it is now to determine the validity of basic final conveyance issues.  However, resolution of other issues, such as those involving valuation, should be postponed.  Pp.  419 U. S. 143-148.
4. For the same reasons as obtained with respect to the ""erosion taking"" issue, a suit in the Court of Claims is available under the Tucker Act for a cash award to cover any shortfall between the consideration that the railroads receive for their rail properties finally conveyed under the Rail Act and the constitutional minimum.  P.  419 U. S. 148.
5. The Tucker Act guarantees an adequate remedy at law for any taking that might occur as a result of the final conveyance provisions of the Rail.Act.  Pp.  419 U. S. 148-156.
(a) Plaintiffs' argument that the Tucker Act remedy is inadequate because the ""conveyance taking"" is an exercise of the eminent domain power and requires full cash payment for the rail properties is without merit.  The Rail Act, coupled with the Tucker Act, is valid as a reorganization statute, and does not constitute an eminent domain statute by virtue of its provisions for federal representation on Conrail's board of directors (which does not constitute Conrail a federal instrumentality) and the provisions for conveyance and continuation of services pending the Plan's formulation; or because of any defects in the Act's provisions for judicial review.  Pp.  419 U. S. 152-155.
(b) Though the Rail Act differs from other reorganization statutes by mandating conveyance without any prior judicial finding that there will be adequate resources in the reorganized company to compensate the debtor estates and, eventually, their creditors, recourse to a Tucker Act suit for any shortfall provides adequate assurance that any taking will be compensated.  Pp.  419 U. S. 155-156. 
Page 419 U. S. 106

(c) The Tucker Act also assures that the railroad estates and their creditors will eventually be made whole for the assets conveyed, and thus the Rail Act doe not deprive plaintiffs of procedural due process.  P.  419 U. S. 156.
6. The Rail Act does not contravene the uniformity requirement of the Bankruptcy Clause.  Pp.  419 U. S. 156-161.
(a) This Court's holding that the Tucker Act remedy is available for any uncompensated taking under the Rail Act obviates the possibility that the Penn Central reorganization court will ever confront the provision for dismissal of a  77 proceeding under  207(b) of the Rail Act, which the District Court held violative of the bankruptcy uniformity requirement.  Pp.  419 U. S. 156-158.
(b) Plaintiffs' argument that constitutional bankruptcy uniformity is violated because the Rail Act is restricted to a single statutorily defined region lacks merit, since the uniformity requirement does not preclude Congress from fashioning legislation to resolve geographically isolated problems, and here Congress acted consistently with that requirement when it dealt with the national rail crisis centering in the problems of rail carriers in the region defined by the Rail Act and applied the Rail Act to every railroad in reorganization throughout the United States.  Pp.  419 U. S. 158-161.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Criminal Court of Baltimore City, Maryland. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted in the Criminal Court of Baltimore City of possession of obscene materials with intent to sell in violation of Art. 27, 418 of the Maryland Code. Section 418 provides in pertinent part as follows: 'Every person who . . . has in his possession with intent to distribute . . . any obsence matter is guilty of a misdemeanor.' The Maryland courts have defined the term 'obscene' by adopting the test set forth in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 ( 1973). See Ebert v. Maryland State Board of Censors, 19 Md.App. 300, 313 A. 2d 536 (1973). The Maryland Court of Special Appeals and the Maryland Court of Appeals denied certiorari. 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that any state or federal ban on, or regulation of, obscenity is prohibited by the Constitution, Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 508-514 (1957); Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 42-47 ( 1973); Paris Adult

 Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 70-73 ( 1973), would grant certiorari and summarily reverse. 
 It is my view that 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obstrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.' Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). 
 It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 418 of the Maryland Code is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals was rendered after Miller, reverse.*

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Missouri. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 On Louis of $200. During the robbery, one of petitioner's confederates fired a shot which killed a bank employee. Petitioner was charged in separate indictments with first-degree murder and first-degree robbery by means of a dangerous and deadly weapon. At the time the death penalty was available under Missouri law for each of these crimes with the decision whether it should be imposed committed to jury discretion. 559. 030, 560.135 (Mo.Rev.Stat.1959) V.A.M.S. 
 Under then-applicable Missouri criminal procedure rules, it was not permissible to join in one indictment or at one trial robbery and murder charges. See Mo.Sup.Ct.Rule 24.04, V.A.M.R.; 545.120, 545.130 (Mo.Rev. Stat.1959), V.A.M.S. Petitioner was tried first on the murder charge. Missouri punishes as first-degree murder 'every homicide which shall be committed in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery, or mayhem.' 559.010 (Mo.Rev.Stat.1969), V.A.M.S. While the murder indictment alleged that petitioner murdered the victim 'feloniously, willfully, premeditately, deliberately, on purpose and of . . . malice afterthought,' petitioner claims, and the Supreme Court of Missouri, as we read its opinion, found, that the murder case was tried to the jury on a felony-murder theory, with proof of the elements of

 the robbery supplying the requisite mens rea for murder. Missouri permits trial on a felony-murder theory even though the indictment does not allege the felony but alleges directly the mens rea for first-degree murder. State v. Conway, 351 Mo. 126, 171 S.W.2d 677 (1943). 
 Petitioner was found guilty of firstdegree murder by the jury, which assessed his punishment as life imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing before the trial judge, petitioner waived his right to appeal the murder conviction and was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. At the same hearing, he withdrew his not-guilty plea to the robbery charge and entered a guilty plea. The prosecuting attorney then recommended a concurrent life sentence on the robbery conviction, and the judge imposed the recommended sentence. 
 In 1970, petitioner sought in state post-conviction remedies to vacate both the waiver of appeal from the murder conviction and the guilty plea to the robbery charge. After hearing, the trial judge held that, although both the waiver of appeal and the guilty plea were motivated by fear that the death penalty might be imposed if petitioner stood trial for robbery, the waiver and plea were voluntary. The Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed. 504 S.W.2d 96 (Sup.Ct.Mo.1974). 
 The Supreme Court of Missouri also rejected petitioner's contention that the prosecution for robbery after conviction for murder on a felony- murder theory violated the constitutional protection from double jeopardy. 504 S.W.2d, at 97, relying on State v. Moore, 326 Mo. 1199, 33 SW.2d 905 ( 1930). In my view this holding was in error. 
 The two charges leveled against petitioner clearly arose out of the same criminal transaction or episode, yet they were tried separately. In that circumstance, we should grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the robbery [419 U.S. 1075 , 1077]

 Raymond WELLSv. State of MISSOURI.No. 73-6535. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 16, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Missouri. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 On Louis of $200. During the robbery, one of petitioner's confederates fired a shot which killed a bank employee. Petitioner was charged in separate indictments with first-degree murder and first-degree robbery by means of a dangerous and deadly weapon. At the time the death penalty was available under Missouri law for each of these crimes with the decision whether it should be imposed committed to jury discretion. 559. 030, 560.135 (Mo.Rev.Stat.1959) V.A.M.S. 
 Under then-applicable Missouri criminal procedure rules, it was not permissible to join in one indictment or at one trial robbery and murder charges. See Mo.Sup.Ct.Rule 24.04, V.A.M.R.; 545.120, 545.130 (Mo.Rev. Stat.1959), V.A.M.S. Petitioner was tried first on the murder charge. Missouri punishes as first-degree murder 'every homicide which shall be committed in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery, or mayhem.' 559.010 (Mo.Rev.Stat.1969), V.A.M.S. While the murder indictment alleged that petitioner murdered the victim 'feloniously, willfully, premeditately, deliberately, on purpose and of . . . malice afterthought,' petitioner claims, and the Supreme Court of Missouri, as we read its opinion, found, that the murder case was tried to the jury on a felony-murder theory, with proof of the elements of

Syllabus 
Appellant brought this class action for injunctive and declaratory relief attacking the constitutionality of Illinois automobile repossession and resale statutory provisions and alleging that he had purchased a car on a retail installment contract later assigned to appellee bank which (assertedly without any default by appellant or notice to him) repossessed the car and resold it to a third party to whom title was transferred.  A three-judge District Court held that appellant lacked ""standing"" to attack the constitutionality of the statutory scheme, since the repossession and sale of the car had already taken place, and that, since appellant was allegedly not in default, the complaint was directed not at the constitutionality of the statutory provisions, but only at the bank's abuse of those provisions.  Appellant sought review under 28 U.S.C.  1253, which provides for an appeal to this Court from an order granting or denying an injunction in a civil action required by any Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a three-judge district court.  Appellant contends, inter alia, that dismissal of his complaint ""denied"" him the injunctive relief that he sought, whereas appellee bank maintains that an injunction is not ""denied"" for purposes of  1253 by a dismissal based on grounds short of a statute's constitutional validity.
Held:  When a three-judge district court denies a plaintiff injunctive relief on grounds that, if sound, would have justified dissolution of the court as to that plaintiff or a refusal to convene a three-judge court to begin with, review of the denial is available in the court of appeals; and since here the three-judge District Court's decision that the complaint was nonjusticiable for lack of ""standing"" was a ground upon which that court could have dissolved itself, leaving the complaint's disposition to a single judge, the Court of Appeals should determine

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS. 
 The petitioners are members of the Illinois State Police who, joined by their fraternal organization, challenge an Illinois regulatory program that requires disclosure of financial transactions and associations by state employees. The program was created by an executive order of the Governor of Illinois. The order established a State Board of Ethics, empowered to require designated state employees to file an annual Statement of Economic Interest, which discloses assets and liabilities, each source of income and the amount received therefrom, and each 'close economic association,' which is defined as a 'busi- 
Page 419 U.S. 1058 , 1059
 ness or professional entity with which the person is associated as an officer, employee, director, or partner, or in which he has a substantial interest.' The foregoing disclosures must be made not only by the employee himself, but by members of his immediate family sharing his household. Information so reported is open to 'reasonable public inspection.' Failure to make the required disclosures subjects the employee to disciplinary action, including discharge. 
 The Executive Order applies by its terms only to members of the executive branch. Were this the only element of the Illinois scheme to discourage conflict of interests among those who hold public office, I believe a substantial equal protection question would be presented. The State has an undeniably strong interest in placing beyond question the integrity of its public service. But this is an interest that applies to all branches of the government, and where a State singles out a target group of employees, it is arguably compelled by the Equal Protection Clause to justify the differential treatment. The Illinois program, however, is greater than the Executive Order and I add this word because it is not discussed in the briefs nor in the opinion in this case. The Illinois Governmental Ethics Act, passed in 1972, in addition to prescribing a 'code of conduct' for legislators, requires the disclosure of 'economic interest' by members of the legislature and independent agencies, Ill.Rev.Stat. c. 127, 601-101 et seq. [Footnote 1] Criminal penalties are provided for the filing of false statements, and failure to disclose at all subjects the officer to forfeiture of his office, 604A-107.

Syllabus 
Some aliens who live in Mexico and Canada commute to work in the United States.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service has approved this practice with respect to both daily and seasonal commuters, and has classified such aliens as immigrants ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence"" who are ""returning from a temporary visit abroad,"" a category of ""special immigrant"" defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.  1101(a) (27)(b).  Those with that classification have freedom from usual documentation and numerical requirements and from the labor certification requirements of 8 U.S.C.  1182(a)(14).  Certain farmworkers and a collective bargaining agent for farmworkers brought this suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against the practice of thus classifying such alien commuters.  The District Court dismissed the action.  The Court of Appeals upheld the classification as to daily commuters but rejected it as to seasonal commuters.
Held:  Alien commuters are immigrants who are ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence,"" and are ""returning from a temporary visit abroad"" when they enter the United States, and this ""special immigrant"" classification is applicable to both daily and seasonal commuters.  This has long been the administrative construction of the statute in the context of alien commuters, a factor which must be accorded great weight when, as here, Congress has considered the subject and has not seen fit to alter the administrative practice.

Appellant, a cotton merchant with its principal office in Memphis, Tenn., in January, 1971, negotiated a ""forward"" contract with appellee, a Mississippi farmer, for appellee's forthcoming cotton crop.  The agreement was made through a Mississippi broker who arranged contracts for appellant for cotton to be resold in interstate and foreign markets.  Appellant had contracted with mills outside Mississippi for sale of most of the cotton to be purchased in Mississippi, including that to be grown by appellee under this contract.  Alleging refusal by appellee farmer to deliver the cotton, appellant brought suit for injunctive relief and damages.  The Supreme Court of Mississippi, reversing the court below, dismissed the complaint, holding that appellant's contracts were wholly intrastate, being completed upon delivery of cotton at the warehouse, and upholding appellee's contention that the Mississippi courts could not be used to enforce the contract as appellant was doing business in Mississippi without the requisite certificate.  Appellee moved to dismiss in this Court on the ground that the State Supreme Court did not pass on the federal question.
Held:
1. A certificate executed by the Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court makes it clear that a federal question was raised and decided by that court on the validity of a state statute as applied to the facts of this case under the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution, and this Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.

2.

419 U.S. 43

Syllabus 
1. A trustee in bankruptcy for an employer is required by the withholding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC) and similar provisions of the New York City Administrative Code to withhold taxes from the payment of priority claims for wages earned by employees prior to the employer's bankruptcy, but unpaid at the inception of the bankruptcy proceeding.  The payment of the wage claims is ""payment of wages"" under IRC  3402(a) requiring withholding of income taxes, and is wages under IRC  3102(a) requiring withholding of social security taxes, and an ""employer,"" defined by IRC  3401(d)(1) to include ""the person having control of the payment"" of wages, is present under  3402(a).  The same rationale applies to the withholding of city income taxes under the similar City Code provisions.  Pp.  419 U. S. 48-52.
2. From the obligation to withhold it follows that the trustee is also required to prepare and submit to the wage claimants and to the taxing authorities the reports and returns required of employers under IRC  6051(a), 6001, and 6011 and similar provisions of the City Code.  P.  419 U. S. 52.
3. Requiring the trustee to withhold, report, and file returns does not unduly burden the administration of bankrupt estates so as to contravene the spirit of the Bankruptcy Act, for the burden is the same as any employer, or receiver, arrangement debtor, or other fiduciary, with a like number of employees must bear; moreover, both the IRC and the City Code allow the trustee to withhold taxes at a flat rate, thus facilitating the tax computation.  Pp.  419 U. S. 52-54.
4. Proofs of claim by the United States and New York City with respect to the withholding taxes on the priority wage claims are not required.  Since tax liability accrues only when the wage is paid, and since the wages subject to the wage claims here, although earned before bankruptcy, were not paid prior thereto, so that the 
Page 419 U. S. 44
 bankrupt employer's tax liability came into being only during bankruptcy, the taxes are not like debts of the bankrupt for which proofs of claim must be filed.  Pp.  419 U. S. 54-55.
5. The federal and city withholding taxes are entitled, as are the priority wage claims from which they emerge, to second priority of payment under  64a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act.

			"|"Otte v. United States
No. 73-375
Argued October 15, 1974
Decided November 19, 1974
419 U.S. 43

Syllabus 
1. A trustee in bankruptcy for an employer is required by the withholding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC) and similar provisions of the New York City Administrative Code to withhold taxes from the payment of priority claims for wages earned by employees prior to the employer's bankruptcy, but unpaid at the inception of the bankruptcy proceeding.  The payment of the wage claims is ""payment of wages"" under IRC  3402(a) requiring withholding of income taxes, and is wages under IRC  3102(a) requiring withholding of social security taxes, and an ""employer,"" defined by IRC  3401(d)(1) to include ""the person having control of the payment"" of wages, is present under  3402(a).  The same rationale applies to the withholding of city income taxes under the similar City Code provisions.  Pp.  419 U. S. 48-52.
2. From the obligation to withhold it follows that the trustee is also required to prepare and submit to the wage claimants and to the taxing authorities the reports and returns required of employers under IRC  6051(a), 6001, and 6011 and similar provisions of the City Code.  P.  419 U. S. 52.
3. Requiring the trustee to withhold, report, and file returns does not unduly burden the administration of bankrupt estates so as to contravene the spirit of the Bankruptcy Act, for the burden is the same as any employer, or receiver, arrangement debtor, or other fiduciary, with a like number of employees must bear; moreover, both the IRC and the City Code allow the trustee to withhold taxes at a flat rate, thus facilitating the tax computation.  Pp.  419 U. S. 52-54.
4. Proofs of claim by the United States and New York City with respect to the withholding taxes on the priority wage claims are not required.  Since tax liability accrues only when the wage is paid, and since the wages subject to the wage claims here, although earned before bankruptcy, were not paid prior thereto, so that the 
Page 419 U. S. 44
 bankrupt employer's tax liability came into being only during bankruptcy, the taxes are not like debts of the bankrupt for which proofs of claim must be filed.  Pp.  419 U. S. 54-55.
5. The federal and city withholding taxes are entitled, as are the priority wage claims from which they emerge, to second priority of payment under  64a(2) of the Bankruptcy Act.  Such taxes are not within the fourth priority under  64a(4), since they did not become due and owing by the bankrupt until after the wage claims were paid following bankruptcy.  Nor are such taxes entitled to first priority under  64a(1), since they are not costs or expenses of administration of the bankrupt estate, but are part of the wage clams themselves, and are carved out of the payment of those claims.  Pp.  419 U. S. 55-58.

No. 73-5768
Argued October 15, 1974
Decided November 19, 1974
419 U.S. 59

Syllabus 
Petitioner brought this federal habeas corpus action, claiming the unconstitutionality of a state statute under which he had been convicted of a drug violation.  The Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's ruling that petitioner's challenge should be resubmitted to the state courts in the light of a State Supreme Court decision (issued after that court had declined to review petitioner's conviction on direct appeal but before petitioner had filed his habeas petition) holding the state statute constitutionally invalid.
Held:  Since the state courts had a full opportunity to determine the federal constitutional issue before petitioner resorted to the federal forum, no substantial state interest would be served by requiring petitioner to resubmit his constitutional claim to the state courts.  Roberts v. LaVallee, 389 U. S. 40.

 October 29, 1974
 The judgment is affirmed.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Appellant owns several bookstores in Baltimore which contain, inter alia, coin-operated viewing machines showing portions of so-called 'adult' motion pictures. After a number of raids in which these motion pictures were seized for lack of a proper license from the Maryland State Board of Censors, appellant sought injunctive relief against the enforcement of Maryland's film licensing requirements on the grounds that such requirements violate the freedoms protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. We held a predecessor Maryland statute unconstitutional in Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, the three- judge District Court, however, concluded that the defects identified in Freedman had been remedied by the present statute. 352 F.Supp. 530; 375 F. Supp. 1093. 
 The court below made much of the fact that the amended statute provides for a prompt judicial determination of obscenity after denial of a license by the Board, and that the Board must bear the burden of proof at all stages of the proceedings. I have previously set forth, at some length, my view that no form of censorship, no matter how speedy or efficient it may be, is constitutionally permissible. The cost and delay involved in contesting an adverse determination by the censor provide a very practical deterrent to free and open expression; the inevitable result is a reluctance even to attempt to disseminate ideas which, by virtue of their content, may attract the censor's attention or draw his wrath. Moreover, by imposing his sanctions in advance, the censor circumvents all the protections of the Bill of Rights which are called into play by a criminal prosecution after the 
Page 419 U.S. 956 , 957
 fact. The Maryland system has no place for the right of trial by jury, nor does it require proof beyond a reasonable doubt; step by step, by eroding these constitutional guarantees, the state facilitates its self-appointed task of imposing and ensuring conformity to an official standard of morality. 
 I adhere to the positions I have taken in Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 61 (concurring opinion); Times Film Corp. v. Chicago, 365 U.S. 43, 78 (dissenting opinion); Kingsley International Pictures Corp. v. Regents, 360 U.S. 684, 697 (concurring opinion); and Superior Films v.

 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the Maryland motion picture censorship statute, Art. 66A, 1-26, Annotated Code of Maryland, which requires that films be licensed before exhibition and forbids the licensing of obscene films.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 29, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN join, dissenting. 
 On In eight of the 12 counts petitioners were charged with income tax fraud, in violation of 7206(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. 7206(1).1 The indictment alleged that the 
Page 419 U.S. 970, 971
 acts that were the subject of four of the fraud counts (counts II-V, inclusive) were committed on July 18 and 21, 1966, respectively. 
 Section 6531 of the Code, 26 U.S.C. 6531,2 provides a 6-year period of limitations for offenses under 7206(1). The indictment, obviously, was returned after the expiration of the 6-year period and, without more, would be subject to dismissal as out-of-time. See Benes v. United States, 276 F.2d 99, 107-109 (CA6 1960). 
 Section 6531, however, has as its penultimate sentence the following: 
 With respect to the alleged offenses of July 18 and 21, 1966, a complaint was filed by the Government with a commissioner of the United States on July 17, 1972, just within the 6-year period. The record contains an [419 U.S. 970, 972]

 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN join, dissenting. 
 On In eight of the 12 counts petitioners were charged with income tax fraud, in violation of 7206(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. 7206(1).1 The indictment alleged that the

 acts that were the subject of four of the fraud counts (counts II-V, inclusive) were committed on July 18 and 21, 1966, respectively. 
 Section 6531 of the Code, 26 U.S.C. 6531,2 provides a 6-year period of limitations for offenses under 7206(1). The indictment, obviously, was returned after the expiration of the 6-year period and, without more, would be subject to dismissal as out-of-time. See Benes v. United States, 276 F.2d 99, 107-109 (CA6 1960). 
 Section 6531, however, has as its penultimate sentence the following:

 October 29, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL concurs, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was questioned by Texas police officers in connection with the burglary of a store. After receiving Miranda warnings, petitioner admitted participation in the robbery and disclosed that certain stolen articles could be found in his apartment. The police decided to search the apartment for the stolen goods. Instead of obtaining a warrant, however, the police officers presented petitioner with a 'consent form,' which he signed. By signing the form he authorized the police 'to take from may premises and property any letters, papers, material, or any other property or things which they desire as evidence for criminal prosecution in the case or cases now under investigation.' 
 The police then went to petitioner's apartment in search of four boxes of gum and a small radio, goods known to have been taken in the store burglary. In the course of searching for these items, one of the searching officers found a check lying on a bureau. The check was partly obscured by an article of clothing, but the officer testified that a protruding stub allowed him to determine that the payee was a person other than petitioner. The officers 
Page 419 U.S. 979 , 980
 seized the check, and subsequent investigation revealed that it had been stolen. The officer's discovery formed the basis for petitioner's prosecution in the District Court for mail theft, 18 U.S.C. 1708. Prior to trial, petitioner unsuccessfully moved to suppress the stolen check as evidence, asserting that the seizure of it violated the Fourth Amendment. Petitioner's conviction followed and the denial of the motion to suppress was held proper on the ground that petitioner had consented to the search of his apartment. 
 Since there is no contention that the police could otherwise have searched petitioner's apartment without first obtaining a warrant, the lawfulness of their search turns on whether petitioner's signing of the consent form relieved the police of this obligation. If this consent form has any validity, seizure of the stolen check from petitioner's residence is outside its scope. The form signified consent to seizure of property 'as evidence . . . in the case or cases now under investigation' (emphasis added). At the time petitioner signed the form he had been questioned and charged with the burglary of a particular store. Thus his reasonable expectations, which must govern construction of the document, were that he was authorizing the police to search his residence for evidence in connection with the only crime for which he was then a suspect.

 Linda SPADY and Vincent Spadyv. MOUNT VERNON HOUSING AUTHORITY.No. 73-6874. 
 Supreme Court of the United States October 29, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of New York. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioners Linda and Vincent Spady applied for public housing in Mount Vernon, New York, in early 1971. Their application was accepted, and in early July they were told that they were eligible for low-income public housing accommodations. On July 9, 1971, petitioners signed a lease, paid one month's rent plus a security deposit, and were assigned to a specific apartment which would be available to them on July 15, 1971. On or before that date, however, the respondent Housing Authority learned from other tenants that Vincent Spady had previously used the name of Vincent Bentley, 1 and that he had compiled a criminal record under that name. Investigation disclosed that Vincent had been arrested once on burglary charges, which were dismissed when the complaining witnesses failed to appear before the grand jury, and had been arrested again on robbery charges, which were dismissed when he was certified for treatment as a narcotics addict. Since those arrests, he had undergone treatment for his narcotics addiction, had been released as rehabilitated, and was enrolled in a methadone maintenance program. 
 Upon learning these details, the Housing Authority revoked petitioners' eligibility and removed them from its housing list, on the grounds that their application had been 'untruthful' and had failed to reveal Vincent's prior arrests and certification as a narcotics addict. [Footnote 2] Pe- 
Page 419 U.S. 983 , 984
 titioners requested an evidentiary hearing to contest the revocation, but the Housing Authority declined to grant a hearing. Petitioners then brought suit in the New York Supreme Court, which ordered the Authority to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether petitioners met applicable desirability standards for public housing eligibility. A divided Appellate Division reversed, holding that petitioners were not entitled to a hearing because they were not tenants in possession, and that the Authority's revocation of petitioners' eligibility had a rational basis. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed on the memorandum of the Appellate Division. 
 Petitioners contend that they were entitled to an evidentiary hearing before they could be deprived of their eligibility for public housing; they further contend that the reasons advanced by the Authority in support of that revocation are so arbitrary and so lacking in any rational basis as to constitute a denial of due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws.

|419 u.s. 1|"United States v. Michigan National Corp.
No. 73-1737
Decided October 21, 1974
419 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Appellee bank holding company's planned acquisition of additional banks was governed by both the Bank Holding Company Act requiring the Federal Reserve Board's approval of the acquisition and the Bank Merger Act requiring the Comptroller of the Currency's approval.  Both statutes provide that an antitrust suit challenging a transaction approved by the designated agency must be brought within 30 days of such approval.  Within 30 days after the Board had approved the planned acquisition, but before the Comptroller had acted, the Government brought a Clayton Act suit to enjoin the acquisition, which the District Court dismissed without prejudice, ruling that the Government should bring a new suit if and when the Comptroller approved the acquisition.
Held:  The District Court erred in taking such action, but should stay the suit until the Comptroller acts.  Such procedure will conserve judicial resources and fully protect both parties, and avoid possible prejudice to the Government, which by being required to wait for the Comptroller's approval before filing suit would risk having complete relief barred by the time limitation of the Bank Holding Company Act.
Vacated and remanded.

 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, the manager of a movie theater, was convicted in the Corporation Court of the city of Danville, Virginia, of exhibiting an allegedly obscene motion picture entitled 'Anomalies.' The statute under which he was convicted 18.1-230, Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, provides in pertinent part: 
Page 419 U.S. 902 , 903
 As used in that section,
 The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. This Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Virginia Supreme Court for further consideration in light of Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93-S.Ct. 2607 (1973), and companion cases. On remand, the Virginia Supreme Court again affirmed the conviction. 
 It is my view that 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obsence' contents'. Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 18.1-230, as it incorporates the definition of 'obscene' in 18.1-227, is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), and because the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court was rendered after Miller, I would reverse.* 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that any state or federal ban on, or regulation of, obscenity is prohibited by the Constitution, Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 43-48; Paris Adult Theatre v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 70-73, would grant certiorari in this case and summarily reverse.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York of transporting allegedly obscene materials in interstate commerce for the purpose of sale in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1465, which provides in pertinent part as follows: 
Page 419 U.S. 904 , 905
 silhouette, drawing, figure, image, cast, phonograph recording, electrical transcription or other article capable of producing sound or any other matter of indecent or immoral character, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.'
 The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, 491 F.2d 906 ( 1974). 
 I adhere to my dissent in United States v. Orito, 413 U.S. 139, 147, in which, speaking of 18 U.S.C. 1462, which is similar in scope to 1465, I expressed the view that '[w]hatever the extent of the Federal Government's power to bar the distribution of allegedly obscene material to juveniles or the offensive exposure of such material to unconsenting adults, the statute before us is clearly overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.' Id., at 147-148. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was rendered after Orito, reverse.* In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 483, 494 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that any state or dederal ban on, or regulation of, obscenity is prohibited by the Constitution, Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 43-48; Paris Adult Theatre v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 70-73, would grant certiorari in this case and summarily reverse. 
 Finally, it does not appear from the petition and response that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974), I believe that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, petitioner must be given an opportunity to have his case decided on, and introduce evidence relevant to, the legal standard upon which his con- [419 U.S. 904 , 906]

California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was rendered after Orito, reverse.* In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 483, 494 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that any state or dederal ban on, or regulation of, obscenity is prohibited by the Constitution, Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 43-48; Paris Adult Theatre v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 70-73, would grant certiorari in this case and summarily reverse. 
 Finally, it does not appear from the petition and response that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Virginia. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted in the Corporation Court of the city of Norfolk, Virginia, of selling and distributing an allegedly obscene movie and an allegedly obscene magazine. The statute under which he was convicted, 18.1-228, Code of Virginia of 1950 as amended, provides in pertinent part that:

It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 18.1-228, as it incorporates the definition of 'obscene' in 18.1-227, is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 21, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, a Lieutenant in the Air Force, was convicted by court- martial under Art. 92 (Failure to obey order or regulation) and 134 ( General article) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
Page 419 U.S. 907 , 908
 His Offense was 'failure to do monitor duty.' Petitioner's punishment was a fine of $1500, to be paid in six monthly installments to be deducted from his paycheck. [Footnote 1] After exhausting his appeals, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus from the District Court, 28 U.S.C. 2241, on the ground that Art. 92 is unconstitutionally vague. The writ was denied below on the sole ground that petitioner was not in 'custody' as required by 2241. 
 In my view, the District Court should have treated petitioner's complaint as either one seeking a declaration that his punishment was not lawfully imposed, 28 U.S.C. 2201, or one to compel expungement of his conviction, 28 U.S.C. 1361, and reached the merits. Several courts of appeals have entertained actions to remove penalties imposed by military tribunals where the aggrieved plaintiffs were not confined, but presented constitutional challenges to the imposition of punishment. See Kauffman v. Secretary of the Air Force, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 415 F.2d 991 (1969) (suit protesting discharge and forfeiture of all pay and allowances); Ashe v. McNamara, 355 F.2d 277 (CA1 1965) (suit to compel correction of dishonorable discharge); Smith v. McNamara, 395 F.2d 896 (CA10 1968) ( dishonorable discharge); Mindes v.

 October 21, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN concurs, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice by threatening, intimidating, or otherwise endeavoring to influence a grand jury witness. The witness, one Perry Scheer, had been a principal in a collapsed brokerage house whose activities were under investigation by the SEC and the FBI; there was strong evidence that Scheer had been involved in at least seven illegal securities transactions. Petitioner, who was allegedly in league with various persons who could have been harmed by Scheer's testimony before a grand jury investigating the affairs of the brokerage house, met with Scheer on several occasions and sought to secure Scheer's silence through veiled threats and suggestions that Scheer 'take the Fifth' (or, in more contemporary parlance, 'stonewall it'). Unbeknownst to petitioner, Scheer by this time was cooperating fully with federal authorities, and had been fitted out with a recording device on which he recorded several of his conversations with petitioner; these recordings were introduced at trial to corroborate and supplement Scheer's own testimony, and were played several times for the jury. I am unable to agree that the use of recordings made under 
Page 419 U.S. 917 , 918
 such circumstances is consistent with constitutional guarantees. 
 In a series of decisions beginning with On Lee v. United States, 343 U.S. 747, this Court has held that electronic interception or recording of conversations with the consent of one party does not violate Fourth Amendment standards. [Footnote 1] With one notable exception, however, these decisions were handed down prior to Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, in which we formally interred much of their conceptual underpinning by holding that Fourth Amendment protections rest upon reasonable expectations of privacy rather than upon common-law property principles. That exception came in United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745, where four Members of the Court held that On Lee remained good law after Katz, four other Members maintained with equal adamance that it did not, and Mr. Justice Black (adhering to his dissent in Katz) found it unnecessary to reach the issue. 
 At a bare minimum, Katz must be read to require that monitoring of this sort be conducted only pursuant to a warrant: ""Over and again this Court has emphasized that the mandate of the [Fourth] Amendment requires adherence to judicial processes,' United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 51, and that searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment-subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.' 389 U.S., at 357 (footnotes omitted). In the absence of such judicial supervision, there is no effective safeguard against the possibility of an uncontrolled electronic police state. [Footnote 2] [419 U.S. 917 , 919]

 October 21, 1974
 On Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner seeks review of the Service's order deporting him to Canada, his nation of citizenship. The Ninth Circuit noted that the Service's 'discretion . . . might have been exercised with greater compassion,' but none- 
Page 419 U.S. 919 , 920
 theless upheld the order on the theory that 'the scope of . . . review in this area is extremely narrow.' 
 The facts are peculiar; or, more accurately, the Service's action is peculiar in light of the facts. Moving to this country with his parents in 1953 (at age 9), petitioner acquired permanent resident alien status. As such, he was subject to the draft, 50 U.S.C. App. 454(a), and he duly registered on his 18th birthday. In August of 1966, he was ordered to report for induction on September 28, 1966. Possessing strong views against war and conscription, petitioner decided to go to Canada, rather than serve. At the border, he turned in his Alien Immigration Card but expressly refused to sign a formal renunciation of his permanent resident status. Very quickly, he thought better of his decision to leave. On September 28, his induction date, petitioner telephoned his draft board to announce that he was returning to the United States to surrender to a U. S. Attorney and to accept the legal penalty for refusing induction. On October 3, 1966, petitioner flew to Chicago and turned himself in to the U. S. Attorney. The Government took no action for 21 months, during which time petitioner studied at an American university. 
 Finally, in July of 1968, petitioner was indicted under 50 U.S.C.App . 462 for 'evad[ing] or refus[ing] . . . service in the armed forces.' He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and 18 months' probation, the latter conditioned on his doing civilian work of national importance. Petitioner served this sentence in full. 
 Two years later, the Service moved to deport him, on grounds that he had fled the country to evade the draft, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(22), and abandoned his immigrant status in the process, [419 U.S. 919 , 921]

 Petitioner seeks review of the Service's order deporting him to Canada, his nation of citizenship. The Ninth Circuit noted that the Service's 'discretion . . . might have been exercised with greater compassion,' but none- 
Page 419 U.S. 919 , 920
 theless upheld the order on the theory that 'the scope of . . . review in this area is extremely narrow.' 
 The facts are peculiar; or, more accurately, the Service's action is peculiar in light of the facts. Moving to this country with his parents in 1953 (at age 9), petitioner acquired permanent resident alien status. As such, he was subject to the draft, 50 U.S.C. App. 454(a), and he duly registered on his 18th birthday. In August of 1966, he was ordered to report for induction on September 28, 1966. Possessing strong views against war and conscription, petitioner decided to go to Canada, rather than serve. At the border, he turned in his Alien Immigration Card but expressly refused to sign a formal renunciation of his permanent resident status. Very quickly, he thought better of his decision to leave. On September 28, his induction date, petitioner telephoned his draft board to announce that he was returning to the United States to surrender to a U. S. Attorney and to accept the legal penalty for refusing induction. On October 3, 1966, petitioner flew to Chicago and turned himself in to the U. S. Attorney. The Government took no action for 21 months, during which time petitioner studied at an American university. 
 Finally, in July of 1968, petitioner was indicted under 50 U.S.C.App . 462 for 'evad[ing] or refus[ing] . . . service in the armed forces.' He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and 18 months' probation, the latter conditioned on his doing civilian work of national importance. Petitioner served this sentence in full. 
 Two years later, the Service moved to deport him, on grounds that he had fled the country to evade the draft, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(22), and abandoned his immigrant status in the process, [419 U.S. 919 , 921]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the Ohio for Clark County. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 Approximately one month after pleading guilty, petitioner sought to vacate her plea on the ground that she had not been adequately advised of the rights thereby waived. The record shows that before accepting petitioner's plea the trial judge advised her of her right to be tried by a jury and to confront witnesses against her. Petitioner's motion was denied by the trial court and the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed.

 In Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 243 (1968), we emphasized that a guilty plea is a waiver of important constitutional rights designed to protect the fairness of a trial: 
 Waiver of such rights as these can be accomplished only by 'an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege,' Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938). Only recently we reaffirmed the stringent standard for demonstrating the waiver of rights designed to safeguard the accused at trial, Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 236-237 (1973). 
 The accused can waive only a known right, Johnson v. Zerbst, supra, and the State has the burden of demonstrating a knowing waiver. To repeat what we said in Boykin, '[w]e cannot presume waiver . . . from a silent record.' Boykin established that the State must demonstrate the defendant's knowing waiver of the three constitutional rights there enumerated. Two States have so interpreted Boykin as a constitutional minimum. People v. Jaworski, 387 Mich. 21, 194 N.W.2d 868 (1972); In re Tahl, 1 Cal.3d 122, 81 Cal.Rptr. 557, 460 P.2d 449 (1969).

 Walt SHULTZ, dba Walt Shultz Equipment Company, et al.v. Elton M. MOORE.No. 73-1804. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 21, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 This is an action for an injunction and damages for the infringement of a patent held by respondent Moore. Petitioner Shultz defended on the ground that the patent was invalid. The patented product is a 'pants topper,' used in the dry cleaning business for finishing and pressing men's trousers. Moore obtained his patent in 1955. At the trial there was evidence that patents on devices having functions similar to Moore's had issued prior to his patent; not all of these prior patents had been brought to the attention of the examiner who recommended that Moore be granted a patent. A jury verdict in Moore's favor was set aside by the trial court on the ground that the subject matter was 'obvious . . . to a person having ordinary skill in the art,' 35 U.S.C. 103. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the patent carries a presumption of validity overcome only by clear and convincing evidence, and that obviousness is a factual question on which the trial judge should not override the jury. With all respect, that holding permits the standard of patentability to be diluted and haphazardly applied. 
 It bears repeating that patents derive from the specific constitutional authorization of Congress 'To promote 
Page 419 U.S. 930 , 931
 the Progress of . . . useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to . . . Inventors the exclusive Right to their . . . Discoveries.' Art. I, 8, cl. 8. Writing against the backdrop of abuses by the Crown in granting monopolies, the Framers did not intend these 'exclusive rights' to be granted freely. To justify the toll exacted by exclusivity, the invention had to make a distinctive contribution to the advancement of scientific knowledge. Besides novelty and utility, a distinctive contribution expanding the frontiers of scientific and industrial knowledge was demanded. This constitutional restraint on the dispensation of patents was once captured in our cases under the standard of 'invention.' See Reckendorfer v. Faber, 92 U.S. 347; Smith v. Whitman Saddle Co., 148 U.S. 674; Potts v. Creager, 155 U.S. 597; Concrete Appliances Co. v. Gomery, 269 U.S. 177; Mantle Lamp Co. v. Aluminum Products Co ., 301 U.S. 544. The standard is now embodied in 35 U.S.C. 103, which requires a 'nonobvious subject matter.' Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17 (1966). 
 Though the label has changed, the standard of patentability is at root a constitutional standard. In determining patent validity under the statute, a court simultaneously holds the statute true to its constitutional source. This is but a specific application of the principle that statutes are construed to avoid any overreaching of constitutional limitations. E. g., Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 98; United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 47; Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 348; United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 188 (concurring opinion). 
 In every patent infringement suit a court is called upon to oversee obedience to the constitutional standard. It cannot be delegated to the jury on the supposition that only a question of fact is involved. Factual assessments are, of course, part of the process of judging validity. [419 U.S. 930 , 932]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York of transporting allegedly obscene materials in interstate commerce for the purpose of sale in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1465, which provides in pertinent part as follows: 
 The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, United States v. Cangiano, 491 F.2d 906 (1974). 
 I adhere to my dissent in United States v. Orito, 413 U.S. 139, 147, in which speaking of 18 U.S.C. 1462, which is similar in scope to 1465, I expressed the view that '[w]hatever the extent of the Federal Government's power to bar the distribution of allegedly obscene 
Page 419 U.S. 933 , 934
 material to juveniles or the offensive exposure of such material to unconsenting adults, the statute before us is clearly overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.' Id., at 147-148. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was rendered after Orito, reverse.* In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 483, 494 ( 1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that any state or federal ban on, or regulation of obscenity is prohibited by the Constitution, Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 43-48; Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 70-73, would grant certiorari in this case and summarily reverse. 
 Finally, it does not appear from the petition and response that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974), I believe that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, petitioner must be given an opportunity to have his case decided on, and introduce evidence relevant to, the legal standard upon which his conviction has ultimately come to depend. Thus, even on its own terms, the Court should vacate the judgment below and remand for a determination whether petitioner should be afforded a new trial under local community standards. 
[Footnote *] Although four of us would grant and reverse, the Justices who join this opinion do not insist that the case be decided on the merits.

[Footnote 1] Upon learning that the petitioner had failed to appear for the second scheduled examination, the local board, acting pursuant to a new selective service regulation then less than two months old, ordered the petitioner to report for immediate induction.

 In September 1970, two weeks before his scheduled induction, petitioner returned to the board the induction order that had been mailed to him in July, stating in an accompanying letter his belief that the induction forms were 'mailed in error' since he had not yet completed a physical examination and been found acceptable for military service. Although the board made no response to petitioner's letter, it did report him to the Department of Justice as a violator when it learned of his failure to report for induction.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 21, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 The petitioner, convicted of failure to report for induction, 50 App. U.S.C. 462(a), challenges the induction order on the ground that he was improperly denied exemption from selective service as a conscientious objector. Petitioner completed high school under a student deferment in 1969. In January 1970, he was reclassified I-A and was ordered to report for a pre-induction physical examination the following October. In January 1971, petitioner filed an application for reclassification as a conscientious objector. His local selective service board rejected this claim advising petitioner by letter: 
 Petitioner appealed to an Appeal Board, which affirmed without opinion the local board's denial of exemption. The Court of Appeals, applying a rule announced in United States v. Stetter, 445 F.2d 472 (CA5 1971), that when an applicant makes a prima facie case for exemption as a conscientious objector the board must give a statement of reasons for rejection of the application, construed the local board's letter to petitioner as a finding of insincerity of petitioner's asserted beliefs. The court then concluded that a finding of insincerity could be based upon the fact that petitioner waited for more than a year after his reclassification as I-A to file his application for exemption and did so only after passing

 Mark Randall WINDSOR v. UNITED STATES.No. 73-6655. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 21, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 The petitioner, convicted of failure to report for induction, 50 App. U.S.C. 462(a), challenges the induction order on the ground that he was improperly denied exemption from selective service as a conscientious objector. Petitioner completed high school under a student deferment in 1969. In January 1970, he was reclassified I-A and was ordered to report for a pre-induction physical examination the following October. In January 1971, petitioner filed an application for reclassification as a conscientious objector. His local selective service board rejected this claim advising petitioner by letter: 
 Petitioner appealed to an Appeal Board, which affirmed without opinion the local board's denial of exemption. The Court of Appeals, applying a rule announced in United States v. Stetter, 445 F.2d 472 (CA5 1971), that when an applicant makes a prima facie case for exemption as a conscientious objector the board must give a statement of reasons for rejection of the application, construed the local board's letter to petitioner as a finding of insincerity of petitioner's asserted beliefs. The court then concluded that a finding of insincerity could be based upon the fact that petitioner waited for more than a year after his reclassification as I-A to file his application for exemption and did so only after passing 
Page 419 U.S. 938 , 939
 his pre-induction physical examination. Accordingly, the court found that the board's 'reason' had a basis in the record and affirmed petitioner's conviction. 
 Elsewhere I have expressed my view that an applicant for exemption as a conscientious objector is entitled, under Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, to a hearing before a local board on his claim.

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Acting upon information received from the Los Angeles Police Department that a man of a specified description would arrive on a certain airplane carrying heroin inside a garment bag, a San Francisco sheriff's deputy observed petitioner arriving on the designated flight, matching the description given and carrying a garment bag. The 
Page 419 U.S. 942 , 943
 deputy stopped petitioner, searched the bag, and discovered heroin that was used to secure petitioner's conviction for importing heroin into the United States. Petitioner appealed the conviction on the ground that the heroin should have been suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful search. The court below held that the report received from the Los Angeles police, as 'corroborated' by petitioner's appearance on the flight designated and matching the description, furnished probable cause for the forcible inspection of petitioner's garment bag. 
 Because the court below failed to inquire into the origin of the information furnished by the Los Angeles police, it cannot be said that probable cause for the search has been established. Had the information been based upon the observations of a Los Angeles Police officer, a proper assessment of probable cause would have necessitated examination of the observations on which he relied, to see whether they would have justified belief by a 'man of reasonable caution' that petitioner was carrying contraband, Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 162 (1925). Had the police report been based upon a tip received by the Los Angeles police from an informer, somewhat greater scrutiny would have been necessary to apply the requirements of Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964) and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969). These cases held that to furnish probable cause a tip must disclose the informer's observations upon which any conclusion is based and must be accompanied by information supporting the informer's credibility.* Neither kind [419 U.S. 942 , 944]

 Frank Steven DORMANv. UNITED STATES.No. 73-6719. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 21, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 In 1973 Frank Dorman was sentenced by the District Court to a term of three years for violating the travel restrictions of his bond and to two concurrent seven-year terms for the interstate transportation of forged checks. In imposing sentence, the trial judge emphasized the 'very, very substantial' record of Dorman's prior convictions. The trial judge learned of these state convictions from a presentence report, which had incorporated the convictions listed in an FBI summary. None of these documents revealed, and it has not been ascertained, whether Dorman had the assistance of counsel at the time these convictions were obtained. On appeal, Dorman sought to have his case remanded for a determination whether he lacked counsel at the time of the prior convictions, and if so far imposition of a new sentence. The Court of Appeals held that Dorman had waived any objection to the trial court's use of the prior convictions by his failure to object after disclosure of the presentence report. 
 Since the landmark of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1964), we have held that convictions obtained without the provision of counsel for the accused may not be used to enhance punishment under a recidivist statute, Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109 (1967), nor to influence the determination of a discretionary sentence, United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443 (1972), nor to impeach 
Page 419 U.S. 945 , 946
 the credibility of a defendant at trial, Loper v. Beto, 405 U.S. 473, 92 S. Ct. 1014 (1973). The guiding principle was stated in Burgett v. Texas: 
 The Court of Appeals permits the defendant's sentence to stand, with ample demonstration that the sentencing judge relied heavily on prior convictions, and no demonstration in the record that he had counsel during the prosecutions involved. The decision below remits the defendant to collateral challenge to his sentence. Under Fourth Circuit practice, the defendant must apparently now challenge each state conviction through independent proceedings and, if successful, move to vacate the federal sentence now in issue under 28 U.S.C. 2255. See Brown v. United States, 483 F.2d 116 (CA4 1973). This result is consonant neither with sound judicial administration nor with fairness to the accused. The determination whether a defendant had counsel at the time of prior convictions should ordinarily be ascertainable from an examination of the records of conviction. I would place the burden of that examination, which surely would add only a small increment to the task of preparation for trial or sentencing, upon the Government. This procedure would centralize in one proceeding all inquiry relevant to the use of prior convictions and would give positive assurance in the record that Gideon was not undercut through impermissible collateral uses of uncounselled convictions.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was walking up a freeway on-ramp when he was stopped by an officer. Petitioner gave the officer his name but was unable to produce any identification. The officer noticed an envelope in petitioner's shirt pocket and saw through a window in the envelope that it was addressed to someone other than petitioner. He thought that the envelope contained a Treasury check, and he pulled it out of petitioner's pocket. The officer removed the check from the envelope and saw that it had been endorsed. Petition was arrested, and after further investigation was tried and convicted of forgery. 
 The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction on the ground that the officer had probable cause to seize the check from petitioner's person and that the absence of a warrant is excused by the plain view doctrine. 496 F. 2d, at 151-152. Judge Hufstedler wrote a dissent in which she pointed out that the incriminating aspects of the item in petitioner's pocket simply were not in plain view. The check itself and in particular the endorsement were not visible until the envelope had been removed from petitioner's pocket and opened. 'Nothing in the record of this case supports a conclusion that [the officer] at the time of the seizure had probable cause to believe that the envelope seen in Sedillo's pocket was 
Page 419 U.S. 947 , 948
 contraband, or that it contained contraband, or that it was evidence relevant to a crime that [the officer] had probable cause to believe had been committed. Accordingly, the plain view doctrine cannot justify the seizure of the envelope and check.' Id., at 153 (footnote omitted). 
 In Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 466, 29 L. Ed.2d 564, the Court pointed out that the plain view doctrine is applicable only 'where it is immediately apparent to the police that they have evidence before them; the 'plain view' doctrine may not be used to extend a general exploratory search from one object to another until something incriminating at last emerges.' To use the plain view rationale in this case is to ignore the limitations on that exception to the warrant requirement which are explained by Coolidge. 
 It appears to me that the conviction here results from police conduct which violated the Fourth Amendment. The plain view doctrine is not applicable, and I do not see how any other exceptions to the warrant requirement would justify the conduct of the police.* I would therefore grant certiorari and set this case for argument. 
[Footnote *] Obviously the search and seizure were not incident to arrest, since the arrest did not occur until after the envelope had been removed from petitioner's pocket and opened. I dissented in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, but even the majority position in that case would not justify the officer's conduct here. Terry permitted a 'reasonable search for weapons for the protection of the police officer, where he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime.' Id., at 27. But that doctrine clearly has no applicability here. As Judge Hufstedler put it, 'No one contends in this case that [the officer's] seizure of the envelope from Sedillo's pocket or the examination of the envelope's contents was necessary to protect the officer's person.' 496 F.2d, at 153.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 21, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Nebraska. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted of violating a city gambling ordinance, carrying a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment and a $500 fine. Following a trial before a municipal judge, petitioner was convicted and sentenced to 100 days in jail and fined $500. Under Nebraska law, trial by jury is unavailable in a prosecution in municipal court for violation of a city ordinance. The Nebraska courts rejected petitioner's assertion of a right to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment, on the ground that no such right applies to prosecutions for offenses carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for six months or less. 
 The Constitution provides for trial by jury in two places. Article III, 2, provides that 'The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury. . . .' And the Sixth Amendment provides in pertinent part: 
 Despite these specific references to a jury in the trial of 'all crimes' and in 'all criminal prosecutions' the Court has held that the accused enjoys no right to demand trial by jury in prosecutions for 'petty offenses.' The notion of a class of 'petty offenses' for which prosecution would carry no right to jury trial first surfaced in this Court in the dicta of Callan v. Wilson, 127 U.S. 540, 555 (1888), which held that a conspiracy offense did not belong in the 'petty' class. 'Petty of- 
Page 419 U.S. 949 , 950
 fenses' were to be defined as those punishable by summary proceedings at common law prior to the adoption of the Constitution. The exclusion of petty offense prosecutions from the jury trial guarantee was repeated in several later cases. Natal v. Louisiana, 139 U.S. 621, 35 L. Ed.2d 288 (1891), involved a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to a Louisiana ordinance regulating the location of private marketplaces. Prosecution for violation was before a magistrate only and was punishable by a $25 fine or imprisonment for 30 days. In holding that the absence of jury trial did not vitiate conviction under the ordinance, the Court repeated the Callan dicta, but the decision came more than 70 years before we held the federal right to jury trial applicable in state proceedings, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 194 (1968). In Schick v. United States, 195 U.S. 65 (1904), the petty offense exclusion was again repeated, but the holding of that case was that the defendant's waiver of jury trial in the District Court did not invalidate his conviction. 
 Not until District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617 (1937), did the Court squarely rule that certain prosecutions are outside the constitutional guarantee. That case involved a prosecution in the District of Columbia for violation of a statute making it a crime, punishable by a fine of $300 or less, or imprisonment of 90 days or less, to sell second-hand goods without a license. In holding that trial by jury was not required, the Court expanded the definition of 'petty offenses' to embrace all those for which the authorized punishment failed to meet a requisite standard of severity. The degree of severity required to invoke the constitutional right was to be ascertained 'by objective standards such as may be observed in the laws and practices of the community taken as a guage of its social and ethical judgments.' Id., at 628. In the years since Clawans, the Court has struggled to achieve greater precision in drawing the line [419 U.S. 949 , 951]

In holding that the absence of jury trial did not vitiate conviction under the ordinance, the Court repeated the Callan dicta, but the decision came more than 70 years before we held the federal right to jury trial applicable in state proceedings, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 194 (1968). In Schick v. United States, 195 U.S. 65 (1904), the petty offense exclusion was again repeated, but the holding of that case was that the defendant's waiver of jury trial in the District Court did not invalidate his conviction. 
 Not until District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617 (1937), did the Court squarely rule that certain prosecutions are outside the constitutional guarantee. That case involved a prosecution in the District of Columbia for violation of a statute making it a crime, punishable by a fine of $300 or less, or imprisonment of 90 days or less, to sell second-hand goods without a license. In holding that trial by jury was not required, the Court expanded the definition of 'petty offenses' to embrace all those for which the authorized punishment failed to meet a requisite standard of severity. The degree of severity required to invoke the constitutional right was to be ascertained 'by objective standards such as may be observed in the laws and practices of the community taken as a guage of its social and ethical judgments.' Id., at 628. In the years since Clawans, the Court has struggled to achieve greater precision in drawing the line [419 U.S. 949 , 951]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 21, 1974
 Rehearing Denied Dec. 9, 1974. 
 See 419 U.S. 1061. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, joined by Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice STEWART, dissenting. 
 The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, adhering to its previous decisions in Stuckey v. Weinberger, 488 F.2d 904 (CA9 1973), en banc, and Wallace v. Weinberger, 488 F.2d 606 (CA9 1973), en banc, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 913, 41 L.ed.2d 217 (1974), held in this case that the decision of the Secretary of HEW on a request to reopen a previous denial on the merits of a claim for benefits is so far committed to agency discretion by the provisions of 205(h) of the Social Security Act, Title 42 U.S.C. 405(h), that review of that decision is not available pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. See Title 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(2). This holding is squarely in conflict with the holdings of three other Circuits in Cappadora v. Celebrezze, 356 F.2d 1 (CA2 1966); Davis v. Richardson, 460 F.2d 772 (CA3 1972); and Maddox v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 617 (CA6 1972). It is a prime function of this Court's certiorari jurisdiction to resolve precisely the kind of conflict here presented. Rule 19(1)(b), Rules of the Supreme Court. Perhaps the state of our docket will not permit us to resolve all disagreements between courts of appeals, or between federal and state courts, and perhaps we must tolerate the 
Page 419 U.S. 953 , 954
 fact that in some instances enforcement of federal law in one area of the country differs from its enforcement in another. Hopefully, these situations will be few and far between. I would grant certiorari in this case. 

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 While I have joined Mr. Justice WHITE's dissent, I should add that the number of cases we take to review on the merits is well below the tolerable limit and that this case presents one of the most pressing problems on the modern scene. For the extent to which the evergrowing federal bureaucracy uses 'discretion' to mask irresponsible action that evades review seems to me to be eroding basic rights of the citizen.

 Applications to Vacate Stay. 
 The respective applications for an order vacating or modifying the stay order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, presented to Mr. Justice BLACKMUN and by him referred to the Court, are each denied. Four Justices, however, state explicitly that these denials are without prejudice to the applicants' renewal of their applications to vacate if the litigation has not been finally decided by the Court of Appeals by January 31, 1975.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 I would vacate the stay issued by the Court of Appeals. 
 Judge Lord made detailed findings as to the health hazard of the respondent's discharges into the air and into the waters of Lake Superior, 1 findings which I attach as an Appendix to this opinion. The Court of Appeals disagreed with Judge Lord's conclusion

 but it stopped short of holding that his findings were 'clearly erroneous' within the meaning of Rule 52(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.

[Footnote 2] It therefore decided that being 'a court of law' it was 'governed by rules of proof' and that 'unknowns may not be substituted for proof of a demonstrable hazard to the public health.'3 
 That position, however, with all respect makes 'maximizing profits' the measure of the public good, not health of human beings or life itself. Property is, of course, protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment against federal intrusion. But so is life and liberty. Where the scales are so evenly divided, we cannot say that the findings on health were 'clearly erroneous' nor am I able to discover how 'maximizing profits' becomes a governing principle overriding the health hazards.

Syllabus 
Respondents brought this class action, alleging that the Detroit public school system is racially segregated as a result of the official policies and actions of petitioner state and city officials, and seeking implementation of a plan to eliminate the segregation and establish a unitary nonracial school system.  The District Court, after concluding that various acts by the petitioner Detroit Board of Education had created and perpetuated school segregation in Detroit, and that the acts of the Board, as a subordinate entity of the State, were attributable to the State, ordered the Board to submit Detroit-only desegregation plans.  The court also ordered the state officials to submit desegregation plans encompassing the three-county metropolitan area, despite the fact that the 85 outlying school districts in these three counties were not parties to the action and there was no claim that they had committed constitutional violations.  Subsequently, outlying school districts were allowed to intervene, but were not permitted to assert any claim or defense on issues previously adjudicated or to reopen any issue previously decided, but were allowed merely to advise the court as to the propriety of a metropolitan plan and to submit any objections, modifications, or alternatives to any such plan.  Thereafter, the District Court ruled that it was proper to consider metropolitan plans, that Detroit-only plans submitted by the Board and respondents were inadequate to accomplish desegregation, and that, therefore, it would seek a solution beyond the limits of the Detroit school District, and concluded that ""[s]chool district lines are simply matters of political convenience, and may not be used to deny constitutional rights.""  Without having evidence that the suburban school districts had committed acts of de jure segregation, the court appointed a panel to submit a plan for the 
Page 418 U. S. 718
 Detroit schools that would encompass an entire designated desegregation area consisting of 53 of the 85 suburban school districts plus Detroit, and ordered the Detroit Board to acquire at least 295 school buses to provide transportation under an interim plan to be developed for the 1972-1973 school year.  The Court of Appeals, affirming in part, held that the record supported the District Court's finding as to the constitutional violations committed by the Detroit Board and the state officials; that, therefore, the District Court was authorized and required to take effective measures to desegregate the Detroit school system; and that a metropolitan area plan embracing the 53 outlying districts was the only feasible solution and was within the District Court's equity powers.  But the court remanded so that all suburban school districts that might be affected by a metropolitan remedy could be made parties and have an opportunity to be heard as to the scope and implementation of such a remedy, and vacated the order as to the bus acquisitions, subject to its reimposition at an appropriate time.
Held:  The relief ordered by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals was based upon erroneous standards, and was unsupported by record evidence that acts of the outlying districts had any impact on the discrimination found to exist in the Detroit schools.  A federal court may not impose a multidistrict, area-wide remedy for single-district de jure school segregation violations where there is no finding that the other included school districts have failed to operate unitary school systems or have committed acts that effected segregation within the other districts, there is no claim or finding that the school district boundary lines were established with the purpose of fostering racial segregation, and there is no meaningful opportunity for the included neighboring school districts to present evidence  or be heard on the propriety of a multidistrict remedy or on the question of constitutional violations by those districts.  Pp.  418 U. S. 737-753.
(a) The District Court erred in using as a standard the declared objective of development of a metropolitan area plan which, upon implementation, would leave ""no school, grade or classroom . . . substantially disproportionate to the overall pupil racial composition"" of the metropolitan area as a whole.  The clear import of Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1, is that desegregation, in the sense of dismantling a dual school system, does not require any particular racial balance.  Pp.  418 U. S. 739-741. 
Page 418 U. S. 719

(b) While boundary lines may be bridged in circumstances where there has been a constitutional violation calling for inter-district relief, school district lines may not be casually ignored or treated as a mere administrative convenience; substantial local control of public education in this country is a deeply rooted tradition.  Pp.  418 U. S. 741-742.
(c) The inter-district remedy could extensively disrupt and alter the structure of public education in Michigan, since that remedy would require, in effect, consolidation of 54 independent school districts historically administered as separate governmental units into a vast new super school district, and, since -- entirely apart from the logistical problems attending large-scale transportation of students -- the consolidation would generate other problems in the administration, financing, and operation of this new school system.  Pp.  418 U. S. 742-743.
(d) From the scope of the inter-district plan itself, absent a complete restructuring of the Michigan school district laws, the District Court would become, first, a de facto ""legislative authority"" to resolve the complex operational problems involved, and thereafter a ""school superintendent"" for the entire area, a task which few, if any, judges are qualified to perform, and one which would deprive the people of local control of schools through elected school boards.  Pp.  418 U. S. 743-744.
(e) Before the boundaries of separate and autonomous school districts may be set aside by consolidating the separate units for remedial purposes or by imposing a cross-district remedy, it must be first shown that there has been a constitutional violation within one district that produces a significant segregative effect in another district; i.e., specifically, it must be shown that racially discriminatory acts of the state or local school districts, or of a single school district have been a substantial cause of inter-district segregation.  Pp.  418 U. S. 744-745.
(f) With no showing of significant violation by the 53 outlying school districts and no evidence of any inter-district violation or effect, the District Court transcended the original theory of the case as framed by the pleadings, and mandated a metropolitan area remedy the approval of which would impose on the outlying districts, not shown to have committed any constitutional violation, a standard not previously hinted at in any holding of this Court.  P.  418 U. S. 745.
(g) Assuming, arguendo, that the State was derivatively responsible for Detroit's segregated school conditions, it does not follow 
Page 418 U. S. 720
 that an inter-district remedy is constitutionally justified or required, since there has been virtually no showing that either the State or any of the 85 outlying districts engaged in any activity that had a cross-district effect.  Pp.  418 U. S. 748-749.
(h) An isolated instance of a possible segregative effect as between two of the school districts involved would not justify the broad metropolitan-wide remedy contemplated, particularly since that remedy embraced 52 districts having no responsibility for the arrangement and potentially involved 503,000 pupils in addition to Detroit's 276,000 pupils.  Pp.  418 U. S. 749-750.

(e) Before the boundaries of separate and autonomous school districts may be set aside by consolidating the separate units for remedial purposes or by imposing a cross-district remedy, it must be first shown that there has been a constitutional violation within one district that produces a significant segregative effect in another district; i.e., specifically, it must be shown that racially discriminatory acts of the state or local school districts, or of a single school district have been a substantial cause of inter-district segregation.  Pp.  418 U. S. 744-745.
(f) With no showing of significant violation by the 53 outlying school districts and no evidence of any inter-district violation or effect, the District Court transcended the original theory of the case as framed by the pleadings, and mandated a metropolitan area remedy the approval of which would impose on the outlying districts, not shown to have committed any constitutional violation, a standard not previously hinted at in any holding of this Court.  P.  418 U. S. 745.
(g) Assuming, arguendo, that the State was derivatively responsible for Detroit's segregated school conditions, it does not follow 
Page 418 U. S. 720
 that an inter-district remedy is constitutionally justified or required, since there has been virtually no showing that either the State or any of the 85 outlying districts engaged in any activity that had a cross-district effect.  Pp.  418 U. S. 748-749.
(h) An isolated instance of a possible segregative effect as between two of the school districts involved would not justify the broad metropolitan-wide remedy contemplated, particularly since that remedy embraced 52 districts having no responsibility for the arrangement and potentially involved 503,000 pupils in addition to Detroit's 276,000 pupils.  Pp.  418 U. S. 749-750.

 MISSOURI PORTLAND CEMENT CO. v. CARGILL, INC.  No. 73-2014. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 25, 1974
 Motion to Vacate Stay of Mandate of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent to vacate the stay heretofore entered by Mr. Justice DOUGLAS on July 12, 1974, is granted. 
 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN took no part in the consideration or decision of this motion. 

 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Cargill, desirous of acquiring control of petitioner, made a cash offer for all of petitioner's common stock. Petitioner thereupon filed this suit in the District Court to enjoin that tender offer, alleging that acquisition of control of petitioner would violate 7 of the Clayton Act. That Court issued the injunction stating in a detailed opinion its view that the acquisition of stock control by Cargill raises serious antitrust issues. 
 The sole question here is whether Cargill's attempts to take over Missouri Portland will be enjoined, pending the outcome of a trial on the merits of Missouri Portland's claim that a merger of these two companies would violate the antitrust laws. The District Court granted such an injunction, 375 F.Supp. 249, but the Court of Appeals reversed. 498 F.2d 851. Missouri Portland sought and received a stay of the Court of Appeals' mandate, thus reinstituting the injunction issued by the District Court. Today the Court vacates that stay. 
 The Court treats the case as if we were in the sensitive First Amendment field where relatively minor restraints may have a 'chilling' effect on an important constitu- 
Page 418 U.S. 919, 920
 tional right. But as I read the Constitution and Bill of Rights, a corporation has no constitutional right to merge, consolidate, or acquire the assets of another company. The old Court in the days of 'substantive due process' built an expansive corporate Bill of Rights by reading 'liberty' in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment as including the 'liberty' to exploit people, our resources, our environment. The Court trifles with the antitrust laws when it restores a stay that only requires Cargill to wait until there is a ruling on the merits before it swallows up Missouri Portland. What the Court does today is a shocking example of the disregard of law to please the management of huge conglomerates. Denial of a stay means a decision on the merits. For once the companies and their personnel are mixed, the momentum to complete the acquisition is almost irresistible. By careless neglect we actually decide that, what appears to be a monstrous violation of the law, may go on unremedied. 
 I  
 The Court of Appeals did not hold that the findings of the District Court were 'clearly erroneous.' The Court of Appeals considered the issue on the merits to be frivolous and only required Cargill to agree to hold the assets of Missouri Portland in a separate corporation or division so that it can be divested under any subsequent decree of the Court. But that misses the whole point, as I will make clear.

 Missouri Portland is the Nation's 20th largest producer of Portland cement with 2% of the national capacity and 8% in the 11-state region it serves. The District Court defined the relevant markets here as four [418 U.S. 919, 921]

 Moreover, on the basis of the Court's own holding in Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153 (1974), its denial of certiorari is improper.

 Petitioners were enjoined by the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, Maryland, from selling a group of allegedly obscene books, on the authority of Art. 27, 418 and 418A, of the Annotated Code of Maryland.

Page 418 U.S. 930 , 931
 provides in pertinent part as follows: 'Every person who knowingly sends or causes to be sent, . . . into this State, or . . . distributes . . . any obscene material is guilty of a misdemeanor.' As respondent concedes, the Maryland courts have defined the term 'obscenity' in this section by adopting the test set forth in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S. Ct. 1304. See Wagonheim v. Maryland State Board of Censors, 255 Md. 297, 304-305, 258 A.2d 240 (1969). The Court of Appeals affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973). That court again affirmed in an unreported opinion. 
 It is my view that 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.'

 It is my view that 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.' Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). 
 It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 418A, as it incorporates the term 'obscene' in 418, is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973 ). I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals was rendered after Miller, reverse.'* 
 In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary [418 U.S. 930 , 932]

No. 73-1766
Argued July 8, 1974
Decided July 24, 1974*
418 U.S. 683

Syllabus 
Following indictment alleging violation of federal statutes by certain staff members of the White House and political supporters of the President, the Special Prosecutor filed a motion under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 17(c) for a subpoena duces tecum for the production before trial of certain tapes and documents relating to precisely identified conversations and meetings between the President and others.  The President, claiming executive privilege, filed a motion to quash the subpoena.  The District Court, after treating the subpoenaed material as presumptively privileged, concluded that the Special Prosecutor had made a sufficient showing to rebut the presumption and that the requirements of Rule 17(c) had been satisfied.  The court thereafter issued an order for an in camera examination of the subpoenaed material, having rejected the President's contentions (a) that the dispute between him and the Special Prosecutor was nonjusticiable as an ""intra-executive"" conflict and (b) that the judiciary lacked authority to review the President's assertion of executive privilege.  The court stayed its order pending appellate review, which the President then sought in the Court of Appeals.  The Special Prosecutor then filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment (No. 73-1766), and the President filed a cross-petition for such a writ challenging the grand jury action (No. 73-1834).  The Court granted both petitions.
Held:
1. The District Court's order was appealable as a ""final"" order under 28 U.S.C.  1291, was therefore properly ""in"" the Court of Appeals, 28 U.S.C.  1254, when the petition for certiorari before judgment was filed in this Court, and is now properly before this Court for review.  Although such an order is normally not final and subject to appeal, an exception is made in a
""limited class of 
Page 418 U. S. 684
 cases where denial of immediate review would render impossible any review whatsoever of an individual's claims,""
United States v. Ryan, 402 U. S. 530,  402 U. S. 533.  Such an exception is proper in the unique circumstances of this case, where it would be inappropriate to subject the President to the procedure of securing review by resisting the order and inappropriate to require that the District Court proceed by a traditional contempt citation in order to provide appellate review.  Pp.  418 U. S. 690-692.
2. The dispute between the Special Prosecutor and the President presents a justiciable controversy.  Pp.  418 U. S. 692-697.
(a) The mere assertion of an ""intra-branch dispute,"" without more, does not defeat federal jurisdiction.  United States v. ICC, 337 U. S. 426.  P.  418 U. S. 693.
(b) The Attorney General, by regulation, has conferred upon the Special Prosecutor unique tenure and authority to represent the United States, and has given the Special Prosecutor explicit power to contest the invocation of executive privilege in seeking evidence deemed relevant to the performance of his specially delegated duties.  While the regulation remains in effect, the Executive Branch is bound by it.  United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U. S. 260.  Pp.  418 U. S. 694-696.
(c) The action of the Special Prosecutor within the scope of his express authority seeking specified evidence preliminarily determined to be relevant and admissible in the pending criminal case, and the President's assertion of privilege in opposition thereto, present issues ""of a type which are traditionally justiciable,"" United States v. ICC, supra, at  337 U. S. 430, and the fact that both litigants are officers of the Executive Branch is not a bar to justiciability.  Pp.  418 U. S. 696-697.
3. From this Court's examination of the material submitted by the Special Prosecutor in support of his motion for the subpoena, much of which is under seal, it is clear that the District Court's denial of the motion to quash comported with Rule 17(c), and that the Special Prosecutor has made a sufficient showing to justify a subpoena for production before trial.  Pp.  418 U. S. 697-702.
4. Neither the doctrine of separation of powers nor the generalized need for confidentiality of high-level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.  See, e.g.,  5 U. S.  Madison, 1 Cranch 137,  5 U. S. 177; Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186,  369 U. S. 211.  Absent a claim of need to protect military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets, the confidentiality of 
Page 418 U. S. 685
 Presidential communications is not significantly diminished by producing material for a criminal trial under the protected conditions of in camera inspection, and any absolute executive privilege under Art. II of the Constitution would plainly conflict with the function of the courts under the Constitution.  Pp.  418 U. S. 703-707.
5. Although the courts will afford the utmost deference to Presidential acts in the performance of an Art. II function, United States v. Burr, 25 F.Cas. 187, 190, 191-192 (No. 14,694), when a claim of Presidential privilege as to materials subpoenaed for use in a criminal trial is based, as it is here, not on the ground that military or diplomatic secrets are implicated, but merely on the ground of a generalized interest in confidentiality, the President's generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial and the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.  Pp.  418 U. S. 707-713.
6. On the basis of this Court's examination of the record, it cannot be concluded that the District Court erred in ordering in camera examination of the subpoenaed material, which shall now forthwith be transmitted to the District Court.  Pp.  418 U. S. 713-714.
7. Since a president's communications encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material than would be true of an ordinary individual, the public interest requires that Presidential confidentiality be afforded the greatest protection consistent with the fair administration of justice, and the District Court has a heavy responsibility to ensure that material involving Presidential conversations irrelevant to or inadmissible in the criminal prosecution be accorded the high degree of respect due a President, and that such material be returned under seal to its lawful custodian.  Until released to the Special Prosecutor, no in camera material is to be released to anyone.  Pp.  418 U. S. 714-716.
No. 73-1766, 377 F.Supp. 1326, affirmed; No. 73-1834, certiorari dismissed as improvidently granted.
BURGER, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all Members joined except REHNQUIST, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the cases.

In sentencing a youth offender as an adult under other applicable penal statutes,  5010(d) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act requires a federal district court to ""find"" that the offender would not benefit from treatment under the Act, but does not require that such ""finding"" be accompanied by supporting reasons.  Pp.  418 U. S. 431-444.
(a) Section 5010(d)'s requirement of a ""no benefit"" finding is not to be read as a substantive standard that must be satisfied to support a sentence outside the Act, for such a reading would not comport with the intent of the Act, as manifested by its legislative history, to increase federal trial judges' sentencing options, or with the traditional doctrine that the sentencing function is exclusively vested in the trial court and is not reviewable if within the terms of the statute.  It therefore follows that requiring a statement of supporting reasons to accompany a ""no benefit"" finding would limit the trial court's sentencing discretion, since it would only serve to facilitate appellate review of sentencing, contrary to the intent of the Act.  Pp.  418 U. S. 436-442.
(b) Section 5010(d)'s ""no benefit"" finding requirement was designed to insure that the sentencing judge deliberately exercised discretion in choosing not to commit a youth offender to treatment under the Act, such a finding making it clear that the judge was not only aware of the Act's existence, but also of the youth offender's eligibility for treatment thereunder.

Syllabus 
Following enactment of the Federal Magistrates Act, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky amended its Local Rule 16 to provide that, in addition to submitting such other reports and recommendations as may be required concerning petitions for writs of habeas corpus from state prisoners the full-time magistrate shall
""schedule and hear evidentiary matters . . . [to be electronically recorded] deemed by the Magistrate to be necessary and proper in the determination of . . . such petition, and to report thereon with an appropriate recommendation for the disposition thereof to the District Judge [who] . . . [u]pon . . . request . . . shall proceed to hear the recording of the testimony . . . and give it de novo consideration.""
Respondent, a state prisoner, whose petition for habeas corpus was assigned to a full-time Magistrate for processing, claimed that the Rule is invalid, and filed a motion with the District Court that the Magistrate be disqualified from holding the habeas corpus hearing and that the hearing be assigned to a district judge.  The District Court denied the motion; the Magistrate proceeded with the hearing; and thereafter he transmitted the electronic recording to the District Court along with his written findings and conclusions recommending dismissal.  The District Court, following respondent's motion for a de novo hearing, listened to the recording, on the basis of which, together with the Magistrate's findings and conclusions, it dismissed the petition.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, notwithstanding a formal revision of the habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C.  2243, the construction of the predecessor statute given in Holiday v.

No. 73-846
Argued April 22, 1974
Decided June 26, 1974
418 U.S. 461

Syllabus 
Following enactment of the Federal Magistrates Act, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky amended its Local Rule 16 to provide that, in addition to submitting such other reports and recommendations as may be required concerning petitions for writs of habeas corpus from state prisoners the full-time magistrate shall
""schedule and hear evidentiary matters . . . [to be electronically recorded] deemed by the Magistrate to be necessary and proper in the determination of . . . such petition, and to report thereon with an appropriate recommendation for the disposition thereof to the District Judge [who] . . . [u]pon . . . request . . . shall proceed to hear the recording of the testimony . . . and give it de novo consideration.""
Respondent, a state prisoner, whose petition for habeas corpus was assigned to a full-time Magistrate for processing, claimed that the Rule is invalid, and filed a motion with the District Court that the Magistrate be disqualified from holding the habeas corpus hearing and that the hearing be assigned to a district judge.  The District Court denied the motion; the Magistrate proceeded with the hearing; and thereafter he transmitted the electronic recording to the District Court along with his written findings and conclusions recommending dismissal.  The District Court, following respondent's motion for a de novo hearing, listened to the recording, on the basis of which, together with the Magistrate's findings and conclusions, it dismissed the petition.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, notwithstanding a formal revision of the habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C.  2243, the construction of the predecessor statute given in Holiday v. Johnson, 313 U. S. 342, still applied, to the effect that the statute plainly accorded a prisoner seeking habeas corpus relief the right of testifying before a judge.

418 U.S. 488

Syllabus 
During a Kentucky murder trial in which petitioner was counsel for the accused, respondent trial judge informed petitioner on nine different occasions that he was in contempt of court.  At the conclusion of the trial, respondent, in the jury's presence, made a statement concerning petitioner's trial conduct, and, refusing petitioner's request to respond, imposed consecutive sentences on nine counts of contempt aggregating almost four and one-half years' imprisonment, including sentences of one year's imprisonment on each of two counts.  Subsequently, respondent amended the judgment to eliminate the first contempt charge and to reduce each of the latter sentences to six months' imprisonment, but was silent on whether all of the sentences were to run concurrently or consecutively.  The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed, but ruled that, because the amended judgment did not direct that the sentences be served consecutively, they had to be served concurrently, thereby making the penalty actually imposed six months in jail and rendering constitutionally permissible the conviction and sentence without a jury trial.
Held:
1. Since no more than a six-month sentence was actually imposed, the eight contempts, whether considered singly or collectively, constituted petty offenses, and hence trial by jury was not required.  It is not improper to permit the State, as in this instance, after conviction, to reduce a sentence to six months or less, rather than retry the contempt with a jury, since ""criminal contempt is not a crime of the sort that requires the right to jury trial regardless of the penalty involved.""  Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 194,  391 U. S. 211.  Pp.  418 U. S. 495-496.
2. Respondent's conduct, in proceeding summarily after trial to punish petitioner for alleged contempt committed during the trial without giving him an opportunity to be heard in defense or mitigation before he was finally adjudged guilty and sentence was imposed, does not square with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Groppi v. Leslie, 404 U. S. 496.  Reasonable notice of the specific charges and opportunity to be heard

Syllabus 
Petitioners, Codispoti and Langnes, were tried before a judge in separate proceedings for contemptuous conduct that allegedly occurred during the course of their criminal trial before another judge, and were found guilty on each of several separate charges.  The judge in the contempt proceedings, who refused petitioners' request for a jury trial, imposed consecutive sentences, Codispoti receiving six months for each of six contempts and three months for the seventh (aggregating over three years), and Langnes six months for each of five contempts and two months for the sixth (aggregating close to three years).  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.  This Court granted certiorari limited to questions raising the issue whether petitioners should have been afforded a jury trial.
Held:
1. Though a crime carrying more than a six-month sentence is a serious offense triable by jury, Frank v. United States, 395 U. S. 147; Baldwin v. New York, 399 U. S. 66, an alleged contemnor is not entitled to a jury trial simply because a strong possibility exists that upon conviction he will face a substantial term of imprisonment regardless of the punishment actually imposed.

418 U.S. 539

Syllabus 
Respondent, on behalf of himself and other inmates at a Nebraska prison, filed a complaint for damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983, in which he alleged that disciplinary proceedings at the prison violated due process; that the inmate legal assistance program did not meet constitutional standards; and that the regulations governing inmates' mail were unconstitutionally restrictive.  After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court granted partial relief.  Though rejecting respondent's procedural due process claim, the court held that the prison's policy of inspecting all attorney-prisoner mail was improper, but that restrictions on inmate legal assistance were not constitutionally defective.  The Court of Appeals reversed with respect to the due process claim, holding that the procedural requirements outlined in the intervening decisions in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, and Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778, should be generally followed in prison disciplinary hearings, but leaving the specific requirements (including the circumstances in which counsel might be required) to be determined by the District Court on remand.  The Court of Appeals further held that Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, forbade restoration of good time credits in a 1983 suit, but ordered expunged from prison records misconduct determinations reached in proceedings that had not comported with due process.  The court generally affirmed the District Court's judgment respecting correspondence with attorneys, but added some additional prescriptions and ordered further proceedings to determine whether the State was meeting its burden under Johnson v. Avery, 393 U. S. 483, to provide legal assistance to prisoners, a duty the court found to extend to civil rights cases as well as habeas corpus proceedings.  Under Nebraska's disciplinary scheme, forfeiture or withholding of good time credits or confinement in a disciplinary cell is provided for serious misconduct and deprivation of privileges for less serious misconduct.  To establish misconduct, (1) a preliminary conference is held with the chief corrections supervisor and the charging party, where the 
Page 418 U. S. 540
 prisoner is orally informed of the charge and preliminarily discusses the merits; (2) a conduct report is prepared and a hearing held before the prison's disciplinary body,the Adjustment Committee (composed of three prison officials), where (3) the inmate can ask questions of the charging party.
Held:
1. Though the Court of Appeals correctly held that restoration of good time credits under  1983 is foreclosed under Preiser, supra, damages and declaratory and other relief for improper revocation of good time credits are cognizable under that provision.  Pp.  418 U. S. 553-555.
2. A prisoner is not wholly stripped of constitutional protections, and though prison disciplinary proceedings do not implicate the full panoply of rights due a defendant in a criminal prosecution, such proceedings must be governed by a mutual accommodation between institutional needs and generally applicable constitutional requirements.  Pp.  418 U. S. 555-556.
3. Since prisoners in Nebraska can only lose good time credits if they are guilty of serious misconduct, the procedure for determining whether such misconduct has occurred must observe certain minimal due process requirements (though not the full range of procedures mandated in Morrissey, supra, and Scarpelli, supra, for parole and probation revocation hearings) consonant with the unique institutional environment and therefore involving a more flexible approach reasonably accommodating the interests of the inmates and the needs of the institution.  Pp.  418 U. S. 556-572.
(a) Advance written notice of charges must be given to the disciplinary action inmate, no less than 24 hours before his appearance before the Adjustment Committee.  Pp.  418 U. S. 563-564.
(b) There must be ""a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for [the disciplinary action].""  Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, at  408 U. S. 489.  Pp. 564- 418 U. S. 565.
(c) The inmate should be allowed to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense if permitting him to do so will not jeopardize institutional safety or correctional goals.  Pp.  418 U. S. 566-567.
(d) The inmate has no constitutional right to confrontation and cross-examination in prison disciplinary proceedings, such procedures in the current environment, where prison disruption remains a serious concern, being discretionary with the prison officials.  Pp.  418 U. S. 567-569.
(e) Inmates have no right to retained or appointed counsel 
Page 418 U. S. 541
 in such proceedings, although counsel substitutes should be provided in certain cases.  Pp.  418 U. S. 569-570.
(f) On the record here, it cannot be concluded that the Adjustment Committee is not sufficiently impartial to satisfy due process requirements.  Pp.  418 U. S. 570-571.
4. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the due process requirements in prison disciplinary proceedings were to be applied retroactively by requiring the expunging of prison records of improper misconduct determinations.  Morrissey, supra, at  408 U. S. 490.  Pp.  418 U. S. 573-574.
5. The State may constitutionally require that mail from an attorney to a prisoner be identified as such, and that his name and address appear on the communication; and -- as a protection against contraband -- that the authorities may open such mail in the inmate's presence.  A lawyer desiring to correspond with a prisoner may also be required first to identify himself and his client to the prison officials to ensure that letters marked ""privileged"" are actually from members of the bar.  Other restrictions on the attorney-prisoner mail procedure required by the courts below are disapproved.  Pp.  418 U. S. 574-577.
6. The District Court, as the Court of Appeals suggested, is to assess the adequacy of the legal assistance available for preparation of civil rights actions, applying the standard of Johnson v. Avery, supra, at  373 U. S. 490, that
""unless and until the State provides some reasonable alternative to assist inmates in the preparation of petitions for post-conviction relief,""
inmates could not be barred from furnishing assistance to each other.  Pp.  418 U. S. 577-580.

No. 73-38
Argued April 23, 1974
Decided June 26, 1974
418 U.S. 602

Syllabus 
The United States brought this civil antitrust action under  7 of the Clayton Act to challenge a proposed merger between two commercial banks, which would substitute the acquiring bank for the acquired bank in Spokane, Wash., and would permit the former for the first time to participate directly in the Spokane market.  The acquiring bank, appellee National Bank of Commerce (NBC), is a large, nationally chartered bank based in Seattle, Wash., and a wholly owned subsidiary of appellee Marine Bancorporation, Inc., and, in terms of assets, deposits, and loans, is the second largest banking organization with headquarters in Washington, operating 107 branches in the State, including 59 in the Seattle metropolitan area and 31 in lesser developed eastern sections of the State, but none of which is in the Spokane metropolitan area.  The acquired or target bank, appellee Washington Trust Bank (WTB), is a medium-size, state-chartered bank located in Spokane, with seven branches, six in the city and one in a suburb, and is the eighth largest bank with headquarters in Washington and the ninth largest in the State, controlling 17.4% of the 46 commercial banking offices and holding 18.6% or the third largest percentage of the total deposits in the Spokane metropolitan area.  (The two banks with the largest percentages in the area hold 42.1% and 31.6%, respectively, of total deposits.)  The Government bases its case exclusively on the potential competition doctrine, seeking to establish that the merger ""may . . . substantially . . . lessen competition"" within the meaning of  7:  (i) by eliminating the prospect that NBC, absent acquisition of the market share represented by WTB, would enter Spokane de novo or through acquisition of a smaller bank, and thus would assist in deconcentrating that market over the long run; (ii) by ending present procompetitive effects allegedly produced in Spokane by NBC's perceived presence on the fringe of the Spokane market; and (iii) by terminating the alleged probability 
Page 418 U. S. 603
 that WTB as an independent entity would develop by internal expansion or mergers with other medium-size banks into a regional or ultimately state-wide actual competitor of NBC and other large banks.  The District Court held against the Government on all aspects, and dismissed the complaint.
Held:
1. As ""a necessary predicate"" to deciding whether the proposed merger contravenes the Clayton Act, the District Court properly found that the relevant product market was the ""business of commercial banking"" and that the relevant geographic market was the Spokane metropolitan area.  The entire State is not, despite the Government's contrary contention, an appropriate ""section of the country"" within the meaning of  7, since, for the purpose of this case, the appropriate ""section of the country"" and the ""relevant geographic market"" are the same, being the area in which the acquired firm is an actual, direct competitor, and since, moreover, the Government has not shown that the effect of the merger on a state-wide basis ""may be substantially to lessen competition"" within the meaning of  7.  Pp.  418 U. S. 618-623.
2. While geographic market extension mergers by commercial banks must pass muster under the potential competition doctrine, the application of the doctrine to commercial banking must take into account the extensive and unique federal and state regulatory restraints on entry into that line of commerce, including controls over the number of bank charters to be granted, prior bank regulatory agency approval of the opening of branches, and state law restrictions, such as those in Washington, on de novo geographic expansion through branching and multibank holding companies.  Pp.  418 U. S. 626-630.
3. The Government's evidence of concentration ratios in the Spokane commercial banking market established a prima facie case that that market was sufficiently concentrated to invoke the potential competition doctrine, and appellees did not demonstrate that such ratios inaccurately depicted the economic characteristics of the Spokane market.  Pp. 630-632.
4. In view of the legal barriers to entry, notably state law prohibitions against de novo branching, branching from a branch office, and multibank holding companies, the Government failed to sustain its burden of proof that the challenged merger violates  7 by eliminating the likelihood that, but for the merger, NBC would enter Spokane de novo by means of sponsorship acquisition or through a foothold acquisition of a small state bank in the Spokane 
Page 418 U. S. 604
 area, since it was not shown that either of the proposed alternative methods of entry was feasible or offered a substantial likelihood of ultimately producing deconcentration of the Spokane market or other significant procompetitive effects.  Pp.  418 U. S. 632-639
5. The Government's failure to establish that NBC has alternative methods of entry offering a reasonable likelihood of producing significant procompetitive effects is determinative of its contention that, without regard to the possibility of future deconcentration of the Spokane market, the challenged merger is illegal because it eliminates NBC as a perceived potential entrant.  Assuming that commercial bankers in Spokane are aware of the regulatory barriers that render NBC an unlikely or insignificant potential entrant except by merger with WTB, it is improbable, in light of such barriers, that NBC exerts any meaningful procompetitive influence over Spokane banks by ""standing in the wings.""  Pp.  418 U. S. 639-640.
6. The record amply supports the District Court's finding that the Government ""failed to establish . . . that there is any reasonable probability that WTB will expand into other banking markets,"" since at no time in its 70-year history has WTB established branches outside the Spokane area, acquired another bank, or received a merger offer other than the one at issue here.  Pp.  418 U. S. 640-641.

Argued April 23, 1974

418 U.S. 656

Syllabus 
The United States brought this civil antitrust action under  7 of the Clayton Act challenging a proposed consolidation between the Connecticut National Bank (CNB) and the First New Haven National Bank (FNH), which are, respectively, the fourth and eighth largest commercial banks in Connecticut.  The banks operate in contiguous areas of the State, CNB having headquarters in Bridgeport, with 51 offices there and in nearby towns; FNH having headquarters in New Haven, with 22 offices there and in nearby towns.  The Government contended that the merger would eliminate significant potential competition in commercial banking in the New Haven and Bridgeport metropolitan areas and in other areas in Connecticut.  The District Court rejected the Government's arguments in support of that position, relying on state law restraints on de novo branching, the two banks' expansion plans and capabilities, the posture of national and state regulatory officials regarding the issuance of new bank charters, and the existence and economic feasibility of possible foothold acquisitions.  The court concluded that, under  7, commercial banking is not a distinct line of commerce in Connecticut, and that the relevant geographic market or ""section of the country"" under that provision is the State as a whole.
Held:
1. The District Court erred in holding that the appropriate ""line of commerce"" within the meaning of  7 included both commercial banks and savings banks.  Pp.  418 U. S. 660-666.
2. The District Court further erred in ruling that the relevant geographic market is the State of Connecticut as a whole.  In a potential competition case like this, the relevant geographic market must be defined as the localized area in which the acquired bank is in significant, direct competition with other banks, albeit not the acquiring bank.  United States v. Marine Bancorporation, ante, p. 602.  Pp.  418 U. S. 666-668.
3. On remand, the District Court must make a determination as to the geographic market in which each of the banks operates 
Page 418 U. S. 657
 and to which the bulk of it customers may turn for alternative commercial bank services, and, in making that determination, it will be aided by the following considerations:  (i) the Government has the burden of producing evidence to define localized banking markets; (ii) in satisfying that burden (as the District Court correctly held), the Government cannot rely only on Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas; and (iii) town boundaries, although significant, are not controlling.  Pp.  418 U. S. 668-671.
4. The Government's contention that the State as a whole, though not a banking market, is a ""section of the country"" within the meaning of  7 is without merit, Marine Bancorporation, supra.  Pp.  418 U. S. 672-673.

Respondent, as a federal taxpayer, brought this suit for the purpose of obtaining a declaration of unconstitutionality of the Central Intelligence Agency Act, which permits the CIA to account for its expenditures ""solely on the certificate of the Director. . . .""  50 U.S.C.  403j(b).  The complaint alleged that the Act violated Art. I,  9, cl. 7, of the Constitution insofar as that clause requires a regular statement and account of public funds.  The District Court's dismissal of the complaint for, inter alia, respondent's lack of standing under Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, was reversed by the Court of Appeals.  That court held that respondent had standing as a taxpayer on the ground that he satisfied Flast's requirements that the allegations (1) challenge an enactment under the Taxing and Spending Clause of Art I,  8, and show (2) a ""nexus"" between the plaintiff's status and a specific constitutional limitation on the taxing and spending power.
Held:  Respondent lacks standing to maintain this suit.  Pp.  418 U. S. 171-180.
(a) Flast, which stressed the need for meeting the requirements of Art. III, did not
""undermine the salutary principle . . . established by Frothingham \[v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447] . . . that a taxpayer may not 'employ a federal court as a forum in which to air his generalized grievances about the conduct of government or the allocation of power in the Federal System.'""
Pp.  418 U. S. 171-174.
(b) Respondent's challenge, not being addressed to the taxing or spending power, but to the statutes regulating the CIA's accounting and reporting procedures, provides no ""logical nexus"" between his status as ""taxpayer"" and the asserted failure of Congress to require more detailed reports of expenditures of the CIA.  Pp.  418 U. S. 174-175.
(c) Respondent's claim that, without detailed information on the CIA's expenditures, he cannot properly follow legislative or executive action, and thereby fulfill his obligations as a voter, is a generalized grievance insufficient under Frothingham or Flast to show that ""he has sustained or is immediately in danger of

Respondents -- an association of present and former members of the Armed Forces Reserve opposing United States involvement in Vietnam, and five association members who were United States citizens and taxpayers -- brought a class action on behalf, inter alia, of all United States citizens and taxpayers against petitioners, the Secretary of Defense and the three Service Secretaries, challenging the Reserve membership of Members of Congress as violating the Incompatibility Clause of Art.

The District Court held that respondents had standing to sue as citizens but not as taxpayers, and, on the merits, granted partial relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Decided June 25, 1974
418 U.S. 241

Syllabus 
After appellant newspaper had refused to print appellee's replies to editorials critical of appellee's candidacy for state office, appellee brought suit in Florida Circuit Court seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and damages, based on Florida's ""right of reply"" statute that grants a political candidate a right to equal space to answer criticism and attacks on his record by a newspaper, and making it a misdemeanor for the newspaper to fail to comply.  The Circuit Court held the statute unconstitutional as infringing on the freedom of the press, and dismissed the action.  The Florida Supreme Court reversed, holding that the statute did not violate constitutional guarantees, and that civil remedies, including damages, were available, and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.
Held:
1. The Florida Supreme Court's judgment is ""final"" under 28 U.S.C.  1257, and thus is ripe for review by this Court.  North Dakota Pharmacy Bd. v. Snyder's Stores, 414 U. S. 156.  Pp.  418 U. S. 246-247.
2. The statute violates the First Amendment's guarantee of a free press.  Pp.  418 U. S. 247-258.
(a) Governmental compulsion on a newspaper to publish that which ""reason"" tells it should not be published is unconstitutional.  P.  418 U. S. 256.
(b) The statute operates as a command by a State in the same sense as a statute or regulation forbidding appellant to publish specified matter.  P.  418 U. S. 256.
(c) The statute exacts a penalty on the basis of the content of a newspaper by imposing additional printing, composing, and materials costs and by taking up space that could be devoted to other material the newspaper may have preferred to print.  Pp.  418 U. S. 256-257
(d) Even if a newspaper would face no additional costs to comply with the statute and would not be forced to forgo publication of news or opinion by the inclusion of a reply, the statute still fails to clear the First Amendment's barriers because of its

No. 72-1180
Argued November 14, 1973
Decided June 25, 1974
418 U.S. 264

Syllabus 
As part of its ongoing efforts to organize the remainder of letter carriers, appellant union, the carriers' collective bargaining representative in Richmond, Virginia, published a ""List of Scabs"" in its newsletter, including the names of appellees, together with a pejorative definition of ""scab"" using words like ""traitor.""  Appellees brought libel actions.  Though recognizing that the case involved the publications of a labor union that were relevant to the union's organizational campaign, the trial court overruled appellants' motions to dismiss based on the ground that the publication had First Amendment and federal labor law protection.  The court interpreted Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, to permit application of state libel laws as long as the challenged statements were made with ""actual malice,"" defined as being
""actuated by some sinister or corrupt motive such as hatred, personal spite, ill will, or desire to injure the plaintiff . . . or . . . with such gross indifference and recklessness as to amount to a wanton or willful disregard of the rights of the plaintiff.""
The jury awarded appellees damages, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. Although Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, supra, held that federal labor law does not completely preempt the application of state laws to libels published during labor disputes, that decision recognized that federal law does preempt state law to the extent that the State seeks to make actionable defamatory statements in labor disputes published without knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard of the truth.  Pp.  418 U. S. 270-273.
2. Federal labor laws favor uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate in labor disputes.  Pp.  418 U. S. 273-279.
(a) The relevant law here is Executive Order No. 11491, governing labor relations in federal employment.  The basic provisions of the Executive Order are like those of the National Labor Relations Act, and similarly afford wide latitude for union freedom 
Page 418 U. S. 265
 of speech.  The partial preemption of Linn is thus equally applicable here.  Pp.  418 U. S. 273-279.
(b) The free speech protections afforded union organizing efforts extend to post-recognition organizing activity to the same degree as to pre-recognition activity.  P.  418 U. S. 279.
3. The trial court's instruction defining malice in common law terms was erroneous and reflected a misunderstanding of Linn, which adopted the ""reckless or knowing falsehood"" test of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254.  Pp.  418 U. S. 280-282.
4. The state libel award arising out of the publication of the union newsletter here did not comport with the protection for freedom of speech in labor disputes recognized in Linn.  The use of the epithet ""scab,"" which was literally and factually true, and is common parlance in labor disputes, was protected under federal law.  Publication of the pejorative definition was likewise not actionable, since the use of words like ""traitor"" cannot be construed as representations of fact and their use in a figurative sense to manifest the union's strong disagreement with the views of workers opposing unionization is also protected by federal law.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a candidate for state office, who was refused available advertising space on vehicles of a city transit system, brought this suit challenging the constitutionality of the municipal policy on which the refusal was based of not permitting political advertising but allowing other types of public transit advertising.  The state courts declined to give petitioner relief, the Ohio Supreme Court holding that the city's refusal did not violate a candidate's free speech or equal protection rights.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  418 U. S. 302-308.
34 Ohio St.2d 143, 296 N.E.2d 683, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that car card space on a city transit system is not a First Amendment forum, and that here the decision to limit transit advertisements to innocuous and less controversial commercial and service-oriented advertising -- thus minimizing chances of abuse, appearances of political favoritism, and the risk of imposing upon a captive audience -- is within the city's discretion, and involves no First or Fourteenth Amendment violation.  Pp.  418 U. S. 302-304.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concluded that petitioner, though free to express his views to a willing audience, has no constitutional right to force his message upon a captive audience, which uses public transit vehicles not as a place for discussion, but only as a means of transport. Pp. 305-308

Argued November 14, 1973
Decided June 25, 1974
418 U.S. 323

Syllabus 
A Chicago policeman named Nuccio was convicted of murder.  The victim's family retained petitioner, a reputable attorney, to represent them in civil litigation against Nuccio.  An article appearing in respondent's magazine alleged that Nuccio's murder trial was part of a Communist conspiracy to discredit the local police, and it falsely stated that petitioner had arranged Nuccio's ""frameup,"" implied that petitioner had a criminal record, and labeled him a ""Communist-fronter.""  Petitioner brought this diversity libel action against respondent.  After the jury returned a verdict for petitioner, the District Court decided that the standard enunciated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, which bars media liability for defamation of a public official absent proof that the defamatory statements were published with knowledge of their falsity or in reckless disregard of the truth, should apply to this suit.  The court concluded that that standard protects media discussion of a public issue without regard to whether the person defamed is a public official as in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra, or a public figure, as in Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U. S. 130.  The court found that petitioner had failed to prove knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth, and therefore entered judgment n.o.v. for respondent.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. A publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehoods about an individual who is neither a public official nor a public figure may not claim the New York Times protection against liability for defamation on the ground that the defamatory statements concern an issue of public or general interest.  Pp.  418 U. S. 339-348.
(a) Because private individuals characteristically have less effective opportunities for rebuttal than do public officials and public figures, they are more vulnerable to injury from defamation.  Because they have not voluntarily exposed themselves to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehoods, they are also more deserving of recovery.  The state interest in compensating 
Page 418 U. S. 324
 injury to the reputation of private individuals is therefore greater than for public officials and public figures.  Pp.  418 U. S. 343-345.
(b) To extend the New York Times standard to media defamation of private persons whenever an issue of general or public interest is involved would abridge to an unacceptable degree the legitimate state interest in compensating private individuals for injury to reputation and would occasion the additional difficulty of forcing courts to decide on an ad hoc basis which publications and broadcasts address issues of general or public interest and which do not.  Pp.  418 U. S. 345-346.
(c) So long as they do not impose liability without fault, the States may define for themselves the appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehood which injures a private individual and whose substance makes substantial danger to reputation apparent.  Pp.  418 U. S. 347-348.
2. The States, however, may not permit recovery of presumed or punitive damages when liability is not based on knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth, and the private defamation plaintiff who establishes liability under a less demanding standard than the New York Times test may recover compensation only for actual injury.  Pp.  418 U. S. 348-350.
3. Petitioner was neither a public official nor a public figure.  Pp.  418 U. S. 351-352.
(a) Neither petitioner's past service on certain city committees nor his appearance as an attorney at the coroner's inquest into the death of the murder victim made him a public official.  P.  418 U. S. 351.
(b) Petitioner was also not a public figure.  Absent clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community and pervasive involvement in ordering the affairs of society, an individual should not be deemed a public figure for all aspects of his life.  Rather, the public figure question should be determined by reference to the individual's participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation.  Petitioner's role in the Nuccio affair did not make him a public figure.  Pp.  418 U. S. 351-352.

For displaying out of his apartment window a United States flag upside down with a peace symbol taped thereto, appellant was convicted under Washington's ""improper use"" statute forbidding the exhibition of a United States flag to which is attached or superimposed figures, symbols, or other extraneous material.  He testified without contradiction at his trial that he thus displayed his flag as a protest against then-recent actions in Cambodia and fatal events at Kent State University, and that his purpose was to associate the American flag with peace instead of war and violence.  The Washington Supreme Court sustained the conviction, rejecting appellant's contention, inter alia, that the improper use statute, on its face and as applied, contravened the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held:  The statute, as applied to appellant's activity, impermissibly infringed a form of protected expression.

Syllabus 
Section 167(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 allows a depreciation deduction from gross income for ""property used in the [taxpayer's] trade or business"" or ""held for the production of income,"" whereas  263(a)(1) of the Code disallows a deduction for ""[a]ny amount paid out for new buildings or for permanent improvements or betterments made to increase the value of any property or estate,"" expenditures which, the regulations state, include the ""cost of acquisition, construction, or erection of buildings.""  Section 161 makes the deductions specified in that part of the Code, including  167(a), subject to the exceptions provided in the part including  263.  Respondent public utility claimed a deduction from gross income under  167(a) for all the depreciation for the year on its transportation equipment (car, trucks, etc.), including that portion attributable to its use in constructing capital facilities, although, on its books, as required by the regulatory agencies, it charged such equipment, to the extent it was used in construction, to the capital assets so constructed.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction for the construction-related depreciation, ruling that that depreciation was a nondeductible capital expenditure under  263(a).  
Page 418 U. S. 2
 The Commissioner was upheld by the Tax Court, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a deduction expressly enumerated in the Code, such as that for depreciation, may properly be taken even if it relates to a capital item, and that  263(a)(1) was inapplicable because depreciation is not an ""amount paid out"" as required by that section.
Held:  The equipment depreciation allocable to the taxpayer's construction of capital facilities must be capitalized under  263(a)(1).  Pp.  418 U. S. 10-19.
(a) Accepted accounting practice and established tax principles require the capitalization of the cost of acquiring a capital asset, including the cost incurred in a taxpayer's construction of capital facilities.  The purpose of depreciation accounting is the allocation of the expense of using an asset over the tax periods benefited by that asset.  Pp.  418 U. S. 10-13.
(b) Construction-related depreciation is not unlike expenditure for other construction-related items, such as construction workers' wages, which must be treated as part of the cost of acquiring a capital asset.  The significant fact is that the exhaustion of the construction equipment does not represent the final disposition of the taxpayer's investment in that equipment; rather such investment is assimilated into the cost of the capital asset constructed, and this capitalization prevents the distortion of income that would otherwise occur if depreciation properly allocable to asset acquisition were deducted from gross income currently realized.  Pp.  418 U. S. 13-14.
(c) Capitalization of construction-related equipment depreciation by the taxpayer which does its own construction work maintains tax parity with the taxpayer which has such work done independently.  P.  418 U. S. 14.
(d) Where a taxpayer's generally accepted method of accounting is made compulsory by the regulatory agency and that method clearly reflects income, as here, it is almost presumptively controlling of federal income tax consequences.  Pp.  418 U. S. 14-15.
(e) Considering  263(a)(1)'s literal language in denying a deduction for ""[a]ny amount paid out"" for construction or permanent improvement of facilities, and its purpose to reflect the basic principle that a capital expenditure may not be deducted from current income, as well as the regulations indicating that, for purposes of  263(a)(1) ""amount paid out"" equates with ""cost incurred,"" there is no question that the cost of the transportation equipment was ""paid out"" in the same manner as the cost of other 
Page 418 U. S. 3

Syllabus 
After the three individual respondents, who had been convicted of felonies and had completed their sentences and paroles, were refused registration to vote in three different California counties respectively because of their felony convictions, they brought a class petition, on behalf of themselves and all other ex-felons similarly situated, for a writ of mandate in the California Supreme Court, naming as defendants the Secretary of State and the three county election officials who had denied them registration ""individually and as representatives of the class of all other"" county election officials in the State, and challenging the constitutionality of respondents' disenfranchisement on the ground, inter alia, that provisions of the California Constitution and the implementing statutes that disenfranchised ex-felons denied them equal protection.  The three county officials named as defendants decided not to contest the action, and told the court they would henceforth register to vote ex-felons, including respondents, whose sentences and paroles had expired.  Prior to the return date of the writ, the court added to the named defendants (instead of allowing her to intervene) another county election official (petitioner here) who was the defendant in a similar action by an ex-felon pending in the State Court of Appeal.  After holding that the three first-named county officials' acquiescence did not render the case moot, the California Supreme Court went on to hold that the constitutional and statutory provisions in question, as applied to ex-felons whose sentences and paroles had expired, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but did not issue the peremptory writ.
Held:
1. In view of its unusual procedural history in the Supreme Court of California, the case is not moot.  Pp.  418 U. S. 34-40.
(a) The State Supreme Court's action in adding petitioner as a named defendant after the other named county officials decided not to contest the action, and at a time when the Secretary of 
Page 418 U. S. 25
 State (who did not join in the petition to this Court) was still a party defendant who had answered the complaint, indicates that the court considered the suit to be not only on behalf of the three named plaintiffs, but also on behalf of all ex-felons in California similarly situated, and also that the court regarded petitioner's opponent in the Court of Appeal suit, both as an unnamed member of the class of ex-felons referred to in the complaint and as one of a class actually seeking to register in petitioner's county, as a party to the Supreme Court action.  Pp.  418 U. S. 38-40.
(b) Being rendered in a class action in which relief in the nature of declaratory relief was granted, the decision below is not only binding on petitioner, and thus dispositive of her other suit, but also decides the federal constitutional question presented for the unnamed members of the classes represented below by petitioner and respondents, whose continuing controversy in the State Supreme Court still continues in this Court.  Brockington v. Rhodes, 396 U. S. 41, distinguished.  P.  418 U. S. 40.
2. California, in disenfranchising convicted felons who have completed their sentences and paroles, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  418 U. S. 41-56.
(a) The understanding of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, as reflected in the express language of  2 of the Amendment, which exempts from the sanction of reduced congressional representation resulting from the denial of citizens' right to vote the denial of such right for ""participation in rebellion, or other crime,"" and in the historical and judicial interpretation of the Amendment's applicability to state laws disenfranchising felons, is of controlling significance in distinguishing such laws from those other state limitations on the franchise that this Court has held invalid under the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  418 U. S. 54-55.
(b) Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which contains the Equal Protection Clause, in dealing with voting rights as it does, could not have been meant to bar outright a form of disenfranchisement that was expressly exempted from the less drastic sanction of reduced representation that  2 imposed for other forms of disenfranchisement.  P.  418 U. S. 55.
(c) Even if  2 was made part of the Amendment ""largely through the accident of political exigency, rather than for the relation which it bore to the other sections of Amendment,'"" as respondents contend, this does not preclude looking to it for guidance in interpreting  1, since  2 is as much a part of the Amendment

Syllabus 
Petitioners were convicted of mailing and conspiring to mail an obscene advertising brochure with sexually explicit photographic material relating to their illustrated version (hereafter Illustrated Report) of an official report on obscenity, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  2, 371, and 1461.  The indictment under  1461 charged petitioners in the language of the statute, which provides in pertinent part that obscene material and written information as to where it may be obtained is nonmailable, and that ""[w]hoever knowingly uses the mails for the mailing . . . of anything declared by this section . . . to be nonmailable . . ."" commits a crime.  The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the counts charging the mailing of the allegedly obscene Illustrated Report.  Following affirmance of the convictions by the Court of Appeals, this Court decided Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, and companion cases (hereafter collectively the Miller cases), after considering which, the Court of Appeals denied a petition for rehearing.  Petitioners challenge their convictions based upon the pre-Miller obscenity test in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413, and also as failing to meet the standards of the Miller cases; and challenge various procedural and evidentiary rulings of the District Court, as well as its instructions.
Held:
1. Title 18 U.S.C.  1461,
""applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity, do[es] not offend constitutional safeguards against convictions based upon protected material, or fail to give men in acting adequate notice of what is prohibited,""
Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476,  354 U. S. 492.  Pp.  418 U. S. 98-99.
2. The jury's determination that the brochure was obscene was supported by the evidence, and was consistent with the Memoirs obscenity formulation.  P.  418 U. S. 100.
3. The inability of the jury to reach a verdict on the counts charging distribution of the Illustrated Report had no relevance to its finding that the brochure was obscene, consistency in verdicts not being required, and the brochure being separable from the Illustrated Report.  Pp.  418 U. S. 100-101. 
Page 418 U. S. 88

4. The standards established in the Miller cases do not, as applied to petitioners' pre-Miller conduct, require a reversal of their convictions.  Pp.  418 U. S. 101-117.
(a) Defendants like petitioners, who were convicted prior to the decisions in the Miller cases but whose convictions were on direct appeal at that time, should receive any benefit available to them from those decisions.  Pp.  418 U. S. 101-102.
(b) The instruction to the jury on the application of national community standards of obscenity was not constitutionally improper, since, in rejecting the view that the First and Fourteenth Amendments require that the proscription of obscenity be based on uniform national standards, the Court in the Miller cases did not require as a constitutional matter the substitution of some smaller geographical area into the same sort of formula; the test was stated in terms of the understanding of the ""average person, applying contemporary community standards.""  The Court's holding in Miller that California could constitutionally proscribe obscenity in terms of a ""state-wide"" standard did not mean that any such precise geographic area is required as a matter of constitutional law.  Reversal is required in pre-Miller cases only where there is a probability that the excision of the references to the ""nation as a whole"" in the instruction dealing with community standards would have materially affected the deliberations of the jury.  Pp.  418 U. S. 103-110.
(c) Construing 18 U.S.C.  1461 as being limited to the sort of ""patently offensive representations or descriptions of that specific hard core' sexual conduct given as examples in Miller v. California,"" the statute is not unconstitutionally vague, it being plain that the brochure is a form of hard-core pornography well within the permissibly proscribed depictions described in Miller.  The enumeration of specific categories of obscene material in Miller did not purport to proscribe, for purposes of 18 U.S.C.  1461, conduct that had not previously been thought criminal, but instead added a ""clarifying gloss"" to the prior construction, making the statute's meaning ""more definite.""  Bouie v. City of Columbia. 378 U. S. 347,  378 U. S. 353.  Pp.  418 U. S. 110-116.
(d) Miller's rejection of Memoirs' ""social value"" formulation did not mean that 18 U.S.C.  1461 was unconstitutionally vague at the time of petitioners' convictions because it did not provide them with sufficient guidance as to the proper test of ""social value,"" that formula having been rejected not for vagueness 
Page 418 U. S. 89
 reasons but because it departed from Roth's obscenity definition and entailed a virtually impossible prosecutorial burden.  Pp.  418 U. S. 116-117.
5. The indictment was sufficiently definite.  Pp.  418 U. S. 117-119.
(a) The language of  1461 was not ""too vague to support conviction for crime,"" Roth v. United States, supra, at  354 U. S. 480.  P.  418 U. S. 117.
(b) The indictment gave petitioners adequate notice of the charges against them, since, at the time petitioners were indicted, the statutory term ""obscene,"" a legal term of art and not a generic expression, had a definite legal meaning.  Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749, distinguished.  Pp.  418 U. S. 117-119.
6. The District Court did not err in its instructions to the jury on scienter, including its instruction that ""[petitioners'] belief as to the obscenity or non-obscenity of the material is irrelevant,"" it being constitutionally sufficient that the prosecution show that a defendant had knowledge of the contents of materials that he distributes, and that he knew the character and nature of the materials.  Rosen v. United States, 161 U. S. 29, followed; Smith v. California, 361 U. S. 147, distinguished.  Pp.  418 U. S. 119-124.
7. The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict.  P.  418 U. S. 124.
8. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding allegedly comparable materials (materials with second-class mailing privileges, or judicially found to have been nonobscene, or available on newsstands), since, inter alia, expert testimony had been allowed on relevant community standards; and similar materials or judicial determinations with respect thereto do not necessarily prove nonobscenity of the materials the accused is charged with circulating; and with respect to whether proffered evidence is cumulative, clearly relevant, or confusing, the trial court has considerable latitude.  Pp.  418 U. S. 125-127.
9. The District Court's instruction that, in deciding whether the predominant appeal of the brochure was to a prurient interest in sex, the jury could consider whether some portions appealed to a specifically defined deviant group as well as to the average person was not erroneous, since, in measuring prurient appeal, the jury (which was instructed that it must find that the material as a whole appealed generally to a prurient interest in sex) may consider the material's prurient appeal to clearly defined deviant sexual groups.  Mishkin v. New York, 383 U. S. 502,  383 U. S. 508-509.  Pp.  418 U. S. 127-130. 
Page 418 U. S. 90

10. Since evidence of pandering can be relevant in determining obscenity, as long as the proper constitutional definition of obscenity is applied, Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U. S. 463, it was not improper for the District Court to instruct the jury in connection with the Memoirs test that it could also consider whether the brochure had been pandered by looking to the manner of its distribution and editorial intent.  Pp.  418 U. S. 130-131.
11. The Court of Appeals did not err in refusing to reverse petitioners' convictions for the District Court's failure to comply with Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 30 by denying petitioners' counsel's request to make additional objections to the instructions out of the presence of the jury, since this Court's independent examination of the record confirms the Court of Appeals' view that petitioners were not prejudiced thereby.  Pp.  418 U. S. 131-135.
12. Petitioner' argument that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a continuance until a new jury with a presumably greater ratio of young people could be drawn -- it having been almost four years since the jury wheel had last been filled -- is without merit, since there was no showing of a discriminatory exclusion of an identifiable group entitled to a group-based protection.

			"|"Hamling v. United States
No. 73-507
Argued April 15, 1974
Decided June 24, 1974
418 U.S. 87

Syllabus 
Petitioners were convicted of mailing and conspiring to mail an obscene advertising brochure with sexually explicit photographic material relating to their illustrated version (hereafter Illustrated Report) of an official report on obscenity, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  2, 371, and 1461.  The indictment under  1461 charged petitioners in the language of the statute, which provides in pertinent part that obscene material and written information as to where it may be obtained is nonmailable, and that ""[w]hoever knowingly uses the mails for the mailing . . . of anything declared by this section . . . to be nonmailable . . ."" commits a crime.  The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the counts charging the mailing of the allegedly obscene Illustrated Report.  Following affirmance of the convictions by the Court of Appeals, this Court decided Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, and companion cases (hereafter collectively the Miller cases), after considering which, the Court of Appeals denied a petition for rehearing.  Petitioners challenge their convictions based upon the pre-Miller obscenity test in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413, and also as failing to meet the standards of the Miller cases; and challenge various procedural and evidentiary rulings of the District Court, as well as its instructions.
Held:
1. Title 18 U.S.C.  1461,
""applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity, do[es] not offend constitutional safeguards against convictions based upon protected material, or fail to give men in acting adequate notice of what is prohibited,""
Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476,  354 U. S. 492.  Pp.  418 U. S. 98-99.
2. The jury's determination that the brochure was obscene was supported by the evidence, and was consistent with the Memoirs obscenity formulation.  P.  418 U. S. 100.
3. The inability of the jury to reach a verdict on the counts charging distribution of the Illustrated Report had no relevance to its finding that the brochure was obscene, consistency in verdicts not being required, and the brochure being separable from the Illustrated Report.  Pp.  418 U. S. 100-101. 
Page 418 U. S. 88

4. The standards established in the Miller cases do not, as applied to petitioners' pre-Miller conduct, require a reversal of their convictions.  Pp.  418 U. S. 101-117.
(a) Defendants like petitioners, who were convicted prior to the decisions in the Miller cases but whose convictions were on direct appeal at that time, should receive any benefit available to them from those decisions.  Pp.  418 U. S. 101-102.
(b) The instruction to the jury on the application of national community standards of obscenity was not constitutionally improper, since, in rejecting the view that the First and Fourteenth Amendments require that the proscription of obscenity be based on uniform national standards, the Court in the Miller cases did not require as a constitutional matter the substitution of some smaller geographical area into the same sort of formula; the test was stated in terms of the understanding of the ""average person, applying contemporary community standards.""  The Court's holding in Miller that California could constitutionally proscribe obscenity in terms of a ""state-wide"" standard did not mean that any such precise geographic area is required as a matter of constitutional law.  Reversal is required in pre-Miller cases only where there is a probability that the excision of the references to the ""nation as a whole"" in the instruction dealing with community standards would have materially affected the deliberations of the jury.  Pp.  418 U. S. 103-110.
(c) Construing 18 U.S.C.  1461 as being limited to the sort of ""patently offensive representations or descriptions of that specific hard core' sexual conduct given as examples in Miller v. California,"" the statute is not unconstitutionally vague, it being plain that the brochure is a form of hard-core pornography well within the permissibly proscribed depictions described in Miller.  The enumeration of specific categories of obscene material in Miller did not purport to proscribe, for purposes of 18 U.S.C.  1461, conduct that had not previously been thought criminal, but instead added a ""clarifying gloss"" to the prior construction, making the statute's meaning ""more definite.""  Bouie v. City of Columbia. 378 U. S. 347,  378 U. S. 353.  Pp.  418 U. S. 110-116.
(d) Miller's rejection of Memoirs' ""social value"" formulation did not mean that 18 U.S.C.  1461 was unconstitutionally vague at the time of petitioners' convictions because it did not provide them with sufficient guidance as to the proper test of ""social value,"" that formula having been rejected not for vagueness 
Page 418 U. S. 89
 reasons but because it departed from Roth's obscenity definition and entailed a virtually impossible prosecutorial burden.  Pp.  418 U. S. 116-117.
5. The indictment was sufficiently definite.  Pp.  418 U. S. 117-119.
(a) The language of  1461 was not ""too vague to support conviction for crime,"" Roth v. United States, supra, at  354 U. S. 480.  P.  418 U. S. 117.
(b) The indictment gave petitioners adequate notice of the charges against them, since, at the time petitioners were indicted, the statutory term ""obscene,"" a legal term of art and not a generic expression, had a definite legal meaning.  Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749, distinguished.  Pp.  418 U. S. 117-119.
6. The District Court did not err in its instructions to the jury on scienter, including its instruction that ""[petitioners'] belief as to the obscenity or non-obscenity of the material is irrelevant,"" it being constitutionally sufficient that the prosecution show that a defendant had knowledge of the contents of materials that he distributes, and that he knew the character and nature of the materials.  Rosen v. United States, 161 U. S. 29, followed; Smith v. California, 361 U. S. 147, distinguished.  Pp.  418 U. S. 119-124.
7. The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict.  P.  418 U. S. 124.
8. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding allegedly comparable materials (materials with second-class mailing privileges, or judicially found to have been nonobscene, or available on newsstands), since, inter alia, expert testimony had been allowed on relevant community standards; and similar materials or judicial determinations with respect thereto do not necessarily prove nonobscenity of the materials the accused is charged with circulating; and with respect to whether proffered evidence is cumulative, clearly relevant, or confusing, the trial court has considerable latitude.  Pp.  418 U. S. 125-127.
9. The District Court's instruction that, in deciding whether the predominant appeal of the brochure was to a prurient interest in sex, the jury could consider whether some portions appealed to a specifically defined deviant group as well as to the average person was not erroneous, since, in measuring prurient appeal, the jury (which was instructed that it must find that the material as a whole appealed generally to a prurient interest in sex) may consider the material's prurient appeal to clearly defined deviant sexual groups.  Mishkin v. New York, 383 U. S. 502,  383 U. S. 508-509.  Pp.  418 U. S. 127-130. 
Page 418 U. S. 90

10. Since evidence of pandering can be relevant in determining obscenity, as long as the proper constitutional definition of obscenity is applied, Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U. S. 463, it was not improper for the District Court to instruct the jury in connection with the Memoirs test that it could also consider whether the brochure had been pandered by looking to the manner of its distribution and editorial intent.  Pp.  418 U. S. 130-131.
11. The Court of Appeals did not err in refusing to reverse petitioners' convictions for the District Court's failure to comply with Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 30 by denying petitioners' counsel's request to make additional objections to the instructions out of the presence of the jury, since this Court's independent examination of the record confirms the Court of Appeals' view that petitioners were not prejudiced thereby.  Pp.  418 U. S. 131-135.
12. Petitioner' argument that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a continuance until a new jury with a presumably greater ratio of young people could be drawn -- it having been almost four years since the jury wheel had last been filled -- is without merit, since there was no showing of a discriminatory exclusion of an identifiable group entitled to a group-based protection.  Pp.  418 U. S. 135-138.
13. The District Court's voir dire examination was sufficient to test the qualifications and competency of the prospective jurors, and complied with Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 24(a), and that court did not constitutionally err in not asking certain questions propounded by petitioners.  Pp.  418 U. S. 138-140.

No. 73-557
Argued April 15, 1974

418 U.S. 153

Syllabus 
Appellant was convicted, prior to the announcement of Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, and companion cases, of violating Georgia's obscenity statute for showing the film ""Carnal Knowledge"" in a motion picture theater.  The jury had been instructed on obscenity under that statute, which defines obscene material in terms similar to the definition in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413,  383 U. S. 418.  The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. Appellant, whose conviction was on appeal at the time of the announcement of Miller, is entitled to any benefit available thereunder.  Hamling v. United States, ante, p.  418 U. S. 87.  P.  418 U. S. 155.
2. There is no constitutional requirement that juries be instructed in state obscenity cases to apply the standards of a hypothetical state-wide community -- Miller approving, but not mandating, such an instruction -- and jurors may properly be instructed to apply ""community standards,"" without a specification of the ""community"" by the trial court.  P.  418 U. S. 157.
3. The film is not obscene under the constitutional standards announced in Miller, and appellant's conviction therefore contravened the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  418 U. S. 157-161.
(a) Juries do not have unbridled discretion in determining what is ""patently offensive,"" since
""no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials [that do not] depict or describe patently offensive 'hard core' sexual conduct.',' . . . .""
Miller, supra, at  413 U. S. 27.  Pp.  418 U. S. 160-161.
(b) This Court's own view of the film impels the conclusion that the film's depiction of sexual conduct is not patently offensive.  The camera does not focus on the bodies of actors during scenes of ""ultimate sexual acts,"" nor are the actors' genitals exhibited during those scenes.  The film shows occasional nudity, but nudity alone does not render material obscene under Miller's standards.  P.  418 U. S. 161.

A union does not commit an unfair labor practice under  8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) when it disciplines supervisor-members for crossing a picket line and performing rank-and-file struck work during a lawful economic strike against the employer.  Pp.  417 U. S. 798-813.

Syllabus 
Four California prison inmates and three professional journalists brought this suit in the District Court challenging the constitutionality of a regulation,  415.071, of the California Department of Corrections Manual, which provides that ""[p]ress and other media interviews with specific individual inmates will not be permitted.""  That provision was promulgated following a violent prison episode that the correction authorities attributed at least in part to the former policy of free face-to-face prisoner-press interviews, which had resulted in a relatively small number of inmates gaining disproportionate notoriety and influence among their fellow inmates.  The District Court granted the inmate appellees' motion for summary judgment, holding that  415.071, insofar as it prohibited inmates from having face-to-face communication with journalists unconstitutionally infringed the inmates' First and Fourteenth Amendment freedoms.  The court granted a motion to dismiss with respect to the claims of the media appellants, holding that their rights were not infringed, in view of their otherwise available rights to enter state institutions and interview inmates at random and the even broader access afforded prisoners by the court's ruling with respect to the inmate appellees.  The prison officials (in No. 73-754) and the journalists (in No. 73-918) have appealed.
Held:
1. In light of the alternative channels of communication that are open to the inmate appellees,  415.071 does not constitute a violation of their rights of free speech.  Pp.  417 U. S. 821-828.
(a) A prison inmate retains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system, and here the restrictions on inmates' free speech rights must be balanced against the State's legitimate interest in confining prisoners 
Page 417 U. S. 818
 to deter crime, to protect society by quarantining criminal offenders for a period during which rehabilitative procedures can be applied, and to maintain the internal security of penal institutions.  Pp.  417 U. S. 822-824.
(b) Alternative means of communication remain open to the inmates; they can correspond by mail with persons (including media representatives), Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396; they have rights of visitation with family, clergy, attorneys, and friends of prior acquaintance; and they have unrestricted opportunity to communicate with the press or public through their prison visitors.  Pp.  417 U. S. 824-828.
2. The rights of the media appellants under the First and Fourteenth Amendments are not infringed by  415.071, which does not deny the press access to information available to the general public.  Newsmen, under California policy, are free to visit both maximum security and minimum security sections of California penal institutions and to speak with inmates whom they may encounter, and (unlike members of the general public) are also free to interview inmates selected at random.

Syllabus 
Under the Social Security Act, illegitimate children are deemed entitled to disability insurance benefits without any showing that they are, in fact, dependent upon their disabled parent if state law permits them to inherit from the wage-earner parent; if their illegitimacy results solely from formal, nonobvious defects in their parents' ceremonial marriage; or if they are legitimated in accordance with state law.  An illegitimate child unable to meet any of the foregoing conditions can qualify only if the disabled wage-earner parent contributed to the child's support or lived with him prior to the parent's disability, 42 U.S.C.  416(h)(3)(B); if the child is unable to meet any of the foregoing conditions, the statute bars the child's benefits without any opportunity to establish entitlement thereto.  Ramon Jimenez, a resident of Illinois (which does not allow nonlegitimated illegitimate children to inherit from their father), is a wage earner covered by the Act who became entitled to disability benefits in October, 1963.  Thereafter, Jimenez applied for insurance benefits for appellants, two of his nonlegitimated illegitimate children who were born after the onset of disability.  The claims were denied since the children did not meet the requirements of 42 U.S.C.  416(h)(3)(B) or the other qualifying provisions of the Act.  Appellants brought this action for review of the denial of benefits.  A three-judge District Court upheld the statutory classification as being rationally related to the proper governmental interest of avoiding spurious claims.
Held:  Title 42 U.S.C.  416(h)(3)(B), as part of the statutory scheme applicable to illegitimates, contravenes the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the equal protection of the laws guaranteed thereby.  Pp.  417 U. S. 631-638.
(a) ""[T]he Equal Protection Clause [is violated by] discriminatory

(b) The primary purpose of the contested provision of the Act is to provide support for dependents of a disabled wage earner and is not, as appellee contends, to replace only that support actually enjoyed before the onset of disability.  Pp.  417 U. S. 634-635.
(c) The complete statutory bar to disability benefits imposed upon nonlegitimated after-born illegitimates in appellants' position, is not reasonably related to the valid governmental interest of preventing spurious claims.  The potential for spurious claims is the same as to both.  Even if children might rationally be classified on the basis of whether they are dependent upon their disabled parents, the Act's definition of two subclasses of illegitimates is ""overinclusive"" in that it benefits some children who are legitimated, or entitled to inherit, or illegitimate solely because of a defect in the marriage of their parents, but who are not dependent on their disabled parent.  Conversely, the Act is ""underinclusive"" in that it conclusively excludes some illegitimates in appellants' subclass who are, in fact, dependent upon their disabled parent.  Pp.  417 U. S. 635-637.

Syllabus 
The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, which became effective May 1, 1971, makes parole under the general parole statute, 18 U.S.C.  4202, available for almost all narcotics offenders.  Respondent, who had been sentenced before May 1, 1971, and was ineligible for parole under 26 U.S.C.  7237(d), which was repealed by the 1970 Act, sought habeas corpus in the District Court, claiming parole eligibility when one-third of his sentence had been served.  The District Court denied relief on the ground that the prohibition on parole eligibility under 26 U.S.C.  7237(d) had been preserved by  1103(a) of the 1970 statute (which provides that ""[p]rosecutions"" for violations before May 1, 1971, shall not be affected by repeals of statutory provisions) and by the general saving clause, 1 U.S.C.  109 (which provides that ""[t]he repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute . . ."").  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. Section 1103(a) of the 1970 statute bars the Board of Parole from considering respondent for parole under 18 U.S.C.  4202, since parole eligibility, as a practical matter, is determined at the time of sentencing, and sentencing is a part of the concept of ""prosecution,"" saved by  1103(a), Bradley v. United States, 410 U. S. 605.  Pp.  417 U. S. 657-659.
2. The Board of Parole is also barred by the general saving clause from considering respondent for parole, since it is clear that Congress intended ineligibility for parole in  7237(d) to be treated as part of the offender's ""punishment,"" and therefore the prohibition against the offender's eligibility for parole under 18 U.S.C.  4202 is a ""penalty, forfeiture, or liability"" under the saving clause.

No. 73-718
Argued April 15, 1974
Decided June 19, 1974
417 U.S. 703

Syllabus 
In 1964, petitioner Bangor Punta Corp. (Bangor Punta), through its wholly owned subsidiary, petitioner Bangor Punta Operations, Inc., acquired 9.3% of the outstanding stock of respondent Bangor & Aroostook Railroad Co. (BAR), a Maine railroad, by purchasing all the assets of BAR's holding company, Bangor & Aroostook Corp. (B&A).  From 1964 to 1969, Bangor Punta controlled and directed BAR.  In 1969, Bangor Punta, again through its subsidiary, sold all its BAR stock to Amoskeag Co., which then assumed responsibility for BAR's management and later acquired additional shares to give it 99% ownership of the outstanding stock.  In 1971, BAR and its subsidiary filed an action against Bangor Punta and its subsidiary, alleging various acts of corporate mismanagement of BAR during the period of control from 1960 through 1967 by Bangor Punta and B&A, and seeking damages for violations of the federal antitrust and securities laws, the Maine Public Utilities Act, and the common law of Maine.  The District Court first noted that Amoskeag would be the principal beneficiary of any recovery, and was thus the real party in interest, and that, since Amoskeag had acquired its BAR stock long after the alleged wrongs had occurred, any recovery by it would be a windfall.  The District Court then dismissed the action on the ground that, since Amoskeag would have been barred from maintaining a shareholder derivative action due to its failure to satisfy the ""contemporaneous ownership"" requirement of both Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23.1(1), and state law, equitable principles precluded the use of the corporate fiction to evade that requirement.  The Court of Appeals reversed primarily on the ground that, in view of BAR's status as a ""public"" or ""quasi-public"" corporation and the important nature of the services it provides, any recovery by BAR would also inure to the public's benefit, a factor the court found to be sufficient to support a corporate cause of action and to render any windfall to Amoskeag irrelevant.
Held: 
Page 417 U. S. 704

1. The equitable principles that a stockholder, who has purchased all or substantially all the shares of a corporation from a vendor at a fair price, may not seek to have the corporation recover against that vendor for prior corporate mismanagement, and that the corporate entity may be disregarded if equity so demands, preclude respondent corporations from maintaining the action under either the federal antitrust and securities laws or state law.  Pp.  417 U. S. 710-713.
(a) Amoskeag, having purchased 98.3% of the stock of BAR from Bangor Punta and alleging no fraud, would have no standing in equity to maintain this action for alleged corporate mismanagement.  Home Fire Insurance Co. v. Barber, 67 Neb. 644, 93 N.W. 1024.  Pp.  417 U. S. 711-712;  417 U. S. 713-714.
(b) As the principal beneficiary of any recovery and itself estopped from complaining of petitioners' alleged wrongs, Amoskeag cannot avoid the command of equity through the guise of proceeding in the name of respondent corporations which it owns and controls.  Pp.  417 U. S. 711-712;  417 U. S. 713-714.
2. The Court of Appeals' assumption that any recovery would necessarily benefit the public is unwarranted, and also overlooks the fact that Amoskeag, the actual beneficiary of any recovery, would be unjustly enriched, since it has sustained no injury.  Neither the federal antitrust and securities laws nor the applicable state laws contemplate a windfall recovery by Amoskeag in these circumstances.  Pp.  417 U. S. 714-716.
3. Deterrence of railroad mismanagement is not, in itself, a sufficient ground for allowing respondents to recover.  If such deterrence were the only objective, it would suffice if any plaintiff were willing to file a complaint, and no injury or violation of a legal duty to the particular plaintiff would have to be alleged.  P.  417 U. S. 717.

(BAR), a Maine railroad, by purchasing all the assets of BAR's holding company, Bangor & Aroostook Corp. (B&A).  From 1964 to 1969, Bangor Punta controlled and directed BAR.  In 1969, Bangor Punta, again through its subsidiary, sold all its BAR stock to Amoskeag Co., which then assumed responsibility for BAR's management and later acquired additional shares to give it 99% ownership of the outstanding stock.  In 1971, BAR and its subsidiary filed an action against Bangor Punta and its subsidiary, alleging various acts of corporate mismanagement of BAR during the period of control from 1960 through 1967 by Bangor Punta and B&A, and seeking damages for violations of the federal antitrust and securities laws, the Maine Public Utilities Act, and the common law of Maine.  The District Court first noted that Amoskeag would be the principal beneficiary of any recovery, and was thus the real party in interest, and that, since Amoskeag had acquired its BAR stock long after the alleged wrongs had occurred, any recovery by it would be a windfall.  The District Court then dismissed the action on the ground that, since Amoskeag would have been barred from maintaining a shareholder derivative action due to its failure to satisfy the ""contemporaneous ownership"" requirement of both Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23.1(1), and state law, equitable principles precluded the use of the corporate fiction to evade that requirement.  The Court of Appeals reversed primarily on the ground that, in view of BAR's status as a ""public"" or ""quasi-public"" corporation and the important nature of the services it provides, any recovery by BAR would also inure to the public's benefit, a factor the court found to be sufficient to support a corporate cause of action and to render any windfall to Amoskeag irrelevant.
Held:

1. The equitable principles that a stockholder, who has purchased all or substantially all the shares of a corporation from a vendor at a fair price, may not seek to have the corporation recover against that vendor for prior corporate mismanagement, and that the corporate entity may be disregarded if equity so demands, preclude respondent corporations from maintaining the action under either the federal antitrust and securities laws or state law.  Pp.  417 U. S. 710-713.
(a) Amoskeag, having purchased 98.3% of the stock of BAR from Bangor Punta and alleging no fraud, would have no standing in equity to maintain this action for alleged corporate mismanagement.  Home Fire Insurance Co. v. Barber, 67 Neb. 644, 93 N.W. 1024.  Pp.  417 U. S. 711-712;  417 U. S. 713-714.
(b) As the principal beneficiary of any recovery and itself estopped from complaining of petitioners' alleged wrongs, Amoskeag cannot avoid the command of equity through the guise of proceeding in the name of respondent corporations which it owns and controls.  Pp.  417 U. S. 711-712;  417 U. S. 713-714.
2. The Court of Appeals' assumption that any recovery would necessarily benefit the public is unwarranted, and also overlooks the fact that Amoskeag, the actual beneficiary of any recovery, would be unjustly enriched, since it has sustained no injury.  Neither the federal antitrust and securities laws nor the applicable state laws contemplate a windfall recovery by Amoskeag in these circumstances.  Pp.  417 U. S. 714-716.
3. Deterrence of railroad mismanagement is not, in itself, a sufficient ground for allowing respondents to recover.  If such deterrence were the only objective, it would suffice if any plaintiff were willing to file a complaint, and no injury or violation of a legal duty to the particular plaintiff would have to be alleged.  P.  417 U. S. 717.

Syllabus 
Article 90(2) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (Code) provides for punishment of any person subject to the Code who ""willfully disobeys a lawful command of his superior commissioned officer""; Art. 133 punishes a commissioned officer for ""conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman""; and Art. 134 (the general article) punishes any person subject to the Code for, inter alia, ""all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces,"" though not specifically mentioned in the Code.  Appellee, an Army physician assigned to a hospital, was convicted by a general court-martial of violating Art. 90(2) for disobeying the hospital commandant's order to establish a training program for Special Forces aide men, and of violating Arts. 133 and 134 for making public statements urging Negro enlisted men to refuse to obey orders to go to Vietnam and referring to Special Forces personnel as ""liars and thieves,"" ""killers of peasants,"" and ""murderers of women and children.""  After his conviction was sustained within the military and he exhausted this avenue of relief, appellee sought habeas corpus relief in the District Court, challenging his conviction on the ground that both Art. 133 and Art. 134 are ""void for vagueness"" under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and overbroad in violation of the First Amendment.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Arts. 133 and 134 are void for vagueness, that, while appellee's conduct fell within an example of Art. 134 violations contained in the Manual for Courts-Martial, the possibility that the articles would be applied to others' future conduct as to which there was insufficient warning, or which was within the area of protected First Amendment expression, was enough to give appellee standing to challenge both articles on their face, and that the joint consideration of the Art. 90 charges gave rise to a ""reasonable possibility"" that appellee's right to a fair trial was prejudiced, so that a new trial was required.

1. Articles 133 and 134 are not unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  417 U. S. 752-757. 
Page 417 U. S. 734

(a) Each article has been construed by the United States Court of Military Appeals or by other military authorities, such as the Manual for Courts-Martial, so as to limit its scope, thus narrowing the very broad reach of the literal language of the articles, and at the same time supplying considerable specificity by way of examples of the conduct that they cover.  Pp.  417 U. S. 752-755.
(b) The articles are not subject to being condemned for specifying no standard of conduct at all, but are of the type of statutes which, ""by their terms or as authoritatively construed, apply without question to certain activities, but whose application to other behavior is uncertain,"" Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566,  415 U. S. 578.  Pp.  417 U. S. 755-756.
(c) Because of the factors differentiating military from civilian society, Congress is permitted to legislate with greater breadth and flexibility when prescribing rules for the former than when prescribing rules for the latter, and the proper standard of review for a vagueness challenge to Code articles is the standard that applies to criminal statutes regulating economic affairs, and that standard was met here, since appellee could have had no reasonable doubt that his statements urging Negro enlisted men not to go to Vietnam if ordered to do so was both ""unbecoming an officer and gentleman"" and ""to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces,"" in violation of Arts. 133 and 134, respectively.  Pp.  417 U. S. 756-757.
2. Nor are Arts. 133 and 134 facially invalid because of overbreadth.  Pp.  417 U. S. 757-761.
(a) Doctrines of First Amendment overbreadth asserted in support of challenges to imprecise language like that contained in Arts. 133 and 134 are not exempt from the operation of the principles that, while military personnel are not excluded from First Amendment protection, the fundamental necessity for obedience, and the consequent necessity for discipline, may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it.  Pp.  417 U. S. 758-759.
(b) There is a wide range of conduct to which Arts. 133 and 134 may be applied without infringing the First Amendment, and while there may be marginal applications in which First Amendment values would be infringed, this is insufficient to invalidate either article at appellee's behest.  His conduct in publicly urging enlisted personnel to refuse to obey orders which might send them into combat was unprotected under the most expansive notions of the First Amendment, and Arts. 133 and 134

 may constitutionally prohibit that conduct, and a sufficiently large number of similar or related types of conduct so as to preclude their invalidation for overbreadth.  Pp.  417 U. S. 760-761.
3. Appellee's contention that, even if Arts. 133 and 134 are constitutional, his conviction under Art. 90 should be invalidated because to carry out the hospital commandant's order would have constituted participation in a war crime and because the commandant gave the order, knowing it would be disobeyed, for the sole purpose of increasing appellee's punishment, is not of constitutional significance, and is beyond the scope of review, since such defenses were resolved against appellee on a factual basis by the court-martial that convicted him.

Petitioners, trustees of a railroad in a  77 reorganization proceeding, brought suit for freight charges against respondent shipper, and respondent counterclaimed for cargo loss and damage.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment for entry of one judgment on their claim and another on the counterclaim, but set off one judgment against the other, resulting in a net judgment against petitioners for some $11,000.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in allowing the setoff, since it thereby granted a preference to the claim of one creditor that happened to owe freight charges over other creditors that did not, and thus interfered with the Reorganization Court's duty under  77e, 11 U.S.C.  205(e), to approve a ""fair and equitable plan"" that duly recognizes the rights of each class of creditors and stockholders and does not discriminate unfairly in favor of any class.

Syllabus 
California has a disability insurance system for private employees temporarily disabled from working by an injury or illness not covered by workmen's compensation, under which an employee contributes to an Unemployment Compensation Disability Fund one percent of his salary up to an annual maximum of $85.  A disability lasting less than eight days is not compensable, except when the employee is hospitalized.  Benefits are not payable for a single disability exceeding 26 weeks.  A disability resulting from an individual's court commitment as a dipsomaniac, drug addict, or sexual psychopath is not compensable, nor are certain disabilities attributable to pregnancy.  Appellees, four women otherwise qualified under the program who have suffered employment disability because of pregnancies, only one of which was normal, challenged the pregnancy exclusion.  A three-judge District Court upheld their contention that the exclusion violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The court denied a motion to reconsider based on a state appellate court ruling, in which appellant who administers the program has acquiesced, confining the exclusion to only normal pregnancies.  The California program, in terms of the level of benefits and risks insured, is structured to maintain the solvency of the Disability Fund at a one-percent annual level of contribution.  The District Court acknowledged that coverage of disabilities resulting from normal pregnancies would entail substantial additional expense.  But it concluded that this increased cost could be accommodated through adjustments in the rate of employee contribution, the maximum benefits payable, ""and the other variables affecting the solvency of the program.""
Held:
1. The appellate ruling and administrative guidelines excluding only normal pregnancies have mooted the case as to the three appellees who had abnormal pregnancies and whose claims have now been paid.  Pp.  417 U. S. 491-492. 
Page 417 U. S. 485

2. California's decision not to insure under its program the risk of disability resulting from normal pregnancy does not constitute an invidious discrimination violative of the Equal Protection Clause.  The program does not discriminate with respect to the persons or groups eligible for its protection, and there is no evidence that it discriminates against any definable group or class in terms of the aggregate risk protection derived from the program.  The sole contention is the asserted underinclusiveness of the program's coverage as a result of the exclusion of disabilities resulting from normal pregnancy.  The State is not required by the Equal Protection Clause to sacrifice the self-supporting nature of the program, reduce the benefits payable for covered disabilities, or increase the maximum employee contribution rate just to provide protection against another risk of disability, such as normal pregnancy.

Syllabus 
Respondent, an American manufacturer based in Illinois, in order to expand its overseas operations, purchased from petitioner a German citizen, three enterprises owned by him and organized under the laws of Germany and Liechtenstein, together with all trademark rights of these enterprises.  The sales contract, which was negotiated in the United States, England, and Germany, signed in Austria, and closed in Switzerland, contained express warranties by petitioner that the trademarks were unencumbered and a clause providing that ""any controversy or claim [that] shall arise out of this agreement or the breach thereof"" would be referred to arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris, France, and that Illinois laws would govern the agreement and its interpretation and performance.  Subsequently, after allegedly discovering that the trademarks were subject to substantial encumbrances, respondent offered to rescind the contract, but when petitioner refused, respondent brought suit in District Court for damages and other relief, contending that petitioner's fraudulent representations concerning the trademark rights violated  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  Petitioner moved to dismiss the action or alternatively to stay the action pending arbitration, but the District Court denied the motion to dismiss and, as sought by respondent, preliminarily enjoined petitioner from proceeding with arbitration, holding, in reliance on Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427, that the arbitration clause was unenforceable.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The arbitration clause is to be respected and enforced by federal courts in accord with the explicit provisions of the United States Arbitration Act that an arbitration agreement, such as is here involved, ""shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.""  9 U.S.C.  1, 2.  Wilko v. Swan, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  417 U. S. 510-520.
(a) Since uncertainty will almost inevitably exist with respect to any contract, such as the one in question here, with substantial 
Page 417 U. S. 507
 contacts in two or more countries, each with its own substantive laws and conflict of laws rules, a contractual provision specifying in advance the forum for litigating disputes and the law to be applied is an almost indispensable precondition to achieving the orderliness and predictability essential to any international business transaction.  Such a provision obviates the danger that a contract dispute might be submitted to a forum hostile to the interests of one of the parties or unfamiliar with the problem area involved.  Pp.  417 U. S. 515-517.
(b) In the context of an international contract, the advantages that a security buyer might possess in having a wide choice of American courts and venue in which to litigate his claims of violations of the securities laws, become chimerical, since an opposing party may by speedy resort to  foreign court block or hinder access to the American court of the buyer's choice.  Pp.  417 U. S. 517-518.
(c) An agreement to arbitrate before a specified tribunal is, in effect, a specialized kind of forum selection clause that posits not only the situs of suit, but also the procedure to be used in resolving the dispute, and the invalidation of the arbitration clause in this case would not only allow respondent to repudiate its solemn promise but would, as well, reflect a ""parochial concept that all disputes must be resolved under our laws and in our courts.""

No. 73-781
Argued April 29, 1974
Decided June 17, 1974
417 U.S. 506

Syllabus 
Respondent, an American manufacturer based in Illinois, in order to expand its overseas operations, purchased from petitioner a German citizen, three enterprises owned by him and organized under the laws of Germany and Liechtenstein, together with all trademark rights of these enterprises.  The sales contract, which was negotiated in the United States, England, and Germany, signed in Austria, and closed in Switzerland, contained express warranties by petitioner that the trademarks were unencumbered and a clause providing that ""any controversy or claim [that] shall arise out of this agreement or the breach thereof"" would be referred to arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris, France, and that Illinois laws would govern the agreement and its interpretation and performance.  Subsequently, after allegedly discovering that the trademarks were subject to substantial encumbrances, respondent offered to rescind the contract, but when petitioner refused, respondent brought suit in District Court for damages and other relief, contending that petitioner's fraudulent representations concerning the trademark rights violated  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  Petitioner moved to dismiss the action or alternatively to stay the action pending arbitration, but the District Court denied the motion to dismiss and, as sought by respondent, preliminarily enjoined petitioner from proceeding with arbitration, holding, in reliance on Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427, that the arbitration clause was unenforceable.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The arbitration clause is to be respected and enforced by federal courts in accord with the explicit provisions of the United States Arbitration Act that an arbitration agreement, such as is here involved, ""shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.""  9 U.S.C.  1, 2.  Wilko v. Swan, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  417 U. S. 510-520.
(a) Since uncertainty will almost inevitably exist with respect to any contract, such as the one in question here, with substantial 
Page 417 U. S. 507
 contacts in two or more countries, each with its own substantive laws and conflict of laws rules, a contractual provision specifying in advance the forum for litigating disputes and the law to be applied is an almost indispensable precondition to achieving the orderliness and predictability essential to any international business transaction.  Such a provision obviates the danger that a contract dispute might be submitted to a forum hostile to the interests of one of the parties or unfamiliar with the problem area involved.  Pp.  417 U. S. 515-517.
(b) In the context of an international contract, the advantages that a security buyer might possess in having a wide choice of American courts and venue in which to litigate his claims of violations of the securities laws, become chimerical, since an opposing party may by speedy resort to  foreign court block or hinder access to the American court of the buyer's choice.  Pp.  417 U. S. 517-518.
(c) An agreement to arbitrate before a specified tribunal is, in effect, a specialized kind of forum selection clause that posits not only the situs of suit, but also the procedure to be used in resolving the dispute, and the invalidation of the arbitration clause in this case would not only allow respondent to repudiate its solemn promise but would, as well, reflect a ""parochial concept that all disputes must be resolved under our laws and in our courts.""

Syllabus 
Appellees, non-Indian employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), brought this class action claiming that the employment preference for qualified Indians in the BIA provided by the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 contravened the anti-discrimination provisions of the Equal Employment Opportunities Act of 1972, and deprived them of property rights without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  A three-judge District Court held that the Indian preference was implicitly repealed by  11 of the 1972 Act proscribing racial discrimination in most federal employment, and enjoined appellant federal officials from implementing any Indian employment preference policy in the BIA.
Held:
1. Congress did not intend to repeal the Indian preference, and the District Court erred in holding that it was repealed by the 1972 Act.  Pp.  417 U. S. 545-551.
(a) Since in extending general anti-discrimination machinery to federal employment in 1972, Congress in no way modified, and thus reaffirmed, the preferences accorded Indians by  701(b) and 703(i) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for employment by Indian tribes or by private industries located on or near Indian reservations, it would be anomalous to conclude that Congress intended to eliminate the longstanding Indian preferences in BIA employment, as being racially discriminatory.  Pp.  417 U. S. 547-548.
(b) In view of the fact that, shortly after it passed the 1972 Act, Congress enacted new Indian preference laws as part of the Education Amendments of 1972, giving Indians preference in Government programs for training teachers of Indian children, it is improbable that the same Congress condemned the BIA preference as racially discriminatory.  Pp.  417 U. S. 548-549. 
Page 417 U. S. 536

(c) The 1972 extension of the Civil Rights Act to Government employment being largely just a codification of prior anti-discrimination Executive Orders, with respect to which Indian preferences had long been treated as exceptions, there is no reason to presume that Congress affirmatively intended to erase such preferences.  P.  417 U. S. 549
(d) This is a prototypical case where an adjudication of repeal by implication is not appropriate, since the Indian preference is a longstanding, important component of the Government's Indian program, whereas the 1972 anti-discrimination provisions, being aimed at alleviating minority discrimination in employment, are designed to deal with an entirely different problem.  The two statutes, thus not being irreconcilable, are capable of coexistence, since the Indian preference, as a specific statute applying to a specific situation, is not controlled or nullified by the general provisions of the 1972 Act.  Pp.  417 U. S. 549-551.
2. The Indian preference does not constitute invidious racial discrimination in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, but is reasonable and rationally designed to further Indian self-government.  Pp.  417 U. S. 551-555.
(a) If Indian preference laws, which were derived from historical relationships and are explicitly designed to help only Indians, were deemed invidious racial discrimination, 25 U.S.C. in its entirety would be effectively erased and the Government's commitment to Indians would be jeopardized.  Pp.  417 U. S. 551-553.
(b) The Indian preference does not constitute ""racial discrimination"" or even ""racial"" preference, but is rather an employment criterion designed to further the cause of Indian self-government and to make the BIA more responsive to the needs of its constituent groups.  Pp.  417 U. S. 553-554.
(c) As long as the special treatment of Indians can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress' unique obligation toward Indians, such legislative judgments will not be disturbed.  Pp.  417 U. S. 554-555.

No. 72-1517
Argued January 15-16, 1974
Decided June 17, 1974
417 U.S. 556

Syllabus 
Petitioners, Negro citizens of Montgomery, Ala., brought this class action in 1958 to desegregate the city's public parks, and, in 1959, the District Court ordered the parks desegregated.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, and ordered the District Court to retain jurisdiction.  Thereafter, however, segregated recreational programs were continued by the city in cooperation with the YMCA, public swimming pools were closed allegedly to prevent the mixing of races, and recreational facilities in Negro neighborhoods were not maintained equally with those in white neighborhoods.  The petitioners by motion in 1970 reopened the litigation based on facts developed in Smith v. YMCA, 316 F.Supp. 899 (MD Ala.1970), in which relief was obtained against the ""coordinated effort"" of the city and the YMCA to perpetuate the segregated parks.  The claims raised by the 1970 motion were settled by agreement.  In 1971 the petitioners filed the ""Motion for Supplemental Relief,"" which forms the basis for the present phase of the litigation, complaining that the city was permitting racially segregated schools and other segregated private groups and clubs to use city parks and recreational facilities.  The District Court enjoined the city and its officials from permitting or sanctioning the use of city recreational facilities by any racially segregated private school or affiliated group, or by any private non-school group, club, or organization that has a racially discriminatory admissions policy.  The Court of Appeals sustained the injunction insofar as the use of city facilities by segregated private schools was ""exclusive"" and not in common with other citizens, but reversed the injunction as it applied to ""nonexclusive"" use by segregated private schools and to use by non-school groups.  The court found an insufficient threat to desegregated public education to support an injunction restraining nonexclusive use by private school groups, and no ""symbiotic relationship"" between the city and non-school groups so that the injunction impermissibly 
Page 417 U. S. 557
 intruded upon the freedom of association of citizens who were members of such groups.
Held:
1. The city was properly enjoined from permitting exclusive access to its recreational facilities by segregated private schools and by groups affiliated with such schools.  Pp.  417 U. S. 566-569.
(a) Using the term ""exclusive use"" as implying that an entire facility is exclusively and completely in the possession, control, and use of a private group, and as also implying, without mandating, a decisionmaking role for the city in allocating such facilities among private and public groups, the city's policy of allocating facilities to segregated private schools, in the context of the 1959 order and subsequent history, created, in effect, ""enclaves of segregation"" and deprived petitioners of equal access to parks and recreational facilities.  Pp.  417 U. S. 566-567.
(b) The exclusive use and control of city recreational facilities, however, temporary, by private segregated schools were little different from the city's agreement with the YMCA to run a ""coordinated"" but, in effect, segregated recreational program.  This use carried the brand of ""separate but equal,"" and, in the circumstances of this case, was properly terminated by the District Court.  Pp.  417 U. S. 567-568.
(c) More importantly, the city's policies operated directly to contravene an outstanding school desegregation order, and any arrangement, implemented by state officials at any level, that significantly tends to perpetuate a dual school system, in whatever manner, is constitutionally impermissible.  Pp.  417 U. S. 568-569.
2. On the record, it is not possible to determine whether the use of the city's recreational facilities by private school groups in common with others, and by private non-school organizations, involved the city so directly in the action of those users as to warrant court intervention on constitutional grounds.  Pp.  417 U. S. 569-574.
(a) The record does not contain sufficient facts upon which to predicate legal judgment as to whether certain uses of city facilities in common by private school groups or exclusively or in common by non-school groups contravened the parks desegregation order or the school desegregation order, or in some way constitute ""state action"" ascribing to the city the discriminatory actions of the groups in question.  P.  417 U. S. 570.
(b) The portion of the District Court's order prohibiting the mere use of city recreational facilities by any segregated ""private group, club or organization"" is invalid because it was not predicated

Syllabus 
On July 24, 1967, law enforcement officers interviewed respondent in connection with a murder that had occurred five days before and viewed his automobile, which was thought to have been used in the commission of the crime.  On October 10, in response to a previous request, respondent appeared at 10 a.m. for questioning at the office of the investigating authorities, having left his car at a nearby public commercial parking lot.  Though the police had secured a warrant for respondent's arrest at 8 a.m., respondent was not arrested until late in the afternoon, after which his car was towed to a police impoundment lot, where a warrantless examination the next day of the outside of the car revealed that a tire matched the cast of a tire impression made at the crime scene and that paint samples taken from respondent's car were not different from foreign paint on the fender of the victim's car.  Respondent was tried and convicted of the murder, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal.  In a subsequent habeas corpus proceeding, the District Court concluded that the seizure and examination of respondent's car violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and that the evidence obtained therefrom should have been excluded at the trial.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the scraping of paint from the car's exterior was a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment; that the search, which was not incident to respondent's arrest, was unconsented; and that the car's seizure could not be justified on the ground that the car was an instrumentality of the crime in plain view.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  417 U. S. 585-596.
476 F.2d 467, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST concluded that:
1. The examination of the exterior of respondent's automobile upon probable cause was reasonable, and invaded no right of privacy that the requirement of a search warrant is meant to protect.  Pp.  417 U. S. 588-592. 
Page 417 U. S. 584

(a) The primary object of the Fourth Amendment is the protection of privacy.  Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294,  387 U. S. 305-306.  P.  417 U. S. 589.
(b) Generally, less stringent warrant requirements are applied to vehicles than to homes or offices, Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132; Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42, and the search of a vehicle is less intrusive and implicates a lesser expectation of privacy.  Pp.  417 U. S. 589-591.
(c) The ""search"" in this case, concededly made on the basis of probable cause, infringed no expectation of privacy.  Pp.  417 U. S. 591-592.
2. Under the circumstances of this case, the seizure by impounding the car was not unreasonable.  Pp.  417 U. S. 592-596.
(a) The vehicle was seized from a public place, where access was not meaningfully restricted.  Chambers v. Maroney, supra, followed; Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, distinguished.  Pp.  417 U. S. 593-595.
(b) Exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless search of a vehicle are not limited to situations where probable cause is unforeseeable and arises only at the time of arrest.  Cf. Chambers, supra, at  399 U. S. 50-51.  Pp.  417 U. S. 595-596.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, being of the view that the inquiry of a federal court on habeas corpus review of a state prisoner's Fourth Amendment claim should be confined solely to the question whether the defendant had an opportunity in the state courts to raise that claim and have it adjudicated fairly, would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, since respondent does not contend that he was denied that opportunity. See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218,  412 U. S. 250 (POWELL, J., concurring).  P.  417 U. S. 596.

476 F.2d 467, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST concluded that:
1. The examination of the exterior of respondent's automobile upon probable cause was reasonable, and invaded no right of privacy that the requirement of a search warrant is meant to protect.  Pp.  417 U. S. 588-592. 
Page 417 U. S. 584

(a) The primary object of the Fourth Amendment is the protection of privacy.  Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294,  387 U. S. 305-306.  P.  417 U. S. 589.
(b) Generally, less stringent warrant requirements are applied to vehicles than to homes or offices, Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132; Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42, and the search of a vehicle is less intrusive and implicates a lesser expectation of privacy.  Pp.  417 U. S. 589-591.
(c) The ""search"" in this case, concededly made on the basis of probable cause, infringed no expectation of privacy.  Pp.  417 U. S. 591-592.
2. Under the circumstances of this case, the seizure by impounding the car was not unreasonable.  Pp.  417 U. S. 592-596.
(a) The vehicle was seized from a public place, where access was not meaningfully restricted.  Chambers v. Maroney, supra, followed; Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, distinguished.  Pp.  417 U. S. 593-595.
(b) Exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless search of a vehicle are not limited to situations where probable cause is unforeseeable and arises only at the time of arrest.  Cf. Chambers, supra, at  399 U. S. 50-51.  Pp.  417 U. S. 595-596.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, being of the view that the inquiry of a federal court on habeas corpus review of a state prisoner's Fourth Amendment claim should be confined solely to the question whether the defendant had an opportunity in the state courts to raise that claim and have it adjudicated fairly, would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, since respondent does not contend that he was denied that opportunity. See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218,  412 U. S. 250 (POWELL, J., concurring).  P.  417 U. S. 596.

417 U.S. 600

Syllabus 
Respondent, an indigent, while represented by court-appointed counsel, was convicted of forgery in state court in two separate cases, and his convictions were affirmed on his appeals of right by the North Carolina Court of Appeals.  In one case, he was denied appointment of counsel for discretionary review by the North Carolina Supreme Court, and in the other case, after that court had denied certiorari, was denied appointment of counsel to prepare a petition for certiorari to this Court.  Subsequently, Federal District Courts denied habeas corpus relief, but the United States Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to appointment of counsel both on his petition for review by the State Supreme Court and on his petition for certiorari in this Court.
Held:
1. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require North Carolina to provide respondent with counsel on his discretionary appeal to the State Supreme Court.  Pp.  417 U. S. 609-611.
(a) As contrasted with the trial stage of a criminal proceeding, a defendant appealing a conviction needs an attorney, not as a shield to protect him against being ""haled into court"" by the State and stripped of his presumption of innocence, but rather as a sword to upset the prior determination of guilt, the difference being significant since, while a State may not dispense with the trial stage without the defendant's consent, it need not provide any appeal at all.  Pp.  417 U. S. 610-611.
(b) The fact that an appeal has been provided does not automatically mean that the State then acts unfairly by refusing to provide counsel to indigent defendants at every stage of the way, but unfairness results only if the State singles out indigents and denies them meaningful access to the appellate system because of their poverty.  P.  417 U. S. 611.
2. Nor does the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment require North Carolina to provide free counsel for indigent defendants seeking discretionary appeals to the State Supreme Court.  Pp.  417 U. S. 611-616. 
Page 417 U. S. 601

(a) A defendant in respondent's circumstances is not denied meaningful access to the State Supreme Court simply because the State does not appoint counsel to aid him in seeking review in that court, since, at that stage, under North Carolina's multi-tiered appellate system, he will have, at the very least, a transcript or other record of the trial proceedings, a brief in the Court of Appeals setting forth his claims of error, and frequently an opinion by that court disposing of his case, materials which, when supplemented by any pro se submission that might be made, would provide the Supreme Court with an adequate basis for its decision to grant or deny review under its standards of whether the case has ""significant public interest,"" involves ""legal principles of major significance,"" or likely conflicts with a previous Supreme Court decision.  Pp.  417 U. S. 614-615.
(b) Both an indigent defendant's opportunity to have counsel prepare an initial brief in the Court of Appeals and the nature of the Supreme Court's discretionary review make the relative handicap that such a defendant may have in comparison to a wealthy defendant, who has counsel at every stage of the proceeding, far less than the handicap borne by an indigent defendant denied counsel on his initial appeal of right, Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353.  P.  417 U. S. 616.
(c) That a particular service might benefit an indigent defendant does not mean that the service is constitutionally required, the duty of the State not being to duplicate the legal arsenal that may be privately retained by a criminal defendant in a continuing effort to reverse his conviction, but only to assure the indigent defendant, as was done here, an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of the State's appellate process.  P.  417 U. S. 616.
3. Similarly, the Fourteenth Amendment does not require North Carolina to provide counsel for a convicted indigent defendant seeking to file a petition for certiorari in this Court, under circumstances where the State will have provided counsel for his only appeal as of right, and the brief prepared by such counsel together with one and perhaps two state appellate opinions will be available to this Court in order to decide whether to grant certiorari.  Pp.  417 U. S. 616-618.
(a) Since the right to seek discretionary review in this Court is conferred by federal statutes and not by any State, the argument that the State having once created a right of appeal must give all persons an equal opportunity to enjoy the right is, by 
Page 417 U. S. 602
 its terms, inapplicable.  Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, and Douglas v. California, supra, distinguished.  P.  417 U. S. 617.
(b) The suggestion that a State is responsible for providing counsel to an indigent defendant petitioning this Court simply because it initiated the prosecution leading to the judgment sought to be reviewed is unsupported by either reason or authority.  Pp.  417 U. S. 617-618.

No. 73-437
Argued April 17, 1974
Decided June 10, 1974*
417 U.S. 283

Syllabus 
The Federal Power Commission (FPC) instituted a proceeding in 1961 to establish an area rate structure for interstate sales of natural gas produced in the Southern Louisiana area.  After extensive hearings, the FPC in 1968 issued an order establishing ceiling rates for gas sold by producers in the area and ordering refunds of rates in excess of the maximum that had been collected prior to the order.  The Court of Appeals upheld the order, but declared that the affirmance was not to be interpreted to foreclose the FPC from making such changes in its order, as to both past and future rates, as it found to be in the public interest.  In response to petitions for rehearing urging that the FPC's authority to modify its order, after affirmance by the court, could be exercised only prospectively, the Court of Appeals stated that
""[w]e wish to make crystal clear the authority of the Commission in this case to reopen any part of its order that circumstances require be opened,""
that ""[t]he Commission can make retrospective as well as prospective adjustments in this case if it finds that it is in the public interest to do so,"" and that, if
""the refunds are too burdensome in light of new evidence to be in the public interest . . . , the Commission shall have the power and the duty to remedy the situation by changing its orders.""
The FPC thereupon reopened the 1961 proceeding, and, after considering a settlement proposal that had been agreed to by a large majority of the parties, issued an order in 1971 establishing a new rate structure for the Southern Louisiana area superseding the 1968 order.  This 1971 order established, inter alia, (1) higher ceiling rates for both ""flowing"" or ""first vintage"" gas (gas delivered after the order's effective date under contracts dated prior to 
Page 417 U. S. 284
 October 1, 1968), and ""new"" or ""second vintage"" gas (gas delivered after the order's effective date under contracts dated after October 1, 1968); (2) two incentive programs, one providing for refund workoff credits based on a refund obligor's commitment of additional gas reserves to the interstate market (the producer being required to offer at least 50% of the new reserves to the purchaser to whom the refund would otherwise be payable), and the other providing for contingent escalation of rates based on new dedications of gas to the market; (3) minimum rates to be paid by producers to pipelines for transportation of liquids and liquefiable hydrocarbons; and (4) a moratorium upon the filing of rate increases for flowing gas until October 1, 1976, and for new gas until October 1, 1977.  The Court of Appeals upheld this order as an appropriate exercise of administrative discretion supported by substantial evidence on the authority of Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747.
Held:
1. The FPC had the statutory authority to adopt the 1971 order, notwithstanding the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the 1968 order.  Pp.  417 U. S. 310-315.
(a) Under circumstances where the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the 1968 order was not ""unqualified"" or final, and such order had not been made effective, but was stayed until withdrawn in the 1971 order, the Court of Appeals' action in authorizing the FPC to reopen the 1968 order did not exceed the court's powers under  19(b) of the Natural Gas Act ""to affirm, modify, or set aside [an] order in whole or in part,"" or constitute an improper exercise of the court's equity powers with which it is vested in reviewing FPC orders.  Pp.  417 U. S. 310-312.
(b) The fact that the settlement proposal lacked unanimous agreement of the parties did not preclude the FPC from adopting the proposal as an order establishing just and reasonable rates, since the FPC clearly had the power to admit the agreement into the record, and indeed was obliged to consider it.  Pp.  417 U. S. 312-314.
(c) The fact that the Court of Appeals' opinion on rehearing regarding the 1968 order authorized modification of the 1968 refund provisions if the refunds ""are too burdensome in light of new evidence to be in the public interest"" did not require the FPC, before revising the refund terms, to find, based on substantial new evidence, that the refunds ""would substantially and adversely affect the producers' ability to meet the continuing gas needs of the interstate market,"" since the opinion on rehearing was explicit 
Page 417 U. S. 285
 that the FPC was to have ""great flexibility,"" and could make retrospective as well as prospective adjustments; moreover, the Court of Appeals flatly rejected
""the notion that the label 'affirmance' could possibly impair FPC's ability to alter or modify any of the provisions, particularly the refund provisions""
of the 1968 order.  Pp.  417 U. S. 314-315.
2. Petitioners' challenges to the established price levels under the 1971 order are without merit.  Pp.  417 U. S. 315-321.
(a) Mobil's attack on the FPC's evidence of costs is clearly frivolous, since the FPC took extensive evidence of costs in its 1968 order hearings for flowing gas and in both its 1968 and 1971 hearings for new gas, and since the fragments of the record cited by Mobil do not sustain its heavy burden of showing that the FPC's choice was outside what the Court of Appeals could have found to be within the FPC's authority.  P.  417 U. S. 316.
(b) With respect to Mobil's argument that inclusion of refund workoff credits and contingent escalations in the just and reasonable rates indicates that producers unable to gain part or all of their share of such payments will receive merely their ""bare-bones"" costs, which constitute illegally low prices, the Court of Appeals did not err in deciding that it was within the FPC's discretion and expertise to conclude that the refund workoff credits and contingent escalations could provide an opportunity for increased prices that would help in generating capital funds and in meeting rising costs, while assuring that such increases will not be levied upon consumers unless accompanied by increased supplies of gas.  Pp.  417 U. S. 316-319.
(c) New York's contention that the 1971 order rates for flowing gas are excessive is predicated on an erroneously limited view of the permissible range of the FPC's authority.  Where the FPC's justification for increasing the price of flowing gas was the necessity for increased revenues to expand future production, rather than new evidence of differing production conditions, the Court of Appeals, against the background of a serious and growing domestic gas shortage, could properly conclude that the FPC might reasonably decide that, as compared with adjustments in rate ceilings to induce more exploration and production, its responsibility to maintain adequate supplies at the lowest reasonable rate could better be discharged by means of contingent escalation and refund credits.  Pp.  417 U. S. 319-321.
3. The claims of all three petitioners, with respect to both the contingent escalations on flowing gas and the refund credits, that 
Page 417 U. S. 286
 even if the 1971 rates are sufficient to satisfy the Natural Gas Act's minimum requirements as to amount and, on the basis of the FPC's chosen methodology, are supported by substantial evidence, they are nevertheless unduly discriminatory and therefore unlawful under  4 and 5 of the Act, are also without merit.  Pp.  417 U. S. 321-327.
(a) Concerning Mobil's argument that undue discrimination results because producers who had not settled their refund obligations will receive advantages from the contingent escalations and refund credits that producers like Mobil, which did settle its obligations, will not receive, it cannot be said that the Court of Appeals misapprehended or grossly misapplied the substantial evidence standard in concluding that the FPC's assessment of the need for refund credits, compared to the costs and benefits of some other scheme, was adequately supported.  Pp.  417 U. S. 321-325.
(b) Though New York and MDG argue that the refund credit formula discriminates against pipeline purchasers because it permits producers to work off refunds by offering 50%, rather than 100%, of the new reserves to pipeline purchasers other than those owed the refunds, the Court of Appeals did not err in holding that the refund credit provision, the purpose of which was to increase the supply of gas, was within the FPC's discretion, since the FPC could reasonably conclude that the producers' incentive to explore for and produce new gas in the area, could result in their dedication of new reserves that would exceed in benefit the amount of the refunds.  P.  417 U. S. 325.
(c) With respect to New York's argument that some producers might abandon their normal business of exploring for and developing new reserves and yet enjoy the increase in their prices for flowing gas if other producers contribute substantial additional reserves, the FPC's belief that producers already operating in the area will continue to do so is at least an equally tenable judgment, and New York offered nothing to overcome the presumption of validity attaching to the exercise of the FPC's expertise.  Pp.  417 U. S. 326-327.
4. The Court of Appeals' conclusion, contrary to Mobil's contention, that the FPC's fixing of moratoria on new rate filings was supported by required findings of fact and by substantial evidence, did not misapprehend or grossly misapply the substantial evidence standard.  Pp.  417 U. S. 327-328.
5. Mobil's argument that the FPC improperly failed to provide automatic adjustments in area rates to compensate for anticipated 
Page 417 U. S. 287
 higher royalty costs, is hypothetical at this stage and, in any event, an affected producer is entitled to seek individualized relief.  P.  417 U. S. 328.
6. The Court of Appeals did not err in concluding that the FPC ""acted within the bounds of administrative propriety in abandoning"" as a pragmatic adjustment the distinction in maximum permissible rates between casinghead gas and gas-well gas so far as new dedications are concerned, even though casinghead gas was formerly treated as a byproduct of oil, and therefore costed and priced lower than gas-well gas.  Pp.  417 U. S. 328-330.
7. In arguing that the minimum rates provided by the 1971 order to be paid by producers to pipelines for transportation of liquids and liquefiable hydrocarbons are not supported by substantial evidence, Mobil has not met its burden of demonstrating that the Court of Appeals misapprehended or grossly misapplied the substantial evidence standard.  P.  417 U. S. 330.
483 F.2d 880, affirmed.
BRENNAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all Members joined except STEWART and POWELL, JJ., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the cases.

(a) Under circumstances where the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the 1968 order was not ""unqualified"" or final, and such order had not been made effective, but was stayed until withdrawn in the 1971 order, the Court of Appeals' action in authorizing the FPC to reopen the 1968 order did not exceed the court's powers under  19(b) of the Natural Gas Act ""to affirm, modify, or set aside [an] order in whole or in part,"" or constitute an improper exercise of the court's equity powers with which it is vested in reviewing FPC orders.  Pp.  417 U. S. 310-312.
(b) The fact that the settlement proposal lacked unanimous agreement of the parties did not preclude the FPC from adopting the proposal as an order establishing just and reasonable rates, since the FPC clearly had the power to admit the agreement into the record, and indeed was obliged to consider it.  Pp.  417 U. S. 312-314.
(c) The fact that the Court of Appeals' opinion on rehearing regarding the 1968 order authorized modification of the 1968 refund provisions if the refunds ""are too burdensome in light of new evidence to be in the public interest"" did not require the FPC, before revising the refund terms, to find, based on substantial new evidence, that the refunds ""would substantially and adversely affect the producers' ability to meet the continuing gas needs of the interstate market,"" since the opinion on rehearing was explicit 
Page 417 U. S. 285
 that the FPC was to have ""great flexibility,"" and could make retrospective as well as prospective adjustments; moreover, the Court of Appeals flatly rejected
""the notion that the label 'affirmance' could possibly impair FPC's ability to alter or modify any of the provisions, particularly the refund provisions""
of the 1968 order.  Pp.  417 U. S. 314-315.
2. Petitioners' challenges to the established price levels under the 1971 order are without merit.  Pp.  417 U. S. 315-321.
(a) Mobil's attack on the FPC's evidence of costs is clearly frivolous, since the FPC took extensive evidence of costs in its 1968 order hearings for flowing gas and in both its 1968 and 1971 hearings for new gas, and since the fragments of the record cited by Mobil do not sustain its heavy burden of showing that the FPC's choice was outside what the Court of Appeals could have found to be within the FPC's authority.  P.  417 U. S. 316.
(b) With respect to Mobil's argument that inclusion of refund workoff credits and contingent escalations in the just and reasonable rates indicates that producers unable to gain part or all of their share of such payments will receive merely their ""bare-bones"" costs, which constitute illegally low prices, the Court of Appeals did not err in deciding that it was within the FPC's discretion and expertise to conclude that the refund workoff credits and contingent escalations could provide an opportunity for increased prices that would help in generating capital funds and in meeting rising costs, while assuring that such increases will not be levied upon consumers unless accompanied by increased supplies of gas.  Pp.  417 U. S. 316-319.
(c) New York's contention that the 1971 order rates for flowing gas are excessive is predicated on an erroneously limited view of the permissible range of the FPC's authority.  Where the FPC's justification for increasing the price of flowing gas was the necessity for increased revenues to expand future production, rather than new evidence of differing production conditions, the Court of Appeals, against the background of a serious and growing domestic gas shortage, could properly conclude that the FPC might reasonably decide that, as compared with adjustments in rate ceilings to induce more exploration and production, its responsibility to maintain adequate supplies at the lowest reasonable rate could better be discharged by means of contingent escalation and refund credits.  Pp.  417 U. S. 319-321.
3. The claims of all three petitioners, with respect to both the contingent escalations on flowing gas and the refund credits, that 
Page 417 U. S. 286
 even if the 1971 rates are sufficient to satisfy the Natural Gas Act's minimum requirements as to amount and, on the basis of the FPC's chosen methodology, are supported by substantial evidence, they are nevertheless unduly discriminatory and therefore unlawful under  4 and 5 of the Act, are also without merit.  Pp.  417 U. S. 321-327.
(a) Concerning Mobil's argument that undue discrimination results because producers who had not settled their refund obligations will receive advantages from the contingent escalations and refund credits that producers like Mobil, which did settle its obligations, will not receive, it cannot be said that the Court of Appeals misapprehended or grossly misapplied the substantial evidence standard in concluding that the FPC's assessment of the need for refund credits, compared to the costs and benefits of some other scheme, was adequately supported.  Pp.  417 U. S. 321-325.
(b) Though New York and MDG argue that the refund credit formula discriminates against pipeline purchasers because it permits producers to work off refunds by offering 50%, rather than 100%, of the new reserves to pipeline purchasers other than those owed the refunds, the Court of Appeals did not err in holding that the refund credit provision, the purpose of which was to increase the supply of gas, was within the FPC's discretion, since the FPC could reasonably conclude that the producers' incentive to explore for and produce new gas in the area, could result in their dedication of new reserves that would exceed in benefit the amount of the refunds.  P.  417 U. S. 325.
(c) With respect to New York's argument that some producers might abandon their normal business of exploring for and developing new reserves and yet enjoy the increase in their prices for flowing gas if other producers contribute substantial additional reserves, the FPC's belief that producers already operating in the area will continue to do so is at least an equally tenable judgment, and New York offered nothing to overcome the presumption of validity attaching to the exercise of the FPC's expertise.  Pp.  417 U. S. 326-327.
4. The Court of Appeals' conclusion, contrary to Mobil's contention, that the FPC's fixing of moratoria on new rate filings was supported by required findings of fact and by substantial evidence, did not misapprehend or grossly misapply the substantial evidence standard.  Pp.  417 U. S. 327-328.
5. Mobil's argument that the FPC improperly failed to provide automatic adjustments in area rates to compensate for anticipated 
Page 417 U. S. 287
 higher royalty costs, is hypothetical at this stage and, in any event, an affected producer is entitled to seek individualized relief.  P.  417 U. S. 328.
6. The Court of Appeals did not err in concluding that the FPC ""acted within the bounds of administrative propriety in abandoning"" as a pragmatic adjustment the distinction in maximum permissible rates between casinghead gas and gas-well gas so far as new dedications are concerned, even though casinghead gas was formerly treated as a byproduct of oil, and therefore costed and priced lower than gas-well gas.  Pp.  417 U. S. 328-330.
7. In arguing that the minimum rates provided by the 1971 order to be paid by producers to pipelines for transportation of liquids and liquefiable hydrocarbons are not supported by substantial evidence, Mobil has not met its burden of demonstrating that the Court of Appeals misapprehended or grossly misapplied the substantial evidence standard.  P.  417 U. S. 330.
483 F.2d 880, affirmed.

Syllabus 
After being declared a delinquent, petitioner was ordered to report for induction pursuant to Selective Service regulations, which permitted the ordering of a declared delinquent to report for induction even though he had not been found acceptable for military service.  When petitioner did not report as ordered, he was prosecuted and convicted for failure to report for induction.  Following a remand by the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in the light of the intervening decision of this Court in Gutknecht v. United States, 396 U. S. 295, the District Court concluded that Gutknecht did not affect the conviction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  While petitioner's petition for certiorari was pending in this Court, the Court of Appeals decided United States v. Fox, 454 F.2d 593, wherein, on the authority of Gutknecht, that court reversed a conviction based on facts virtually identical to those on which petitioner's conviction was based.  This Court subsequently denied certiorari in the petitioner's case.  After beginning his sentence, petitioner brought this collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C.  2255, asserting that the Court of Appeals in the Fox case had effected a change in the law of the Ninth Circuit after affirmance of his conviction, and that the holding in Fox required that his conviction be set aside.  The District Court summarily denied relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that, because petitioner had unsuccessfully litigated the Gutknecht issue on direct review, the court's earlier affirmance was ""the law of the case,"" and precluded petitioner from securing relief under  2255 on the basis of an intervening change in law.
Held:
1.

Respondent operators of offstreet parking facilities in Pittsburgh, Pa. sued to enjoin the enforcement of a city ordinance imposing an increased 20% tax on the gross receipts from parking or storing automobiles at nonresidential parking places, alleging, inter alia, that the ordinance was invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The lower courts sustained the ordinance, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court invalidated it on the ground that the tax was so unreasonably high and burdensome that, in the context of competition from public lots operated by the city parking authority, which enjoyed certain tax exemptions and other advantages, the ordinance had the ""effect"" of an uncompensated taking of property contrary to the Due Process Clause.
Held:  The ordinance is not unconstitutional, and the city was constitutionally entitled to put the automobile parker to the choice of using other transportation or paying the increased tax.  Pp. 373-379

Syllabus 
Following its notice of proposed rulemaking ""propos[ing] prospectively to exempt from regulation under the Natural Gas Act all existing and all future jurisdictional sales made by small producers . . . ,"" and the filing of comments and informal conferences, the Federal Power Commission (FPC) issued Order No. 428, which exempted all existing and future sales by ""small producers"" from direct rate regulation, and provided that they could thereunder contract for the sale of their gas at any obtainable rates, without refund obligations with respect to increased rates, if any, collected for sales regulated thereunder to the pipelines.  The FPC asserted that the order did not amount to ""deregulation of sales by small producers,"" but was intended to regulate small producers' sales in the course of regulating the rates of pipeline and large producer customers of the small producers.  Pipelines purchasing from small producers above ceiling prices were to be allowed ""tracking increases"" in their rates, but those rates would be subject to refund
""with respect to new small producer sales, but only as to that part of the rate which is unreasonably high considering appropriate comparisons with highest contract prices for sales by large producers or the prevailing market price for intrastate sales in the same producing area.""
The FPC asserted its intention of reviewing small producer prices to maintain reasonable rates, and specified that small producers remain subject to  7(b) of the Natural Gas Act.  The Court of Appeals set aside the FPC order, holding that the small producer blanket certificate procedure contravened the FPC's statutory responsibilities under  4 and 5 of the Act to ensure ""just and reasonable rates.""  It viewed the order as merely calling for rates that were not unreasonably high as compared with the highest contract prices for large producer sales or the prevailing market price in the intrastate market, and 
Page 417 U. S. 381
 the court held unacceptable the possible contention that market prices themselves would produce just and reasonable rates.
Held:
1. The scheme for regulating small producer rates indirectly did not exceed the FPC's statutory authority.  Pp.  417 U. S. 386-393.
(a) Order No. 428 is not invalid because it does not initially consider each company and the reasonableness of its rates, or because it has a two-tier system for small producers and large producers.  Cf. Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747.  P.  417 U. S. 390.
(b) Since pipeline rates are subject to refund to the extent that the purchased gas component of their rates is excessive, there is an incentive ""to bargain prices down.""  Pp.  417 U. S. 390-391.
(c) Requiring the pipelines and the large producers to assume risks in bargaining for reasonable prices from small producers that might entail refunds unrecoverable from the small producers, is not an abuse of the FPC's discretion under  4(e) in balancing the interests involved.  Pp.  417 U. S. 391-392.
(d) It is premature to assert that the indirect regulation contemplated by Order No. 428 is confiscatory, especially since the FPC is to maintain a close review of the avowedly experimental scheme.  Pp.  417 U. S. 392-393.
2. But it is not clear from the wording of Order No. 428 that it satisfies the statutory requirement that the sale price for gas sold in interstate commerce be just and reasonable; at the least, the order is too ambiguous to satisfy the standard of clarity that an administrative order must exhibit, and the implication that the reasonableness of the small producers' rates would be judged by the assertion that the FPC ""would consider all relevant factors"" in determining whether the proposed rates comported with the ""public convenience and necessity,"" is insufficient to sustain the order.  Pp.  417 U. S. 394-397.
3. The FPC lacks authority to rely exclusively on market prices as the final measure of ""just and reasonable"" rates mandated by the Act; moreover, the FPC order made no finding as to the actual impact the market price increases would have on consumer gas expenditures.  Pp.  417 U. S. 397-399.

No. 762
Argued January 16, 1974
Decided June 10, 1974
417 U.S. 402

Syllabus 
Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1966 (the Act) provides for federal funding of special programs for educationally deprived children in both public and private schools.  Respondents, parents of children attending nonpublic schools in Kansas City, Mo., brought this class action, alleging that petitioner state school officials arbitrarily and illegally were approving Title I programs that deprived eligible nonpublic school children of services comparable to those offered eligible public school children, and seeking injunctive and other relief.  Petitioners answered that the aid sought by respondents exceeded Title I's requirements and contravened the State's Constitution and state law and public policy.  First Amendment issues were also raised.  The District Court denied relief.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that:  petitioners were violating the requirement of the Act and implementing regulations that educationally deprived nonpublic school children be afforded a program comparable to that provided in public schools; if ""on the premises"" special teaching services are furnished public school children, then comparable programs must be provided nonpublic school children; the state constitutional provision barring use of ""public"" school funds in private schools did not apply to Title I funds; the question whether Title I funds were ""public"" within the meaning of the State Constitution was governed by federal law; and, since no plan for ""on the premises"" instruction in nonpublic schools had yet been implemented, the court would refuse to pass on petitioners' claims that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment would be violated if Title I does require or permit such instruction.
Held:
1. At this stage of the proceedings, this Court cannot reach and decide whether Title I requires the assignment of publicly employed teachers to provide remedial instruction during regular school hours on the premises of private schools attended by Title I eligible students.  Pp.  417 U. S. 415-426.
(a) While the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the District Court erred in denying relief where it clearly appeared that 
Page 417 U. S. 403

P.  417 U. S. 415.
(b) That court erred in holding that federal law governed the question whether ""on the premises"" private school instruction is permissible under Missouri law, since Title I evinces a dear intention that state constitutional spending proscriptions not be preempted as a condition of accepting federal funds.  The key issue whether federal aid is money ""donated to any state fund for public school purposes"" within the meaning of the Missouri Constitution is purely a question of state, and not federal, law, and by characterizing the problem as one involving ""federal,"" and not ""state,"" funds, and then concluding that federal law governs, the Court of Appeals in effect nullified the Act's policy of accommodating state law.  Pp.  417 U. S. 415-419.
(c) It was unnecessary for the Court of Appeals to reach the issue whether ""on the premises"" nonpublic school instruction is permissible under state law, since, in view of the fact that Title I does not obligate the State to provide such instruction, but only to provide ""comparable"" (not identical) services, the illegality of such instruction under state law would not provide a defense to respondents' charge of noncompliance with Title I.  Pp.  417 U. S. 419-420.
(d) On remand, petitioners and the local school agency have the option to provide for ""on the premises"" instruction for nonpublic school children, but if they do not choose this method or if it turns out that state law prevents its use, then the following options remain:  (1) they may approve a plan that does not utilize nonpublic school ""on the premises"" instruction but that still complies with the Act's comparability requirement; (2) they may submit a plan that eliminates ""on the premises"" instruction in public schools and may resort, instead, to other means, such as neutral sites or summer programs; or (3) they may choose not to participate at all in the Title I program.  Pp.  417 U. S. 421-426.

3. While, under the Act, respondents are entitled to comparable services, and therefore to relief, they are not entitled to any particular form of service, and it is the role of state and local agencies,

			"|"Wheeler v. Barrera
No. 762
Argued January 16, 1974
Decided June 10, 1974
417 U.S. 402

Syllabus 
Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1966 (the Act) provides for federal funding of special programs for educationally deprived children in both public and private schools.  Respondents, parents of children attending nonpublic schools in Kansas City, Mo., brought this class action, alleging that petitioner state school officials arbitrarily and illegally were approving Title I programs that deprived eligible nonpublic school children of services comparable to those offered eligible public school children, and seeking injunctive and other relief.  Petitioners answered that the aid sought by respondents exceeded Title I's requirements and contravened the State's Constitution and state law and public policy.  First Amendment issues were also raised.  The District Court denied relief.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that:  petitioners were violating the requirement of the Act and implementing regulations that educationally deprived nonpublic school children be afforded a program comparable to that provided in public schools; if ""on the premises"" special teaching services are furnished public school children, then comparable programs must be provided nonpublic school children; the state constitutional provision barring use of ""public"" school funds in private schools did not apply to Title I funds; the question whether Title I funds were ""public"" within the meaning of the State Constitution was governed by federal law; and, since no plan for ""on the premises"" instruction in nonpublic schools had yet been implemented, the court would refuse to pass on petitioners' claims that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment would be violated if Title I does require or permit such instruction.
Held:
1. At this stage of the proceedings, this Court cannot reach and decide whether Title I requires the assignment of publicly employed teachers to provide remedial instruction during regular school hours on the premises of private schools attended by Title I eligible students.  Pp.  417 U. S. 415-426.
(a) While the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the District Court erred in denying relief where it clearly appeared that 
Page 417 U. S. 403
 petitioners had failed to comply with the Act's comparability requirement, the Court of Appeals' opinion is not to be read to the effect that petitioners must submit and approve plans that employ the use of Title I teachers on private school premises during regular school hours.  P.  417 U. S. 415.
(b) That court erred in holding that federal law governed the question whether ""on the premises"" private school instruction is permissible under Missouri law, since Title I evinces a dear intention that state constitutional spending proscriptions not be preempted as a condition of accepting federal funds.

No. 73-482
Argued March 20, 1974
Decided June 10, 1974
417 U.S. 433

Syllabus 
Respondent, who had been arrested for rape, was questioned by police.  Before the commencement of the interrogation (which antedated this Court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436), respondent was advised of his right to remain silent and his right to counsel (but not of his right to the appointment of counsel if he was indigent).  Respondent related an alibi that he was with a friend (Henderson), at the time of the crime, but the police later elicited from Henderson information tending to incriminate respondent.  Before trial, respondent made a motion to exclude Henderson's expected testimony because respondent had revealed Henderson's identity without having received the full warnings mandated by the intervening Miranda decision.  The motion was denied, Henderson testified, and respondent was convicted.  Following affirmance on appeal, respondent sought habeas corpus relief, which the District Court granted, finding that Henderson's testimony was inadmissible because of the Miranda violation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The police conduct in this case, though failing to afford respondent the full measure of procedural safeguards later set forth in Miranda, did not deprive respondent of his privilege against self-incrimination since the record clearly shows that respondent's statements during the police interrogation were not involuntary or the result of potential legal sanctions.  Pp.  417 U. S. 439-446.
2. The evidence derived from the police interrogation was admissible.  Pp.  417 U. S. 446-452.
(a) The police's pre-Miranda failure to advise respondent of his right to appointed counsel under all the circumstances of this case involved no bad faith, and would not justify recourse to the exclusionary rule, which is aimed at deterring willful or negligent deprivation of the accused's rights.  Pp.  417 U. S. 446-448.
(b) The failure to advise respondent of his right to appointed counsel had no bearing upon the reliability of Henderson's testimony, which was subjected to the normal testing process of an adversary trial.  Pp.  417 U. S. 448-449. 
Page 417 U. S. 434

(c) The use of the testimony of a witness discovered by the police as a result of the accused's statements under these circumstances does not violate any requirements under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments relating to the adversary system.  Pp.  417 U. S. 449-450.

No. 73-29
Argued March 25, 1974
Decided June 3, 1974*
417 U.S. 188

Syllabus 
Male employees at the Corning Glass Works (Corning) previously performed night shift inspection and were paid more than females, who performed the day shift inspection.  A plant-wide shift differential that subsequently came with unionization was superimposed on the existing base-wage difference between male night inspectors and female day inspectors.  Thereafter, beginning June 1, 1966, Corning began to open up night shift jobs for women, who, on an equal seniority basis with men, were able to bid for the higher paid night inspection jobs as vacancies occurred.  On January 20, 1969, a new ""job evaluation"" system for setting wage rates took effect, under which all subsequently hired inspectors were to receive the same base wage (which was higher than the previous night shift rate) regardless of sex or shift.  Employees hired before that date, however, when working night shift, were to continue to receive a higher (""red circle"") rate, thus perpetuating the previous differential in base pay between day and night inspectors.  The Secretary of Labor brought these actions for backpay and injunctive relief against Corning, claiming that violations of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 had occurred at its Corning, N.Y. (No. 73-29), and Wellsboro, Pa. (No. 73-695), plants.  In No. 73-29, the District Court granted relief, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that Corning's practice violated the Act, while the District Court in No. 73-695 held that the Act had not been violated, and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.  In order to establish a violation of the Act, it must be shown that an employer pays different wages to employees of opposite sexes
""for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, ""
Page 417 U. S. 189
except where the difference in payment is made pursuant to a seniority or merit system or one measuring earnings by quantity or quality of production, or where the differential is ""based on any other factor other than sex.""
Held:
1. Corning violated the Act during the period from its effective date to June, 1966.  Pp.  417 U. S. 195-205.
(a) The statutory term ""working conditions,"" as is clear from the Act's legislative history, encompasses only physical surroundings and hazards, and not the time of day worked.  Pp.  417 U. S. 197-204.
(b) The record amply supports the conclusion of the District Court in No. 73-29 that Corning had not sustained its burden of proof that the higher base wage for pre-June 1966 all-male night inspection work was, in fact, intended to serve as added compensation for night work, and thus was based on a ""factor other than sex.""  Substantial evidence showed that the differential arose simply because men would not work at the low rates paid women inspectors, and reflected a job market in which Corning could pay women less than men for the same work.  Pp.  417 U. S. 204-205.
2. Corning did not cure its violation in June, 1966, by permitting women to work as night shift inspectors, since the violation could not have been cured except by equalizing the base wages of female day inspectors with the higher rates paid the night inspectors.  Pp.  417 U. S. 205-208.
3. The violation was not cured in 1969, when Corning equalized day and night inspector wage rates, since the ""red circle"" rate perpetuated the discrimination.  Pp.  417 U. S. 208-210.

No. 73-346
Argued March 19, 1974
Decided June 3, 1974
417 U.S. 211

Syllabus 
For having conspired to cast fictitious votes for federal, state, and local candidates in a West Virginia primary election, petitioners were convicted of violating 18 U.S.C.  241, which makes it unlawful to conspire to injure any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.  At the trial, over petitioners' objections, certain statements made by two of the petitioners at a local election contest hearing held after the election results had been certified on May 27, 1970, were admitted in evidence against all the petitioners to prove that the two petitioners making the statements had perjured themselves at the election contest hearing.  On appeal, the petitioners contended for the first time that  241 was limited to conspiracies to cast false votes in federal elections, and that, accordingly, the conspiracy charged in their case, as far as federal jurisdiction was concerned, ended on May 27, so that subsequent out-of-court statements could not have furthered any  241 conspiracy, and hence should not have been admitted in evidence.  The Court of Appeals rejected these contentions, and affirmed the convictions.
Held:
1. The out-of-court statements were admissible under basic principles of the law of evidence and conspiracy, regardless of whether or not  241 encompasses conspiracies to cast fraudulent votes in state and local elections.  Pp.  417 U. S. 214-222.
(a) The statements were not hearsay, since they were not offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted; hence their admissibility was governed by the rule that acts of one alleged conspirator can be admitted into evidence against the other conspirators, if relevant to prove the existence of the conspiracy, even though they may have occurred after the conspiracy ended.  Lutwak v. United States, 344 U. S. 604.  Pp.  417 U. S. 219-221.
(b) Since the statements were not hearsay, the jury did not have to make a preliminary finding that the conspiracy charged 
Page 417 U. S. 212
 was still in progress before it could consider them as evidence against the other defendants, and accordingly the statements were admissible if relevant to prove the conspiracy charged.  P.  417 U. S. 221.
(c) Even if the federal conspiracy ended on May 27, the fact that two of the petitioners perjured themselves at the local election contest hearing was relevant and admissible to prove the underlying motive of the conspiracy.  Accordingly, in order to rule on petitioners' challenge to the admissibility of this evidence, there was no need for the Court of Appeals, and there is no need for this Court, to decide whether petitioners' conspiracy ended on May 27 for purposes of federal jurisdiction or whether  241 applies to conspiracies to cast fraudulent votes in local elections.  Pp.  417 U. S. 221-222.
2. The evidence amply supports the verdict that each of the petitioners engaged in the conspiracy with the intent of having false votes cast for the federal candidates.  Pp.  417 U. S. 222-228.
(a) The fact that petitioners' primary motive was to affect the result in the local, rather than the federal, election has no significance, since although a single conspiracy may have several purposes, if one of them -- whether primary or secondary -- violates a federal law, the conspiracy is unlawful under federal law.  Pp.  417 U. S. 225-226.
(b) That the petitioners may have had no purpose to change the outcome of the federal election is irrelevant, since that is not the specific intent required under  241, but rather the intent to have false votes cast, and thereby to injure the right of all voters in a federal election to have their expressions of choice given full value, without dilution or distortion by fraudulent balloting.  Pp.  417 U. S. 226-227.
(c) Even assuming, arguendo, that  241 is limited to conspiracies to cast false votes for federal candidates, it was not plain error for the District Court's jury instructions not to focus specifically upon the federal conspiracy, since, in view of the fact that the prosecution's case showed a single conspiracy to cast entire slates of false votes and the defense consisted primarily of a challenge to the Government witnesses' credibility, it is inconceivable that, even if charged by more specific instructions, the jury could have found a conspiracy to cast false votes for local offices without also finding a similar conspiracy affecting the federal offices.  Pp.  417 U. S. 227-228.
481 F.2d 685, affirmed.

1. The out-of-court statements were admissible under basic principles of the law of evidence and conspiracy, regardless of whether or not  241 encompasses conspiracies to cast fraudulent votes in state and local elections.  Pp.  417 U. S. 214-222.
(a) The statements were not hearsay, since they were not offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted; hence their admissibility was governed by the rule that acts of one alleged conspirator can be admitted into evidence against the other conspirators, if relevant to prove the existence of the conspiracy, even though they may have occurred after the conspiracy ended.  Lutwak v. United States, 344 U. S. 604.  Pp.  417 U. S. 219-221.
(b) Since the statements were not hearsay, the jury did not have to make a preliminary finding that the conspiracy charged 
Page 417 U. S. 212
 was still in progress before it could consider them as evidence against the other defendants, and accordingly the statements were admissible if relevant to prove the conspiracy charged.  P.  417 U. S. 221.
(c) Even if the federal conspiracy ended on May 27, the fact that two of the petitioners perjured themselves at the local election contest hearing was relevant and admissible to prove the underlying motive of the conspiracy.  Accordingly, in order to rule on petitioners' challenge to the admissibility of this evidence, there was no need for the Court of Appeals, and there is no need for this Court, to decide whether petitioners' conspiracy ended on May 27 for purposes of federal jurisdiction or whether  241 applies to conspiracies to cast fraudulent votes in local elections.  Pp.  417 U. S. 221-222.
2. The evidence amply supports the verdict that each of the petitioners engaged in the conspiracy with the intent of having false votes cast for the federal candidates.  Pp.  417 U. S. 222-228.
(a) The fact that petitioners' primary motive was to affect the result in the local, rather than the federal, election has no significance, since although a single conspiracy may have several purposes, if one of them -- whether primary or secondary -- violates a federal law, the conspiracy is unlawful under federal law.  Pp.  417 U. S. 225-226.
(b) That the petitioners may have had no purpose to change the outcome of the federal election is irrelevant, since that is not the specific intent required under  241, but rather the intent to have false votes cast, and thereby to injure the right of all voters in a federal election to have their expressions of choice given full value, without dilution or distortion by fraudulent balloting.  Pp.  417 U. S. 226-227.
(c) Even assuming, arguendo, that  241 is limited to conspiracies to cast false votes for federal candidates, it was not plain error for the District Court's jury instructions not to focus specifically upon the federal conspiracy, since, in view of the fact that the prosecution's case showed a single conspiracy to cast entire slates of false votes and the defense consisted primarily of a challenge to the Government witnesses' credibility, it is inconceivable that, even if charged by more specific instructions, the jury could have found a conspiracy to cast false votes for local offices without also finding a similar conspiracy affecting the federal offices.  Pp.  417 U. S. 227-228.

Argued March 19-20, 1974

Syllabus 
Petitioner purchased the assets of a restaurant and motor lodge under an agreement whereby the sellers, who had been operating the enterprises under franchises from petitioner, retained the real property and leased it to petitioner, and petitioner expressly did not assume any of the sellers' obligations, including those under any collective bargaining agreement.  Deciding to hire its own workforce to operate the enterprises, petitioner hired 45 employees, but only nine of the sellers' 53 former employees and none of the former supervisors.  Respondent Union, which had collective bargaining agreements with the sellers containing arbitration provisions, filed an action under  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, claiming that petitioner's failure to hire all the sellers' employees constituted a ""lockout"" in violation of the agreements and seeking injunctive relief and an order compelling petitioner and the sellers to arbitrate the extent of their obligations to the sellers' employees under the agreements.  The District Court held that petitioner was required to arbitrate, but denied the union's motion for a preliminary injunction requiring petitioner to hire all of the sellers' employees.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the order compelling petitioner to arbitrate.
Held:  Petitioner was not required to arbitrate with the union in the circumstances of this case, since there was plainly no substantial continuity of identity in the workforce hired by petitioner with that of the sellers, and no express or implied assumption of the agreement to arbitrate.  John Wiley & Sons v. Livingston, 376 U. S. 543, distinguished.  Petitioner had the right not to hire any of the sellers' employees, if it so desired, NLRB v. Burns Security Services, 406 U.

417 U.S. 116

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
Petitioner F. D. Rich Co., the prime contractor on a federal housing project in California, had two separate contracts for the project with Cerpac Co., one contract being for Cerpac to select, modify, detail, and install all custom millwork and the other being for Cerpac to supply all exterior plywood.  Cerpac, in turn, ordered the lumber called for under the plywood contract from respondent.  When Rich needed plywood for another project in South Carolina, one of the shipments called for by respondent's contract with Cerpac was diverted to South Carolina.  When Cerpac defaulted on its payments to respondent for the plywood, including the South Carolina shipment, respondent gave notice to Rich and its surety of a Miller Act claim, and thereafter brought suit in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of California, where the California project was located.  Finding that Cerpac was a ""subcontractor"" within the meaning of the Miller Act, rather than merely a materialman, that hence respondent could assert a Miller Act claim against Rich, and that venue for suit on the South Carolina as well as the California shipments properly lay, under 40 U.S.C.  270b(b), in the Eastern District of California, the District Court granted judgment for respondent for the amount due on the unpaid invoices, but denied its claim for attorneys' fees.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in large part, but held that attorneys' fees should be awarded respondent.
Held:
1. Based on the substantiality and importance of its relationship with the prime contractor, MacEvoy Co. v. United States ex rel. Tomkins Co., 322 U. S. 102, Cerpac was clearly a subcontractor for Miller Act purposes, considering not just its plywood contract, but also its custom millwork contract on the California project.  Moreover, Cerpac and Rich had closely interrelated management and financial structures, and their relationship on the California 
Page 417 U. S. 117
 project as the same as on many other similar projects; hence it would have been easy for Rich to secure itself from loss as a result of Cerpac's default.  Pp.  417 U. S. 121-124.

National Alfalfa Dehydrating & Milling Co.
No. 73-9
Argued January 14, 1974
Decided May 28, 1974
417 U.S. 134

Syllabus 
Respondent corporate taxpayer, pursuant to a recapitalization plan, issued $50 face value 5% sinking fund debentures in exchange for its outstanding unlisted $50 par 5% cumulative preferred shares, which at the time were quoted at approximately $33 per share on the over-the-counter market.  Based on the exchange, respondent claimed on its income tax returns for several years deductions for debt discount under  163(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which allows deductions for interest paid on indebtedness.  Respondent asserted that the debt discount, measured by the difference between a claimed $33 per share value for the preferred and the face amount of the debentures, amortized over the life of the debentures, constituted deductible interest within the purview of that provision.  The Commissioner disallowed the deductions, and was upheld by the Tax Court, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Respondent did not incur amortizable debt discount upon the issuance of its debentures in exchange for its outstanding preferred stock.  Pp.  417 U. S. 142-155.
(a) In determining whether debt discount arises in the situation presented here, the relevant inquiry must be whether the corporate taxpayer has incurred, as a result of the transaction, some cost or expense of acquiring the use of capital.  P.  417 U. S. 147.
(b) The propriety of a deduction does not turn upon general equitable considerations, such as a demonstration of effective economic and practical equivalence to what actually occurred, but rather ""depends upon legislative grace; and only as there is clear provision therefor can any particular deduction be allowed.""  New Colonial Co. v. Helvering, 292 U. S. 435,  292 U. S. 440.  Pp.  417 U. S. 147-149.
(c) This Court will not speculate as to what the market price and the investor reaction to any sales of the debentures or purchases of the preferred by respondent in the open market would have been, since there is nothing in the record to establish the cash price at which the debentures could have been sold upon the 
Page 417 U. S. 135

			"|"Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.
National Alfalfa Dehydrating & Milling Co.
No. 73-9
Argued January 14, 1974
Decided May 28, 1974
417 U.S. 134

Syllabus 
Respondent corporate taxpayer, pursuant to a recapitalization plan, issued $50 face value 5% sinking fund debentures in exchange for its outstanding unlisted $50 par 5% cumulative preferred shares, which at the time were quoted at approximately $33 per share on the over-the-counter market.  Based on the exchange, respondent claimed on its income tax returns for several years deductions for debt discount under  163(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which allows deductions for interest paid on indebtedness.  Respondent asserted that the debt discount, measured by the difference between a claimed $33 per share value for the preferred and the face amount of the debentures, amortized over the life of the debentures, constituted deductible interest within the purview of that provision.  The Commissioner disallowed the deductions, and was upheld by the Tax Court, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Respondent did not incur amortizable debt discount upon the issuance of its debentures in exchange for its outstanding preferred stock.  Pp.  417 U. S. 142-155.
(a) In determining whether debt discount arises in the situation presented here, the relevant inquiry must be whether the corporate taxpayer has incurred, as a result of the transaction, some cost or expense of acquiring the use of capital.  P.  417 U. S. 147.
(b) The propriety of a deduction does not turn upon general equitable considerations, such as a demonstration of effective economic and practical equivalence to what actually occurred, but rather ""depends upon legislative grace; and only as there is clear provision therefor can any particular deduction be allowed.""  New Colonial Co. v. Helvering, 292 U. S. 435,  292 U. S. 440.  Pp.  417 U. S. 147-149.
(c) This Court will not speculate as to what the market price and the investor reaction to any sales of the debentures or purchases of the preferred by respondent in the open market would have been, since there is nothing in the record to establish the cash price at which the debentures could have been sold upon the 
Page 417 U. S. 135
 market or to indicate that respondent would have been able to purchase all its outstanding preferred on the open market, or at what price that stock would have been purchased in light of the impending exchange; moreover, when a corporation issues to its preferred shareholders its own new debt obligations in exchange for the outstanding preferred, the claimed fair market value of both securities is somewhat artificial, since the exchange is effectively insulated from market forces.  Pp.  417 U. S. 149-151.
(d) Absent any evidence that the difference between the claimed $33 per share of the preferred and the face amount of the debentures is attributable to debt discount or that the discount rate was determined by such factors as respondent's financial condition at the time of the exchange and the availability and cost of capital in the general market as well as from the preferred shareholders, rather than simply having been predicated on the preferred's par value, the requisite evaluation of the property to be exchanged cannot occur, and debt discount cannot be determined . P.  417 U. S. 151.

No. 73-203
Argued February 25, 1974
Decided May 28, 1974
417 U.S. 156

Syllabus 
Petitioner brought a class action under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23 on behalf of himself and all odd-lot traders on the New York Stock Exchange for a certain four-year period, charging respondent brokerage firms, which handled 99% of the Exchange's odd-lot business, and respondent Exchange with violating the antitrust and securities laws.  There followed a series of decisions by the District Court and the Court of Appeals.  The District Court ultimately decided that the suit could be maintained as a class action, and, after finding that some two and a quarter million members of the prospective class could be identified by name and address with reasonable effort and that it would cost $225,000 to send individual notice to all of them, proposed a notification scheme providing for individual notice to only a limited number of prospective class members and notice by publication to the remainder.  The District Court then held a preliminary hearing on the merits, and after finding that petitioner was ""more than likely"" to prevail at trial, ruled that respondents should bear 90% of the costs of the notification scheme.  The Court of Appeals reversed and ordered the suit dismissed as a class action, disapproving the District Court's partial reliance on publication notice.  The Court of Appeals held that Rule 23(c)(2) required individual notice to all identifiable class members; that the District Court had no authority to hold a preliminary hearing on the merits for the purpose of allocating notice costs; that the entire notice expense should fall on petitioner; and that the proposed class action was unmanageable under Rule 23(b)(3)(D).  Petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to review the District Court's orders, and further, that the Court of Appeals decided the above issues incorrectly.
Held:
1. The District Court's resolution of the notice problems constituted a ""final"" decision within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1291, and was therefore appealable as of right under that section.  Pp.  417 U. S. 169-172.
(a) Section 1291 does not limit appellate review to ""those 
Page 417 U. S. 157
 final judgments which terminate an action . . . ,"" but rather the requirement of finality is to be given a ""practical, rather than a technical construction.""  Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541,  337 U. S. 545-546.  Pp.  417 U. S. 170-172.
(b) The District Court's decision that respondents could lawfully be required to bear the costs of notice involved a collateral matter unrelated to the merits of petitioner's claims and was ""a final disposition of a claimed right which is not an ingredient of the cause of action, and does not require consideration with it,"" Cohen, supra, at  337 U. S. 546-547.  P.  417 U. S. 172.
2. The District Court's resolution of the notice problems failed to comply with the notice requirement of Rule 23(c)(2).  Pp.  417 U. S. 173-177.
(a) The express language and intent of Rule 23(c)(2) leave no doubt that individual notice must be sent to all class members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Here there was nothing to show that individual notice could not be mailed to each of the two and a quarter million class members whose names and addresses were easily ascertainable, and, for these class members, individual notice was clearly the ""best notice practicable"" within the meaning of Rule 23(c)(2).  Pp.  417 U. S. 173-175.
(b) The facts that the cost of sending individual notices would be prohibitively high to petitioner, who has only a $70 stake in the matter, or that individual notice might be unnecessary because no prospective class member has a large enough stake to justify separate litigation of his individual claim, do not dispense with the individual notice requirement, since individual notice to identifiable class members is not a discretionary consideration to be waived in a particular case, but an unambiguous requirement of Rule 23.  Pp.  417 U. S. 175-176.
(c) Adequate representation, in itself, does not satisfy Rule 23(c)(2), since the Rule speaks to notice, as well as to adequacy of representation, and requires that both be provided.  Otherwise no notice at all, published or otherwise, would be required in this case.  Pp.  417 U. S. 176-177.
3. Petitioner must bear the cost of notice to the members of his class, and it was improper for the District Court to impose part of the cost on respondents.  Pp.  417 U. S. 177-179.
(a) There is nothing in either the language or history of Rule 23 that gives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether 
Page 417 U. S. 158
 it may be maintained as a class action, and, indeed, such a procedure contravenes the Rule by allowing a representative plaintiff to secure the benefits of a class action without first satisfying the requirements of the Rule.  Pp.  417 U. S. 177-178.
(b) A preliminary determination of the merits may substantially prejudice a defendant, since it is unaccompanied by the traditional rules and procedures applicable to civil trials.  P.  417 U. S. 178.
(c) Where, as here, the relationship between the parties is truly adversary, the plaintiff must pay for the cost of notice as part of the ordinary burden of financing his own suit.  Pp.  417 U. S. 178-179.

After finding that Heck's Inc. had engaged in pervasive unfair labor practices, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued a cease and desist order against it, but rejected the argument of respondent union, the charging party, for additional remedies, including reimbursement of litigation expenses and excess organizational costs incurred as a result of Heck's illegal conduct.  The Court of Appeals enforced the NLRB's order but remanded the case to the NLRB for further consideration of additional remedies.  The NLRB again refused to order reimbursement of litigation expenses and excess organizational costs, reasoning that its ""orders must be remedial, not punitive, and collateral losses are not considered in framing a reimbursement order,"" and that the Board, not the charging party, is entrusted with primary responsibility to protect the public interest.  The Court of Appeals enforced the NLRB's amended order but, concluding that the NLRB 
Page 417 U. S. 2
 had meanwhile in Tiidee Products, Inc., 194 N.L.R.B. 1234, changed its policy, enlarged the NLRB's order by requiring Heck's to ""[p]ay to the Union any extraordinary organizational cost which the Union incurred by reason of Heck's policy of resisting organizational efforts and refusing to bargain"" and to ""[p]ay to the Board and the Union the costs and expenses incurred by them"" in connection with the litigation.  Sections 10(e) and (f) of the National Labor Relations Act authorize courts of appeals to ""make and enter a decree . . . modifying and enforcing as so modified"" an NLRB order.
Held:  The Court of Appeals, although properly refusing to resolve inconsistencies in the Board's decisions in this case and in Tiidee by accepting Board counsel's rationalizations, erroneously exercised its authority under  10(e) and (f), since it was ""incompatible with the orderly function of the process of judicial review"" (NLRB v.

Syllabus 
When respondent unions called a jurisdictional dispute strike against petitioner employer, petitioner brought this suit, which is within the purview of  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, in a Florida trial court to enjoin respondents' breach of a no-strike clause in the collective bargaining agreement containing a binding settlement procedure.  That court issued a temporary restraining order against the strike, and its action was upheld by an intermediate appellate court.  The Florida Supreme Court reversed, holding that, since the unions' breach was also arguably an unfair labor practice under  8(b)(4)(i)(D) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) involving jurisdictional disputes, the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) was exclusive.
Held:
1. When the activity in question is arguably both an unfair labor practice prohibited by  8 of the NLRA and a breach of a collective bargaining agreement, the NLRB's authority ""is not exclusive, and does not destroy the jurisdiction of the courts in suits under  301.""  Smith v. Evening News Assn., 371 U. S. 195,  371 U. S. 197.  Pp.  417 U. S. 15-18.
(a) The preemption doctrine of San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, is ""not relevant"" to actions within the purview of  301, which may be brought in either state or federal courts.  P.  417 U. S. 16.
(b) NLRB policy is to refrain from exercising jurisdiction as to conduct which is arguably both an unfair labor practice and a contract violation when, as here, the parties have voluntarily established by contract a binding settlement procedure.  P.  417 U. S. 16.
(c) When the particular contract violations also involve an arguable violation of  8(b)(4)(i)(D), the NLRB has recognized added policy justifications for deferring to the contractual dispute settlement mechanism, as indicated by  10(k) of the NLRA, which, by its special procedure for NLRB resolution of charges 
Page 417 U. S. 13
 involving jurisdictional disputes ""not only tolerates, but actually encourages,"" settlements of such disputes.  Pp.  417 U. S. 17-18.

When respondent unions called a jurisdictional dispute strike against petitioner employer, petitioner brought this suit, which is within the purview of  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, in a Florida trial court to enjoin respondents' breach of a no-strike clause in the collective bargaining agreement containing a binding settlement procedure.  That court issued a temporary restraining order against the strike, and its action was upheld by an intermediate appellate court.  The Florida Supreme Court reversed, holding that, since the unions' breach was also arguably an unfair labor practice under  8(b)(4)(i)(D) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) involving jurisdictional disputes, the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) was exclusive.
Held:
1. When the activity in question is arguably both an unfair labor practice prohibited by  8 of the NLRA and a breach of a collective bargaining agreement, the NLRB's authority ""is not exclusive, and does not destroy the jurisdiction of the courts in suits under  301.""  Smith v. Evening News Assn., 371 U. S. 195,  371 U. S. 197.  Pp.  417 U. S. 15-18.
(a) The preemption doctrine of San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, is ""not relevant"" to actions within the purview of  301, which may be brought in either state or federal courts.  P.  417 U. S. 16.
(b) NLRB policy is to refrain from exercising jurisdiction as to conduct which is arguably both an unfair labor practice and a contract violation when, as here, the parties have voluntarily established by contract a binding settlement procedure.  P.  417 U. S. 16.
(c) When the particular contract violations also involve an arguable violation of  8(b)(4)(i)(D), the NLRB has recognized added policy justifications for deferring to the contractual dispute settlement mechanism, as indicated by  10(k) of the NLRA, which, by its special procedure for NLRB resolution of charges 
Page 417 U. S. 13
 involving jurisdictional disputes ""not only tolerates, but actually encourages,"" settlements of such disputes.  Pp.  417 U. S. 17-18.
2. State court jurisdiction over collective bargaining disputes does not turn upon the particular type of relief sought, and therefore is not limited to claims for damages, rather than injunctive relief.  Pp.  417 U. S. 18-20.
279 So.2d 300, reversed and remanded.

417 U.S. 21

Syllabus 
Respondent, a North Carolina prison inmate, had an altercation with another prisoner, and was charged with the misdemeanor of assault with a deadly weapon, of which he was convicted in the State District Court.  While respondent's subsequent appeal was pending in the Superior Court, where he had the right to a trial de novo, the prosecutor obtained an indictment covering the same conduct for the felony offense of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and inflict serious bodily injury, to which respondent pleaded guilty.  Thereafter, respondent applied for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, claiming, inter alia, that the felony indictment deprived him of due process.  The District Court granted the writ, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The indictment on the felony charge contravened the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since a person convicted of a misdemeanor in North Carolina is entitled to pursue his right under state law to a trial de novo without apprehension that the State will retaliate by substituting a more serious charge for the original one and thus subject him to a significantly increased potential period of incarceration.  Cf. North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711.  Pp.  417 U. S. 24-29.
2. Since North Carolina, having chosen originally to proceed against respondent on the misdemeanor charge in the State District Court, was precluded by the Due Process Clause from even prosecuting respondent for the more serious charge in the Superior Court, respondent's guilty plea to the felony charge did not bar him from raising his constitutional claim in the federal habeas corpus proceeding.

No. 73-5280
Argued March 26, 1974
Decided May 20, 1974
417 U.S. 40

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who pleaded guilty to a crime and was given a probationary sentence, conditioned upon his complying with a jail work-release program permitting him to attend college and also upon his reimbursing the county for the fees and expenses of an attorney and investigator whose services had been provided him because of his indigency, attacks the constitutionality of Oregon's recoupment statute, which was upheld on appeal.  That law requires convicted defendants who are indigent at the time of the criminal proceedings against them but who subsequently acquire the financial means to do so, to repay the costs of their legal defense.  Defendants with no likelihood of having the means to repay are not even conditionally obligated to do so, and those thus obligated are not subjected to collection procedures until their indigency has ended and no manifest hardship will result.
Held:
1. The Oregon recoupment scheme does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  417 U. S. 46-50.
(a) The statute retains all the exemptions accorded to other judgment debtors, in addition to the opportunity to show that recovery of legal defense costs will impose ""manifest hardship.""  James v. Strange, 407 U. S. 128, distinguished.  Pp.  417 U. S. 46-48.
(b) The statutory distinction between those who are convicted, on the one hand, and those who are not or whose convictions are reversed, on the other, is not an invidious classification, since the Legislative decision not to impose a repayment obligation on a defendant forced to submit to criminal prosecution that does not end in conviction is objectively rational.  Pp.  417 U. S. 48-50.
2. The Oregon law does not infringe upon a defendant's right to counsel, since the knowledge that he may ultimately have to repay the costs of legal services does not affect his ability to obtain such services.  The challenged statute is thus not similar to a provision that ""chill[s] the assertion of constitutional rights by penalizing those who choose to exercise them,"" United States v. Jackson, 390 U.

416 U.S. 802

Syllabus 
Appellee union and the individual appellees, who attempted from June, 1966, to June, 1967, to unionize farmworkers and persuade them to support or join a strike, were subjected to persistent harassment and violence by appellants and other law enforcement officers.  In July, 1967, a state court issued a temporary injunction against appellees proscribing picketing on or near property of one of the major employers in the area.  Appellees brought this federal civil rights action, 42 U.S.C.  1983, 1985, attacking the constitutionality of certain Texas statutes and alleging that appellants and the other officers conspired to deprive appellees of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  A three-judge District Court declared five of the statutes unconstitutional and enjoined their enforcement, and in addition permanently enjoined appellants and the other officers from intimidating appellees in their organizational efforts.
Held:
1. The state court injunction did not moot the controversy, since it was the appellants' and the other officers' conduct, not the injunction, that ended the strike.  Nor has the case become moot because appellees abandoned their unionization efforts as a result of the harassment, for appellee union still is a live organization with a continuing goal of unionizing farmworkers.  Pp.  416 U. S. 809-811.
2. The portion of the District Court's decree enjoining police intimidation of the appellees was an appropriate exercise of the court's equitable powers.  Pp.  416 U. S. 811-816.
(a) The three-judge court could properly consider the question of police harassment under concededly constitutional statutes and grant relief in the exercise of jurisdiction ancillary to that conferred by the constitutional attack on the statutes that plainly required a three-judge court.  Pp.  416 U. S. 811-812.
(b) This portion of the decree did not interfere with pending state prosecutions, so that special considerations relevant to cases like Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, do not apply, nor was there any requirement that appellees first exhaust state remedies before bringing their federal suit.  P.  416 U. S. 814.
(c) Irreparable injury was shown as evidenced by the District Court's unchallenged findings of police intimidation, and no remedy at law would adequately protect appellees from such intimidation in their lawful effort to unionize the farmworkers.  Pp.  416 U. S. 814-815.
(d) Where there is a persistent pattern of police misconduct, as opposed to isolated incidents, injunctive relief is appropriate.  Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496.  Pp.  416 U. S. 815-816.
3. The portion of the District Court's decree holding five of the state statutes unconstitutional with accompanying injunctive relief must be vacated.  Pp.  416 U. S. 816-820.
(a) Where three of the statutes have been repealed and replaced by more narrowly drawn provisions since the District Court's decision, and there are no pending prosecutions under them, the judgment relating to these statutes will have become moot.  Since it cannot be definitely determined from the District Court's opinion or the record whether there are pending prosecutions, or even whether the District Court intended to enjoin them if there were, the case is remanded for further findings.  If there are no pending prosecutions, the court should vacate the judgment as to the superseded statutes.  If some are pending, the court should make findings as to whether they were brought in bad faith, and, if so, enter an appropriate decree subject to review both as to the propriety of federal court intervention and as to the merits of any holding striking down the statutes.  Pp.  416 U. S. 818-820.
(b) The case is remanded for a determination as to whether there are pending prosecutions under the two remaining statutes, and for further findings and reconsideration in light of Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S. 452.  If there are pending prosecutions, the court should determine whether they were brought in bad faith.  If there are only threatened prosecutions and only declaratory relief is sought, then Steffel controls and no Younger showing need be made.  P.  416 U. S. 820.

416 U.S. 653

Syllabus 
Following discharge of petitioners, managers of meat departments in respondent Food Fair's stores, because of their union membership, the union filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board, which were dismissed on the ground that the protection of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) did not extend to ""supervisors"" like petitioners.  Thereupon petitioners brought suit in state court, under  95-83 of North Carolina's right-to-work law.  The trial court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment.  On the ground that enforcing the state law in favor of petitioners was barred by the second clause of  14(a) of the NLRA (""no employer . . . shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining""), the State Supreme Court ultimately upheld that ruling.
Held:  The second clause of  14(a) applies to any law requiring an employer to accord to supervisors like petitioners, who are ""the front line of management,"" the ""anomalous status of employees,"" and enforcement of the North Carolina law would thus flout the national policy against compulsion upon employers from either federal or state authorities to treat supervisors as employees.

On the ground that enforcing the state law in favor of petitioners was barred by the second clause of  14(a) of the NLRA (""no employer . . . shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining""), the State Supreme Court ultimately upheld that ruling.
Held:  The second clause of  14(a) applies to any law requiring an employer to accord to supervisors like petitioners, who are ""the front line of management,"" the ""anomalous status of employees,"" and enforcement of the North Carolina law would thus flout the national policy against compulsion upon employers from either federal or state authorities to treat supervisors as employees.  Pp.  416 U. S. 656-662.
282 N.C. 530, 193 S.E.2d 911, affirmed.

No. 73-157
Argued January 7, 1974
Decided May 15, 1974
416 U.S. 663

Syllabus 
A pleasure yacht, which appellee had leased to Puerto Rican residents, was seized, pursuant to Puerto Rican statutes providing for forfeiture of vessels used for unlawful purposes, without prior notice to appellee or the lessees and without a prior adversary hearing, after authorities had discovered marihuana aboard her.  Appellee was neither involved in nor aware of a lessee's wrongful use of the yacht.  Appellee then brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the statutory scheme.  A three-judge District Court, relying principally on Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U. S. 67, held that the statutes' failure to provide for pre-seizure notice and hearing rendered them unconstitutional, and that, as applied to forfeit appellee's interest in the yacht, they unconstitutionally deprived an innocent party of property without just compensation.
Held:
1. The statutes of Puerto Rico are ""State statute[s]"" for purposes of the Three-Judge Court Act, and hence a three-judge court was properly convened under that Act, and direct appeal to this Court was proper under 28 U.S.C.  1253.  Pp.  416 U. S. 669-676.
2. This case presents an ""extraordinary"" situation in which postponement of notice and hearing until after seizure did not deny due process, since (1) seizure under the statutes serves significant governmental purposes by permitting Puerto Rico to assert in rem jurisdiction over the property in forfeiture proceedings, thereby fostering the public interest in preventing continued illicit use of the property and in enforcing criminal sanctions; (2) pre-seizure notice and hearing might frustrate the interests served by the statutes, the property seized often being of the sort, as here, that could be removed from the jurisdiction, destroyed, or concealed, if advance notice were given; and (3), unlike the situation in Fuentes v. Shevin, supra, seizure is not initiated by self-interested private parties, but by government officials.  Pp.  416 U. S. 676-680. 
Page 416 U. S. 664

3. Statutory forfeiture schemes are not rendered unconstitutional because of their applicability to the property interests of innocents, and here the Puerto Rican statutes, which further punitive and deterrent purposes, were validly applied to appellee's yacht.  Pp.  416 U. S. 680-690.

Syllabus 
The District Court on May 26, 1971, awarded to the successful plaintiff petitioners, Negro parents and guardians, in this protracted litigation involving the desegregation of the Richmond, Virginia, public schools, expenses and attorneys' fees for services rendered from March 10, 1970, to January 29, 1971.  On March 10, 1970, petitioners had moved in the District Court for additional relief under Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, 391 U. S. 430, in which this Court held that a freedom of choice plan (like the one previously approved for the Richmond schools) was not acceptable where methods promising speedier and more effective conversion to a unitary school system were reasonably available.  Respondent School Board then conceded that the plan under which it had been operating was not constitutional.  After considering a series of alternative and interim plans, the District Court on April 5, 1971, approved the Board's third proposed plan, and the order allowing fees followed shortly thereafter.  Noting the absence of any explicit statutory authorization for such an award in this type of case, the court predicated its ruling on the grounds (1) that actions taken and defenses made by the School Board during the relevant period resulted in an unreasonable delay in desegregation of the schools, causing petitioners to incur substantial expenditures to secure their constitutional rights, and (2) that plaintiffs in actions of this kind were acting as ""private attorneys general,"" Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400,  390 U. S. 402, in leading the School Board into compliance with the law, thus effectuating the constitutional guarantees of nondiscrimination.  The Court of Appeals reversed, stressing that,
""if such awards are to be made to promote the public policy expressed in legislative action, they should be authorized by Congress, and not by the courts.""
Following initial submission of the case to the Court of Appeals, but before its decision, Congress enacted  718 of the Education Amendments of 1972, which granted a federal court authority to award the prevailing party a 
Page 416 U. S. 697
 reasonable attorney's fee when appropriate upon entry of a final order in a school desegregation case, the applicability of which to this and other litigation the court then considered.  In the other cases, the court held that  718 did not apply to services rendered prior to July 1, 1972, the effective date of  718, and, in this case, reasoned that there were no orders pending or appealable on either May 26, 1971, when the District Court made its fee award, or on July 1, 1972, and that, therefore,  718 could not be used to sustain the award.
Held:  Section 718 can be applied to attorneys' services that were rendered before that provision was enacted in a situation, like the one here involved, where the propriety of the fee award was pending resolution on appeal when the statute became law.  Pp.  416 U. S. 710-724.
(a) An appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, Thorpe v. Housing Authority of the City of Durham, 393 U. S. 268,  393 U. S. 281, unless such application would work a manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.  Pp.  416 U. S. 711-716.
(b) Such injustice could result ""in mere private cases between individuals,"" United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103,  5 U. S. 110, the determinative factors being the nature and identity of the parties, the nature of their rights, and the nature of the impact of the change in law upon those rights.  Upon consideration of those aspects here (see infra, (c)-(e)), it cannot be said that the application of the statute would cause injustice.  Pp.  416 U. S. 716-721.
(c) There was a disparity in the respective abilities of the parties to protect themselves, and the litigation did not involve merely private interests.  Petitioners rendered substantial service to the community and to the Board itself by bringing it into compliance with its constitutional mandate, and thus acting as a ""private attorney general"" in vindicating public policy.  Pp.  416 U. S. 718-719.
(d) Application of  718 does not affect any matured or unconditional rights, the School Board having no unconditional right to the funds allocated to it by the taxpayers.  P.  416 U. S. 720.
(e) No increased burden was imposed, since the statute did not alter the Board's constitutional responsibility for providing pupils with a nondiscriminatory education, and there is no change in the substantive obligation of the parties.  Pp.  416 U. S. 720-721.
(f) The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that  718 was inapplicable to the petitioners' request for fees because there was no final order pending unresolved on appeal, since the language of  718 is not to be read to mean that a fee award must be made 
Page 416 U. S. 698

(g) Since the District Court made an allowance for services to January 29, 1971, when petitioners were not yet the ""prevailing party"" within the meaning of  718, the fee award should be recomputed to April 5, 1971, or thereafter.  Pp.  416 U. S. 723-724.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a private university, was notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), pursuant to a newly announced policy of denying tax-exempt status for private schools with racially discriminatory admissions policies, that it was going to revoke a ruling letter declaring that petitioner qualified for tax-exempt status under  501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code).  Petitioner sued for injunctive relief to prevent revocation, alleging irreparable injury in the form of income tax liability and loss of contributions and claiming that the revocation would violate petitioner's rights to free exercise of religion, to free association, and to due process and equal protection of the laws.  The District Court granted relief despite  7421(a) of the Code, which provides that ""no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.""  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  7421(a), as construed in Enochs v. Williams Packing & Navigation Co., 370 U. S. 1, foreclosed relief.  Under that decision, a pre-enforcement injunction against tax assessment or collection may be granted only if (1) ""it is clear that under no circumstances could the Government ultimately prevail . . ."" and (2) ""if equity jurisdiction otherwise exists.""
Held:
1. The suit is one ""for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax"" within the meaning of  7421(a).  Pp.  416 U. S. 738-742.
(a) Petitioner's allegation that revocation of the ruling letter would subject it to ""substantial"" income tax liability demonstrates that a primary purpose of the suit is to prevent the IRS from assessing and collecting income taxes; but even if no income tax liability resulted, the suit would still be one to restrain the assessment and collection of federal social security and unemployment taxes, as well as to restrain the collection of taxes from petitioner's donors.  Pp.  416 U. S. 738-739. 
Page 416 U. S. 726

(b) Petitioner has not shown that the contemplated revocation of its ruling letter is not based on the IRS' good faith effort to enforce the technical requirements of the Code.  Pp.  416 U. S. 739-741.
2. Petitioner's contention that  7421(a) is subject to judicially created exceptions other than the Williams Packing test is without merit.  That decision constitutes an all-encompassing reading of  7421(a), and it rejected the contention, relied upon by petitioner, that irreparable injury alone is sufficient to lift the statutory bar.

3. Denying injunctive relief to petitioner under the standards of William Packing, supra, will not, because of alleged irreparable injury pending resort to alternative remedies, deny petitioner due process of law, since this is not a case where an aggrieved party has no access at all to judicial review.

Syllabus 
Respondent, a nonprofit corporation, had a ruling letter assuring it of tax-exempt status under  501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code).  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) revoked the ruling letter on the ground that respondent had violated the lobbying proscriptions of  501(c)(3) and 170 of the Code, the effect of which was to render it liable for federal unemployment taxes and to terminate its eligibility for tax-deductible contributions.  Respondent and two of its benefactors brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that the IRS' administration of the lobbying provisions of  501(c)(3) and 170 was erroneous or unconstitutional and injunctive relief requiring reinstatement of its  501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground, inter alia, that the action was barred by the prohibition in  7421(a) of the Code against suits ""for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.""  The Court of Appeals agreed that the action could not be maintained by the benefactors, but held that respondent's suit was not barred on the grounds that respondent raised constitutional allegations; that the primary design of the suit was not to enjoin the assessment or collection of respondent's own taxes; that restraining the assessment or collection of the taxes of respondent's contributors was only a ""collateral effect"" of this suit; and that, in the absence of injunctive relief, respondent would sustain irreparable injury for which there was no adequate legal remedy.  The court consequently affirmed the dismissal as to the benefactors but reversed as to respondent.
Held:  The action is barred by  7421(a).  Enochs v. Williams Packing & Navigation Co., 370 U. S. 1; Bob Jones University v. Simon, ante, p.  416 U. S. 725.  Pp.  416 U. S. 758-763.
(a) The constitutional nature of a taxpayer's claim, as distinct from its probability of success, is of no consequence under  7421(a).  Pp.  416 U. S. 759-760. 
Page 416 U. S. 753

(b) That respondent was not seeking to enjoin the assessment or collection of its own taxes is irrelevant, for  7421(a) bars a suit to enjoin the assessment or collection of anyone's taxes.  P.  416 U. S. 760.
(c) Under any reasonable construction of the statutory term ""purpose,"" the objective of this action was to restrain the assessment and collection of taxes from respondent's contributors, the purpose being to restore advance assurance that donations to respondent would qualify as charitable deductions for respondent's donors.

			"|"Alexander v. ""Americans United,"" Inc.
No. 72-1371
Argued January 7, 1974
Decided May 15, 1974
416 U.S. 752

Syllabus 
Respondent, a nonprofit corporation, had a ruling letter assuring it of tax-exempt status under  501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code).  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) revoked the ruling letter on the ground that respondent had violated the lobbying proscriptions of  501(c)(3) and 170 of the Code, the effect of which was to render it liable for federal unemployment taxes and to terminate its eligibility for tax-deductible contributions.  Respondent and two of its benefactors brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that the IRS' administration of the lobbying provisions of  501(c)(3) and 170 was erroneous or unconstitutional and injunctive relief requiring reinstatement of its  501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground, inter alia, that the action was barred by the prohibition in  7421(a) of the Code against suits ""for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.""  The Court of Appeals agreed that the action could not be maintained by the benefactors, but held that respondent's suit was not barred on the grounds that respondent raised constitutional allegations; that the primary design of the suit was not to enjoin the assessment or collection of respondent's own taxes; that restraining the assessment or collection of the taxes of respondent's contributors was only a ""collateral effect"" of this suit; and that, in the absence of injunctive relief, respondent would sustain irreparable injury for which there was no adequate legal remedy.  The court consequently affirmed the dismissal as to the benefactors but reversed as to respondent.
Held:  The action is barred by  7421(a).  Enochs v. Williams Packing & Navigation Co., 370 U. S. 1; Bob Jones University v. Simon, ante, p.  416 U. S. 725.  Pp.  416 U. S. 758-763.
(a) The constitutional nature of a taxpayer's claim, as distinct from its probability of success, is of no consequence under  7421(a).  Pp.  416 U. S. 759-760. 
Page 416 U. S. 753

(b) That respondent was not seeking to enjoin the assessment or collection of its own taxes is irrelevant, for  7421(a) bars a suit to enjoin the assessment or collection of anyone's taxes.  P.  416 U. S. 760.
(c) Under any reasonable construction of the statutory term ""purpose,"" the objective of this action was to restrain the assessment and collection of taxes from respondent's contributors, the purpose being to restore advance assurance that donations to respondent would qualify as charitable deductions for respondent's donors.  Pp.  416 U. S. 760-761.
(d) An action for refund of unemployment taxes, even if successful, will not lead to the recovery of contributions lost in the interim between withdrawal of a  501(c)(3) ruling letter and the final adjudication of entitlement to  501(c)(3) status.  This is, however, merely a form of irreparable injury, which, in itself, is insufficient to avoid the bar of  7421(a).  Pp.  416 U. S. 761-762.
(e) An action for refund of unemployment taxes will afford respondent a full opportunity to litigate the legality of the IRS' withdrawal of its  501(c)(3) ruling letter, since respondent's liability for such taxes hinges on precisely the same legal issue as does its eligibility for tax-deductible contributions under  170, i.e., its entitlement to  501(c)(3) status.

No. 73-5412
Argued March 26, 1974
Decided May 15, 1974
416 U.S. 783

Syllabus 
In this action (brought initially by appellant Dillard, and in which appellant Williams was allowed to intervene) Williams claimed that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevented Virginia from permitting suspension of workmen's compensation benefits as a result of a claimed change in condition without notice to the claimant and a prior adversary hearing.  The District Court rejected the constitutional claim on the merits.
Held:  If, as indicated in the briefs and oral arguments in this Court, state law permits a claimant whose benefits have been suspended to have them reinstated by the state trial courts, which act in a purely ministerial capacity, pending a full administrative hearing before the State Industrial Commission on the merits of his claim, it was probably unnecessary to address the federal constitutional question.  Accordingly, the case must be remanded to the District Court for reconsideration.  Pp.  416 U. S. 784-798.

416 U.S. 470

Syllabus 
Harshaw Chemical Co., an unincorporated division of petitioner, over a period of years, developed certain processes in the growth and encapsulation of synthetic crystals and purification of raw materials, some of which processes were considered to be trade secrets; it eventually succeeded for the first time in growing a 17-inch crystal of a type useful in the detection of ionizing radiation.  The individual respondents, former employees of Harshaw who. while working there. had signed agreements not to disclose trade secrets obtained as employees, formed or later joined respondent Bicron Corp., which competed with Harshaw in producing crystals; Bicron, soon after its formation, also grew a 17-inch crystal.  Petitioner brought this diversity action seeking injunctive relief and damages for misappropriation of trade secrets.  The District Court, applying Ohio trade secret law, granted a permanent injunction.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that Ohio's trade secret law conflicted with the federal patent laws.
Held:  Ohio's trade secret law is not preempted by the federal patent laws.  Pp.  416 U. S. 474-493.
(a) The States are not forbidden to protect the kinds of intellectual property that may make up the subject matter of trade secrets; just as the States may exercise regulatory power over writings, Goldstein v. California, 412 U. S. 546, so may they regulate with respect to discoveries, the only limitation being that regulation in the area of patents and copyrights must not conflict with the operation of federal laws in this area.  Pp.  416 U. S. 478-479.
(b) Abolition of trade secret protection would not result in increased disclosure to the public of discoveries in the area of nonpatentable subject matter, and the public would not be benefited by disclosure of such discoveries.  Pp.  416 U. S. 482 483.
(c) The federal patent policy of encouraging invention is not disturbed by the existence of another form of incentive to invention such as trade secret protection, and, in this respect, the two systems are not in conflict.  P.  416 U. S. 484.
(d) Nor is the patent policy that matter once in the public domain must remain there incompatible with the existence of trade secret protection.  P.  416 U. S. 484. 
Page 416 U. S. 471

(e) Nor is there any conflict between trade secret law and the patent policy of disclosure whether a trade secret concerning patentable subject matter is in the category of discovery which is (1) clearly unpatentable, (2) doubtfully patentable, or (3) clearly patentable.  As to the first category, the patent alternative is not available, and trade secret law will encourage invention and prompt the innovator to proceed with the discovery and exploitation of his invention, and to license others to exploit secret processes.  As to the second category, the risk and cost of eventual patent invalidity may impel the inventor not to seek patent protection regardless of the existence of trade secret law, and the encouragement by the elimination of trade secret protection of patent applications by some with doubtfully patentable inventions is likely to have a deleterious effect on society and patent policy.  As to the third category, trade secret law, which affords weaker protection than the patent laws, presents no reasonable risk of deterrence from patent application.  Pp.  416 U. S. 484-491.
(f) There being no real possibility that trade secret law will conflict with federal patent policy, partial preemption as to clearly patentable inventions would not be appropriate, and could well unnecessarily burden administration of trade secret law by States.  Pp.  416 U. S. 491-492.

No. 73-641
Argued April 16, 1974
Decided May 13, 1974
416 U.S. 500

Syllabus 
Petitioner Edwin A. Snow, who had advanced part of the capital in a partnership formed in 1966 to develop a special purpose incinerator and had become a limited partner, was disallowed a deduction under  174(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, on his individual income tax return for that year for his pro rata share of the partnership's operating loss.  Though there were no sales in 1966, expectations were high and the inventor-partner was giving about a third of his time to the project, an outside engineering firm doing the shopwork.  The Tax Court and the Court of Appeals both upheld disallowance of the deduction, which  174(a)(1) provides for
""experimental expenditures which are paid or incurred by [the taxpayer] during the taxable year in connection with his trade or business as expenses which are not chargeable to capital account.""
Held:  It was error to disallow the deduction, which was ""in connection with"" petitioner's trade or business, and the disallowance was contrary to the broad legislative objective of the Congress when it enacted  174 to provide an economic incentive, especially for small and growing businesses, to engage in the search for new products and new inventions.

416 U.S. 505

Syllabus 
Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 provides in 18 U.S.C.  2516(1) that
""the Attorney General, or any Assistant Attorney General specially designated by the Attorney General, may authorize an application to a Federal judge . . . for . . . an order authorizing or approving the interception of wire or oral communications""
by federal investigative agencies seeking evidence of certain designated offenses; and further provides that the contents of intercepted communications, or evidence derived therefrom, may not be received in evidence at a trial if the disclosure of the information would violate Title III, 18 U.S.C.  2515, and may be suppressed on the ground, inter alia, that the communication was ""unlawfully intercepted,"" 18 U.S.C.  2518(10)(a)(i).  In this case, an application purportedly authorized by a specially designated Assistant Attorney General for an order permitting the wiretap of the telephone of respondent Giordano, a narcotics offense suspect, was submitted to the Chief Judge of the District Court, who then issued an interception order and later an extension order based on a similar application, but also including information obtained from the previously authorized interception and extending the authority to conversations of additional named individuals calling to or from Giordano's telephone.  The interception was terminated when Giordano and the other respondents were arrested and charged with narcotics violations.  During suppression hearings, it developed that the wiretap applications had not, in fact, been authorized by a specially designated Assistant Attorney General, but that the initial application was authorized by the Attorney General's Executive Assistant and the extension application had been approved by the Attorney General himself.  The District Court sustained the motions to suppress on the ground that the Justice Department officer approving each application had been misidentified in the applications and intercept orders.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but on the ground that the initial authorization violated  2516(1), thereby requiring suppression of the wiretap 
Page 416 U. S. 506
 and derivative evidence under  2515 and 2518(10)(a)(i), inter alia.
Held:
1. Congress did not intend the power to authorize wiretap applications to be exercised by any individuals other than the Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General specially designated by him.  Pp.  416 U. S. 512-523.
(a) Notwithstanding 28 U.S.C.  510, which authorizes the Attorney General to delegate any of his functions to any other officer, employee, or agency of the Justice Department,  2516(1), fairly read, was intended to limit the power to authorize wiretap applications to the Attorney General himself and to any Assistant Attorney General he might designate.  Pp.  416 U. S. 512-514.
(b) This interpretation of  2516(1) is strongly supported by the purpose of the Act effectively to prohibit all interceptions of oral and wire communications except those specifically provided for, and by its legislative history.  Pp.  416 U. S. 514-523.
2. Primary or derivative evidence secured by wire interceptions pursuant to a court order issued in response to an application which was, in fact, not authorized by the Attorney General or a specially designated Assistant Attorney General must be suppressed under  2515 upon a motion properly made under  2518(10)(a), and hence the evidence obtained from the interceptions pursuant to the initial court order was properly suppressed.  Pp.  416 U. S. 524-529.
(a) Under  2518(10)(a)(i) the words ""unlawfully intercepted"" are not limited to constitutional violations, but the statute was intended to require suppression where there is a failure to satisfy any of those statutory requirements that directly and substantially implement the congressional intention to limit the use of intercept procedures to those situations clearly calling for the employment of this extraordinary investigative device.  Pp.  416 U. S. 524-528.
(b) Since Congress intended to condition the use of intercept procedures upon the judgment of a senior Justice Department official that the situation is one of those warranting their use, thus precluding resort to wiretapping in various situations where investigative personnel would otherwise seek intercept authority from the court and the court would very likely authorize its use, it is evident that the provision for pre-application approval was intended to play a central role in the statutory scheme and that suppression must follow when it is shown that this statutory requirement has been ignored.  Pp.  416 U. S. 528-529. 
Page 416 U. S. 507

3. Communications intercepted pursuant to the extension order were inadmissible, since they were evidence derived from the communications invalidly intercepted pursuant to the initial order.  Pp.  416 U. S. 529-533.

Pp.  416 U. S. 524-528.
(b) Since Congress intended to condition the use of intercept procedures upon the judgment of a senior Justice Department official that the situation is one of those warranting their use, thus precluding resort to wiretapping in various situations where investigative personnel would otherwise seek intercept authority from the court and the court would very likely authorize its use, it is evident that the provision for pre-application approval was intended to play a central role in the statutory scheme and that suppression must follow when it is shown that this statutory requirement has been ignored.

Syllabus 
Under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 each application for a court order authorizing the interception of a wire or oral communication, 18 U.S.C.  2518(1)(a), and each interception order, 18 U.S.C.  2518(4)(d), must identify the officer authorizing the application, and the Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General specially designated by him, may authorize the application, 18 U.S.C.  2516(1).  The contents of intercepted communications, or evidence derived therefrom, may not be received in evidence at a trial if the disclosure of the information would be ""in violation of"" Title III, 18 U.S.C.  2515, and may be suppressed on the grounds, inter alia, that the communication was ""unlawfully intercepted,"" 18 U.S.C.  2518(10)(a)(i), or that the interception order was ""insufficient on its face,"" 18 U.S.C.  2518(10)(a)(ii).  In this case, the applications and orders to wiretap the telephones of respondents Chavez and Fernandez, two narcotics offense suspects, incorrectly identified an Assistant Attorney General as the official authorizing the applications, whereas, with respect to Chavez, it had been the Attorney General, and, with respect to Fernandez, the Attorney General's Executive Assistant.  After Chavez, Fernandez, and the other respondents were indicted, the District Court, on respondents' motions, held that the evidence secured through both wiretaps had to be suppressed for failure of the applications or orders to identify the individual who actually authorized the application, and further, as to the Fernandez wiretap, because neither the Attorney General nor a specially designated Assistant Attorney General authorized the application.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in all respects.
Held:
1. Because the application for the interception order on the Fernandez phone was authorized by the Attorney General's Executive Assistant, rather than by the Attorney General or any specially designated Assistant Attorney General, on whom alone  2516(1) confers such power, evidence secured under that order 
Page 416 U. S. 563
 was properly suppressed.  United States v. Giordono, ante, p.  416 U. S. 505.  Pp.  416 U. S. 569-570.
2. Misidentifying the Assistant Attorney General as the official authorizing the Chavez wiretap, when the Attorney General himself actually gave the approval, was in no sense the omission of a requirement that must be satisfied if wiretapping or electronic surveillance is to be lawful under Title III, and hence does not require suppression of the wiretap evidence.  United States v. Giordano, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  416 U. S. 570-580.
(a) Where it is established that responsibility for approval of the application is fixed in the Attorney General, compliance with the screening requirements of Title III is assured, and there is no justification for suppression.  Pp.  416 U. S. 571-572.
(b) The interception order was not ""insufficient on its face"" within the meaning of  2618(10)(a)(ii), since the order clearly identified ""on its face"" the Assistant Attorney General as the person authorizing the application, he being a person who, under  2516(1), could properly give such approval if specially designated to do so as the order recited, notwithstanding this was subsequently shown to be incorrect.  Pp.  416 U. S. 573-574.
(c) The misidentification of the officer authorizing the wiretap application did not affect the fulfillment of any of the reviewing or approval functions required by Congress, and, by itself, does not render the interception conducted under the order ""unlawful"" within the meaning of  2518(10)(a)(i) or the disclosure of the content of the interceptions, or derivative evidence, otherwise ""in violation of"" Title III within the meaning of  2515, there being no legislative history concerning  2518(1)(a) and (4)(d) to suggest that they were meant, by themselves, to occupy a central, or even functional, role in guarding against unwarranted use of wiretapping or electronic surveillance.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 13, 1974
 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN, Mr. Justice STEWART, and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, concurring in part and dissenting in part in No. 72-1319, United States v. Chavez, 416 U.S. 562, and concurring in No. 72-1057, United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505. 
 The Court deals with two different Justice Department violations of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, which imposes express limitations on the use of electronic surveillance. In United States v. Giordano, the Court correctly finds that the violation of 18 U.S.C. 2516(1) is a violation of a statutory requirement which 'directly and substantially implement(s) the congressional intention to limit the use of intercept procedures to those situations clearly calling for the employment of this extraordinary investigative device.' The Court also properly finds that a violation of such a statutory requirement mandates suppression of the evidence seized by the unlawful interception. I join the opinion of the Court in Giordano. The same violation of 2516( 1) is also involved in the Fernandez wiretap in United States v. Chavez, and I therefore concur in the Court's suppression of the 
Page 416 U.S. 580 , 581
 evidence seized in that wiretap. In Chavez, however, the Court finds that suppression is not warranted for the violations of 18 U.S.C. 2518(1)(a) and 2518(4)(d) which the Court admits occurred in the Chavez wiretap itself. I dissent from this conclusion, hereinafter referred to as the holding of Chavez. 
 I  
 Title III permits electronic surveillance to be employed only pursuant to a court order. It requires, inter alia, that a federal trial attorney desiring to apply to the District Court for such a wiretap order must first secure authorization from one of a group of specified officials in the Justice Department. Giordano represents a class of cases in which authorization for electronic surveillance was given by Sol Lindenbaum, the Executive Assistant to Attorney General John Mitchell, in violation of the 'authorization requirement' of 2516(1) of Title III. This section provides that a wiretap order may be applied for only after authorization by '(t)he Attorney General, or any Assistant Attorney General specially designated by the Attorney General.' Chavez, on the other hand, represents a class of cases where the Justice Department violated the 'identification requirement' of 2518(1)(a) of Title III, which requires that each application made to the District Court for a wiretap order 'shall include . . . the identity of . . . the officer authorizing the application.' Because the District Courts in this class of cases were supplied with misinformation as to the identity of the person who authorized the applications made to them, the orders they entered approving the use of electronic surveillance violated 2518(4)(d) of Title III, which provides that such orders 'shall specify . . . the identity [416 U.S. 580 , 582]

No. 72-6160
Argued December 4, 1973
Decided May 13, 1974
416 U.S. 600

Syllabus 
The Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure makes available to a mortgage or lien holder a writ of sequestration to forestall waste or alienation of the encumbered property.  While the writ is obtainable on the creditor's ex parte application without notice to the debtor or an opportunity for hearing, the writ will issue only upon a verified affidavit and upon a judge's authority (with respect to the parish involved in this case) after the creditor has filed a sufficient bond.  The debtor may immediately seek dissolution of the writ, which must be ordered unless the creditor proves the grounds for issuance (existence of the debt, lien, and delinquency), failing which the court may order return of the property and assess damages, including attorney's fees, in the debtor's favor.  Respondent seller filed suit against petitioner in the New Orleans City Court for the overdue balance of the price of certain personal property that petitioner had purchased under an installment sales contract and on which respondent had a vendor's lien. On respondent's application, the trial judge in accordance with the Louisiana procedure ordered sequestration of the property without prior notice or opportunity for a hearing, and denied petitioner's motion to dissolve the writ on the asserted ground, inter alia, that the seizure violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The appellate courts affirmed.
Held:  The Louisiana sequestration procedure is not invalid, either on its face or as applied, and, considering the procedure as a whole, it effects a constitutional accommodation of the respective interests of the buyer and seller by providing for judicial control of the process from beginning to end, thus minimizing the risk of the creditor's wrongful interim possession, by protecting the debtor's interest in every way except to allow him initial possession, and by putting the property in the possession of the party who is able to furnish protection against loss or damage pending trial on the merits.

416 U.S. 637

Syllabus 
During the course of a joint first-degree murder trial, respondent's codefendant pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, of which the trial court advised the jury, stating that the trial against respondent would continue.  In his summation, the prosecutor stated that respondent and his counsel had said that they
""hope that you find him not guilty.  I quite frankly think that they hope that you find him guilty of something a little less than first-degree murder.""
Respondent's counsel objected, and later sought an instruction that the remark was improper, and should be disregarded.  In its instructions, the trial court, after reemphasizing the prosecutor's statement that his argument was not evidence, declared that the challenged remark was unsupported, and admonished the jury to ignore it.  Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder.  The State's highest court ruled that the prosecutor's remark, though improper, was not so prejudicial as to warrant a mistrial, and that the trial court's instruction sufficed to safeguard respondent's rights.  The District Court denied respondent's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the challenged comment implied that respondent, like his codefendant, had offered to plead guilty to a lesser offense, but was refused, and that the comment was thus potentially so misleading and prejudicial as to deprive respondent of a constitutionally fair trial.
Held:  In the circumstances of this case, where the prosecutor's ambiguous remark in the course of an extended trial was followed by the trial court's specific disapproving instructions, no prejudice amounting to a denial of constitutional due process was shown.

 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL, join, dissenting. 
 Successive prosecutions of petitioner and one Cioffi 
Page 416 U.S. 995 , 996
 resulted from an alleged agreement to sell an undercover agent $500,000 worth of counterfeit 6-cent stamps and an alleged delivery to the agent of a sample sheet of four hundred of the stamps. The first prosecution was upon a two-count indictment that charged the pair in the first count with having attempted to sell stamps known to be falsely made, forged and counterfeited, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 472, and, in the second count, with conspiracy to violate the same section. The trial on that indictment ended with a directed verdict of acquittal on the first count as to Cioffi, a dismissal of the first count as to petitioner and a mistrial on the second count when the jury could not agree upon a verdict. 
 Instead of proceeding to a retrial on the second count, the Government abandoned its efforts under 472 and procured a second indictment under 18 U.S.C. 501 based upon the very same course of conduct. The second indictment was also a two-count indictment, the first count charging that the pair 'knowingly did possess with intent to use and sell, approximately four hundred forged and counterfeited postage stamps . . .,' in violation of 501, and count 2 charging conspiracy to violate that section. The overt acts alleged were the same as in the first indictment and the evidence at the trials was much the same. 
 I  
 Petitioner and Cioffi unsuccessfully claimed that, since the second prosecution grew out of the same transaction, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment barred the second prosecution. In my view the rejection of this claim was error. I adhere to the position that the Double Jeopardy Clause requires the prosecution, except in most limited circumstances not present here, 'to join at one trial all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode or transaction.'

No. 73-439
Argued March 19, 1974
Decided April 29, 1974*
416 U.S. 386

Syllabus 
Shareholders' derivative diversity suits were brought in federal court in New York, alleging that the president of a Florida corporation as a fiduciary, with others, used inside information about projected corporate earnings for profit, and hence was liable to the corporation for the unlawful profits.  The District Court, looking to New York's choice of law rules, held that, under Florida law, which it held governed, the defendants were not liable, and dismissed the complaints.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that Florida law, though controlling, was not decisive, and that, in this situation, Florida ""would probably"" apply a certain New York decision to impose liability.
Held:  While resort to an available certification procedure, such as is available in Florida, is not obligatory where there is doubt as to local law, and its use in a given case is discretionary resort to such procedure seems particularly appropriate here in view of the novelty of the question, the unsettled state of Florida law, and the fact that, when federal judges in New York attempt to predict uncertain Florida law, they act as ""outsiders"" not exposed to local law.  Hence, the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals to reconsider whether the controlling issue of state law should be certified to the Florida Supreme Court.  Pp.  416 U. S. 389-392.

Syllabus 
Appellees, prison inmates, brought this class action challenging prisoner mail censorship regulations issued by the Director of the California Department of Corrections and the ban against the use of law students and legal paraprofessionals to conduct attorney-client interviews with inmates.  The mail censorship regulations, inter alia, proscribed inmate correspondence that ""unduly complain[ed],"" ""magnif[ied] grievances,"" ""express[ed] inflammatory political, racial, religious or other views or beliefs,"" or contained matter deemed ""defamatory"" or ""otherwise inappropriate.""  The District Court held these regulations unconstitutional under the First Amendment, void for vagueness, and violative of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of procedural due process, and it enjoined their continued enforcement.  The court required that an inmate be notified of the rejection of correspondence, and that the author of the correspondence be allowed to protest the decision and secure review by a prison official other than the original censor.  The District Court also held that the ban against the use of law students and legal paraprofessionals to conduct attorney-client interviews with inmates abridged the right of access to the courts and enjoined its continued enforcement.  Appellants contend that the District Court should have abstained from deciding the constitutionality of the mail censorship regulations.
Held:
1. The District Court did not err in refusing to abstain from deciding the constitutionality of the mail censorship regulations.  Pp. 400-404.
2. The censorship of direct personal correspondence involves incidental restrictions on the right to free speech of both prisoners and their correspondents, and is justified if the following criteria are met:  (1) it must further one or more of the important and substantial governmental interests of security, order, and the rehabilitation of inmates, and (2) it must be no greater than is necessary to further the legitimate governmental interest involved.  Pp.  416 U. S. 404-414. 
Page 416 U. S. 397

3. Under this standard, the invalidation of the mail censorship regulations by the District Court was correct.  Pp.  416 U. S. 415-416.
4. The decision to censor or withhold delivery of a particular letter must be accompanied by minimum procedural safeguards against arbitrariness or error, and the requirements specified by the District Court were not unduly burdensome.  Pp.  416 U. S. 417-419.
5. The ban against attorney-client interviews conducted by law students or legal paraprofessionals, which was not limited to prospective interviewers who posed some colorable threat to security or to those inmates thought to be especially dangerous and which created an arbitrary distinction between law students employed by attorneys and those associated with law school programs (against whom the ban did not operate), constituted an unjustifiable restriction on the inmates' right of access to the courts.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, charged with illegal possession of drugs, made a motion to suppress the physical evidence seized in petitioner's apartment on February 12, 1971, at 9:30 p.m. by District of Columbia police officers pursuant to a magistrate's search warrant.  Although no provisions of the D.C.Code were explicitly referred to, petitioner apparently contended, inter alia, that the warrant was executed in the night-time in violation of D.C.Code  23-521(f)(5), which specifically requires that search warrants be served in the daytime unless certain statutory conditions are met, none of which was satisfied here.  The District Court granted petitioner's motion, rejecting the Government's contention that the warrant was issued under 21 U.S.C.  879(a), which relates only to searches for ""controlled substances"" and provides that a warrant may be served ""at any time of the day or night"" as long as the issuing authority is satisfied that probable cause exists to believe that there are grounds for the warrant ""and for its service at such time.""  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that 21 U.S.C.  879(a) was the applicable statute, and that its terms had been satisfied.
Held:
1. Title 21 U.S.C.  879(a), which is part of a comprehensive federal scheme for the control of drug abuse, applies to this case.  Pp.  416 U. S. 446-454.
(a) The standards for issuance of the warrant should be governed by nationwide federal legislation, rather than by local D.C. laws.  An Assistant United States Attorney filed the application for the warrant with a Federal Magistrate, alleging violations of the United States Code for which petitioner was indicted.  P.  416 U. S. 447.
(b) Though the affiant officer and the officers executing the warrant were D.C. police, rather than federal officers, and the legislative history of  879(a) stressed federal enforcement, Congress manifested no purpose to dispense with the aid of other enforcement personnel in dealing with the narcotics problem.  Pp.  416 U. S. 447-450. 
Page 416 U. S. 431

(c) If petitioner's contention were to prevail, the general search warrant statute applicable to the District of Columbia would govern D.C. police officers when investigating federal drug violations but not other federal crimes, despite the fact that D.C. police officers historically played a prominent role in federal drug enforcement under 18 U.S.C.  1405 (194 ed.), the predecessor statute of 21 U.S.C.  879(a).  Pp.  416 U. S. 450-454.
2. Title 21 U.S.C.  879(a), as was true of its predecessor statute, requires no special showing for a night-time search, other than a showing, such as was made here, that the contraband is likely to be on the property or person to be searched at that time.  Pp.  416 U. S. 454-458.

A Florida statute grants widows an annual $500 property tax exemption.  Appellant, a widower, was denied an exemption because the statute offers no analogous benefit for widowers.  He then sought a declaratory judgment in county Circuit Court, which held the statute violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Florida Supreme Court reversed, finding the classification ""widow"" valid because it has a ""fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation"" of reducing ""the disparity between the economic capabilities of a man and a woman.""

Argued February 26, 1974
Decided April 23, 1974
416 U.S. 251

Syllabus 
Section 402(a)(7) of the Social Security Act requires state agencies in administering the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program to ""take into consideration . . . any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of . . . income.""  Such expenses are deducted from an AFDC applicant's income in determining eligibility for assistance.  Colorado's AFDC regulations, which previously had permitted the deduction from income of all expenses reasonably attributable to employment, including transportation expenses, were amended in 1970 to subject work-related expenses (with certain exceptions) to a uniform allowance of $30 per month.  This substantially reduced respondent's monthly deductions for work-related transportation expenses and the corresponding increase in her monthly net income made her ineligible for continued AFDC assistance.  She then brought this action for injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming, inter alia, that Colorado's standardized work expense allowance violated  402(a)(7).  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondent, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Colorado regulation conflicts with  402(a)(7), and is therefore invalid.  Pp.  416 U. S. 258-266.
(a) In light of the statute's legislative history and the normal meaning of the term ""any,"" the language of  402(a)(7) requiring the consideration of ""any"" reasonable work expenses in determining eligibility for AFDC assistance is to be interpreted as a congressional directive that no limitation, apart from that of reasonableness, may be placed upon recognition of work-related expenses, and hence a fixed work expense allowance that does not permit deductions for expenses exceeding that standard directly contravenes the language of the statute.  P.  416 U. S. 260.
(b) Standardized treatment of work-related expenses without provision for showing actual and reasonable expenses exceeding the standard amount threatens to defeat the purpose of the 
Page 416 U. S. 252
 mandatory work expense recognition provision of  402(a)(7) of encouraging AFDC recipients to secure and retain employment, since, by limiting work expenses to $30 per month, the Colorado regulation results in a disincentive to seek or retain employment for all recipients whose reasonable work-related expenses exceed or would exceed that amount.  Pp.  416 U. S. 263-265.
(c) It is not the adoption of a standardized work expense allowance per se that violates  402(a)(7), but the fact that the standard is, in effect, a maximum or absolute limitation upon the recognition of such expenses.  P.  416 U. S. 265.

Syllabus 
On a petition by a labor union for a representation election, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) held that the buyers employed by respondent company constituted an appropriate collective bargaining unit and directed an election.  The NLRB stated that, even though the buyers might be ""managerial employees,"" they were nevertheless covered by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in the absence of any showing that union organization of the buyers would create a conflict of interest in labor relations.  Subsequently, the buyers voted for the union, and the NLRB certified it as their exclusive bargaining representative.  The company refused to bargain, however, and was found guilty of an unfair labor practice and ordered to bargain.  The Court of Appeals denied enforcement on the grounds that (1) it was not certain that the NLRB's decision rested on a factual determination that the buyers were not true ""managerial employees"", rather than on a new, and, in the court's view, erroneous, holding that the NLRB was free to regard all managerial employees as covered by the Act unless their duties met the conflict of interest touchstone, and (2) in view of its previous contrary decisions, the NLRB was required to proceed by rulemaking, rather than by adjudication in determining whether buyers are ""managerial employees.""
Held:
1. Congress intended to exclude from the protections of the NLRA all employees properly classified as ""managerial,"" not just those in positions susceptible to conflicts of interest in labor relations.  This is unmistakably indicated by the NLRB's early decisions, the purpose and legislative history of the Taft-Hartley amendments to the NLRA in 1947, the NLRB's subsequent construction of the Act for more than two decades, and the decisions of the courts of appeals.  Pp.  416 U. S. 274-290.
2. The NLRB is not required to proceed by rulemaking, rather 
Page 416 U. S. 268
 than by adjudication, in determining whether buyers or some types of buyers are ""managerial employees.""  Pp.  416 U. S. 290-295.
(a) The NLRB is not precluded from announcing new principles in an adjudicative proceeding, and the choice between rulemaking and adjudication initially lies within the NLRB's discretion.  SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U. S. 194; NLRB v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 394 U. S. 759.  P.  416 U. S. 294.
(b) In view of the large number of buyers employed in manufacturing, wholesale, and retail units, and the wide variety of buyers' duties, depending on the company or industry, any generalized standard would have no more than marginal utility, and the NLRB thus has reason to proceed with caution, and develop its standards in a case-by-case manner with attention to the specific character of the buyers' authority and duties in each company.

Syllabus 
After being denied admission to a state-operated law school, petitioner brought this suit on behalf of himself alone for injunctive relief, claiming that the school's admissions policy racially discriminated against him in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The trial court agreed and ordered the school to admit him in the fall of 1971.  The Washington Supreme Court reversed, holding that the school's admissions policy was not unconstitutional.  MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, as Circuit Justice, stayed that judgment pending this Court's final disposition of the case, with the result that petitioner was in his final school year when this Court considered his petition for certiorari.  After oral argument, the Court was informed that petitioner had registered for his final quarter.  Respondents have assured the Court that this registration is fully effective regardless of the ultimate disposition of the case.
Held:  Because petitioner will complete law school at the end of the term for which he has registered regardless of any decision this Court might reach on the merits, the Court cannot, consistently with the limitations of Art. III of the Constitution, consider the substantive constitutional issues, and the case is moot.
(a) Mootness here does not depend upon a ""voluntary cessation"" of the school's admissions practices, but upon the simple fact that petitioner is in his final term, and the school's fixed policy to permit him to complete the term.
(b) The case presents no question that is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review,"" since petitioner will never again have to go through the school's admissions process, and since it does not follow that the issue petitioner raises will in the future evade review merely because this case did not reach the Court until the eve of petitioner's graduation.

Petitioners, the personal representatives of the estates of students who were killed on the campus of a state controlled university, brought these damages actions under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against the Governor, the Adjutant General of the Ohio National Guard, various other Guard officers and enlisted members, and the university president, charging that those officials, acting under color of state law, ""intentionally, recklessly, willfully and wantonly"" caused an unnecessary Guard deployment on the campus and ordered the Guard members to perform allegedly illegal acts resulting in the students' deaths.  The District Court dismissed the complaints for lack of jurisdiction without the filing of any answer and without any evidence other than the Governor's proclamations and brief affidavits of the Adjutant General and his assistant, holding that respondents were being sued in their official capacities, and that the actions were therefore in effect against the State, and barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on that ground and on the alternative ground that the common law doctrine of executive immunity was absolute, and barred action against respondent state officials.
Held:
1. The Eleventh Amendment does not in some circumstances bar an action for damages against a state official charged with depriving a person of a federal right under color of state law, and the District Court acted prematurely, and hence erroneously, in dismissing the complaints as it did without affording petitioners any opportunity by subsequent proof to establish their claims.

Syllabus 
Workers engaged in an economic strike in New Jersey are eligible for public assistance through state welfare programs.  Petitioners, employers whose plants were struck, brought this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief against such eligibility, claiming that the regulations according benefits to striking workers were invalid because they interfered with the federal labor policy of free collective bargaining expressed in the Labor Management Relations Act and with other federal policy set forth in the Social Security Act.  Before the case was tried, the labor dispute was settled and the strike ended.  The District Court, rejecting the respondent union's contention that the case had been mooted, dismissed the complaint on the grounds that Congress was the appropriate forum for the claim and that the challenged laws did not violate the Supremacy Clause.  The Court of Appeals remanded the case with instructions to vacate and dismiss for mootness.
Held:  To the extent that declaratory relief was sought, the case or controversy requirement of Art. III,  2, and the Declaratory Judgment Act is completely satisfied.  Pp.  416 U. S. 121-127.
(a) Even though the case for an injunction dissolved with the settlement of the strike and the strikers' return to work, the petitioners and respondent state officials may still retain sufficient interests and injury to justify declaratory relief.  Pp.  416 U. S. 121-122.
(b) The challenged governmental action is not contingent upon executive discretion and has not ceased, but is a fixed and definite policy which, by its continuing presence, casts what may well be a substantial adverse effect on petitioners' interests.

Syllabus 
Appellee, a nonprobationary employee in the competitive Civil Service, was dismissed from his position in the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) for allegedly having made recklessly false and defamatory statements about other OEO employees.  Though previously advised of his right under OEO and Civil Service Commission (CSC) regulations to reply to the charges and that the material on which the dismissal notice was based was available for his inspection, he did not respond to the substance of the charges, but brought this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief, contending that the standards and procedures established by and under the Lloyd-La Follette Act, 5 U.S.C.  7501, for the removal of nonprobationary employees from the federal service unwarrantedly interfere with such employees' freedom of expression and deny them procedural due process.  A three-judge District Court held that the Act and attendant regulations denied appellee due process because they failed to provide for a trial-type pre-removal hearing before an impartial official and were unconstitutionally vague because they failed to furnish sufficiently precise guidelines as to what kind of speech might be made the basis for removal action.  Section 7501 of the Act provides for removal of nonprobationary federal employees ""only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,"" and prescribes that the employing agency must furnish the employee with written notice of the proposed removal action and a copy of the charges; give him a reasonable time for a written answer and supporting affidavits; and promptly furnish him with the agency's decision.  The Act further provides, however, that ""[e]xamination of witnesses, trial, or hearing is not required,"" but is discretionary with the individual directing the removal.  CSC and OEO regulations enlarge the statutory provisions by requiring 30 days' advance notice before removal and in other respects, and entitle the employee to a post-removal evidentiary trial-type hearing at the appeal stage.  If the employee is reinstated on appeal, he receives full backpay.  In addition 
Page 416 U. S. 135
 to his First Amendment claims, appellee contends that, absent a full adversary hearing before removal, he could not consistently with due process requirements be divested of his property interest or expectancy in employment or be deprived of his ""liberty"" to refute the charges of dishonesty on which he asserts his dismissal was based.

3. The Act's standard of employment protection, which describes as explicitly as is feasible in view of the wide variety of factual situations where employees' statements might justify dismissal for ""cause"" the conduct that is ground for removal, is not impermissibly vague or overbroad in regulating federal employees' speech.

No. 72-1118
Argued November 7, 1973
Decided April 16, 1974
416 U.S. 134

Syllabus 
Appellee, a nonprobationary employee in the competitive Civil Service, was dismissed from his position in the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) for allegedly having made recklessly false and defamatory statements about other OEO employees.  Though previously advised of his right under OEO and Civil Service Commission (CSC) regulations to reply to the charges and that the material on which the dismissal notice was based was available for his inspection, he did not respond to the substance of the charges, but brought this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief, contending that the standards and procedures established by and under the Lloyd-La Follette Act, 5 U.S.C.  7501, for the removal of nonprobationary employees from the federal service unwarrantedly interfere with such employees' freedom of expression and deny them procedural due process.  A three-judge District Court held that the Act and attendant regulations denied appellee due process because they failed to provide for a trial-type pre-removal hearing before an impartial official and were unconstitutionally vague because they failed to furnish sufficiently precise guidelines as to what kind of speech might be made the basis for removal action.  Section 7501 of the Act provides for removal of nonprobationary federal employees ""only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,"" and prescribes that the employing agency must furnish the employee with written notice of the proposed removal action and a copy of the charges; give him a reasonable time for a written answer and supporting affidavits; and promptly furnish him with the agency's decision.  The Act further provides, however, that ""[e]xamination of witnesses, trial, or hearing is not required,"" but is discretionary with the individual directing the removal.  CSC and OEO regulations enlarge the statutory provisions by requiring 30 days' advance notice before removal and in other respects, and entitle the employee to a post-removal evidentiary trial-type hearing at the appeal stage.  If the employee is reinstated on appeal, he receives full backpay.  In addition 
Page 416 U. S. 135
 to his First Amendment claims, appellee contends that, absent a full adversary hearing before removal, he could not consistently with due process requirements be divested of his property interest or expectancy in employment or be deprived of his ""liberty"" to refute the charges of dishonesty on which he asserts his dismissal was based.
Held:  The judgment is reversed and the case remanded.  Pp.  416 U. S. 148-171.

Syllabus 
Respondents sold cattle to a meat packer at its Texas plant and received checks in payment, but the packer was adjudged a bankrupt before the checks were paid.  With the consent of all parties, the receiver and trustee in bankruptcy continued to sell meat of cattle slaughtered and packaged by the bankrupt and held the sale proceeds subject to disposition by the referee.  Respondents then sought reclamation of the cattle sold to the bankrupt, and asserted a concomitant right to the sale proceeds.  This claim was opposed by the trustee and C.I.T. Corporation, which held a perfected lien on the bankrupt's inventory and other property.  The referee sustained the respondents' position, but the District Court reversed on the ground that, under the Texas Business and Commercial Code, the trustee's and C. I.T.'s claims were superior to that of respondents, who, by delivering the cattle to the bankrupt, retained only an unperfected security interest subject to reclamation.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the Packers and Stockyards Act, along with the implementing regulations and trade usages, established the superiority of respondents' claim notwithstanding Texas law by making the bankrupt a trustee of the proceeds received from the sale of the cattle delivered by respondents.
Held:
(1) On the facts, nothing in either the specific sections of the Packers and Stockyards Act relating to packers or in the general sections of the Act applying to all persons subject to the Act, or in the implementing regulations ex propria vigore overrides the Texas Business and Commercial Code in determining the parties' respective rights to the funds held by the trustee or establishes a special priority in bankruptcy.
(a) An ordinary debtor-creditor relationship requires more than post-bankruptcy disappointment of the creditor to convert it into a trust relationship.  McKee v. Paradise, 299 U. S. 119.
(b) Although the Packers and Stockyards Act regulates methods of payment and recordkeeping procedures for packers, the 
Page 416 U. S. 101
 Act was primarily aimed at the monopoly of the packers which enabled them arbitrarily to lower prices to shippers and increase the price to consumers, and there is no evidence in either the Act or the regulations that packers are to hold cattle or carcasses in trust until the sellers actually convert into cash the checks given them as payment for each sale.
(2) But a course of conduct mandated by the Act or regulations might be relevant or even dispositive under state law in determining priorities to the funds in question, and hence, to the extent that respondents, in appealing to the Court of Appeals, challenged the District Court's determination to the contrary, such determination will be open for adjudication on remand.
Certiorari granted; 483 F.2d 557, reversed and remanded.

 April 15, 1974
 The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of Arkansas for further consideration in light of Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130 (1974). 
 (See dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice DOUGLAS in this case and in Karlan v. City of Cincinnati, 73-537, 416 U.S. 924d 280; Kelly v. Ohio, 72-1379, 416 U.S. 923, and Rosen v. California, 72-1738, 416 U.S. 924, 40 L. Ed.2d 280.)
 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 A North Little Rock policeman on routine patrol drove his car at midnight through a parking lot adjacent to a motel and restaurant. He heard loud language and thought a fight was in progress. He rolled the window down and heard one of the appellants say, 'Well, there goes the bid, bad mother fucking cops.' He ignored this and slowly drove on. The language grew louder. He pulled over behind a large parking sign. The appellants said, 'Look at the chicken shit mother fucker hide over there behind that sign.' He drove back. The appellants then said 'Now the sorry son-of-a-bitch is going to come back over here.' Petitioners were arrested and convicted of breaching the peace, in violation of Arkansas law.

 The Court today grants certiorari, vacates the state court judgment and remands for consideration in light of Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130 (1974). I dissent. The Arkansas Court has already clearly construed 42-1412 to apply only to 'fighting words,' as defined in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942), in Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518 (1972), and in Lewis. That court, in Holmes v. State, 135 Ark. 187, 204 S.W. 846 (1918), held that the statute was narrow in its scope. 'It is not sufficient that the language used gives offense to the person to whom or about whom it is addressed, but it must be that which in its ordinary acceptation is calculated to give offense and to arouse to anger.' 135 Ark., at 189, 204 S.W., at 847 ( 1918).

 The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of Ohio for further consideration in light of Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130, 94 S. Ct. 970 (1974).
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.* 
 These cases all involve convictions under ordinances and statutes which punish the mere utterance of words variously described as 'abusive,' 'vulgar,' 'insulting,' 'profane,' 'indecent,' 'boisterous,' and the like. [Footnote 1] The provisions are challenged as being unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The 'void for vagueness' doctrine is, of course, a due process concept implementing principles of fair warning and non-discriminatory enforcement. Vague laws may trap those who desire to be law-abiding by not providing fair notice of what is prohibited. Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 162 (1972); United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617 ( 1954). They also provide opportunity for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement since those 
Page 416 U.S. 924 , 925
 who apply the laws have no clear and explicit standards to guide them. Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611, 614 ( 1971); Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U.S. 87, 90-91, 15 L. Ed.2d 176 (1965). Further, when a vague statute ""abut[s] upon sensitive areas of First Amendment freedoms,' it 'operates to inhibit the exercise of [those] freedoms.' Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to 'steer far wider of the unlawful zone . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked."" Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 109 (1972), quoting Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372 (1964), and Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526 (1958). 
 Overbreadth, on the other hand, 'offends the constitutional principle that 'a governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms."" Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 250 (1967), quoting NAACP v. Alabama, 377 U.S. 288, 307 (1964). A vague statute may be overbroad if its uncertain boundaries leave open the possibility of punishment for protected conduct and thus lead citizens to avoid such protected activity in order to steer clear of the uncertain proscriptions. Grayned v. City of Rockford supra, 408 U.S. at 109; Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 486 (1965). A statute is also overbroad, however, if, even though it is clear and precise, it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct. Aptheker v.

 Mindy MEYERS, Etc., et al. v. Commonwealth of PENNSYLVANIA et al.No. 73-721. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 15, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 The petitioners seek damages from the State of Pennsylvania arising from a bus accident allegedly caused by the improper design, construction, and maintenance of the highway.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 15, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 The petitioners seek damages from the State of Pennsylvania arising from a bus accident allegedly caused by the improper design, construction, and maintenance of the highway. Seven children were fatally injured when the bus, carrying a group of young people, rotated 180 degrees on wet pavement and when through the guardrail and over the embankment. A study by the National Transportation Safety Board suggested that the accident was caused in part by the 'low basic skid resistance of the pavement in wet weather, and the probable presence of water draining across the pavement in an abnormal manner.' It also suggested that the fatalities and injuries resulted in part from an 'ineffective highway guardrail which failed to prevent the bus from rolling down an embankment. . . .'1 In bringing the action in Federal District Court petitioners contended that the State was liable because it had failed to make the road conform to applicable federal highway regulations which were binding upon Pennsylvania because of its acceptance of federal highway funds. The District Court dismissed the action and the Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that petitioners had no private right of action for the State's failure to conform to the federal regulations and that the State was immune from the suit in federal court because of the Eleventh Amendment.

Syllabus 
A New York village ordinance restricted land use to one-family dwellings, defining the word ""family"" to mean one or more persons related by blood, adoption, or marriage, or not more than two unrelated persons, living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit and expressly excluding from the term lodging, boarding, fraternity, or multiple dwelling houses.

Syllabus 
The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, which was enacted following extensive hearings concerning the unavailability of foreign and domestic lank records of customers thought to be engaged in illegal activities, authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe by regulation certain bank recordkeeping and reporting requirements, the Act's penalties attaching only upon violation of the regulations thus prescribed.  (Unless otherwise indicated, references below to the Act also include the accompanying regulations.)  The Act is designed to obtain financial information having ""a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings.""  Title I of the Act requires financial institutions to maintain records of their customers' identities, to make microfilm copies of checks and similar instruments, and to keep records of certain other items.  Title II requires the reporting to the Federal Government of certain foreign and domestic financial transactions.  Title II,  231, requires reports of the transportation of currency and specified instruments exceeding $5,000 into or out of the country, exception being made, inter alia, for banks and security dealers.  Section 241 requires individuals with bank accounts or other relationships with foreign banks to provide specified information on a tax return form.  Section 221 delegates to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to require reports of transactions ""if they involve the payment, receipt, or transfer of United States currency, or such other monetary instruments as the Secretary may specify . . . ,""  222 providing that he may require such reports from the domestic financial institution involved, the parties to the transaction, or both, and  223 providing that he may designate financial institutions 
Page 416 U. S. 22
 to receive the reports.  Under the implementing regulations, only financial institutions must file reports with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and then only where the transaction involves the deposit, withdrawal, exchange, or other payment of currency exceeding $10,000.  The regulations provide that the Secretary may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations.  Suits were brought by various plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of the Act, principally on the ground that it violated the Fourth Amendment, because when the bank makes and keeps records under compulsion of the Secretary's regulations it acts as a Government agent, and thereby engages in a ""seizure"" of its customer's records.  A three-judge District Court, though upholding the recordkeeping requirements of Title I of the Act and the foreign transaction reporting requirements of Title II, concluded that the domestic reporting provisions of Title II,  221-223, contravened the Fourth Amendment, and enjoined their enforcement.  Three separate appeals were taken.  In No. 72-985, the California Bankers Association, a plaintiff below, asserts that Title I's recordkeeping provisions violate(1) due process, because there is no rational relationship between the Act's objectives and the required recordkeeping and because the Act is unduly burdensome, and (2) rights of privacy.  In No. 72-1196, a bank plaintiff, certain plaintiff depositors, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), also a plaintiff, as a depositor in a bank subject to the recordkeeping requirements and as a representative of its bank customer members, attack both the Title I recordkeeping requirements and the Title II foreign financial transaction reporting requirements on Fourth Amendment grounds; on Fifth Amendment grounds, as violating the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination; and on First Amendment grounds, as violating free speech and free association rights.  In No. 72-1073, the Secretary asserts that the District Court erred in holding Title II's domestic financial transaction reporting requirements facially invalid without considering the actual implementation of the statute by the regulations.
Held:
1. Title I's recordkeeping requirements, which are a proper exercise of Congress' power to deal with the problem of crime in interstate and foreign commerce, do not deprive the bank plaintiffs of due process of law.  Pp.  416 U. S. 45-52.
(a) There is a sufficient nexus between the evil Congress sought to address and the recordkeeping procedure to meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, 
Page 416 U. S. 23
 and the fact that banks are not mere bystanders in transactions involving negotiable instruments, but have a substantial stake in their availability and acceptance and are the most easily identifiable party to the instruments, makes it appropriate for the banks, rather than others, to do the recordkeeping.  United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100; Shapiro v. United States, 335 U. S. 1.  Pp.  416 U. S. 45-49.
(b) The cost burdens on the banks of the recordkeeping requirements are not unreasonable.  P.  416 U. S. 50.
(c) The bank plaintiffs' claim that the recordkeeping requirements undermine the right of a depositor effectively to challenge an IRS third-party summons is premature, absent the issuance of such process involving a depositor's transactions.  Pp.  416 U. S. 51-52.
2. Title I's recordkeeping provisions do not violate the Fourth Amendment rights of either the bank or depositor plaintiffs, the mere maintenance by the bank of records without any requirement that they be disclosed to the Government (which can secure access only by existing legal process) constituting no illegal search and seizure.  Pp.  416 U. S. 52-54.
3. Title I's recordkeeping provisions do not violate the Fifth Amendment rights of either the bank or depositor plaintiffs.  P.  416 U. S. 55.
(a) The bank plaintiffs, being corporations, have no constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination by virtue of the Fifth Amendment.  Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43,  201 U. S. 74-75.  P.  416 U. S. 55.
(b) A depositor plaintiff incriminated by evidence produced by a third party sustains no violation of his own Fifth Amendment rights.  Johnson v. United States, 228 U. S. 457,  228 U. S. 458; Couch v. United States, 409 U. S. 322,  409 U. S. 328.  P.  416 U. S. 55.
4. The ACLU's claim that Title I's recordkeeping requirements violate its members' First Amendment rights, since the challenged provisions could possibly be used to identify its members and contributors (cf. NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U. S. 449), is premature, the Government having sought no such disclosure here.  Pp.  416 U. S. 55-57.
5. The reporting requirements in Title II applicable to foreign financial dealings, which single out transactions with the greatest potential for avoiding enforcement of federal laws and which involve substantial sums, do not abridge plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights and are well within Congress' powers to legislate with respect to foreign commerce.  Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132,  267 U. S. 154; Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U. S. 266,  413 U. S. 272.  Pp.  416 U. S. 563. 
Page 416 U. S. 24

6. The regulations for the reporting by financial institutions of domestic financial transactions are reasonable, and abridge no Fourth Amendment rights of such institutions, which are themselves parties to the transactions involved, since neither ""incorporated nor unincorporated associations [have] an unqualified right to conduct their affairs in secret,"" United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U. S. 632,  338 U. S. 652.  Pp.  416 U. S. 63-67.
7. The depositor plaintiffs, who do not allege engaging in the type of $10,000 domestic currency transaction requiring reporting, lack standing to challenge the domestic reporting regulations.  It is therefore unnecessary to consider contentions made by the bank and depositor plaintiffs that the regulations are constitutionally defective because they do not require the financial institution to notify the customer that a report will be filed concerning the domestic currency transaction.  Pp.  416 U. S. 67-70.
8. The depositor plaintiffs who are parties in this litigation are premature in challenging the foreign and domestic reporting provisions under the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  416 U. S. 72-75.
(a) Since those plaintiffs merely allege that they intend to engage in foreign currency transactions with foreign banks, and make no additional allegation that any of the information required by the Secretary will tend to incriminate them, their challenge to the foreign reporting requirements cannot be considered at this time.  Communist Party v. SACB, 367 U. S. 1,  367 U. S. 105-110, followed; Albertson v. SACB, 382 U. S. 70, distinguished.  Pp.  416 U. S. 72-74.
(b) The depositor plaintiffs' challenge to the domestic reporting requirements are similarly premature, since there is no allegation that any depositor engaged in a $10,000 domestic transaction with a bank that the latter was required to report, and no allegation that any bank report would contain information incriminating any depositor.  Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S. 39; Grosso v. United States, 390 U. S. 62; and Haynes v. United States, 390 U. S. 85, distinguished.  P.  416 U. S. 75.
9. The bank plaintiffs cannot vicariously assert Fifth Amendment claims on behalf of their depositors under the circumstances present here, since the depositors cannot assert those claims themselves at this time.  See  8, supra.  Pp.  416 U. S. 71-72.
10. The contentions of the ACLU that the reporting requirements with respect to foreign and domestic transactions invade its First Amendment associational interests are too speculative and hypothetical to warrant consideration, in view of the fact that the ACLU alleged only that it maintains accounts at a San 
Page 416 U. S. 25
 Francisco bank, but not that it regularly engages in abnormally large domestic currency transactions, transports or receives monetary instruments from foreign commercial channels, or maintains foreign bank account.  Pp.  416 U. S. 75-76.

8. The depositor plaintiffs who are parties in this litigation are premature in challenging the foreign and domestic reporting provisions under the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  416 U. S. 72-75.
(a) Since those plaintiffs merely allege that they intend to engage in foreign currency transactions with foreign banks, and make no additional allegation that any of the information required by the Secretary will tend to incriminate them, their challenge to the foreign reporting requirements cannot be considered at this time.  Communist Party v. SACB, 367 U. S. 1,  367 U. S. 105-110, followed; Albertson v. SACB, 382 U. S. 70, distinguished.  Pp.  416 U. S. 72-74.
(b) The depositor plaintiffs' challenge to the domestic reporting requirements are similarly premature, since there is no allegation that any depositor engaged in a $10,000 domestic transaction with a bank that the latter was required to report, and no allegation that any bank report would contain information incriminating any depositor.  Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S. 39; Grosso v. United States, 390 U. S. 62; and Haynes v. United States, 390 U. S. 85, distinguished.  P.  416 U. S. 75.
9. The bank plaintiffs cannot vicariously assert Fifth Amendment claims on behalf of their depositors under the circumstances present here, since the depositors cannot assert those claims themselves at this time.  See  8, supra.  Pp.  416 U. S. 71-72.
10. The contentions of the ACLU that the reporting requirements with respect to foreign and domestic transactions invade its First Amendment associational interests are too speculative and hypothetical to warrant consideration, in view of the fact that the ACLU alleged only that it maintains accounts at a San 
Page 416 U. S. 25
 Francisco bank, but not that it regularly engages in abnormally large domestic currency transactions, transports or receives monetary instruments from foreign commercial channels, or maintains foreign bank account.  Pp.  416 U. S. 75-76.

 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted after a jury trial of three counts of willfully filing false income tax returns in violation of 7206(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 7206(1). An important prosecution witness at trial was Internal Revenue Special Agent Eugene Konrad, who had interviewed petitioner about his tax returns before the prosecution was instituted and whose 
Page 416 U.S. 909 , 910
 testimony played a major role in establishing the willfullness of petitioner's acts. To facilitate his cross-examination of Konrad, petitioner moved under the Jencks Act, 18, U.S.C. 3500, for production of Konrad's report to the Chief of the Intelligence Division of the Internal Revenue Service in Chicago concerning the interview. Following the in camera examination mandated by 3500(c), the District Court refused to order production of the report on the ground that 'there is no material . . . in the special agent's report . . . that is reasonably necessary for the defendant's use in making adequate trial preparation.' 
 The Court of Appeals correctly held that 'this was an improper test' to apply to determine whether a statement must be produced under 3500. The court, following its recent decision in United States v. Cleveland, 477 F.2d 310, 315-316 (CA7 1973), found that the agent's report was a 'statement' within the meaning of the Jencks Act, 3500(e), see also Clancy v. United States, 365 U.S. 312 (1961), and that it therefore must be produced if it 'relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.' 3500(b). Since the Court of Appeals found that 'some of it clearly relates to the subject matter of his testimony,' it held that Konrad's report should have been produced for the petitioner's use in cross-examination. 
 But the Court of Appeals then went on to conclude, on the basis of its own examination of the report and without permitting petitioner's counsel to see it, that 'the report would have been of no assistance to defendant' and that 'there was no inconsistency between Konrad's report and his testimony at trial.' It therefore held the failure to produce the report to be harmless error. As to this point, Judge Fairchild disagreed, saying that he would 'give defense counsel an opportunity [416 U.S. 909 , 911]

No. 71-6852
Argued October 9, 1973
Decided March 26, 1974
415 U.S. 709

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an indigent, was denied nomination papers to file as a candidate for the position of County Supervisor in California because, although otherwise qualified, he was unable to pay the filing fee required of all candidates by a California statute.  He brought this class action in California Superior Court for a writ of mandate against the Secretary of State and the County Registrar-Recorder, claiming that the statute, by requiring the filing fee but providing no other way of securing access to the ballot, deprived him and others similarly situated of the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and rights of expression and association guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Superior Court denied the writ of mandate; the Court of Appeal and the California Supreme Court also denied writs.
Held:  Absent reasonable alternative means of ballot access, a State may not, consistent with constitutional standards, require from an indigent candidate filing fees that he cannot pay; denying a person the right to file as a candidate solely because of an inability to pay a fixed fee, without providing any alternative means, is not reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of the State's legitimate interest of maintaining the integrity of elections.

No. 72-812
Argued November 5, 1973
Decided March 26, 1974*
415 U.S. 724

Syllabus 
Section 6830(d) (Supp. 1974) of the California Elections Code forbids ballot position to an independent candidate for elective public office if he had a registered affiliation with a qualified political party within one year prior to the immediately preceding primary election;  6831 (1961) requires an independent candidate's nominating papers to be signed by voters not less in number than 5% nor more than 6% of the entire vote cast in the preceding general election;  6833 (Supp. 1974) requires all such signatures to be obtained during a 24-day period following the primary and ending 60 days prior to the general election; and  6830(c) (Supp. 1974) requires that none of such signatures be those of persons who voted at the primary.  Appellants Storer and Frommhagen were disqualified under  6830(d) (Supp. 1974) for ballot status as independent candidates for Congress in the 1972 California elections because they were affiliated with a qualified party no more than six months prior to the primary.  Appellants Hall and Tyner were disqualified for ballot status as independent candidates for President and Vice President in the same election for failure to meet petition requirements.  Appellants brought actions challenging the constitutionality of the above provisions, claiming that their combined effect infringed on rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  A three-judge District Court dismissed the complaints, concluding that the statutes served a sufficiently important state interest to sustain their constitutionality.
Held:
1. Section 6830(d) (Supp. 1974) is not unconstitutional, and appellants Storer and Frommhagen (who were affiliated with a qualified party no more than six months before the primary) were properly barred from the ballot as a result of its application.  Pp  415 U. S. 728-737.
(a) The provision reflects a general state policy aimed at maintaining the integrity of the various routes to the ballot, and 
Page 415 U. S. 725
 involves no discrimination against independents.  Though an independent candidate must be clear of party affiliations for a year before the primary, a party candidate under  6490 (Supp. 1974) of the Code must not have been registered with another party for a year before he files his declaration, which must be done not less than 83 days and not more than 113 days prior to the primary.  Pp.  415 U. S. 733-734.
(b) The provision protects the direct primary process, which is an integral part of the entire election process, by refusing to recognize independent candidates who do not make early plans to leave a party and take the alternative course to the ballot; works against independent candidacies prompted by short-range political goals, pique, or a personal quarrel; is a substantial barrier to a party fielding an ""independent"" candidate to capture and bleed off votes in the general election that might well go to another party; and thus furthers the State's compelling interest in the stability of its political system, outweighing the interest the candidate and his supporters may have in making a late, rather than an early, decision to seek independent ballot status.  Pp.  415 U. S. 734-735.
2. Further proceedings should be had in the District Court to permit additional findings concerning the extent of the burden imposed on independent candidates for President and Vice President under California law, particularly with respect to whether  6831 (1961) and  6833 (Supp. 1974) place an unconstitutional restriction on access by appellants Hall and Tyner to the ballot.  Pp.  415 U. S. 738-746.
(a) It should be determined whether the available pool of possible signers of the nominating papers is so diminished by the disqualification of those who voted in the primary that the 5% provision, which, as applied here, apparently imposes a 325,000 signature requirement, to be satisfied in 24 days, is unduly onerous.  Pp.  415 U. S. 739-740.
(b) While the District Court apparently took the view that California law disqualified anyone who voted in the primary from signing an independent's petition, whether or not the vote was confined to nonpartisan matters, it would be difficult on the record before this Court to ascertain any rational ground, let alone a compelling interest, for disqualifying nonpartisan primary voters.  Pp.  415 U. S. 741-742.
(c) Once the District Court ascertains the number of signatures required in the 24-day period, along with the total pool from which they may be drawn, the court then, in determining whether, 
Page 415 U. S. 726
 in the context of California politics, a reasonably diligent independent candidate could be expected to satisfy the signature requirements or will only rarely succeed in securing ballot placement, should consider not only past experience, but also the relationship between the showing of support through a petition requirement and the percentage of the vote the State can reasonably expect of a candidate who achieves ballot status in the general election.  Pp.  415 U. S. 742-746.

No. 72-887
Argued November 5, 1973
Decided March 26, 1974*
415 U.S. 767

Syllabus 
Texas laws involved in this litigation provide four methods for nominating candidates in a general election:  (1) candidates of parties whose gubernatorial choice polled more than 200,000 votes in the last general election are nominated by primary election only, and the nominees of these parties automatically appear on the ballot; (2) candidates whose parties poll less than 200,000 votes, but more than 2% of the total vote cast for governor in that election are nominated by primary election or nominating conventions; (3) if the foregoing procedures do not apply, precinct conventions can, pursuant to Tex.Election Code, Art. 13.45(2) (Supp. 1973), nominate candidates if the party is able, by notarized signatures, to evidence support by at least 1% of the total gubernatorial vote at the last preceding general election or (by a process to be completed within 55 days after the general May primary election) can produce sufficient supplemental petitions with notarized signatures (not including voters who have already participated in any other party's primary election or nominating process) to make up a combined total of the 1%; and (4) under Arts. 13.50 and 13.51, an independent candidate, regardless of the office sought, can qualify by filing within the time prescribed a petition signed by a certain percentage of voters for governor at the last preceding general election in a specified locality, the percentages varying with the offices sought (in this case 3% in a congressional district and 5% in a State Representative's district).  In no event, are more than 500 signatures required of a candidate for any ""district office.""  No voter, participating in any other political party nominating process or signing a nominating petition for the same office, may sign an independent's petition.  Appellants, minority political parties and their candidates and supporters, and unaffiliated candidates, 
Page 415 U. S. 768
 brought actions in the District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of the Texas election laws, which they claimed infringed their associational rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and were invidiously discriminatory.  They also challenged the practice of printing on absentee ballots only the names of the two major political parties and the State's failure to require printing minority party and independent candidates' names on absentee ballots and the exclusion of minority parties from the benefits of the McKool-Stroud Primary Financing Law of 1972, which provided for public financing from state revenues for primary elections of political parties casting 200,000 or more votes in the last preceding general election for governor.  The District Court upheld the constitutionality of the State's election scheme.
Held:
1. Article 13.45(2), which does not freeze the status quo but affords minority parties a real and essentially equal opportunity for ballot qualification, does not contravene the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and is in furtherance of a compelling state interest.  Storer v. Brown, ante p.  415 U. S. 724.  Pp.  415 U. S. 776-788.
(a) The Equal Protection Clause does not forbid the requirement that small parties proceed by convention, rather than primary election.  The convention process has not been shown here to be invidiously more burdensome than the primary election, followed by a runoff election where necessary.  Pp.  415 U. S. 781-782.
(b) So long as the larger parties must demonstrate major voter support at the last election, it is not invidious to require smaller parties (which need make no such demonstration) to establish their position otherwise, and the 1% requirement (which two of the appellant parties were able to meet) imposes no insurmountable obstacle on a small party.  Pp.  415 U. S. 782-784.
(c) The bar against a person's signing a supplemental petition who has voted in a primary election or participated in a party convention is not unconstitutional, since he may choose to vote or to sign a nominating petition, but not to do both.  Nor is it invidious to disqualify those who have voted in a primary from signing petitions for another party seeking ballot position for its candidates for the same offices where that party had access to the entire electorate and an opportunity to commit voters on primary day.  Cf. Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U. S. 752.  Pp.  415 U. S. 785-786.
(d) The 55-day period provides sufficient time for circulating 
Page 415 U. S. 769
 supplemental petitions, and is not unduly burdensome, nor is the notarization requirement.  Pp.  415 U. S. 786-787.
2. The percentage provisions in Arts. 13.50 and 13.51 with the 500 signature feature are not unduly burdensome.  Requiring independent candidates to evidence a ""significant modicum of support"" is not unconstitutional, and the record here is devoid of any proof to support the claims of appellant independent candidates (who relied solely on the minimal 500 vote signature requirement) that these requirements were impermissibly onerous.  Pp.  415 U. S. 788-791.
3. The challenged McKool-Stroud provisions are not unconstitutional, since they were designed to compensate for primary election expenses to which the major parties alone are subject, and, as the District Court correctly found,
""the convention and petition procedure available for small and new parties carries with it none of the expensive election requirements burdening those parties required to conduct primaries.""
Moreover, the State is not obliged to finance the efforts of every nascent political group seeking ballot placement, like appellant American Party, which failed to qualify for the general election ballot.  Pp.  415 U. S. 791-794.
4. The District Court erred in sustaining the exclusion of minority parties from the absentee ballot.  No justification was offered by appellees for not giving absentee ballot placement to appellant Socialist Workers Part, which satisfied the statutory requirement for demonstrating the necessary community support needed to win general ballot position for its candidates.  Goosby v. Osser, 409 U. S. 512; O'Brien v. Skinner, 414 U. S. 524.  Pp.  415 U. S. 794-795.

Syllabus 
Texas laws involved in this litigation provide four methods for nominating candidates in a general election:  (1) candidates of parties whose gubernatorial choice polled more than 200,000 votes in the last general election are nominated by primary election only, and the nominees of these parties automatically appear on the ballot; (2) candidates whose parties poll less than 200,000 votes, but more than 2% of the total vote cast for governor in that election are nominated by primary election or nominating conventions; (3) if the foregoing procedures do not apply, precinct conventions can, pursuant to Tex.Election Code, Art. 13.45(2) (Supp. 1973), nominate candidates if the party is able, by notarized signatures, to evidence support by at least 1% of the total gubernatorial vote at the last preceding general election or (by a process to be completed within 55 days after the general May primary election) can produce sufficient supplemental petitions with notarized signatures (not including voters who have already participated in any other party's primary election or nominating process) to make up a combined total of the 1%; and (4) under Arts. 13.50 and 13.51, an independent candidate, regardless of the office sought, can qualify by filing within the time prescribed a petition signed by a certain percentage of voters for governor at the last preceding general election in a specified locality, the percentages varying with the offices sought (in this case 3% in a congressional district and 5% in a State Representative's district).  In no event, are more than 500 signatures required of a candidate for any ""district office.""  No voter, participating in any other political party nominating process or signing a nominating petition for the same office, may sign an independent's petition.  Appellants, minority political parties and their candidates and supporters, and unaffiliated candidates, 
Page 415 U. S. 768
 brought actions in the District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of the Texas election laws, which they claimed infringed their associational rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and were invidiously discriminatory.  They also challenged the practice of printing on absentee ballots only the names of the two major political parties and the State's failure to require printing minority party and independent candidates' names on absentee ballots and the exclusion of minority parties from the benefits of the McKool-Stroud Primary Financing Law of 1972, which provided for public financing from state revenues for primary elections of political parties casting 200,000 or more votes in the last preceding general election for governor.  The District Court upheld the constitutionality of the State's election scheme.
Held:
1. Article 13.45(2), which does not freeze the status quo but affords minority parties a real and essentially equal opportunity for ballot qualification, does not contravene the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and is in furtherance of a compelling state interest.  Storer v. Brown, ante p.  415 U. S. 724.  Pp.  415 U. S. 776-788.
(a) The Equal Protection Clause does not forbid the requirement that small parties proceed by convention, rather than primary election.  The convention process has not been shown here to be invidiously more burdensome than the primary election, followed by a runoff election where necessary.  Pp.  415 U. S. 781-782.
(b) So long as the larger parties must demonstrate major voter support at the last election, it is not invidious to require smaller parties (which need make no such demonstration) to establish their position otherwise, and the 1% requirement (which two of the appellant parties were able to meet) imposes no insurmountable obstacle on a small party.  Pp.  415 U. S. 782-784.
(c) The bar against a person's signing a supplemental petition who has voted in a primary election or participated in a party convention is not unconstitutional, since he may choose to vote or to sign a nominating petition, but not to do both.  Nor is it invidious to disqualify those who have voted in a primary from signing petitions for another party seeking ballot position for its candidates for the same offices where that party had access to the entire electorate and an opportunity to commit voters on primary day.  Cf. Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U. S. 752.  Pp.  415 U. S. 785-786.
(d) The 55-day period provides sufficient time for circulating 
Page 415 U. S. 769
 supplemental petitions, and is not unduly burdensome, nor is the notarization requirement.  Pp.  415 U. S. 786-787.
2. The percentage provisions in Arts. 13.50 and 13.51 with the 500 signature feature are not unduly burdensome.  Requiring independent candidates to evidence a ""significant modicum of support"" is not unconstitutional, and the record here is devoid of any proof to support the claims of appellant independent candidates (who relied solely on the minimal 500 vote signature requirement) that these requirements were impermissibly onerous.  Pp.  415 U. S. 788-791.
3. The challenged McKool-Stroud provisions are not unconstitutional, since they were designed to compensate for primary election expenses to which the major parties alone are subject, and, as the District Court correctly found,
""the convention and petition procedure available for small and new parties carries with it none of the expensive election requirements burdening those parties required to conduct primaries.""
Moreover, the State is not obliged to finance the efforts of every nascent political group seeking ballot placement, like appellant American Party, which failed to qualify for the general election ballot.  Pp.  415 U. S. 791-794.
4. The District Court erred in sustaining the exclusion of minority parties from the absentee ballot.  No justification was offered by appellees for not giving absentee ballot placement to appellant Socialist Workers Part, which satisfied the statutory requirement for demonstrating the necessary community support needed to win general ballot position for its candidates.  Goosby v. Osser, 409 U. S. 512; O'Brien v. Skinner, 414 U. S. 524.  Pp.  415 U. S. 794-795.

No. 73-88
Argued January 15, 1974
Decided March 26, 1974
415 U.S. 800

Syllabus 
Respondent Edwards was arrested shortly after 11 p.m. on May 31, 1970, and taken to jail.  The next morning, a warrantless seizure was made of his clothing and over his objection at his later trial, which resulted in conviction, was used as evidence.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Though conceding the legality of the arrest, that probable cause existed for believing that the clothing would reveal incriminating evidence, and that searches and seizures that could be made at the time of arrest may be legally conducted when the accused arrives at the place of detention, the court held that the warrantless seizure of Edwards' clothing ""after the administrative process and the mechanics of the arrest [had] come to a halt"" was unconstitutional.
Held:  The search and seizure of Edwards' clothing did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  415 U. S. 802-809.
(a) At the time Edwards was placed in his cell, the normal processes incident to arrest and custody had not been completed, and the delay in seizing the clothing was not unreasonable, since, at that late hour, no substitute clothing was available, and when, the next morning, the police were able to supply substitute clothing and took Edwards' clothing for laboratory analysis, they did no more than they were entitled to do incident to the usual arrest and incarceration.  Pp.  415 U. S. 804-805.
(b) Once an accused has been lawfully arrested and is in custody, the effects in his possession at the place of detention that were subject to search at the time and place of arrest may lawfully be searched and seized without a warrant even after a substantial time lapse between the arrest and later administrative processing, on the one hand, and the taking of the property for use as evidence, on the other.

415 U.S. 814

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a previously convicted felon, was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C.  922(a)(6), a part of the Gun Control Act of 1968, by falsely stating, in connection with the redemption from a pawnbroker of three guns petitioner had pawned, that he had not been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than a year.  The pawnbroker was a federally licensed firearms dealer.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Section 922(a)(6) makes it an offense knowingly to make a false statement ""in connection with the acquisition . . . of any firearm . . . from a . . . licensed dealer"" and
""intended or likely to deceive such . . . dealer . . . with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm. . . .""
Held:  Section 922(a)(6) applies to the redemption of a firearm from a pawnshop.  Pp.  415 U. S. 819-833.
(a) Petitioner's contention that the statute covers only a sale-like transaction is without merit, since ""acquisition,"" as used in  922(a)(6), clearly includes any person, by definition, who ""comes into possession, control, or power of disposal"" of a firearm.  Moreover, the statutory terms ""acquisition"" and ""sale or other disposition"" are correlatives.  It is reasonable to conclude that a pawnbroker might ""dispose"" of a firearm through a redemptive transaction.  Finally, Congress explicitly included pawnbrokers in the Gun Control Act, specifically mentioned pledge and pawn transactions involving firearms, and did not include them in the statutory exemptions.  Pp.  415 U. S. 819-823.
(b) That pawnshop firearms redemptions are covered by the challenged provision comports with the legislative history of Title IV of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and the Gun Control Act of 1968, which are aimed at controlling access to weapons by those whose possession thereof is contrary to the public interest, through a regulatory scheme focusing on he federally licensed firearms dealer.  Pp.  415 U. S. 824-829.
(c) Section 922(a)(6) contains no ambiguity warranting a narrow construction in petitioner's favor, and application of the

Syllabus 
Petitioners, recipients of public assistance under the federal-state Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, brought this action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and 28 U.S.C.  2201 challenging a New York regulation permitting the State to recoup prior unscheduled payments for rent from subsequent grants under the AFDC program, on the ground that the regulation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and conflicted with the Social Security Act and implementing regulations of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).  Injunctive and declaratory relief was sought, and jurisdiction was invoked under 28 U.S.C.  1343(3) and (4).  The District Court declared the recoupment regulation contrary to the Social Security Act and HEW regulations, and enjoined its implementation or enforcement.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, because petitioners had failed to present a substantial constitutional claim, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain either the equal protection or the statutory claim.
Held:
1. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1343(3).  Pp.  415 U. S. 534-543.
(a) Section 1343(3) conferred jurisdiction to entertain the constitutional claim if it was of sufficient substance to support federal jurisdiction, in which case, the District Court could hear as a matter of pendent jurisdiction the claim of conflict between federal and state law without determining that the latter claim in its own right was encompassed with  1343.  P.  415 U. S. 536.
(b) Within the accepted substantiality doctrine, petitioners' complaint alleged a constitutional claim sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the District Court to pass on the controversy, since (1) the complaint alleged a deprivation, under color of state law, of constitutional rights within the meaning of  1343(3) and 
Page 415 U. S. 529
 1983; (2) the equal protection issue was neither frivolous nor so insubstantial as to be beyond the District Court's jurisdiction, and the challenged regulation was not so clearly rational as to require no meaningful consideration; and (3) the cause of action alleged was not so patently without merit s to justify a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, Bell v Hood, 327 U. S. 678, whatever may be the ultimate resolution of the federal issues on the merits.  Pp.  415 U. S. 536-543.
2. Given a constitutional question over which the District Court had jurisdiction, it also had jurisdiction over the ""statutory"" claim.  The latter claim was to be decided first, and could be decided by the single district judge, while the constitutional claim could be adjudicated only by a three-judge court, and only if the statutory claim was previously rejected.  Pp.  415 U. S. 543-545.
3. State law claims pendent to federal constitutional claims conferring jurisdiction on a district court generally are not to be dismissed.  Given advantages of economy and convenience and no unfairness to litigants, they are to be adjudicated, particularly where they may be dispositive and their decision would avoid adjudication of federal constitutional questions.  There are special reasons to adjudicate the pendent claim where, as here, the claim, although called ""statutory,"" is in reality a constitutional claim arising under the Supremacy Clause, since ""federal courts are particularly appropriate bodies for the application of preemption principles.""

No. 72-1254
Argued November 12-13, 1973
Decided March 25, 1974
415 U.S. 566

Syllabus 
Appellee, for wearing a small United States flag sewn to the seat of his trousers, was convicted of violating the provision of the Massachusetts flag-misuse statute that subjects to criminal liability anyone who ""publicly . . . treats contemptuously the flag of the United States. . . .""  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed.  The District Court in appellee's habeas corpus action found the ""treats contemptuously"" phrase of the statute unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
The challenged statutory language, which had received no narrowing state court interpretation, is void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since, by failing to draw reasonably clear lines between the kinds of nonceremonial treatment of the flag that are criminal and those that are not, it does not provide adequate warning of forbidden conduct, and sets forth a standard so indefinite that police, court, and jury are free to react to nothing more than their own preferences for treatment of the flag.  Pp.  415 U. S. 572-576,  415 U. S. 578.
2. By challenging in state courts the vagueness of the ""treats contemptuously"" phrase as applied to him, appellee preserved his due process claim for purposes of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction, Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270, since the challenged language is void for vagueness as applied to appellee or to anyone else.  A ""hard-core"" violator concept has little meaning with regard to the challenged language, because the phrase at issue is vague not in the sense of requiring a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible standard, but in the sense of not specifying any ascertainable standard of conduct at all.  Pp.  415 U. S. 576-578.
3. Even if, as appellant contends, the statute could be said to deal only with ""actual"" flags of the United States, this would not resolve the central vagueness deficiency of failing to define contemptuous treatment.  Pp.  415 U. S. 578-579. 
Page 415 U. S. 567

4. That other words of the desecration and contempt portion of the statute address more specific conduct (mutilation, trampling, and defacing of the flag) does not assist appellant, since appellee was tried solely under the ""treats contemptuously"" phrase, and the highest state court in this case did not construe the challenged phrase as taking color from more specific accompanying language.  Pp.  415 U. S. 579-50.
5. Regardless of whether restriction by that court of the scope of the challenged phrase to intentional contempt may be held against appellee, such an interpretation nevertheless does not clarify what conduct constitutes contempt of the flag, whether intentional or inadvertent.  P.  415 U. S. 580.

The challenged statutory language, which had received no narrowing state court interpretation, is void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since, by failing to draw reasonably clear lines between the kinds of nonceremonial treatment of the flag that are criminal and those that are not, it does not provide adequate warning of forbidden conduct, and sets forth a standard so indefinite that police, court, and jury are free to react to nothing more than their own preferences for treatment of the flag.  Pp.  415 U. S. 572-576,  415 U. S. 578.
2. By challenging in state courts the vagueness of the ""treats contemptuously"" phrase as applied to him, appellee preserved his due process claim for purposes of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction, Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270, since the challenged language is void for vagueness as applied to appellee or to anyone else.  A ""hard-core"" violator concept has little meaning with regard to the challenged language, because the phrase at issue is vague not in the sense of requiring a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible standard, but in the sense of not specifying any ascertainable standard of conduct at all.  Pp.  415 U. S. 576-578.
3. Even if, as appellant contends, the statute could be said to deal only with ""actual"" flags of the United States, this would not resolve the central vagueness deficiency of failing to define contemptuous treatment.  Pp.  415 U. S. 578-579. 
Page 415 U. S. 567

4. That other words of the desecration and contempt portion of the statute address more specific conduct (mutilation, trampling, and defacing of the flag) does not assist appellant, since appellee was tried solely under the ""treats contemptuously"" phrase, and the highest state court in this case did not construe the challenged phrase as taking color from more specific accompanying language.  Pp.  415 U. S. 579-50.
5. Regardless of whether restriction by that court of the scope of the challenged phrase to intentional contempt may be held against appellee, such an interpretation nevertheless does not clarify what conduct constitutes contempt of the flag, whether intentional or inadvertent.  P.  415 U. S. 580.

Argued December 10, 1973
Decided March 25, 1974
415 U.S. 605

Syllabus 
The Mayor of Philadelphia is empowered by the city charter to appoint a Nominating Panel, which, in turn, submits to him nominees to fill vacancies on the School Board.  The Panel consists of 13 members.  The Mayor must appoint four members from the citizenry at large; each of the remaining nine must be the highest ranking officer of one of nine designated categories of city-wide organizations.  A new Panel is convened in every odd-numbered year.  Respondents brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief charging that Mayor Tate had violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against Negroes in appointments to the 1971 Panel.  Following hearings, the District Court found that respondents had failed to prove racial discrimination and dismissed their complaint.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that respondents had established an unrebutted prima facie case of unlawful exclusion of Negroes from consideration for service on the 1971 Panel.  Although Tate was succeeded, while the case was sub judice, by Mayor Rizzo (as to whose Panel appointment practices the record is silent), the court directed the issuance of certain injunctive relief against Rizzo with regard to the 1973 Panel and future Panels.
Held:
1. The Mayor's principal argument, that federal courts may not interfere with the discretionary appointment powers of an elected executive officer, is of greater importance than was accorded it by the Court of Appeals, but the argument need not be addressed here, since the record is devoid of reliable proof of racial discrimination.  Pp.  415 U. S. 613-616.
2. The Court of Appeals' finding of racial discrimination rests on ambiguous testimony as to a statement in 1969 by then Mayor Tate with regard to the 1969 School Board, not the 1971 Panel; the unawareness of certain organizations on the part of a city official who did not have final authority over the challenged appointments; and racial-composition percentage comparisons the 
Page 415 U. S. 606
 District Court correctly rejected as meaningless in the context of this case.  The Court of Appeals therefore erred in overturning the District Court's findings and conclusions.  Pp.  415 U. S. 616-621.
3. The Court of Appeals erred in ordering injunctive relief against Mayor Rizzo with regard to the 1973 Panel and future Panels, since the record speaks solely to the appointment practices of Tate, his predecessor, who left office in 1972.  Pp.  415 U. S. 621-623.
4. The principal issue throughout this litigation has been whether Mayor Tate violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  There is no basis for remanding the case to the District Court for resolution of peripheral state law issues under that court's pendent jurisdiction or, alternatively, for abstention so that the case may be tried anew in a state court.

Respondent brought this class action for injunctive and declaratory relief against the Illinois officials administering the federal-state programs of Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (AABD), which are funded equally by the State and Federal Governments, contending that they were violating federal law and denying equal protection of the laws by following state regulations that did not comply with the federal time limits within which participating States had to process and make grants with respect to AABD applications.  The District Court by a permanent injunction required compliance with the federal time limits and also ordered the state officials to release and remit AABD benefits wrongfully withheld to all persons found eligible who had applied therefor between July 1, 1968, the date of the federal regulations, and April 16, 1971, the date of the court's preliminary injunction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the state officials' contentions that the Eleventh Amendment barred the award of the retroactive benefits and that the judgment of inconsistency between federal regulations and state provisions could be given only prospective effect.

Petitioner was convicted of criminal contempt for referring to his alleged assailant as ""chicken shit"" in answering a question on cross-examination at his trial for violating a Tulsa, Oklahoma, ordinance.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contention that the conviction must be taken as resting solely on the use of the explective, and holding that, since the record showed that petitioner, in addition to using the explective, made ""discourteous responses"" to the trial judge, there was sufficient evidence upon which the trial court could find petitioner in direct contempt.

No. 72-5581
Argued November 13, 1973
Decided March 19, 1974
415 U.S. 452

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who had twice been warned to stop handbilling on an exterior sidewalk of a shopping center against American involvement in Vietnam and threatened with arrest by police if he failed to do so, and whose companion continued handbilling and was charged with violating the Georgia criminal trespass law, brought an action for injunctive and declaratory relief in the District Court, claiming that application to him of that law would violate his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The District Court dismissed the action, finding that ""no meaningful contention can be made that the state has [acted] or will . . . act in bad faith,"" and therefore ""the rudiments of an active controversy between the parties . . . [are] lacking.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed, being of the view that Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, made it clear that irreparable injury must be measured by bad faith harassment, and such a test must be applied to a request for injunctive relief against threatened, as well as pending, state court criminal prosecution; and that it followed from the reasoning of Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66, that the same test of bad faith harassment is a prerequisite for declaratory relief with respect to a threatened prosecution.
Held:
1. This case presents an ""actual controversy"" under Art. III of the Constitution and the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, the alleged threats of prosecution in the circumstances alleged not being ""imaginary or speculative"" and it being unnecessary for petitioner to expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to make his constitutional challenge.  Whether the controversy remains substantial and continuing in the light of the effect of the recent reduction of the Nation's involvement in Vietnam on petitioner's desire to engage in the handbilling at the shopping center must be resolved by the District Court on remand.  Pp.  415 U. S. 458-460.
2. Federal declaratory relief is not precluded when a prosecution based upon an assertedly unconstitutional state statute has been threatened, but is not pending, even if a showing of bad faith 
Page 415 U. S. 453
 enforcement or other special circumstances has not been made.  Pp.  415 U. S. 460-473.
(a) When no state criminal proceeding is pending at the time the federal complaint is filed, considerations of equity, comity, and federalism on which Younger v. Harris and Samuels v. Mackell both supra, were based, have little vitality:  federal intervention does not result in duplicative legal proceedings or disruption of the state criminal justice system; nor can federal intervention, in that circumstance, be interpreted as reflecting negatively upon the state courts' ability to enforce constitutional principles.  Pp.  415 U. S. 460-462
(b) Even if the Court of Appeals correctly viewed injunctive relief as inappropriate (a question not reached here, petitioner having abandoned his request for that remedy), the court erred in treating the requests for injunctive and declaratory relief as a single issue and in holding that a failure to demonstrate irreparable injury precluded the granting of declaratory relief.  Congress plainly intended that a declaratory judgment be available as a milder alternative than the injunction to test the constitutionality of state criminal statutes.  Pp.  415 U. S. 462-473.
3. In determining whether it is appropriate to grant declaratory relief when no state criminal proceeding is pending, it is immaterial whether the attack is made on the constitutionality of a state criminal statute on its face or as applied.  Cameron v. Johnson, 390 U. S. 611, distinguished.  Pp.  415 U. S. 473-475.

The District Court dismissed the action, finding that ""no meaningful contention can be made that the state has [acted] or will . . . act in bad faith,"" and therefore ""the rudiments of an active controversy between the parties . . . [are] lacking.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed, being of the view that Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, made it clear that irreparable injury must be measured by bad faith harassment, and such a test must be applied to a request for injunctive relief against threatened, as well as pending, state court criminal prosecution; and that it followed from the reasoning of Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66, that the same test of bad faith harassment is a prerequisite for declaratory relief with respect to a threatened prosecution.
Held:
1. This case presents an ""actual controversy"" under Art. III of the Constitution and the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act, the alleged threats of prosecution in the circumstances alleged not being ""imaginary or speculative"" and it being unnecessary for petitioner to expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to make his constitutional challenge.  Whether the controversy remains substantial and continuing in the light of the effect of the recent reduction of the Nation's involvement in Vietnam on petitioner's desire to engage in the handbilling at the shopping center must be resolved by the District Court on remand.  Pp.  415 U. S. 458-460.
2. Federal declaratory relief is not precluded when a prosecution based upon an assertedly unconstitutional state statute has been threatened, but is not pending, even if a showing of bad faith 
Page 415 U. S. 453
 enforcement or other special circumstances has not been made.  Pp.  415 U. S. 460-473.
(a) When no state criminal proceeding is pending at the time the federal complaint is filed, considerations of equity, comity, and federalism on which Younger v. Harris and Samuels v. Mackell both supra, were based, have little vitality:  federal intervention does not result in duplicative legal proceedings or disruption of the state criminal justice system; nor can federal intervention, in that circumstance, be interpreted as reflecting negatively upon the state courts' ability to enforce constitutional principles.  Pp.  415 U. S. 460-462
(b) Even if the Court of Appeals correctly viewed injunctive relief as inappropriate (a question not reached here, petitioner having abandoned his request for that remedy), the court erred in treating the requests for injunctive and declaratory relief as a single issue and in holding that a failure to demonstrate irreparable injury precluded the granting of declaratory relief.  Congress plainly intended that a declaratory judgment be available as a milder alternative than the injunction to test the constitutionality of state criminal statutes.  Pp.  415 U. S. 462-473.
3. In determining whether it is appropriate to grant declaratory relief when no state criminal proceeding is pending, it is immaterial whether the attack is made on the constitutionality of a state criminal statute on its face or as applied.  Cameron v. Johnson, 390 U. S. 611, distinguished.  Pp.  415 U. S. 473-475.

415 U.S. 486

Syllabus 
Material Service Corp., a deep mining coal producer, and its successor, appellee General Dynamics Corp., acquired, through stock purchases, control of appellee United Electric Coal Companies, a strip-mining coal producer.  The Government brought suit alleging that this acquisition violated  7 of the Clayton Act.  The District Court found no violation on the ground, inter alia, that the Government's evidence -- consisting principally of past production statistics showing that, within certain geographic markets, the coal industry was concentrated among a small number of large producers, that this concentration was increasing, and that the acquisition here would materially enlarge the acquiring company's market share and thereby contribute to the concentration trend -- did not support the Government's contention that the acquisition substantially lessened competition in the production and sale of coal in either or both of two specified geographic markets.  This conclusion was primarily based on a determination that United Electric's coal reserves were so low that its potential to compete with other producers in the future was far weaker than the aggregate production statistics relied on by the Government might otherwise have indicated, virtually all of United Electric's proved reserves being either depleted or already committed by long-term contracts with large customers, so that its power to affect the price of coal was severely limited and steadily diminishing.
Held:
1. While the Government's statistical showing might have been sufficient to support a finding of ""undue concentration"" in the absence of other considerations, the District Court was justified in finding that other pertinent factors affecting the coal industry and appellees' business mandated a conclusion that no substantial lessening of competition occurred or was threatened by the acquisition.  Ample evidence showed that United Electric does not have sufficient reserves, which are a key factor in measuring 
Page 415 U. S. 487
 a coal producer's market strength, to make it a significant competitive force.  Thus, in terms of probable future ability to compete, rather than in terms of past production on which the Government relied, the court was warranted in concluding that the merger did not violate  7 of the Act.  Pp.  415 U. S. 494-504.
2. The District Court was justified in considering post-acquisition evidence relating to changes in the patterns and structure of the coal industry and in United Electric's reserve situation, since (unlike evidence showing only that no lessening of competition has yet occurred) the demonstration of weak coal resources necessarily implied that United Electric was not merely disinclined, but unable, to compete effectively for future contracts, such evidence going directly to the question whether future lessening of competition was probable.  Pp.  415 U. S. 504-506.
3. United Electric's weak reserves position, rather than establishing a ""failing company"" defense by showing that the company would have gone out of business but for the merger, went to the heart of the Government's statistical prima facie case and substantiated the District Court's conclusion that United Electric, even if it remained in the market, did not have sufficient reserves to compete effectively for long-term contracts, and therefore appellees' failure to meet the prerequisites of a failing company defense did not detract from the validity of the District Court's analysis.  Pp.  415 U. S. 506-508.
4. Under the ""clearly erroneous"" standard of Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 52(a), which governs as fully on direct appeal to this Court as on review by a court of appeals, the District Court's findings and conclusions are supported by the evidence, and are not clearly erroneous.  P.  415 U. S. 508.
5. The District Court found new strip reserves unavailable, and the mere possibility that United Electric could some day acquire expertise to mine deep reserves does not depreciate the validity of the conclusion that United Electric, at the time of trial, did not have the power to compete effectively for long-term contracts, nor does it give the production statistics relied on by the Government more significance than the District Court ascribed to them.

Syllabus 
A Government witness, who had been indicted with petitioner, testified at petitioner's trial that no promises had been made to the witness regarding disposition of his case.  Petitioner, for the first time on appeal of his conviction, contended that the witness' testimony was false on the basis of the prosecutor's statements at the subsequent sentencing hearing of the witness, who had pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in a superseding indictment.  The Court of Appeals, after examining the transcript of the sentencing hearing, concluded that no leniency promise had been made prior to the witness' testimony at petitioner's trial.
Held:  Had there been a promise to the witness before he testified, a reversal of petitioner's conviction would be required, Giglio v. United States, 405 U. S. 150, and Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264, and the factual issue of whether the plea bargain that obviously was made with the witness preceded or followed petitioner's trial should have been resolved by the District Court after an evidentiary hearing.

 When Congress enacted the Natural Gas Act in 1938, the state regulatory agencies were among its strongest supporters. [Footnote 1] For, without supplanting any of the existing authority of the state agencies, the Act was intended to provide a powerful regulatory partner, the Federal Power Commission, which could regulate activities where the state bodies could not. As the Senate Report on the bill stated: 
 Yet the Court today affirms a holding of the District Court which permits the Federal Power Commission to sue the Oklahoma Corporation Commission and enjoin the enforcement of those state agency orders which the court finds violate either the Natural Gas Act or the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

The Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1952 (hereafter the Act), authorizes each federal agency to prescribe by regulation such fee for the agency's services as is determined to be fair and equitable, taking into consideration the direct and indirect ""cost to the Government, value to the recipient, public policy or interest served, and other pertinent facts. . . .""  Pursuant to the Act, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in revising fees imposed upon community antenna television (CATV) systems, first estimated its direct and indirect costs for CATV regulations, and then, while retaining filing fees, added an annual fee for each CATV system at the rate of 30 per subscriber, concluding that this fee would approximate the ""value to the recipient"" used in the Act.  The Court of Appeals, on a review obtained by petitioner, a CATV trade association, approved the FCC's action.
Held:
1. The Act authorizes the imposition of a ""fee,"" which connotes a ""benefit"" of ""value to the recipient.""

 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, concurring in the result in No. 72-1162 and dissenting in No. 72-948. 
 These cases present two distinct issues involving interpretation of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1952: first, whether sufficient 'work, service, . . . benefit, . . . or similar thing of value or utility' was conferred on the CATV operators or utility companies to warrant imposition of a fee under the statute; and, second, whether, if a fee was justifiably imposed, the amount of the fee was determined in accordance with a proper interpretation of the statutory standard that it be 'fair and equitable taking into consideration direct and indirect cost to the Government, value to the recipient, public policy or interest served, and other pertinent facts.' 31 U.S.C. 483a. The Court, however, fails to recognize that these issues require independent analysis. Instead, permeating the Court's opinions on both issues is an attempt to draw metaphysical distinctions between a 'fee' and a 'tax.' I do not find this approach either helpful or appropriate; whatever the label, the questions presented in these cases involve simply whether the charges assessed by the Commissions were authorized by Congress. The Court's approach merely beclouds its analysis, producing results which seem to me inconsistent and affording guidance to the agencies in setting their fee policies which might be charitably described as uncertain. This approach is allegedly based on the need to construe the statute narrowly to avoid constitutional difficulties. I do not believe that any serious question of the constitutionality of the Act would be presented if Congress had in fact authorized these charges. The notion that the Constitution narrowly confines the power of Congress to delegate authority to administrative agencies, which was briefly in vogue in the 1930's, has

 been virtually abandoned by the Court for all practical purposes,1 at least in the absence of a delegation creating 'the danger of overbroad, unauthorized, and arbitrary application of criminal sanctions in an area of (constitutionally) protected freedoms,' United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 272, 428 (1967) (Brennan, J., concurring).

No. 72-1297
Argued December 11, 1973
Decided March 4, 1974
415 U.S. 361

Syllabus 
Appellee, who had been exempted from military service as a Class I-O conscientious objector but who performed required alternative civilian service, after being denied educational benefits under the Veterans' Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966, brought this class action for a declaratory judgment that the provisions of the Act making him and his class ineligible for such benefits violated the First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom and the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection of the laws.  After denying appellants' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because of 38 U.S.C.  211(a), which prohibits judicial review of decisions of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs on any question of law or fact under laws administered by the Veterans' Administration providing for veterans' benefits, the District Court rejected appellee's First Amendment claim but sustained the Fifth Amendment claim.
Held:
1. Section 211(a) does not extend to actions challenging the constitutionality of veterans' benefits legislation, but is aimed at prohibiting review only of those decisions of law or fact arising in the administration of a statute providing for veterans' benefits, and hence is inapplicable to this action, neither the text of the statute nor its legislative history showing a contrary intent.  Pp.  415 U. S. 366-374
2. The challenged sections of the Act do not create an arbitrary classification in violation of appellee's right to equal protection of the laws.  Pp.  415 U. S. 374-383.
(a) The quantitative and qualitative distinctions between the disruption caused by military service and that caused by alternative civilian service -- military service involving a six-year commitment and far greater loss of personal freedom, and alternative civilian service involving only a two-year obligation and no requirement to leave civilian life -- form a rational basis for Congress' classification limiting educational benefits to military service veterans 
Page 415 U. S. 362
 as a means of helping them to readjust to civilian life.  Pp.  415 U. S. 378-382.
(b) The statutory classification also bears a rational relationship to the Act's objective of making military service more attractive.  P.  415 U. S. 382.
3. The Act does not violate appellee's right of free exercise of religion.  Gillette v. United States, 401 U. S. 437.  Pp.  415 U. S. 383-386.
(a) The withholding of educational benefits to appellee and his class involves only an incidental burden, if any burden at all, upon their free exercise of religion.  P.  415 U. S. 385.
(b) Appellee and his class were not included as beneficiaries not because of any legislative design to interfere with their free exercise of religion, but because to include them would not rationally promote the Act's purposes.  P.  415 U. S. 385.
(c) The Government's substantial interest in raising and supporting armies, Art. I,  8, is of ""a kind and weight"" clearly sufficient to sustain the challenged legislation.  Pp.  415 U. S. 385-386.

Syllabus 
Several creators and producers of copyrighted television programs brought this suit claiming that defendants had infringed their copyrights by intercepting broadcast transmissions of copyrighted material and rechanneling these programs through various community antenna television (CATV) systems to paying subscribers.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the cause of action was barred by this Court's decision in Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artist Television, 392 U. S. 390.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals divided CATV systems into two categories for copyright purposes:  (1) those where the broadcast signal was already ""in the community"" served by the system, and could be received there either by a community antenna or by standard rooftop or other antennae belonging to the owners of television sets; and (2) those where the systems imported ""distant"" signals from broadcasters so far away from the CATV community that the foregoing local facilities could not normally receive adequate signals.  Holding that CATV reception and retransmission of non-""distant"" signals do not constitute copyright infringement, but that reception and retransmission of ""distant"" signals amount to a ""performance,"" and thus constitute copyright infringement, the court affirmed as to those systems in the first category, but reversed and remanded as to the remaining systems.
Held:
1. The development and implementation, since the Fortnightly decision, of new functions of CATV systems -- program origination, sale of commercials, and interconnection with other CATV systems -- even though they may allow the systems to compete more effectively with the broadcasters for the television market, do not convert the entire CATV operation, regardless of distance from 
Page 415 U. S. 395
 the broadcasting station, into a ""broadcast function,"" thus subjecting the CATV operators to copyright infringement liability, but are extraneous to a determination of such liability, since in none of these functions is there any nexus with the CATV operators' reception and rechanneling of the broadcasters' copyrighted materials.  Pp.  415 U. S. 402-405.
2. The importation of ""distant"" signals from one community into another does not constitute a ""performance"" under the Copyright Act.  Pp.  415 U. S. 406-415.
(a) By importing signals that could not normally be received with current technology in the community it serves, a CATV system does not, for copyright purposes, alter the function it performs for its subscribers, as the reception and rechanneling of these signals for simultaneous viewing is essentially a viewer function, irrespective of the distance between the broadcasting station and the ultimate viewer.  P.  415 U. S. 408.
(b) Even in exercising its limited freedom to choose among various ""distant"" broadcasting stations, a CATV operator cannot be viewed as ""selecting"" broadcast signals, since, when it chooses which broadcast signals to rechannel, its creative function is then extinguished, and it thereafter ""simply carr[ies], without editing, whatever programs [it] receive[s],"" Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, supra, at  392 U. S. 400.  Nor does a CATV system importing ""distant"" signals procure and propagate them to the public, since it is not engaged in converting the sights and sounds of an event or a program into electronic signals available to the public, the signals it receives and rechannels having already been ""released to the public"" even though not normally available to the specific segment of the public served by the CATV system.  Pp.  415 U. S. 409-410.
(c) The fact that there have been shifts in current business and commercial relationships in the communications industry as a result of the CATV systems' importation of ""distant"" signals, does not entail copyright infringement liability, since by extending the range of viewability of a broadcast program, the CATV systems do not interfere in any traditional sense with the copyright holders' means of extracting recompense for their creativity or labor from advertisers on the basis of all viewers who watch the particular program.

No. 72-1566
Argued January 8, 1974
Decided March 4, 1974
415 U.S. 423

Syllabus 
Petitioner employers brought suit in California state court alleging that respondent Union was engaging in a strike in breach of collective bargaining agreements.  The court issued a temporary restraining order on May 18, 1970.  Two days later, the case was removed to federal court, and on June 4, the District Court denied the Union's motion to dissolve the restraining order.  Strike activity then stopped, and the labor dispute remained dormant until the Union, after the petitioners had refused to bargain, resumed its strike on November 30, 1970.  Two days later, the District Court, on petitioners' motion, held the Union in criminal contempt for violating the restraining order.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the order had expired long before November 30, 1970, reasoning that, under both state law and Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 65(b), the order expired no later than June 7, 1970, 20 days after its issuance, and rejecting petitioners' contention that the life of the order was indefinitely prolonged by 28 U.S.C.  1450 ""until dissolved or modified by the district court.""
Held:
1. Whether state law or Rule 65(b) is controlling, the restraining order expired long before the date of the alleged contempt, since, under the State Code of Civil Procedure, a temporary restraining order is returnable no later than 15 days from its date, 20 days if good cause is shown, and must be dissolved unless the party obtaining it proceeds to submit its case for a preliminary injunction, and similarly, under Rule 65(b), such an order must expire by its own terms within 10 days after entry, 20 days if good cause is shown.  Pp.  415 U. S. 431-433. 
Page 415 U. S. 424

2. Section 1450 was not intended to give state court injunctions greater effect after removal to federal court than they would have had if the case had remained in state court, and it should be construed in a manner consistent with the time limitations of Rule 65(b).  Pp.  415 U. S. 434-440.
(a) Once a case has been removed to federal court, federal law, including the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, controls the future course of proceedings, notwithstanding state court orders issued prior to removal.  The underlying purpose of  1450 (to ensure that no lapse in a state court temporary restraining order will occur simply by removing the case to federal court) and the policies reflected in the time limitations of Rule 65(b) (stringent restrictions on the availability of ex parte restraining orders) can be accommodated by applying the rule that such a state court pre-removal order remains in force after removal no longer than it would have remained in effect under state law, but in no event longer than the Rule 65(b) time limitations, measured from the date of removal.  Pp.  415 U. S. 435-440.
(b) Accordingly, the order expired, by its terms, on May 30, 1970, under the 10-day limitation of Rule 65(b) applied from the date of removal; hence, no order was in effect on November 30, 1970, and the Union violated no order when it resumed its strike at that time.  P.  415 U. S. 440.
3. The District Court's denial of the Union's motion to dissolve the restraining order did not effectively convert the order into a preliminary injunction of unlimited duration.  Pp.  415 U. S. 440-445.
(a) That the Union may have had the opportunity to be heard on the merits of the preliminary injunction when it moved to dissolve the restraining order is not the controlling factor, since, under Rule 65(b), the burden was on petitioners to show that they were entitled to a preliminary injunction, not on the Union to show that they were not.  Pp.  415 U. S. 142-443.
(b) Where a court intends to supplant a temporary restraining order, which, under Rule 65(b), expires by its own terms within 10 days of issuance, with a preliminary injunction of unlimited duration pending a final decision on the merits or further order of the court, it should issue an order clearly saying so, and where it has not done so, a party against whom a temporary restraining order has issued may reasonably assume that the order has expired within Rule 65(b)'s time limits.  Here, since the only orders entered were a temporary restraining order and an order denying a motion to dissolve the temporary order, the Union had 
Page 415 U. S. 425

			"|"Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Teamsters
No. 72-1566
Argued January 8, 1974
Decided March 4, 1974
415 U.S. 423

Syllabus 
Petitioner employers brought suit in California state court alleging that respondent Union was engaging in a strike in breach of collective bargaining agreements.  The court issued a temporary restraining order on May 18, 1970.  Two days later, the case was removed to federal court, and on June 4, the District Court denied the Union's motion to dissolve the restraining order.  Strike activity then stopped, and the labor dispute remained dormant until the Union, after the petitioners had refused to bargain, resumed its strike on November 30, 1970.  Two days later, the District Court, on petitioners' motion, held the Union in criminal contempt for violating the restraining order.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the order had expired long before November 30, 1970, reasoning that, under both state law and Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 65(b), the order expired no later than June 7, 1970, 20 days after its issuance, and rejecting petitioners' contention that the life of the order was indefinitely prolonged by 28 U.S.C.  1450 ""until dissolved or modified by the district court.""
Held:
1. Whether state law or Rule 65(b) is controlling, the restraining order expired long before the date of the alleged contempt, since, under the State Code of Civil Procedure, a temporary restraining order is returnable no later than 15 days from its date, 20 days if good cause is shown, and must be dissolved unless the party obtaining it proceeds to submit its case for a preliminary injunction, and similarly, under Rule 65(b), such an order must expire by its own terms within 10 days after entry, 20 days if good cause is shown.  Pp.  415 U. S. 431-433. 
Page 415 U. S. 424

2. Section 1450 was not intended to give state court injunctions greater effect after removal to federal court than they would have had if the case had remained in state court, and it should be construed in a manner consistent with the time limitations of Rule 65(b).  Pp.  415 U. S. 434-440.
(a) Once a case has been removed to federal court, federal law, including the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, controls the future course of proceedings, notwithstanding state court orders issued prior to removal.  The underlying purpose of  1450 (to ensure that no lapse in a state court temporary restraining order will occur simply by removing the case to federal court) and the policies reflected in the time limitations of Rule 65(b) (stringent restrictions on the availability of ex parte restraining orders) can be accommodated by applying the rule that such a state court pre-removal order remains in force after removal no longer than it would have remained in effect under state law, but in no event longer than the Rule 65(b) time limitations, measured from the date of removal.  Pp.  415 U. S. 435-440.
(b) Accordingly, the order expired, by its terms, on May 30, 1970, under the 10-day limitation of Rule 65(b) applied from the date of removal; hence, no order was in effect on November 30, 1970, and the Union violated no order when it resumed its strike at that time.  P.  415 U. S. 440.
3. The District Court's denial of the Union's motion to dissolve the restraining order did not effectively convert the order into a preliminary injunction of unlimited duration.  Pp.  415 U. S. 440-445.
(a) That the Union may have had the opportunity to be heard on the merits of the preliminary injunction when it moved to dissolve the restraining order is not the controlling factor, since, under Rule 65(b), the burden was on petitioners to show that they were entitled to a preliminary injunction, not on the Union to show that they were not.  Pp.  415 U. S. 142-443.
(b) Where a court intends to supplant a temporary restraining order, which, under Rule 65(b), expires by its own terms within 10 days of issuance, with a preliminary injunction of unlimited duration pending a final decision on the merits or further order of the court, it should issue an order clearly saying so, and where it has not done so, a party against whom a temporary restraining order has issued may reasonably assume that the order has expired within Rule 65(b)'s time limits.  Here, since the only orders entered were a temporary restraining order and an order denying a motion to dissolve the temporary order, the Union had 
Page 415 U. S. 425
 no reason to believe that a preliminary injunction of unlimited duration had been issued.  Pp.  415 U. S. 443-445.
472 F.2d 764, affirmed.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of grand larceny and burglary following a trial in which the trial court, on motion of the prosecution, issued a protective order prohibiting questioning Green, a key prosecution witness, concerning Green's adjudication as a juvenile delinquent relating to a burglary and his probation status at the time of the events as to which he was to testify.  The trial court's order was based on state provisions protecting the anonymity of juvenile offenders.  The Alaska Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  Petitioner was denied his right of confrontation of witnesses under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  415 U. S. 315-321.
(a) The defense was entitled to attempt to show that Green was biased because of his vulnerable status as a probationer and his concern that he might be a suspect in the burglary charged against petitioner, and limiting the cross-examination of Green precluded the defense from showing his possible bias.  Pp.  415 U. S. 315-318.
(b) Petitioner's right of confrontation is paramount to the State's policy of protecting juvenile offenders, and any temporary embarrassment to Green by disclosure of his juvenile court record and probation status is outweighed by petitioner's right effectively to cross-examine a witness.  Pp.  415 U. S. 319-320.

Argued January 14-15, 1974
Decided February 27, 1974
415 U.S. 322

Syllabus 
At the time respondent company entered into a collective bargaining agreement with a union, respondent had a blanket rule against distribution by employees of literature on company property.  The collective agreement and subsequent contracts authorized the company to issue fair and nondiscriminatory rules for maintaining orderly conditions on plant property, and also provided for bulletin boards for union notices.  The union ultimately challenged the rule's validity, and, upon denial of its request for a change, filed unfair labor practice charges against respondent, which the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) upheld.  The Court of Appeals denied enforcement of the NLRB's order, finding that the union had waived objection to the on-premises distribution ban.
Held:  Respondent's ban might interfere with the employees' rights under  7 of the National Labor Relations Act ""to form, join, or assist labor organizations,"" or to refrain from such activities, and such rights, unlike those in the economic area, cannot be waived by the employees' collective bargaining representative.  The bulletin board provision did not afford an adequate alternative, since it did not give the union's adversaries equal access of communications with their fellow employees.  Pp.  415 U. S. 324-327.

This is an appeal from a decision of the Arizona Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of an Arizona statute requiring a year's residence in a county as a condition to an indigent's receiving nonemergency hospitalization or medical care at the county's expense.
Held:  The durational residence requirement, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, creates an ""invidious classification"" that impinges on the right of interstate travel by denying newcomers ""basic necessities of life.""  Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618.  Pp.  415 U. S. 253-270.
(a) Such a requirement, since it operates to penalize indigents for exercising their constitutional right of interstate migration, must be justified by a compelling state interest.  Shapiro v. Thompson, supra; Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330.  Pp.  415 U. S. 253-262.
(b) The State has not shown that the durational residence requirement is ""legitimately defensible"" in that it furthers a compelling state interest, and none of the purposes asserted as justification for the requirement -- fiscal savings, inhibiting migration of indigents generally, deterring indigents from taking up residence in the county solely to utilize the medical facilities, protection of longtime residents who have contributed to the community particularly by paying taxes, maintaining public support of the county hospital, administrative convenience in determining bona fide residence, prevention of fraud, and budget predictability -- satisfies the State's burden of justification and insures that the State, in pursuing its asserted objectives, has chosen means that do not unnecessarily impinge on constitutionally protected interests.

|415 u.s. 239|"United States v. Kahan
No. 73-428
Decided February 25, 1974
415 U.S. 239

Syllabus 
At respondent's arraignment for improperly receiving gratuities for official acts and for perjury before the grand jury, counsel was appointed to represent him at his request and after he stated he was without funds; he failed, in response to a question as to whether he had funds to employ an attorney, to disclose that he had access to certain savings accounts in which he had deposited $27,000.  On trial, his statements as to lack of funds were admitted as false exculpatory statements evincing his consciousness that the bank deposits were incriminating, and as evidence of willfulness in making statements before the grand jury with knowledge of their falsity.  The Court of Appeals, in reliance on Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377, reversed, holding that the admission of the false statements violated respondent's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
Held:  The incriminating component of respondent's pretrial statements derives, not from their content, but from his knowledge of their falsity, the truth of the matter being that he knew he was not indigent and did not have a right to the appointment of counsel.  Nor is there involved what was ""believed"" by the claimant to be a ""valid"" constitutional claim, hence respondent was not faced with the ""intolerable"" choice of having to surrender one constitutional right in order to assert another.  Simmons v. United States, supra, distinguished.
Certiorari granted; 479 F.2d 290, reversed and remanded.

On remand from this Court for reconsideration in light of Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U. S. 518, appellant's conviction of violating a New Orleans ordinance making it unlawful ""to curse or revile or to use obscene or opprobrious language toward or with reference to"" a police officer while in performance of his duties was again sustained by the Louisiana Supreme Court, which did not narrow or refine the words of the ordinance, although stating that it was limited to ""fighting words"" uttered to specific persons at a specific time.
Held:  The ordinance, as thus construed, is susceptible of application to protected speech, and therefore is overbroad in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and facially invalid.

Decided February 20, 1974
415 U.S. 143

Syllabus 
On the Government's application for an order authorizing a wiretap interception of the home telephones of respondent Irving Kahn, a suspected bookmaker, pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, the District Judge entered an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  2518, which described the telephones to be tapped and found probable cause to believe that Mr. Kahn and ""others as yet unknown"" were using the telephones to conduct an illegal gambling business, and authorized FBI agents to intercept wire communications ""of"" Mr. Kahn and ""others as yet unknown.""  The agents intercepted incriminating calls made by Mr. Kahn in Arizona to respondent Mrs. Kahn at their home in Chicago, and also incriminating calls made by Mrs. Kahn to ""a known gambling figure.""  The respondents were subsequently indicted for violating the Travel Act.  Upon being notified of the Government's intention to introduce the intercepted conversations at trial, respondents moved to suppress them.  The District Court granted the motion.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, construing the requirements of 18 U.S.C.  2518(1)(b)(iv) and 2518(4)(a) that the person whose communications are to be intercepted is to be identified, if known, as excluding from the term ""others as yet unknown"" any persons who careful Government investigation would disclose were probably using the telephones for illegal activities, and that, since the Government had not shown that further investigation of Mr. Kahn's activities would not have implicated his wife in the gambling business, she was not a ""person as yet unknown"" within the purview of the wiretap order.
Held:
1. Title III requires the naming of a person in the application or interception order only when the law enforcement authorities have probable cause to believe that that individual is ""committing the offense"" for which the wiretap is sought, and, since it is undisputed here that the Government had no reason to suspect Mrs. Kahn of complicity in the gambling business before the wiretapping

 began, it follows that, under the statute, she was among the class of persons ""as yet unknown"" covered by the wiretap order.  Pp.  415 U. S. 151-155.

No. 72-1355
Argued December 10-11, 1973
Decided February 20, 1974
415 U.S. 164

Syllabus 
Respondent was arrested in the front yard of a house in which he lived along with a Mrs. Graff (daughter of the lessees) and others.  The arresting officers, who did not ask him which room he occupied or whether he would consent to a search, were then admitted to the house by Mrs. Graff and, with her consent but without a warrant, searched the house, including a bedroom, which Mrs. Graff told them was jointly occupied by respondent and herself, and in a closet of which the officers found and seized money.  Respondent was indicted for bank robbery, and moved to suppress the seized money as evidence.  The District Court held that, where consent by a third person is relied upon as justification for a search, the Government must show, inter alia, not only that it reasonably appeared to the officers that the person had authority to consent, but also that the person had actual authority to permit the search, and that the Government had not satisfactorily proved that Mrs. Graff had such authority.  Although Mrs. Graff's statements to the officers that she and respondent occupied the same bedroom were deemed admissible to prove the officers' good faith belief, they were held to be inadmissible extrajudicial statements to prove the truth of the facts therein averred, and the same was held to be true of statements by both Mrs. Graff and respondent that they were married, which was not the case.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. When the prosecution seeks to justify a warrantless search by proof of voluntary consent, it is not limited to proof that consent was given by the defendant, but may show that permission to search was obtained from a third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.  Pp.  415 U. S. 169-172.
2. It was error to exclude from evidence at the suppression hearings Mrs. Graff's out-of-court statements respecting the joint occupancy of the bedroom, as well as the evidence that both respondent and Mrs. Graff had represented themselves as husband and wife.  Pp.  415 U. S. 172-177. 
Page 415 U. S. 165

(a) There is no automatic rule against receiving hearsay evidence in suppression hearings (where the trial court itself can accord such evidence such weight as it deems desirable), and under the circumstances here, where the District Court as satisfied that Mrs. Graff's out-of-court statements had, in fact, been made and nothing in the record raised doubts about their truthfulness, there was no apparent reason to exclude the declarations in the course of resolving the issues raised at the suppression hearings.  Pp.  415 U. S. 172-176.
(b) Mrs. Graff's statements were against her penal interest, since extramarital cohabitation is a state crime.  Thus, they carried their own indicia of reliability and should have been admitted as evidence at the suppression hearings, even if they would not have been admissible at respondent's trial.  Pp.  415 U. S. 176-177.
3. Although, given the admissibility of the excluded statements, the Government apparently sustained its burden of proof as to Mrs. Graff's authority to consent to the search, the District Court should reconsider the sufficiency of the evidence in light of this Court's opinion.  Pp.  415 U. S. 177-178.

No. 72-1052
Argued November 5, 1973
Decided February 20, 1974
415 U.S. 199

Syllabus 
Respondent Ruiz and his wife, Papago Indians, left their reservation in Arizona in 1940 to live in an Indian community a few miles away, and Ruiz found employment at a nearby mine.  During a prolonged strike, Ruiz applied for but was denied general assistance benefits under the Snyder Act by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) because of a provision in the BIA Manual limiting eligibility to Indians living ""on reservations"" (and in jurisdictions under the BIA in Alaska and Oklahoma).  After unsuccessful administrative appeals, respondents instituted this purported class action, claiming, inter alia, entitlement to such general assistance as a matter of statutory interpretation.  The District Court's summary judgment for petitioner was reversed by the Court of Appeals on the ground that the Manual's residency limitation was inconsistent with the broad language of the Snyder Act, that Congress intended general assistance benefits to be available to all Indians, including those in respondents' position, and that Congress' subsequent actions in appropriating funds for the BIA general assistance program did not serve to ratify the imposed limitation.
Held:
1. Congress did not intend to exclude from the BIA general assistance program these respondents, and their class, who are full-blooded, unassimilated Indians living in an Indian community near their native reservation and who maintain close economic and social ties with that reservation.  Pp.  415 U. S. 212-230.
(a) The legislative history of the subcommittee hearings regarding appropriations under the Snyder Act showing that the BIA's usual practice has been to represent to Congress that ""on or near"" reservations is the equivalent of ""on"" for purposes of welfare service eligibility, and that successive budget requests were for Indians living ""on or near,"" and not just for those living directly ""on,"" clearly shows that Congress was led to believe that 
Page 415 U. S. 200
 the programs were being made available to those nonassimilated Indians living near the reservation as well as to those living ""on,"" and a fair reading of such history can lead only to the conclusion that Indians situated near the reservation, such as respondents, were covered by the authorization.  Pp.  415 U. S. 213-229.
(b) The fact that Congress made appropriations during the time the ""on reservations"" limitation appeared in the BIA Manual does not mean that Congress implicitly ratified the BIA policy, where such limitation had not been published in the Federal Register or in the Code of Federal Regulations, and there is nothing in the legislative history to show that the limitation was brought to the appropriation subcommittees' attention, let alone to the entire Congress.  But, even assuming that Congress knew of the limitation when making appropriations, there is no reason to assume that it did not equate the ""on reservations"" language with the ""on or near"" category that continuously was described as the service area.  P.  415 U. S. 230.
2. Assuming, arguendo, that the Secretary rationally could limit the ""on or near"" appropriation to include only Indians who lived directly ""on"" the reservation (plus those in Alaska and Oklahoma), this has not been validly accomplished.  Pp.  415 U. S. 230-238.
(a) By not publishing its general assistance eligibility requirement in the Federal Register or in the Code of Federal Regulations, the BIA has failed to comply with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as to publication of substantive policies.  The Secretary's conscious choice not to treat this extremely significant requirement as a legislative type rule, renders it ineffective so far as extinguishing the rights of those otherwise within the class of beneficiaries contemplated by Congress.  Pp.  415 U. S. 232-236.
(b) Moreover, the BIA has failed to comply with its own internal procedures, since the ""on reservations"" limitation is clearly an important substantive policy within the class of directives -- those that ""inform the public of privileges and benefits available"" and of ""eligibility requirements"" -- that the BIA Manual declares are among those to be published.  P.  415 U. S. 235.
(c) Even assuming the lack of binding effect of the BIA policy, it is too late to argue that the words ""on reservations"" in the BIA Manual mean something different from ""on or near,"" and therefore are entitled to deference as an administrative interpretation 
Page 415 U. S. 201
 when in fact, the two have been continuously equated by the BIA to Congress.  Pp.  415 U. S. 236-237.

(b) The fact that Congress made appropriations during the time the ""on reservations"" limitation appeared in the BIA Manual does not mean that Congress implicitly ratified the BIA policy, where such limitation had not been published in the Federal Register or in the Code of Federal Regulations, and there is nothing in the legislative history to show that the limitation was brought to the appropriation subcommittees' attention, let alone to the entire Congress.  But, even assuming that Congress knew of the limitation when making appropriations, there is no reason to assume that it did not equate the ""on reservations"" language with the ""on or near"" category that continuously was described as the service area.  P.  415 U. S. 230.
2. Assuming, arguendo, that the Secretary rationally could limit the ""on or near"" appropriation to include only Indians who lived directly ""on"" the reservation (plus those in Alaska and Oklahoma), this has not been validly accomplished.  Pp.  415 U. S. 230-238.
(a) By not publishing its general assistance eligibility requirement in the Federal Register or in the Code of Federal Regulations, the BIA has failed to comply with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as to publication of substantive policies.  The Secretary's conscious choice not to treat this extremely significant requirement as a legislative type rule, renders it ineffective so far as extinguishing the rights of those otherwise within the class of beneficiaries contemplated by Congress.  Pp.  415 U. S. 232-236.
(b) Moreover, the BIA has failed to comply with its own internal procedures, since the ""on reservations"" limitation is clearly an important substantive policy within the class of directives -- those that ""inform the public of privileges and benefits available"" and of ""eligibility requirements"" -- that the BIA Manual declares are among those to be published.  P.  415 U. S. 235.
(c) Even assuming the lack of binding effect of the BIA policy, it is too late to argue that the words ""on reservations"" in the BIA Manual mean something different from ""on or near,"" and therefore are entitled to deference as an administrative interpretation 
Page 415 U. S. 201
 when in fact, the two have been continuously equated by the BIA to Congress.  Pp.  415 U. S. 236-237.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 The petitioner brought this federal habeas corpus action to challenge his Virginia conviction for possession of controlled drugs with intent to distribute. The District Court granted the writ as to one ground, challenged here by the State in the joined case of Neff v. Moran, 73-660, but rejected the petitioner's claim that evidence seized in a warrantless search should have been suppressed. The Court of Appeals affirmed in reliance upon the District Court's opinion. 
 An informer who had given accurate information in the past called State Police Investigator Mitchell concerning the possession and sale of controlled drugs at a 
Page 415 U.S. 940 , 941
 truck-stop motel. He provided Mitchell with a physical description of the petitioner and trailer-tractor rig, the license number of the rig, and the number of petitioner's motel room. Mitchell made no attempt to secure a search warrant based upon this information. Rather he called three other officers to his home where they arranged a plan whereby Mitchell would present himself to petitioner as a truck driver and attempt to purchase drugs. Two hours later the officers arrived at the motel, but found petitioner's room unoccupied and his truck absent. But soon afterward they saw the described rig on a nearby freeway. Mitchell pulled the truck over and informed petitioner that he had probable cause to believe that he was transporting illegal drugs, and that his vehicle would be searched. Petitioner came down from the rig and a search of his person revealed a vile containing five pills. A subsequent search inside the cab however produced a considerable cache of drugs in the glove compartment, a cigar box, a brief case, and a suit case, all of which had to be opened by the officers. 
 Petitioner here does not contest the District Court's conclusion that the officers had probable cause. But 'no amount of probable cause can justify a warrantless seizure,' Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 471. The District Court found, however, that there were exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless search, since here there was an 'out-of-state truck on a highway leading out of the jurisdiction.' The petitioner argues that there were no exigent circumstances precluding the police from securing a warrant in the first instance, before going to the motel room, or after stopping the truck. He draws support from the District Court's own findings. The informer provided the police with no information suggesting that petitioner would soon be leaving the motel, and it was not a perception [415 U.S. 940 , 942]

No. 72-822
Argued October 17, 1973
Decided February 19, 1974
415 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Respondents, whose profits on defense contracts are undergoing renegotiation pursuant to the Renegotiation Act of 1951, sued in the District Court under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to enjoin petitioner Board from withholding documents that respondents had requested and from conducting any further renegotiation proceedings until the documents were produced.  The District Court in each case granted injunctive relief.  The cases were consolidated on appeal and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the District Court had jurisdiction under the FOIA to enjoin administrative proceedings before petitioner and to order production of the documents.  Though noting that the FOIA nowhere authorizes injunctions of agency proceedings, the court concluded that Congress intended to confer broad equitable jurisdiction upon the district courts, and that ""temporary stays of pending administrative procedures may be necessary on occasion to enforce [FOIA] policy.""  The court also concluded that contractors had to exhaust their administrative remedies only under the FOIA, but not under the Renegotiation Act, before they were able to request injunctive relief against renegotiation proceedings, and that contractors' remedies before petitioner 
Page 415 U. S. 2
 and de novo proceedings in the Court of Claims as provided under the Renegotiation Act were inadequate to prevent irreparable harm.  Petitioner contends that the FOIA's provision in 5 U.S.C.  552(a)(3) for enjoining an agency from withholding its records and ordering the production of records improperly withheld from a complainant is the sole method of judicial enforcement.
Held:
1. The FOIA does not limit the inherent powers of an equity court to grant relief, as is manifest from the broad statutory language that Congress used, with its emphasis on disclosure, its carefully delineated exemptions, and the fact that  552(a) vests equitable jurisdiction in the district courts.  Pp.  415 U. S. 16-20.
2. In a renegotiation case, a contractor must pursue its administrative remedy under the Renegotiation Act, and cannot, through resort to preliminary litigation over an FOIA claim, obtain judicial interference with the procedures set forth in the Renegotiation Act.  Aircraft & Diesel Equipment Corp. v. Hirsch, 331 U. S. 752; Lichter v. United States, 334 U. S. 742; Macauley v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 327 U. S. 540.  Pp.  415 U. S. 20-25.
(a) It would contravene the Act's legislative purpose if judicial review by way of injunctive relief under FOIA were allowed to interrupt the process of bargaining that inheres in the statutory renegotiation scheme, and would delay the Government's recovery of excessive profits.  Pp.  415 U. S. 20-23.

No. 72-5847
Argued November 5, 1973
Decided February 19, 1974
415 U.S. 36

Syllabus 
Following discharge by his employer, respondent company, petitioner, a black, filed a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement between respondent and petitioner's union, which contained a broad arbitration clause, petitioner ultimately claiming that his discharge resulted from racial discrimination.  Upon rejection by the company of petitioner's claims, an arbitration hearing was held, prior to which petitioner filed with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission a racial discrimination complaint which was referred to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).  The arbitrator ruled that petitioner's discharge was for cause.  Following the EEOC's subsequent determination that there was not reasonable ground to believe that a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had occurred, petitioner brought this action in District Court, alleging that his discharge resulted from a racially discriminatory employment practice in violation of the Act.  The District Court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment, holding that petitioner was bound by the prior arbitral decision, and had no right to sue under Title VII.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  An employee's statutory right to trial de novo under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not foreclosed by prior submission of his claim to final arbitration under the nondiscrimination clause of a collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  415 U. S. 44-60.
(a) Title VII was designed to supplement, rather than supplant, existing laws and institutions relating to employment discrimination, as may be inferred from the legislative history of Title VII, which manifests a congressional intent to allow an individual to pursue rights under Title VII and other applicable state and federal statutes.  Pp.  415 U. S. 47-49.
(b) The doctrine of election of remedies is inapplicable in the present context, which involves statutory rights distinctly separate from the employee's contractual rights, regardless of the fact that violation of both rights may have resulted from the same factual occurrence.  Pp.  415 U. S. 49-51. 
Page 415 U. S. 37

(c) By merely resorting to the arbitral forum, petitioner did not waive his cause of action under Title VII; the rights conferred thereby cannot be prospectively waived, and form no part of the collective bargaining process.  Pp.  415 U. S. 51-52.
(d) The arbitrator's authority is confined to resolution of questions of contractual rights, regardless of whether they resemble or duplicate Title VII rights.  Pp.  415 U. S. 52-54.
(e) In instituting a Title VII action, the employee is not seeking review of the arbitrator's decision, and thus getting (as the District Court put it) ""two strings to his bow when the employer has only one,"" but is asserting a right independent of the arbitration process that the statute gives to employees, the only possible victims of discriminatory employment practices.  P.  415 U. S. 54.
(f) Permitting an employee to resort to the judicial forum after arbitration procedures have been followed does not undermine the employer's incentive to arbitrate, as most employers will regard the benefits from a no-strike pledge in the arbitration agreement as outweighing any costs resulting from giving employees an arbitral antidiscrimination remedy in addition to their Title VII judicial remedy.  Pp.  415 U. S. 54-55.
(g) A policy of deferral by federal courts to arbitral decisions (as opposed to adoption of a preclusion rule) would not comport with the congressional objective that federal courts should exercise the final responsibility for enforcement of Title VII and would lead to:  the arbitrator's emphasis on the law of the shop, rather than the law of the land; factfinding and other procedures less complete than those followed in a judicial forum; and perhaps employees bypassing arbitration in favor of litigation.  Pp.  415 U. S. 55-59.
(h) In considering an employee's claim, the federal court may admit the arbitral decision as evidence and accord it such weight as may be appropriate under the facts and circumstances of each case.  Pp.  415 U. S. 59-60.

Upon being notified that she was going to be discharged on a specific date from her position as a probationary Government employee, respondent filed this action claiming that the applicable Civil Service regulations for discharge of probationary employees had not been followed, and seeking a temporary injunction against her dismissal pending an administrative appeal to the Civil Service Commission (CSC).  The District Court granted a temporary restraining order, and, after an adversary hearing at which the Government declined to produce the discharging official as a witness to testify as to the reasons for the dismissal, ordered the temporary injunctive relief continued.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the Government's contention that the District Court had no authority to grant temporary injunctive relief in this class of cases, and holding that the relief granted was within the permissible bounds of the District Court's discretion.

Syllabus 
Petitioners, foreign-flag shipowners and agents, sought injunctive relief in the Texas state courts to bar, as tortious under Texas law, the picketing of their vessels by respondent unions, which were protesting as substandard the wages paid to the foreign crewmen, who manned the vessels.  The trial court sustained respondents' contention that state court jurisdiction was preempted by the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), and the appellate court affirmed.
Held:  Respondents' activities, which did not involve wages paid within this country, but were designed to force the foreign vessels to raise their operating costs to levels comparable to those of American shippers, would have materially affected the foreign ships' ""maritime operations"" and precipitated responses by the foreign shipowners in the field of international relations transcending the domestic wage-cost decision that the LMRA was designed to regulate.  Respondents' picketing was consequently not activity ""affecting commerce"" as defined in  2(6) and (7) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the LMRA, and the Texas courts erred in holding that they were prevented by the LMRA from entertaining petitioners' injunction suit.

American Radio Association, AFL-CIO
No. 72-1061
Argued December 3-4, 1973
Decided February 19, 1974
415 U.S. 104

Syllabus 
Petitioners, foreign-flag shipowners and agents, sought injunctive relief in the Texas state courts to bar, as tortious under Texas law, the picketing of their vessels by respondent unions, which were protesting as substandard the wages paid to the foreign crewmen, who manned the vessels.  The trial court sustained respondents' contention that state court jurisdiction was preempted by the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), and the appellate court affirmed.
Held:  Respondents' activities, which did not involve wages paid within this country, but were designed to force the foreign vessels to raise their operating costs to levels comparable to those of American shippers, would have materially affected the foreign ships' ""maritime operations"" and precipitated responses by the foreign shipowners in the field of international relations transcending the domestic wage-cost decision that the LMRA was designed to regulate.  Respondents' picketing was consequently not activity ""affecting commerce"" as defined in  2(6) and (7) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the LMRA, and the Texas courts erred in holding that they were prevented by the LMRA from entertaining petitioners' injunction suit.

Decided February 19, 1974
415 U.S. 125

Syllabus 
Respondent, relying for federal jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C.  1331(a), brought this action in District Court for the reasonable value of helium beyond what petitioner had already paid respondent for natural gas under the sales contract.  The District Court granted petitioner's motion to dismiss for lack of federal jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the basis of its decision in Northern Natural Gas Co. v. Grounds, 441 F.2d 704, a federal interpleader action, in which the court found that the statutory provisions in the Helium Act Amendments of 1960 and the Natural Cas Act do not apply to a sale of commingled helium as a component of the natural gas stream, and that natural gas rates authorized by the Federal Power Commission would thus not bar the seller from recovering the reasonable value of the helium constituent.
Held:  Respondent's suit is, in effect, an action in quantum meruit, whose source is state, and not federal, law.  Under the Grounds decision, supra, those federal statutory provisions do not create a federal right of recovery, but only preclude interposition of a plea of payment to defeat a quasi-contractual suit for the helium constituent, which is insufficient to support federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1331(a).  Gully v. First National Bank, 299 U. S. 109,  299 U. S. 113.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 The petitioner in this case challenges the admission at his trial for rape of certain self-incriminating statements. The statements were the result of police interrogation preceded by warnings which the petitioner asserts to be inadequate in light of the requirements enunciated in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). The warning petitioner received stated in pertinent part: 
 Petitioner contends that the right to appointed counsel only 'if and when he goes of court' is contrary to Miranda, supra, where we said: 
 The validity of warnings which advise only of some in futuro right to counsel is an issue on which lower courts are divided. Courts of Appeal for the Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuits have all concluded that such 
Page 415 U.S. 936 , 937
 warnings are inadequate compliance with Miranda. [Footnote 1] In this case the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit joined the Second, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits in holding the warnings adequate. [Footnote 2] State courts are also widely divided on this issue with Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Washington finding the warnings insufficient3 while Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, and New York have reached a contrary result. [Footnote 4] 

 We are, of course, the only source of resolution for this conflict and it is our obligation to provide uniformity on such important federal constitutional questions. In reforming the Court's jurisdiction in 1925 the purpose was to allow us to 'hear and determine those cases which should alone engage [our] attention,' since under the prior law the Court was 'hindered from . . . efficiently functioning in the performance of its highest duty of interpreting the Constitution and preserving uniformity of decision by the intermediate courts of appeals.' H.R.Rep.No.1075, 68th Cong., 2d Sess., at 2 (1925). Mr. Justice Van Devanter had told Congress that the prime consideration in the exercise of discretionary jurisdiction was 'whether the case is of such a character that the last word, the ultimate guiding rule, should be announced by the Supreme Court, so that there may be uniformity of decision in the several circuits courts of appeal, and also uniformity of decision in the State Courts insofar as federal matters are concerned.' Hearings before Subcomm. of Sen. Comm. on Judiciary, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., at 29-30 (1924).

Syllabus 
Respondent's husband, a longshoreman, was severely injured aboard petitioner's vessel in Louisiana navigable waters.  Shortly after termination of an action based on unseaworthiness, in which he recovered damages for past and future wages, pain and suffering, and medical and incidental expenses, the husband died, and respondent brought this maritime wrongful death action for damages suffered by her.  The District Court dismissed respondent's suit on grounds of res judicata and failure to state a claim.  The Court of Appeals reversed, on the basis of Morange v. States Marine Lines, 398 U. S. 375.
Held:  Respondent's maritime wrongful death action is not barred by decedent's recovery in his lifetime for damages for his personal injuries.  Pp.  414 U. S. 575-S95.
(a) Moragne v. States Marine Lines, supra, created a true wrongful death remedy that is founded upon the death itself, and is independent of any action the decedent may have had for his own personal injuries, and because respondent's suit thus involves a different cause of action from decedent's, it is not precluded by res judicata.  Pp.  414 U. S. 575-583.
(b) The maritime wrongful death remedy permits a decedent's dependents to recover damages for loss of support, services, and society, as well as damages for funeral expenses.  Pp.  414 U. S. 583-591.
(c) All but the first of the foregoing elements of damages could not accrue until the decedent's, death and therefore could not subject petitioner to double liability.

Syllabus 
Appellants, former federal probationary employees who were denied benefits under the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees Program, brought this action in District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against provisions of the Program and its implementing regulations that they contended operated to deny them a hearing on the factual basis for their removal from federal service, for the purpose of determining their eligibility under state law for unemployment compensation.  They claimed that the Act requires such a hearing and, alternatively, that the denial of a hearing deprived them of due process and equal protection.  A three-judge District Court held that the statute does not require a hearing to contest the employing agency's findings; dismissed the constitutional claims against the federal defendants for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; and held that the state agency's denial of a hearing did not violate the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses.
Held:  Any decision upon appellants' statutory or constitutional claims would be premature in view of the fact that the record does not disclose that the state agency, in notifying appellants of the adverse determinations, informed them, as it was required to do by the applicable regulation, of their ""right to additional information or reconsideration and correction"" of the findings by the employing agencies; or that appellants invoked the available procedure entitling them to request their agencies ""to reconsider and correct"" those findings.  The District Court's dismissal of the suit as to both federal and state defendants is therefore vacated with directions that the court determine whether appellants should be permitted to invoke the applicable administrative procedures.

Pregnant public school teachers brought these actions under 42 U.S.C.  1983 challenging the constitutionality of mandatory maternity leave rules of the Cleveland, Ohio (No. 72-777), and Chesterfield County, Virginia (No. 72-1129), School Boards.  The Cleveland rule requires a pregnant school teacher to take unpaid maternity leave five months before the expected childbirth, with leave application to be made at least two weeks before her departure.  Eligibility to return to work is not accorded until the next regular semester after her child is three months old.  The Chesterfield County rule requires the teacher to leave work at least four months, and to give notice at least six months, before the anticipated childbirth.  Reemployment is guaranteed no later than the first day of the school year after the date she is declared reeligible.  Both schemes require a physician's certificate of physical fitness prior to the teacher's return.  Each Court of Appeals reversed the court below, one holding the Chesterfield County maternity leave rule constitutional, the other holding the Cleveland rule unconstitutional.
Held:
1. The mandatory termination provisions of both maternity rules violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  414 U. S. 639-648.
(a) The arbitrary cutoff dates (which obviously come at different times of the school year for different teachers) have no valid relationship to the State's interest in preserving continuity of instruction, as long as the teacher is required to give substantial advance notice that she is pregnant.  Pp.  414 U. S. 639-643.
(b) The challenged provisions are violative of due process, since they create a conclusive presumption that every teacher who is four or five months pregnant is physically incapable of 
Page 414 U. S. 633
 continuing her duties, whereas any such teacher's ability to continue past a fixed pregnancy period is an individual matter, and the school boards' administrative convenience alone cannot suffice to validate the arbitrary rules.  Pp.  414 U. S. 643-648.
2. The Cleveland three-month return provision also violates due process, being both arbitrary and irrational.  It creates an irrebuttable presumption that the mother (whose good health must be medically certified) is not fit to resume work, and it is not germane to maintaining continuity of instruction, as the precise point a child will reach the relevant age will occur at a different time throughout the school year for each teacher.  Pp.  414 U. S. 648-650.
3. The Chesterfield County return rule, which is free of any unnecessary presumption, comports with due process requirements.  P.  414 U. S. 650.

Syllabus 
Pregnant public school teachers brought these actions under 42 U.S.C.  1983 challenging the constitutionality of mandatory maternity leave rules of the Cleveland, Ohio (No. 72-777), and Chesterfield County, Virginia (No. 72-1129), School Boards.

||"Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida, New York
No. 72-851
Argued November 6-7, 1973
Decided January 21, 1974
414 U.S. 661

Syllabus 
Petitioners brought this action for the fair rental value for a specified period of certain land in New York that the Oneidas had ceded to the State in 1795, alleging, inter alia, that the Oneidas had owned and occupied the land from time immemorial to the time of the American Revolution; that, in the 1780's and 1790's, various treaties with the United States had confirmed their right to possession of the land until purchased by the United States; that, in 1790, the treaties had been implemented by the Nonintercourse Act forbidding the conveyance of Indian lands without the United States' consent; and that the 1795 cession was without such consent, and hence ineffective to terminate the Oneidas' right to possession under the treaties and applicable federal statutes.  The District Court, ruling that the action arose under state law, dismissed the complaint for failure to raise a question arising under the laws of the United States within the meaning of either 28 U.S.C.  1331 or 28 U.S.C.  1362.  The Court of Appeals, relying on the ""well pleaded complaint rule"" of Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U. S. 74, affirmed and held that, although the decision would ultimately depend on whether the 1795 cession complied with the Nonintercourse Act, and what the consequences would be if it did not, this alone did not establish ""arising under"" jurisdiction because the federal issue was not one of the necessary elements of the complaint, which essentially sought relief based on the right to possession of real property.
Held:  The complaint states a controversy arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the District Court under 28 U.S.C.  1331 and 1362.  Pp.  414 U. S. 666-682.
(a) Petitioners asserted a current right to possession conferred by federal law, wholly independent of state law, the threshold allegation required of such a well pleaded complaint -- the right to possession -- being plainly enough alleged to be based on federal law so that the federal law issue did not arise solely in anticipation of a defense.  Pp.  414 U. S. 666,  414 U. S. 677. 
Page 414 U. S. 662

(b) Petitioners' claim of a federal right to possession governed wholly by federal law is not so insubstantial or devoid of merit as to preclude a federal controversy within the District Court's jurisdiction, regardless of how the federal issue is ultimately resolved.  Pp.  414 U. S. 666-667.
(c) Indian title is a matter of federal law, and can be extinguished only with federal consent.  Pp.  414 U. S. 670-674.
(d) This is not a case where the underlying right or obligation arises only under state law and federal law is merely alleged as a barrier to its effectuation.  Gully v. First National Bank, 299 U. S. 109, distinguished.  Pp.  414 U. S. 675-676.
(e) In sustaining the District Court's jurisdiction, the well pleaded complaint rule of Taylor v. Anderson, supra, is not disturbed, since here the right to possession itself is claimed to arise under federal law in the first instance, and allegedly aboriginal title of an Indian tribe guaranteed by treaty and protected by statute has never been extinguished.  P.  414 U. S. 676.
(f) The complaint satisfies the requirement that it reveal a dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction, or effect of a federal law upon the determination of which the result depends.  Pp.  414 U. S. 677-678.
(g) The conclusion that this case arises under the laws of the United States comports with the language and legislative history of 25 U.S.C.  233 granting to New York civil jurisdiction over disputes between Indians or between Indians and others.  Pp.  414 U. S. 678-682.

No. 72-1058
Argued November 6, 1973
Decided January 16, 1974
414 U.S. 524

Syllabus 
Appellants, who are incarcerated in jail as convicted misdemeanants or pretrial detainees unable to make bail but who are under no voting disability under state law, and who requested but were denied the right to register and vote under mobile registration, absentee voting, or other procedures, brought this action challenging the constitutionality of the New York election laws.  The contested statutes allow qualified persons to register and vote by absentee measures if precluded from personally doing so because of illness, physical disability, their duties, occupation, or business, and permit absentee voting (but not registration) if the voters are vacationing away from their residence on election day or are confined in a veterans' hospital.  The state trial and intermediate appellate courts initially viewed appellants' confinement as physical disability and held that they were entitled to vote by absentee ballot.  The New York Court of Appeals reversed that determination, concluding that the disability imposed by incarceration did not come within the terms of the statute.
Held:
The challenged provisions as thus construed, which raise no question of disenfranchisement of persons convicted of criminal conduct and permit incarcerated persons to register and vote by absentee means if confined in a county where they are not residents, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as they arbitrarily discriminate between categories of qualified voters.

|414 u.s. 538|"American Pipe & Construction Co. v. Utah
No. 72-1195
Argued November 12, 1973
Decided January 16, 1974
414 U.S. 538

Syllabus 
Eleven days short of a year after a final consent judgment had been entered against petitioners in civil actions by the Government to restrain federal antitrust violations (which actions had been filed almost four years before entry of that judgment), the State of Utah commenced a Sherman Act treble damages class action against petitioners, in which the State purported to represent various state and local agencies and certain other Western States.  The action was found to be timely under the federal four-year statute of limitations governing antitrust suits ( 4B of the Clayton Act) because of  5(b) of that Act providing that, whenever the United States institutes any proceeding to restrain antitrust violations, the running of the statute of limitations in respect of every private right of action arising under such laws and based on any matter complained of in such proceeding shall be suspended during the pendency thereof and for one year thereafter.  The District Court thereafter granted petitioners' motion for an order pursuant to Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(c)(1) that the suit could not be maintained as a class action, the court finding that, although the prerequisites to a class action contained in Rule 23(a)(2) through (4) had been met, the requirement of Rule 23(a)(1) that ""the class [be] so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable"" was not satisfied.  Eight days after entry of this order, respondent towns,municipalities, and water districts, all of which had been claimed as members of the original class, moved to intervene as plaintiffs in Utah's action, either as of right under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 24(a)(2) or by permission under Rule 24(b)(2), but the District Court denied this motion, concluding that the limitation period had run as to all those respondents, and had not been tolled by institution of the class action.  The Court of Appeals reversed as to denial of permission to intervene under Rule 24(b)(2), finding that as to the members of the class Utah purported 
Page 414 U. S. 539
 to represent, suit was actually commenced by Utah's filing of the class action.
Held:
1. The commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the requirement of Rule 23(a)(1) been met, and here, where respondents, who were purported members of the class, made timely motions to intervene after the District Court had found the suit inappropriate for class action status, the institution of the original class suit tolled the limitations statute for respondents.  Pp.  414 U. S. 552-556.
2. A judicial tolling of the statute of limitations does not abridge or modify a substantive right afforded by the antitrust acts; the mere fact that a federal statute providing for substantive liability also sets a time limitation upon the institution of suit does not restrict the power of the federal courts to hold that the statute of limitations is tolled under certain circumstances not inconsistent with the legislative purpose.  Pp.  414 U. S. 556-559.
3. The District Court's determination, in denying permission to intervene, that respondents were absolutely barred by the statute of limitations was not an unreviewable exercise of discretion, but rather a conclusion of law which the Court of Appeals correctly found to be erroneous.  Pp.  414 U. S. 559-560.
4. The commencement of the class action suspended the running of the limitations period only during the pendency of the motion to strip the suit of its class action character.  Since the class action was filed with 11 days yet to run in the period as tolled by  5(b), the intervenors had 11 days after entry of the order denying them participation in the class suit in which to move to file their intervention motion.  Their filing only 8 days after the entry of such order was thus timely.  Pp.  414 U. S. 560-561.

The District Court thereafter granted petitioners' motion for an order pursuant to Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(c)(1) that the suit could not be maintained as a class action, the court finding that, although the prerequisites to a class action contained in Rule 23(a)(2) through (4) had been met, the requirement of Rule 23(a)(1) that ""the class [be] so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable"" was not satisfied.  Eight days after entry of this order, respondent towns,municipalities, and water districts, all of which had been claimed as members of the original class, moved to intervene as plaintiffs in Utah's action, either as of right under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 24(a)(2) or by permission under Rule 24(b)(2), but the District Court denied this motion, concluding that the limitation period had run as to all those respondents, and had not been tolled by institution of the class action.  The Court of Appeals reversed as to denial of permission to intervene under Rule 24(b)(2), finding that as to the members of the class Utah purported 
Page 414 U. S. 539
 to represent, suit was actually commenced by Utah's filing of the class action.
Held:
1. The commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the requirement of Rule 23(a)(1) been met, and here, where respondents, who were purported members of the class, made timely motions to intervene after the District Court had found the suit inappropriate for class action status, the institution of the original class suit tolled the limitations statute for respondents.  Pp.  414 U. S. 552-556.
2. A judicial tolling of the statute of limitations does not abridge or modify a substantive right afforded by the antitrust acts; the mere fact that a federal statute providing for substantive liability also sets a time limitation upon the institution of suit does not restrict the power of the federal courts to hold that the statute of limitations is tolled under certain circumstances not inconsistent with the legislative purpose.  Pp.  414 U. S. 556-559.
3. The District Court's determination, in denying permission to intervene, that respondents were absolutely barred by the statute of limitations was not an unreviewable exercise of discretion, but rather a conclusion of law which the Court of Appeals correctly found to be erroneous.  Pp.  414 U. S. 559-560.
4. The commencement of the class action suspended the running of the limitations period only during the pendency of the motion to strip the suit of its class action character.  Since the class action was filed with 11 days yet to run in the period as tolled by  5(b), the intervenors had 11 days after entry of the order denying them participation in the class suit in which to move to file their intervention motion.  Their filing only 8 days after the entry of such order was thus timely.  Pp.  414 U. S. 560-561.
473 F.2d 580, affirmed.

No. 72-953
Argued October 17, 1973
Decided January 15, 1974
414 U.S. 488

Syllabus 
Respondents, 17 black and two white residents of Cairo, Illinois, brought a civil rights class action against petitioners, a magistrate and a circuit court judge, who allegedly engaged under color of state law, in a continuing pattern and practice of conduct consisting of illegal bond-setting, sentencing, and jury fee practices in criminal cases, which assertedly deprived respondents and members of their class of their rights under the Constitution and 42 U.S.C.  1981-1983, 1985.  The District Court dismissed the action for want of jurisdiction to issue the injunctive relief sought and on the ground of judicial immunity.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that issuance of injunctions against judicial officers was not forbidden if their conduct was intentionally racially discriminatory against a cognizable class of persons.  Absent sufficient remedy at law, it was held that, if respondents proved their allegations, the District Court should fashion appropriate relief to enjoin petitioners from depriving others of their constitutional rights while carrying out their judicial duties in the future.
Held:
1. The complaint fails to satisfy the threshold requirement of Art. III of the Constitution that those who seek to invoke the power of federal courts must allege an actual case or controversy where none of the named plaintiffs is identified as himself having suffered any injury in the manner specified, the claim alleging injury is in only the most general terms, and there are no allegations that any relevant state criminal statute is unconstitutional on its face or as applied or that plaintiffs have been or will be improperly charged with violating criminal law.  Pp.  414 U. S. 493-499.
(a) If none of the named plaintiffs purporting to represent a class meets the case or controversy requirement, none may seek relief on behalf of himself or any other member of the class.  Pp.  414 U. S. 494-495. 
Page 414 U. S. 489

(b) That requirement is not satisfied by general assertions or inferences that, in the course of their activities, respondents will be prosecuted for violating valid criminal laws.  P.  414 U. S. 497.
(c) Where it can only be speculated whether respondents will be arrested for violating an ordinance or state statute, particularly in the absence of allegations that unconstitutional criminal statutes are being employed to deter constitutionally protected conduct, and respondents have not pointed to any imminent prosecutions contemplated against them so that they do not claim any constitutional right to engage in conduct proscribed by therefore presumably permissible state laws, or that it is otherwise their intention to so conduct themselves, the threat of injury from the alleged course of conduct they attack is too remote to satisfy the case or controversy requirement and permit adjudication by a federal court.  Pp.  414 U. S. 497-498.
2. Even if the complaint were considered to present an existing case or controversy, no adequate basis for equitable relief has been stated.  Pp.  414 U. S. 499-504.
(a) The injunctive relief sought by respondents would constitute a ma, or continuing intrusion of the equitable power of the federal courts into the daily conduct of state criminal proceedings, and would sharply conflict with recognized principles of equitable restraint, Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37.  Pp.  414 U. S. 499-502.
(b) Respondents also failed to establish the basic requisites of the issuance of equitable relief -- the likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury, and the inadequacy of remedies at law -- in view of the conjectural nature of the threatened injury to which respondents are allegedly subjected, and where there are available other procedures, both state and federal, which could provide relief.

414 U.S. 514

Syllabus 
Respondents, 17 black and two white residents of Cairo, Illinois, brought a civil rights class action against the then State's Attorney of Alexander County, Illinois, individually and in his official capacity, charging him with certain purposeful racial discrimination practices, under color of state law, in violation of the Constitution and 42 U.S.C.  1981-1983, 1985.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a prosecutor's quasi-judicial immunity from injunctive proscription was not absolute, and that, since respondents' remedies at law were inadequate, an injunctive remedy might be available if respondents could prove their claims.  Subsequent to the Court of Appeals' decision, petitioner was elected as successor State's Attorney, and, in the petition for certiorari filed with this Court, was substituted as a party.
Held:
Where, on the record, respondents have never charged petitioner with anything, and do not presently seek to enjoin him from doing anything, so that there may no longer be a controversy between respondents and any Alexander County State's Attorney concerning injunctive relief to be applied in futuro, the case is vacated and remanded to the Court of Appeals for a determination, in the first instance, of whether the former dispute is now moot and whether respondents will want to, and should be permitted to, amend their complaint to include claims for relief against petitioner.

Petitioner, who had three prior felony convictions, moved for commitment as a narcotic addict pursuant to Title II of the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966 (NARA), following a fourth felony conviction.  The District Court held that the NARA's ""two prior felony"" exclusion precluded the requested commitment, rejecting petitioner's post-sentence motion to vacate his sentence on the ground that the ""two prior felony"" exclusion violated equal protection as embodied in the Fifth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Title II of NARA does not deny due process or equal protection by excluding from rehabilitative commitment, in lieu of penal incarceration, addicts with two or more prior felony convictions, since Congress could rationally assume that an addict with a multiple felony record is likely to benefit less from rehabilitative treatment, present a possible impediment to the successful treatment of others, and be a greater threat to society upon release, because of that record.

Syllabus 
The application of appellants (the Communist Party of Indiana, certain of its officers and potential voters, and its candidates for President and Vice President) for a place on the Indiana ballot for the 1972 general election was rejected for failure to submit a statutory loyalty oath stating that the Party ""does not advocate the overthrow of local, state or national government by force or violence.""  Appellants, contending that the statute was unconstitutional, thereupon filed this action in the District Court for injunctive and declaratory relief.  On September 28, 1972, a three-judge court declared the statute constitutional and ordered the Election Board to place the Party on the ballot, but only if the required oath was submitted.  After a qualified oath submitted by the Party was rejected, appellants, on October 3, sought a District Court order directing the Board to accept such oath, and, on the same day, the Board requested reconsideration of the September 28 order.  The next day, the District Court denied both motions.  On October 10, appellants filed a notice of appeal to this Court, which it later sought to withdraw so that the District Court might act on appellants' motion of the same day that the September 28 order be amended in certain respects.  On October 31, the District Court allowed withdrawal of the appeal notice, but denied the motion to amend.  Appellants refiled their notice of appeal to this Court on November 29, which appellees contend is untimely.
Held:
1. Appellants' notice of appeal was within the 60-day appeal period prescribed by 28 U.S.C.  2101(b), since appellees' October 3 motion for reconsideration suspended the finality of the September 28 judgment until the District Court's denial of such motion on October 4 restored it, so that the time for appeal thus began to run from October 4.  Pp.  414 U. S. 45-44.
2. The loyalty oath requirement of the Indiana statute violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  414 U. S. 446-450. 
Page 414 U. S. 442

(a) The principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to produce such action, applies to state regulation burdening access to the ballot, rights of association in the political party of one's choice, casting an effective ballot, and in running for office, which are interests as substantial as those in other areas that this Court has protected against statutory schemes contrary to the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  414 U. S. 448-449.
(b) For purposes of determining whether to grant a place on the ballot, a group advocating violent overthrow as abstract doctrine need not be regarded as necessarily advocating unlawful action.  Pp.  414 U. S. 449-450.

After a qualified oath submitted by the Party was rejected, appellants, on October 3, sought a District Court order directing the Board to accept such oath, and, on the same day, the Board requested reconsideration of the September 28 order.  The next day, the District Court denied both motions.  On October 10, appellants filed a notice of appeal to this Court, which it later sought to withdraw so that the District Court might act on appellants' motion of the same day that the September 28 order be amended in certain respects.  On October 31, the District Court allowed withdrawal of the appeal notice, but denied the motion to amend.  Appellants refiled their notice of appeal to this Court on November 29, which appellees contend is untimely.
Held:
1. Appellants' notice of appeal was within the 60-day appeal period prescribed by 28 U.S.C.  2101(b), since appellees' October 3 motion for reconsideration suspended the finality of the September 28 judgment until the District Court's denial of such motion on October 4 restored it, so that the time for appeal thus began to run from October 4.  Pp.  414 U. S. 45-44.
2. The loyalty oath requirement of the Indiana statute violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  414 U. S. 446-450. 
Page 414 U. S. 442

(a) The principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to produce such action, applies to state regulation burdening access to the ballot, rights of association in the political party of one's choice, casting an effective ballot, and in running for office, which are interests as substantial as those in other areas that this Court has protected against statutory schemes contrary to the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  414 U. S. 448-449.
(b) For purposes of determining whether to grant a place on the ballot, a group advocating violent overthrow as abstract doctrine need not be regarded as necessarily advocating unlawful action.  Pp.  414 U. S. 449-450.
Reversed.

Syllabus 
Respondent brought this action to enjoin discontinuance of certain passenger trains on the ground that such discontinuance was prohibited by the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (Amtrak Act).  The District Court dismissed the action on the ground that respondent lacked standing under  307(a) of the Amtrak Act, which confers jurisdiction on federal district courts to grant equitable relief on petition of the Attorney General or, in a case involving a labor agreement, on petition of any affected employee, including authorized employee representatives, if Amtrak or any railroad acts inconsistently with the Act or fails to discharge its responsibilities thereunder.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent did have standing, and that  307(a) does not otherwise bar such a suit by an allegedly aggrieved private party.
Held:  Section 307(a), in light of its express language, and the legislative history of that provision and of the Act as a whole, provides the exclusive remedies for breaches of any duties or obligations imposed by the Act, and no additional private cause of action to enforce compliance with the Act can properly be inferred.

No. 72-734
Argued October 11, 1973
Decided January 8, 1974
414 U.S. 338

Syllabus 
When respondent's place of business was being searched by federal agents under a warrant issued in connection with a gambling investigation and specifying that the object of the search was to discover and seize bookmaking records and wagering paraphernalia, one agent, knowing of a pending federal investigation of loansharking activities, discovered and seized a suspected loansharking record.  Subsequently, a grand jury investigating loansharking activities subpoenaed respondent to query him on the seized evidence, but he refused to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds.  After the Government then requested transactional immunity for respondent, the District Court granted respondent's suppression motion on the grounds that the affidavit supporting the warrant was insufficient and that the search exceeded the scope of the warrant, and further ordered that respondent need not answer any of the grand jury's questions based on the suppressed evidence.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  A witness summoned to appear and testify before a grand jury may not refuse to answer questions on the ground that they are based on evidence obtained from an unlawful search and seizure.  Pp.  414 U. S. 342-355.
(a) The exclusionary rule, under which evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment or the fruits of such evidence cannot be used in a criminal proceeding against the victim of the illegal search and seizure, is a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect on future unlawful police conduct, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.  Pp.  414 U. S. 347-348.
(b) Despite its broad deterrent purpose, the rule does not proscribe the use of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons, and its application has been restricted to those areas where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served.  P.  414 U. S. 348.
(c) Allowing a grand jury witness to invoke the exclusionary rule would unduly interfere with the effective and expeditious discharge 
Page 414 U. S. 339
 of the grand jury's duties, and extending the rule to grand jury proceedings would achieve only a speculative and minimal advance in deterring police misconduct at the expense of substantially impeding the grand jury's role.  Pp.  414 U. S. 349-352.
(d) Grand jury questions based on evidence obtained from an unlawful search and seizure involve no independent governmental invasion of privacy, but rather the usual abridgment thereof common to all grand jury questioning.  Such questions are only a derivative use of the product of a past unlawful search and seizure, and work no new Fourth Amendment wrong.  Pp.  414 U. S. 353-355.

No. 72-782
Argued October 15, 1973
Decided January 8, 1974
414 U.S. 368

Syllabus 
Certain foremen at petitioner company's coal mine were suspended for falsifying records to show no reduction in airflow at the mine when, in fact, the airflow had been substantially reduced because of the collapse of a ventilation structure.  When the company reinstated the foremen while criminal charges were pending against them, the miners, who are represented by respondent union, struck to protest the alleged safety hazard created by retention of the foremen.  The union refused the company's offer to arbitrate.  The company then brought this action under  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, contending that the broad arbitration clause of the collective bargaining agreement governed the dispute.  The District Court issued a preliminary injunction requiring the union to end the strike and submit to arbitration, and ordered suspension of the two foremen pending the arbitral decision.  The Court of Appeals reversed and vacated the injunction, holding that there was a public policy disfavoring compulsory arbitration of safety disputes and that, absent an express provision of the collective bargaining agreement, the union had no contractual duty to submit the controversy to arbitration, and hence no implied obligation not to strike.
Held:
1. The arbitration clause of the collective bargaining agreement covering, inter alia, ""any local trouble of any kind aris[ing] at the mine,"" is sufficiently broad to encompass the instant dispute, the foremen's continued presence in the mine being plainly a local issue.  Pp.  414 U. S. 374-380.
(a) On its face, such contractual language admits of only one interpretation:  that the agreement required the union to submit this dispute to arbitration for resolution by an impartial umpire.  P.  414 U. S. 376.
(b) The ""presumption of arbitrability"" (an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute, and doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage), Steelworkers v. American

2. The duty to arbitrate imposed by the collective bargaining agreement gave rise to an implied no-strike obligation supporting issuance of an injunction against a work stoppage since, in the absence of an explicit expression negating any implied no-strike obligation, the agreement to arbitrate and the duty not to strike should be construed as having coterminous application.  Pp.  414 U. S. 380-384.
3. On the facts,  502 of the Labor Management Relations Act providing that the quitting of labor by employees in good faith because of abnormally dangerous conditions for work shall not be deemed a strike, did not deprive the District Court of authority to enforce the no-strike obligation, the suspension of the foremen pending a final arbitral decision having eliminated any safety issue.  Pp.  414 U. S. 385-387.
4. The circumstances of this case satisfy the traditional equitable considerations controlling the availability of injunctive relief, Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, 398 U.

414 U.S. 395

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of violating the federal mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C.  1341, by devising a scheme to defraud through unlawfully obtaining possession from one Meredith of a credit card issued by a Louisville bank, which respondent used to obtain goods and services from motel operators in various States knowing that the operators to whom he presented the card for payment would mail the sales slips to the Louisville bank, which would in turn mail them to Meredith.  Section 1341 makes it a crime, inter alia, for a person who has devised a scheme to defraud or for obtaining money or property by means of false pretenses for the purpose of executing the scheme knowingly to cause to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon any thing delivered by the Postal Service.  The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of conviction on the ground that  1341 was inapplicable to respondent's conduct.
Held:  The mailings were not sufficiently closely related to respondent's scheme to bring his conduct within the statute.  Though mailings were to be directed to adjusting the accounts between respondent's victims (the motels, the Louisville bank, and Meredith), they were not for the purpose of executing the scheme embraced by the statute, since that scheme had already reached fruition when respondent checked out of the motel, and did not depend on which of his victims ultimately bore the loss.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 7, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Appellate Department of the Superior Court of California, County of Alameda. 
 Petition for writ of certiorari granted, judgment vacated and case remanded to the Appellate Department of the Superior Court of California, County of Alameda, for further consideration in light of Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973); Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49 (1973); Kaplan v. California, 413 U.S. 115 (1973); United States v. 12 200-ft.

Kentucky, 413 U.S. 496d 757 (1973); and Alexander v. Virginia, 413 U.S. 836 (1973).
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were convicted on charges of exhibiting allegedly obscene motion pictures in violation of the California Penal Code 311.2(a), which provides as follows: 
Page 414 U.S. 1122 , 1123
 distribute, distributes, or exhibits to others, any obscene matter is guilty of a misdemeanor.'
 It is my view that, 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the state and federal governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.' Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (dissenting opinion of Brennan, J.). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 311.2(a) is unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Appellate Department of the Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the County of Alameda, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with my Paris Adult dissent.

 It is my view that, 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the state and federal governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.' Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (dissenting opinion of Brennan, J.). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 311.2(a) is unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Appellate Department of the Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the County of Alameda, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with my Paris Adult dissent.

 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were convicted in the United States District Court of the Southern District of Florida of using the mails to distribute allegedly obscene materials in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1461, which provides in pertinent part as follows:

 'Is declared to be nonmailable matter and shall not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier.
 The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, 490 F.2d 78 ( 1974). 
 I adhere to my dissent in United States v. Orito, 413 U.S. 139, 147, in which, speaking of 18 U.S.C. 1462, which is similar in scope to 1461, I expressed the view that '[w]hatever the extent of the Federal Government's power to bar the distribution of allegedly obscene material to juveniles or the offensive exposure of such material to unconsenting adults, the statute before us is clearly overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.' Id., at 147-148. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was rendered after Orito, reverse.* In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 483, 494 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that any state or federal ban on, or regulation of, obscenity is prohibited by the Constitution, Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 43-48; Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413; U.S. 49, 70-73, would grant certiorari in this case and summarily reverse. 
 Finally, it does not appear from the petition and response that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v.

 '(a) any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy book, pamphlet, picture, motion-picture film, paper, letter, writing, print, or other matters of indecent character.
 * * * * * 
 The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the conviction. 
 I adhere to my dissent in United States v. Orito, 413 U.S. 139, 147, in which, speaking of 18 U.S.C. 1462, I expressed the view that '[w]hatever the extent of the Federal Government's power to bar the distribution of allegedly obscene material to juveniles or the offensive exposure of such material to unconsenting adults, the statute before us is clearly overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.' Id., at 147-148. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973 ), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit was rendered after Orito, reverse.' * 
 In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 483, 494 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). 
 Finally, it does not appear from the petition and response that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 141, 2919 (1974), I believe that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, petitioner must be given an opportunity to have his case decided on, and introduce evidence relevant to, the [418 U.S. 926 , 928]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Virginia. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted after a jury trial in the Corporation Court of the city of Norfolk, Virginia, of selling

 obscene items. The statute under which he was convicted, 18.1-228, Code of Virginia of 1950 as amended, provides in pertinent part that: 
 As used in that section, 
 The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed by order on July 11, 1972. This Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), and companion cases. The Supreme Court of Virginia again affirmed the conviction. 
 It is my view that 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.'

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that any federal ban on obscenity is prohibited by the First Amendment (see United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, 413 U.S. 123, 130-138 (1973) (Douglas, J., dissenting)), would grant certiorari and reverse the judgment of conviction.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted in the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions of presenting an obscene film in violation of D.C.Code 22-2001( a)(1)(B), which provides in pertinent part: 'It shall be unlawful in the District of Columbia for a person knowingly . . . to present . . . any obscene, indecent, or filthy play, dance, motion picture, or other performance.' The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of

 Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), and companion cases. The Court of Appeals again affirmed. 
 It is my view that 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of thier allegedly 'obscene' contents.' Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). 
 It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 2001(a)(1)( B) is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals was rendered after Miller, reverse.'* 
 In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 483, 494, 495 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). 
 Moreover, on the basis of the Court's own holding in Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153 (1974), its denial of certiorari is improper. As permitted by Supreme Court Rule 21(1), which provides that the record in a case need not be certified to this Court, the petitioner did not certify the allegedly obscene materials involved in this case. It is plain, therefore, that the Court, which has not requested the certification of those materials, has failed to discharge its admitted responsibility under Jenkins independently to review those materials under the second and third parts of the Miller obscenity test. Nor can it be as- [418 U.S. 942 , 944]

 J-R DISTRIBUTORS, INC., et al.v. State of WASHINGTON.No. 73-937. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 25, 1974
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of washington. 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that any state ban on obscenity is prohibited by the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth (see Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 70-73 (1973) (Douglas, J., dissenting)), would grant certiorari and reverse the judgment of conviction. 

 Opinion of Mr. Justice WHITE. 
 In this case and in 13 other cases involving issues dealing with obscenity, Mr. Justice BRENNAN complains that by denying certiorari or dismissing an appeal, the Court has failed to pass independently on the obscenity of the materials involved. This is a task which he has insisted, see Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 187-190 (1964), that the Court must perform under the approach to obscenity which he espoused and explicated for the Court in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957), which he refined for himself and others in Jacobellis v. Ohio, supra; Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413 (1966); Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463 (1966); Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502 (1966); Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968), but which he has now repudiated. 
Page 418 U.S. 949 , 950
 Brother BRENNAN's complaints are wide of the mark. Obscenity cases, like others, are not immune from the standards generally governing the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction. The Court has never indicated that plenary review is mandatory in every case dealing with the issue of obscenity. 
 In five of these cases,1 the issue whether the materials involved are obscene was not presented to this Court and the publications themselves were not lodged here. Rule 23(1)(c) of this Court's rules provides that '[ o]nly the questions set forth in the petition or fairly comprised therein will be considered by the court.' Rule 15(1)(c) with respect to appeals is to the identical effect. I suggest that we are entitled to follow our own rules. See R. Stern and E. Gressman, Supreme Court Practice 6.37, at 297- 299 (4th ed. 1969). 
 In six other cases,2 the issue of obscenity vel non is among the questions presented here, but the materials themselves have not been filed with this Court. While our rules permit parties to dispense with filing the entire record at the petition for certiorari stage, a petitioner is completely free at that time to file all or any part of the record he deems necessary or desirable to present clearly the issues he wants reviewed. Indeed, our Rule 23(4) states that '[t]he failure of a petitioner to present with accuracy, brevity, and clearness whatever is essential to a ready and adequate understanding of the points requiring consideration will be a sufficient reason for denying his petition.'

|419 u.s. 1007|" 419 U.S. 1007 
 NEW ORLEANS BOOK MART, INC., et al.v. UNITED STATES.No. 73-1824. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 11, 1974
 Rehearing Denied Jan. 13, 1975. 
 See 419 U.S. 1116. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were convicted in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana of transporting allegedly obscene materials in interstate commerce for the purpose of sale in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1465, which provides in pertinent part: 
 The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, 490 F.2d 73 (CA5 1974). 
 I adhere to my dissent in United States v. Orito, 413 U.S. 139, 147 (1973), in which, speaking of 18 U.S.C. 1462, which is similar in scope to 1465, I expressed the view that '[w] hatever the extent of the Federal Government's power to bar the distribution of allegedly 
Page 419 U.S. 1007 , 1008
 obscene material to juveniles or the offensive exposure of such material to unconsenting adults, the statute before us is clearly overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.' Id., at 147-148. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was rendered after Orito, reverse.* In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 483, 494 (1973 ) (Brennan, J., dissenting). 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that any state or federal ban on, or regulation of, obscenity is prohibited by the Constitution, Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 508; Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 43-48; Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 70-73, would grant certiorari and summarily reverse. 
 Finally, it does not appear from the petition and response that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974), I believe that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, petitioners must be given an opportunity to have their case decided on, and introduce evidence relevant to, the legal standard upon which their convictions have ultimately come to depend. Thus, even on its own terms, the Court should vacate the judgment below and remand for a determination whether petitioners should be afforded a new trial under local community standards. 
[Footnote *] Although four of us would grant and reverse, the Justices who join this opinion do not insist that the case be decided on the merits.

 Michael KENSINGERv. State of OHIO.No. 74-226. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 16, 1974
 Rehearing Denied Feb. 18, 1975. 
 See 420 U.S. 939, 1151. 
 The stays (A-1282 and A-1283) heretofore granted on July 9, 1974, by Mr. Justice STEWART are hereby vacated. 
 The appeals are dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Appellants were convicted in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio, of possession of allegedly obscene materials with intent to distribute the materials in violation of Ohio Revised Code 2905.35, which provided in pertinent part at the time of the alleged offense as follows: 
Page 419 U.S. 1062 , 1063
 or possess or have in his control any obscene material with intent to violate this section . . ..'
 As used in 2905.35, 
 On appeal, the Court of Appeals of Hamilton County affirmed the convictions. The Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed the appeals. 
 It is my view that 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.' [419 U.S. 1062 , 1064]

 William F. BUCKLEY, Jr., et al.v. AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TELEVISION AND RADIO ARTISTS.No. 74-313. 
 Fulton LEWIS, IIIv. AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TELEVISION AND RADIO ARTISTS.No. 74-314. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 23, 1974
 Rehearing Denied Feb. 24, 1975. 
 See 420 U.S. 956. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of New York. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting. 
 These cases, as I view them, present the issue of whether a person suffers an infringement of his First Amend- 
Page 419 U.S. 1093 , 1094
 ment rights when he is compelled to pay union dues (or their equivalent) as a precondition to expressing his ideas through a public broadcasting medium. [Footnote 1] 

 In Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 (1956), a union shop agreement authorized under the Railway Labor Act was challenged under the First and Fifth Amendments. While holding on the merits that a union shop requirement does not violate those Amendments, we held that the Railway Labor Act provision governing union shop agreements constitute sufficient governmental action to require consideration of the constitutional issues: '[T]he federal statute is the source of power and authority by which any private rights are lost or sacrificed.' Id., at 232. We left open the possibility that a membership or dues requirement might, in some circumstances, be imposed in contravention of the First Amendment, though no such problem was presented on the record in that case. 
 In Hanson, governmental action was based on the Railway Labor Act, which provided that state 'right to work' laws were superseded and that a union shop agreement was permissible notwithstanding such laws. Id., at 231-232. Thus that federal Act placed 'the imprimatur of the federal law' upon union shop agreements. The Taft-Hartley Act (in contrast) authorizes union shop agreements only in the absence of contrary state law. 29 U.S.C. 164(b). Yet there still is a substantial argument in favor of a holding that a union shop agreement under the NLRA bears the imprimatur of federal law. 
 The fact that 8(a)(3)2 is phrased in permissive rather than mandatory terms would not, in and of itself, [419 U.S. 1093 , 1095]
