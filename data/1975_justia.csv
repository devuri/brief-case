No. 74-966
Argued October 14, 1975
Decided December 16, 1975
423 U.S. 150

Syllabus 
Respondent's decedent, a seaman, was discharged for misconduct from petitioner's ship while it was docked in South Vietnam.  Because of South Vietnamese currency regulations and other complications precluding paying the seaman in American currency the wages due him that he had earned prior to his discharge, petitioner purchased for him an airline ticket to the United States for $510, and this ticket, together with a wage voucher for $118.5, representing wages due less the $510, were given to him.  When the seaman arrived back in the United States, he received the $118.45.  Subsequently he sued petitioner, claiming that it had withheld $510 in wages from him.  He contended that petitioner was liable to him for the $510, and for an added sum pursuant to 46 U.S.C.  596, which requires the master or owner of a vessel making foreign voyages to pay a discharged seaman his wages within four days after the discharge, and, upon refusal or neglect to make such payment ""without sufficient cause,"" to pay the seaman a sum equal to two days' pay for every day during which payment is delayed.  Finding that the seaman had consented to the purchase of the airline ticket for his purposes with his money and that such purchase therefore constituted a partial payment of wages, the District Court held that petitioner had not refused or neglected to pay, and hence was not liable under  596.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  596 requires that wage payments be made directly to the seaman, and that therefore the $510 paid to the airline could not be regarded as a partial payment of wages.  On remand, the District Court assessed damages pursuant to  596, and the Court of Appeals dismissed an appeal from this assessment.
Held:  Under the circumstances, the transaction resulting in the seaman's receipt of an airline ticket purchased with money owed to him as wages constituted a payment of wages, and therefore there was no refusal or neglect to make payment, and hence no liability, under  596.  Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U. S. 779, distinguished.  Since the transaction was a partial payment of wages and not a ""deduction 
Page 423 U. S. 151
 from"" wages, the requirement of 46 U.S.C.  642 that a ship's master enter wage deductions in the logbook does not apply, and thus the master's failure to make a logbook entry that the $510 had been paid does not bar viewing the transaction as a partial payment of wages.  Pp.  423 U. S. 156-160.
Reversed and remanded; see 488 F.2d 469.

 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT for the DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEYv. Arthur Lawrence ABRAMS.No. 75-487. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 15, 1975
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Mr. Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Mr. Justice POWELL joins, dissenting. 
 The Court of Appeals has advanced the novel doctrine that when the federal court acts on a record made in state disciplinary proceedings the federal court's power to discipline a member of its bar in circumscribed by the scope of the penalty imposed by the state courts. It has always seemed clear to me that the federal courts have plenary power over the admission, disbarment, or discipline of attorneys who practice before them. See Cheatham, The Reach of Federal Action Over the Profession of Law, 18 Stan.L.Rev. 1288, 1291-1292 (1966). The federal courts are not bound by the standards of professional conduct prescribed or enforced by the States any more than States are bound by federal action. A federal court may well determine that conduct found tolerable by another jurisdiction merits disbarment in federal court, as our actions disciplining members of this Court's bar implicitly demonstrate. See, e. g., In re Disbarment of Osborne, 420 U.S. 918 (1975); In re Disbarment of Buttles, 419 U.S. 1101 (1975); In re Disbarment of Mades, 414 U.S. 1154 ( 1974). A federal court must apply state law in diversity cases, but there is not the slightest reason to do so in judging the conduct of members of its own bar. 
 I do not share the view that this is a subject not warranting the time for full briefing and argument here. Granting that the burdens of our calendar do not permit full review of all we might desire, the issue here seems so 
Page 423 U.S. 1038 , 1039
 clear that we could appropriately grant the writ and reverse the judgment summarily.

 2. Motion to expedite denied. Mr. Justice BRENNAN, Mr. Justice STEWART, and Mr. Justice MARSHALL would grant motion. 
 3. Application for stay denied. Mr. Justice BRENNAN, Mr. Justice STEWART, and Mr. Justice MARSHALL would grant application. Mr. Justice WHITE would stay judgment of the Nebraska Supreme Court to the extent that its order forbade the publication of information disclosed in public at the preliminary hearing in the criminal case out of which this case arose. In this respect, he is in disagreement with the Court's actions in this case today. He joins the Court in granting the petition for writ of certiorari and in ordering plenary consideration of this case, which as he understands it raises issues broader than the power of the State to enjoin the publication of facts disclosed at a public hearing in a State court. Being convinced that these questions should be decided only after adequate briefing and argument and ample time for mature consideration, he is in agreement that we should not attempt to hear and decide this case prior to the beginning of the criminal trial in early January.

Argued October 6, 1975
Decided December 9, 1975
423 U.S. 96

Syllabus 
Respondent, who had been arrested in connection with certain robberies and advised by a detective in accordance with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, that he was not obliged to answer any questions and that he could remain silent if he wished, and having made oral and written acknowledgment of the Miranda warnings, declined to discuss the robberies, whereupon the detective ceased the interrogation.  More than two hours later, after giving Miranda warnings, another detective questioned respondent solely about an unrelated murder.  Respondent made an inculpatory statement, which was later used in his trial for murder, which resulted in his conviction.   The appellate court reversed on the ground that Miranda mandated a cessation of all interrogation after respondent had declined to answer the first detective's questions.
Held:  The admission in evidence of respondent's incriminating statement did not violate Miranda principles.  Respondent's right to cut off questioning was scrupulously honored, the police having immediately ceased the robbery interrogation after respondent's refusal to answer and having commenced questioning about the murder only after a significant time lapse and after a fresh set of warnings had been given respondent.

Argued October 7, 1975
Decided December 9, 1975
423 U.S. 122

Syllabus 
Respondent, a licensed physician registered under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C.  801 et seq., was convicted of knowing and unlawful distribution and dispensation of methadone (a controlled substance or addictive drug used in the treatment of heroin addicts) in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1), which makes it unlawful for ""any person"" knowingly or intentionally to distribute or dispense a controlled substance, except as authorized by the CSA.  The evidence disclosed that respondent prescribed large quantities of methadone for patients without giving them adequate physical examinations or specific instructions for its use and charged fees according to the quantity of methadone prescribed, rather than fees for medical services rendered.  The Court of Appeals, however, reversed the conviction on the grounds that respondent was exempted from prosecution under  841 by virtue of his status as a registrant and that a registrant can be prosecuted only under  842 and 843, which prescribe less severe penalties than  841.
Held:  Registered physicians can be prosecuted under  841 when, as here, their activities fall outside the usual course of professional practice.  Pp.  423 U. S. 131-145.
(a) Only the lawful acts of registrants under the CSA are exempted from prosecution under  841.  That section, by its terms, reaches ""any person,"" and does not exempt (as it could have) ""all registrants"" or ""all persons registered under the Act.""  The language of the qualified authorization of  822(b), which authorizes registrants to possess, distribute, or dispense controlled substances to the extent authorized by their registration and in conformity with other CSA provisions, and which was added merely to ensure that persons engaged in lawful activities could not be prosecuted, cannot be fairly read to support the view that all activities of registered physicians are beyond the reach of  841 simply because of their status.  Pp.  423 U. S. 131-133.
(b) There is no indication in the operative language of  841-843 that Congress intended to establish two mutually exclusive 
Page 423 U. S. 123
 penalty systems, with nonregistrants to be punished under  841 and registrants under  842 and 843, the fact that the term ""registrants"" is used in some subsections of  842 and 843, but not in  841, being of limited significance.  Moreover, the legislative history indicates that Congress was concerned with the nature of the drug transaction, rather than with the defendant's status.  Pp.  423 U. S. 133-135.
(c) It is immaterial whether respondent also could have been prosecuted for the relatively minor offense of violating  829 with respect to the issuing of prescriptions, since there is nothing in the statutory scheme or the legislative history that justifies a conclusion that a registrant who may be prosecuted for violating  829 is thereby exempted from prosecution under  841 for the significantly greater offense of acting as a drug ""pusher.""  Pp.  423 U. S. 135-138.
(d) The scheme of the CSA, viewed against the background of the legislative history, reveals an intent to limit a registered physician's dispensing authority to the course of his ""professional practice.""  Pp.  423 U. S. 138-143.
(e) Congress was concerned that the drug laws not impede legitimate research, and that physicians be allowed reasonable discretion in treating patients, but it did not intend to exempt from serious criminal penalties those acts by physicians that go beyond the limits of approved professional practice.  Pp.  423 U. S. 143-145.

Pp.  423 U. S. 80-86.
(a) Nothing on the face of  191, and no potential difficulty in administering it, require any distinction between liquidated and unliquidated debts for purpose of the statutory priority; the statute's language looks to the time of payment, rather than the time when the assignment is made.  P.  423 U. S. 83.
(b) To construe the words ""debts due to the United States"" as including unliquidated claims and as not being restricted to those obligations that would on the date of the assignment have given rise to a common law action for debt, comports with the treatment of unliquidated claims in the Bankruptcy Acts, including the current Act.  Pp.  423 U. S. 83-85.
(c) The obligations in question were fixed and independent of ""events after insolvency,"" and only the precise amount of those obligations awaited future events.  Pp.  423 U. S. 85-86.

No. 74-884
Argued October 6, 1975

423 U.S. 87

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C.  1715, which proscribes mailing pistols, revolvers, and ""other firearms capable of being concealed on the person,"" by having sent a 22-inch sawed-off shotgun through the mails.  There was evidence at the trial that the gun could be concealed on an average person.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the quoted portion of  1715 was so vague as to violate due process.  In addition to the constitutional claim respondent contends that, as a matter of statutory construction, particularly in light of the ejusdem generis doctrine, the quoted portion does not embrace sawed-off shotguns.
Held:
1. The narrow reading of the statute urged by respondent does not comport with the legislative purpose of making it more difficult for criminals to obtain concealable weapons, and the rule of ejusdem generis may not be used to defeat that purpose.  Here, a properly instructed jury could have found the shotgun mailed by respondent to have been a ""firearm capable of being concealed on the person"" within the meaning of  1715.  Pp.  423 U. S. 90-91.
2. Section 1715 intelligibly forbids a definite course of conduct (mailing concealable firearms) and gave respondent adequate warning that mailing the gun was a criminal offense.  That Congress might have chosen ""[c]learer and more precise language"" equally capable of achieving its objective does not mean that the statute is unconstitutionally vague.  United States v.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 1, 1975
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL concurs, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were arrested on August 31, 1971, and charged with permitting a room to be used for gambling, a misdemeanor, Ohio Rev.Code Ann. 2915.01 (Anderson 1975), and with possession of numbers game tickets, a felony, Ohio Rev.Code Ann. 2915.111 (Anderson 1975). On March 6, 1972, petitioners were tried and convicted of the first charge in the Municipal Court of Franklin County, Ohio. They were subsequently indicted on the felony charge in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, and they filed a motion to 
Page 423 U.S. 1006 , 1007
 dismiss the indictment as violative of double jeopardy based on the previous conviction for a misdemeanor arising out of the same criminal episode. The trial court overruled the motion to dismiss, and the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioners' complaint seeking habeas corpus. In re Susi, 38 Ohio App.2d 73, 313 N.E.2d 422 (1973). The same court then dismissed petitioners' claim for a writ of prohibition, and this dismissal was affirmed on appeal by the Ohio Supreme Court. Ohio ex rel. Susi v. Flowers, 43 Ohio St.2d 11, 330 N.E.2d 662 (1975). 
 Thus, the State seeks to try petitioners on two charges in separate trials, although the charges clearly arose out of the same criminal transaction or episode. In that circumstance, we should grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the denial of petitioners' complaint seeking a writ of prohibition. I adhere to the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 (1969), requires the joinder at one trial, except in extremely limited circumstances not present here, of 'all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction.'

Syllabus 
Tennessee statute proscribing ""crime against nature"" held not unconstitutionally vague as applied to cunnilingus, satisfying as it does the due process standard of giving sufficient warning that men may so conduct themselves as to avoid that which is forbidden.  Viewed against that standard, the challenged statutory phrase is no vaguer than many other terms describing criminal offenses at common law, which are now codified in criminal codes.  Moreover, the Tennessee Supreme Court, by previously rejecting claims that the statute was to be narrowly applied, has given sufficiently clear notice that it would be held applicable to acts such as those involved here when such a case as this arose.  Wainwright v. Stone, 414 U. S. 21, and Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347, distinguished.

 Appellants insist that the judgment of the District Court is wrong under our holding in Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974), while appellees insist that it is consistent with that case. But this case comes here as an appeal from an order of a three- judge District Court enjoining the enforcement of a state statute, a question not even present in Milliken. The three-judge District Court by its order of April 16, 1975, enjoined appellants from relying upon1

 provisions of a Delaware statute which by their terms had expired six years earlier. Because in doing so I believe the District Court decided an issue that is demonstrably moot, I would reverse its judgment on this point. Since the additional question of whether the Milliken issues briefed by the parties are properly before us under any conceivable theory is one which veritably bristles with jurisdictional problems, I would note probable jurisdiction and set the case for argument on these points. The Court's summary affirmance, in my opinion, not only wrongfully upholds an erroneous injunction issued by the District Court, but because of the difficult jurisdictional questions present in this case leaves totally beclouded and uncertain what is decided by that summary affirmance.

 On October 12, 1973, the prosecuting attorney for Adams County, Ind., filed in the Adams Circuit Court a petition to enjoin and abate appellee's motion picture theatre as a public nuisance. On the same day the Circuit Court entered a temporary restraining order with a notice and summons to appear for a hearing on a temporary injunction. Additionally, a subpoena duces tecum issued, ordering appellee to produce before the Court the film 'Deep Throat' and all other motion pictures in his possession, and also a list of the titles and play dates of all motion pictures exhibited by him over the past three years. 
 The prosecutor was proceeding under the Indiana obscenity public nuisance statute, supra. The Statute provides that a place which exhibits obscene films is a public nuisance,1 and provides for a court order requiring the closure for up to one year of any place determined to be a public nuisance. [Footnote 2] An ex parte restraining order may issue up to 10 days without any prior judicial determination of the obscenity of specific films, and a preliminary injunction may issue if after hearing the allegations of the complaint 'are sustained to the satisfaction of the court.'3 The statute further provides that at trial the 'general reputation of the place' is both admissible and prima facie evidence for proving the existence of the nuisance. [Footnote 4] If a nuisance is established at trial, an order closing the theatre for a year and confiscating all personal property and contents therein shall issue. [Footnote 5] The owner of a theatre closed by either preliminary or permanent injunction may obtain a release from the closing order [423 U.S. 976 , 978]

Argued October 8, 1975
Decided November 12, 1975
423 U.S. 28

Syllabus 
Respondent Brada Miller and petitioner Transamerican, two licensed motor carriers, made an agreement whereby respondent leased a vehicle to petitioner, to be operated by respondent's driver over petitioner's authorized route.  Under the lease, petitioner was to
""have the control and responsibility for the operation of said equipment in respect to the public, shippers and Interstate Commerce Commission,""
but respondent agreed to indemnify petitioner for claims arising out of respondent's negligence, though the indemnification clause specifically did not limit petitioner's liability to the public in connection with the use of the leased equipment.  While the vehicle was being operated under the lease, an accident occurred, and a suit was brought against the carriers predicated on the negligence of the vehicle's driver.  Petitioner settled the claim, and then sought recovery against respondent in District Court under the indemnification clause.  That court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the clause contravened an ICC regulation requiring that lease agreements between regulated carriers must contain a written undertaking that ""control and responsibility for the operation of the equipment shall be that of the lessee.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed, reasoning that, since respondent, contrary to the intent of the regulation, had agreed to bear the costs of its own negligence, it had assumed control and responsibility, and that the indemnification clause was ineffective.
Held:  The indemnification agreement entered into by petitioner and respondent does not contravene ICC's ""control and responsibility"" requirement.  Pp.  423 U. S. 35-43.
(a) An indemnification agreement violates the ICC requirement only if the lessor was in control of the service provided, as well as of the vehicle's physical operation.  Here, control over the vehicle, as agreed between the parties, remained in petitioner, and the furnishing of respondent's driver involved only ministerial 
Page 423 U. S. 29
 control, and not delegation of responsibility for the shipment.  Pp.  423 U. S. 38-40.
(b) Nor did the indemnification provision conflict with ICC safety regulations, because such a provision, which places ultimate financial responsibility on the negligent lessor, may tend to increase, rather than diminish, protection of the public.  P.  423 U. S. 41.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
Respondents were convicted of murder and sentenced to death.  The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the convictions, but reversed and remanded to the trial court on the punishment issue.  Shortly thereafter, the Governor commuted the death sentences to 99 years' imprisonment, and the State immediately petitioned for a rehearing in the Court of Criminal Appeals, which sustained the commutations and held its remand ""for naught,"" thus affirming the convictions and sentences, as modified.  After the State Supreme Court denied certiorari, respondents sought habeas corpus in the Federal District Court, claiming, inter alia, that their Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated by the illegal commutations, but the District Court dismissed on this issue for failure to exhaust state remedies.  On respondents' appeal, the Court of Appeals held that, since the death sentences had been vacated at the time of the Governor's order, there were no death sentences to commute, and hence the commutations were invalid.
Held:
1. Whether or not respondents' sentences were subject to commutation, and the extent of the Governor's authority under the circumstances, are questions of Tennessee law which the State Criminal Appeals Court resolved in favor of the Governor's action, and it was not a federal habeas court's province to reexamine these questions.

 Lyman A. MOORE v. State of ILLINOIS.No. 74-6464. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 3, 1975
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice STEWART filed a separate statement: 
 The petitioner's Illinois conviction for first-degree murder was upheld by a closely divided vote in this Court in 1972, Moore v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786. Moore had there urged that the state prosecutor's failure to disclose certain exculpatory evidence violated the principles of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83. The Court's ruling that Brady had not been violated was based on its interpretation of testimony given in a state post-conviction hearing by a prosecution witness named Sanders. 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. 
 Sanders had testified at Moore's trial that two days after the murder a person known to Sanders as 'Slick' had told Sanders that it was 'open season on bartenders' and had confessed that he had shot a bartender in Lansing, a nearby town. (The victim of the murder for which Moore was prosecuted was a bartender in Lansing.) At the trial Sanders had also testified to the effect that it was Moore who had made these incriminating statements. In a pretrial statement not disclosed to the defense, Sanders had told the police that he had first met Slick 'about six months ago' in a local tavern. Evidence adduced at the posttrial hearing proved that Sanders could not have met Moore then because Moore had been incarcerated in Leavenworth Penitentiary at the time, and Sanders acknowledged that Moore thus could not have been the man he knew as 'Slick.' This Court viewed these posttrial revelations as indicating only that Sanders had misidentified Moore as 'Slick' but not as impeaching Sanders' trial testimony that it was Moore who had confessed to the shooting of a bartender in Lansing. Accordingly, the Court concluded that 
Page 423 U.S. 938 , 939
 'Sanders' misidentification of Moore as Slick was not material to the issue of guilt.' 408 U.S., at 797. Four Justices in dissent interpreted Sanders' posttrial testimony as an acknowledgment that 'it was impossible that petitioner was the man with whom he had spoken' about the shooting of the bartender in Lansing. 408 U.S., at 804. 
 After this Court's decision, Sanders executed an affidavit stating that it was inded 'Slick,' and not Moore, who had confessed to the shooting of the Lansing bartender. On the basis of this affidavit the petitioner again turned to the state courts in an effort to overturn his conviction. Over the strong dissent of Mr. Justice Schaefer, those courts denied him relief on the ground that Sanders' affidavit lacked sufficient credibility. People v. Moore, 60 Ill.2d 379, 327 N.E.2d 324. I do not quarrel with today's denial of Moore's petition for certiorari, for we cannot from this vantage point intelligently reassess the state courts' determination of questions of credibility. I write only to point out that those questions will be fully amenable to reassessment in a federal habeas corpus proceeding. See Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293.

 On , with reckless driving of an automobile in- 
Page 423 U.S. 902 , 903
 volved in an accident on Sept. 10, 1971, which resulted in the deaths of two people. On Oct. 12, 1971, the Grand Jury of Benton County, Ia., indicted petitioner for manslaughter arising from the same set of circumstances as formed the basis of the reckless-driving charge. On Dec. 3, 1971, petitioner was found guilty of reckless driving in Justice of the Peace Court and was sentenced to serve 30 days in the county jail and to pay the costs of the action. Subsequently, petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the manslaughter indictment on the ground that prosecution for manslaughter constituted double jeopardy because of his prior conviction for reckless driving based on the same transaction. The motion to dismiss was overruled, and thereafter petitioner was tried and convicted for manslaughter. Petitioner appealed the manslaughter conviction to the Iowa Supreme Court. That court, divided 5 to 4 on the double jeopardy issue, affirmed the conviction. State v. Stewart, 223 N.W.2d 250 (1974). 
 The two charges leveled against petitioner clearly arose out of the same criminal transaction or episode, yet they were tried separately. In that circumstance, we should grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the manslaughter conviction. I adhere to the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 (1969), requires the joinder at one trial, except in extremely limited circumstances not present here, of 'all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction.' Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 453-454 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring). See Waugh v. Gray, 422 U.S. 1027 (1975) (Brennan, J., dissenting); Wells v.

 volved in an accident on Sept. 10, 1971, which resulted in the deaths of two people. On Oct. 12, 1971, the Grand Jury of Benton County, Ia., indicted petitioner for manslaughter arising from the same set of circumstances as formed the basis of the reckless-driving charge. On Dec. 3, 1971, petitioner was found guilty of reckless driving in Justice of the Peace Court and was sentenced to serve 30 days in the county jail and to pay the costs of the action. Subsequently, petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the manslaughter indictment on the ground that prosecution for manslaughter constituted double jeopardy because of his prior conviction for reckless driving based on the same transaction. The motion to dismiss was overruled, and thereafter petitioner was tried and convicted for manslaughter. Petitioner appealed the manslaughter conviction to the Iowa Supreme Court. That court, divided 5 to 4 on the double jeopardy issue, affirmed the conviction. State v. Stewart, 223 N.W.2d 250 (1974). 
 The two charges leveled against petitioner clearly arose out of the same criminal transaction or episode, yet they were tried separately. In that circumstance, we should grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the manslaughter conviction. I adhere to the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 (1969), requires the joinder at one trial, except in extremely limited circumstances not present here, of 'all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction.' Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 453-454 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring). See Waugh v. Gray, 422 U.S. 1027 (1975) (Brennan, J., dissenting); Wells v. Missouri, 419 U.S. 1075 (1974) (Brennan, J., dissenting); Moton v. Swenson, 417 U.S. 957, 94 S. Ct. 3086 (1974) (Brennan, J., dissenting); [423 U.S. 902 , 904]

Syllabus 
In the course of an action to compel federal officials to comply with Executive Order No. 11246 (which requires Government contractors to ensure nondiscriminatory employment practices), the District Court entered an order requiring the General Services Administration (GSA) to disclose information reporting on affirmative action programs and related matters filed with the GSA by Government contractors represented by the applicant.  Applicant sought a stay of that order after having been denied a stay by the Court of Appeals.  Even though there is a substantial question whether the information is privileged by virtue of  709(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the application must be denied because applicant has failed to show that the irreparable injury which allegedly would result from disclosure is imminent.

Syllabus 
The Fourth Amendment held not to allow a roving patrol of the Border Patrol to stop a vehicle near the Mexican border and question its occupants about their citizenship and immigration status, when the only ground for suspicion is that the occupants appear to be of Mexican ancestry.  Except at the border and its functional equivalents, patrolling officers may stop vehicles only if they are aware of specific articulable facts, together with rational inferences therefrom, reasonably warranting suspicion that the vehicles contain aliens who may be illegally in the country.  Pp.  422 U. S. 878-887.
(a) Because of the important governmental interest in preventing the illegal entry of aliens at the border, the minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border, an officer whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain suspicious circumstances; but any further detention or search must be based on consent or probable cause.   Pp.  422 U. S. 878-882.
(b) To allow roving patrols the broad and unlimited discretion urged by the Government to stop all vehicles in the border area without any reason to suspect that they have violated any law, would not be ""reasonable"" under the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  422 U. S. 882-883.
(c) Assuming that Congress has the power to admit aliens on condition that they submit to reasonable questioning about their right to be in the country, such power cannot diminish the Fourth Amendment rights of citizens who may be mistaken for aliens.  The Fourth Amendment therefore forbids stopping persons for questioning about their citizenship on less than a reasonable suspicion that they may be aliens.  Pp.  422 U. S. 883-884.

Three corporations (M & L, Salem, and Tim-Rob), on August 9, 1973, filed a complaint in District Court, seeking a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and declaratory relief, against Doran, a law enforcement official, claiming that a North Hempstead, N.Y., ordinance proscribing topless dancing, which the corporations had provided as entertainment in their bars, violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The District Court denied the prayer for a temporary restraining order instanter, and set the motion for a preliminary injunction for hearing on August 22.  On August 10, M & L, alone of the three corporations, which had theretofore complied with the ordinance, resumed topless dancing, whereupon it was served with criminal summonses.  Thereafter, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the ordinance against the corporations ""pending the final determination of this action.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the ""ordinance would have to fall"" and rejecting Doran's claim that the District Court should have dismissed the complaint on the authority of Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, and companion cases, which it concluded did not bar relief as to Salem and Tim-Rob because there had been no prosecution against them under the ordinance.  A different result for M & L was not deemed warranted in view of the interests of avoiding contradictory outcomes, of conserving judicial energy, and of having a clear-cut method for determining when federal courts should defer to state prosecutions.  Doran appealed under 28 U.S.C.  1254(2), which gives this Court appellate jurisdiction at the behest of a party relying on a state statute held unconstitutional by a court of appeals.
Held:
1. The issues, which were neither briefed nor argued, whether  1254(2) applies to a review of the affirmance of a preliminary injunction or is confined to review of a final judgment, and whether the Court of Appeals, in fact, held the ordinance unconstitutional, need not be resolved, since this Court has certiorari jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  2103, under which this matter can be reviewed.  P.  422 U. S. 927. 
Page 422 U. S. 923

2. The question of entitlement to relief in the light of Younger v. Harris, supra, and companion cases, should be considered as to each corporation separately, and not in the light of contradictory outcomes and other factors relied upon by the Court of Appeals when it lumped the three plaintiffs together.  Pp.  422 U. S. 927-929.
3. Younger squarely bars injunctive relief, and Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66, bars declaratory relief for M & L in view of the fact that, when the criminal summonses were issued on the days immediately following the filing of the federal complaint, the federal litigation was in an embryonic stage, and no contested matter had been decided.  P.  422 U. S. 929.
4. Salem and Tim-Rob, against whom no criminal proceedings were pending, were not subject to Younger's restrictions in seeking declaratory relief.  Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S. 452.  Those two corporations could also seek preliminary injunctive relief without regard to Younger's restrictions, since, prior to a final judgment, a declaratory remedy cannot afford relief comparable to a preliminary injunction.  Pp.  422 U. S. 930-931.
5. In the circumstances of this case and in the light of existing case law, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting preliminary injunctive relief to Salem and Tim-Rob.  Pp.  422 U. S. 931-934.
(a) The District Court was entitled to conclude that Salem and Tim-Rob satisfied one of the two traditional requirements for securing a preliminary injunction, viz., showing irreparable injury, because they made uncontested allegations that, absent such relief, they would suffer a substantial business loss, and perhaps even bankruptcy.  Pp.  422 U. S. 931-932.
(b) The District Court was also entitled to conclude that those corporations satisfied the other traditional requirement for interim relief by showing a likelihood that they would prevail on the merits, since they were, inter alia, challenging (and had standing to challenge, Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,  408 U. S. 115) a ""topless"" ordinance as being unconstitutionally overbroad in its application to protected activities at places that do not serve liquor as well as to places that do.  See California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109,  409 U. S. 118.  Pp.  422 U. S. 932-934.

No. 74-8

Decided June 26, 1975
422 U.S. 563

Syllabus 
Respondent, who was confined almost 15 years ""for care, maintenance, and treatment"" as a mental patient in a Florida state hospital, brought this action for damages under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioner, the hospital's superintendent, and other staff members, alleging that they had intentionally and maliciously deprived him of his constitutional right to liberty.  The evidence showed that respondent, whose frequent requests for release had been rejected by petitioner notwithstanding undertakings by responsible persons to care for him if necessary, was dangerous neither to himself nor others, and, if mentally ill, had not received treatment.  Petitioner's principal defense was that he had acted in good faith, since state law, which he believed valid, had authorized indefinite custodial confinement of the ""sick,"" even if they were not treated and their release would not be harmful, and that petitioner was therefore immune from any liability for monetary damages.  The jury found for respondent and awarded compensatory and punitive damages against petitioner and a codefendant.  The Court of Appeals, on broad Fourteenth Amendment grounds, affirmed the District Court's ensuing judgment entered on the verdict.
Held:
1. A State cannot constitutionally confine, without more, a nondangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help of willing and responsible family members or friends, and since the jury found, upon ample evidence, that petitioner did so confine respondent, it properly concluded that petitioner had violated respondent's right to liberty.  Pp.  422 U. S. 573-576.
2. Since the Court of Appeals did not consider whether the trial judge erred in refusing to give an instruction requested by petitioner concerning his claimed reliance on state law as authorization for respondent's continued confinement, and since neither court below had the benefit of this Court's decision in Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, on the scope of a state official's qualified immunity under 42 U.S.C.  1983, the case is vacated and

422 U.S. 590

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who had been arrested without probable cause and without a warrant, and under circumstances indicating that the arrest was investigatory, made two in-custody inculpatory statements after he had been given the warnings prescribed by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  Thereafter indicted for murder, petitioner filed a pretrial motion to suppress the statements.  The motion was overruled and the statements were used in the trial, which resulted in petitioner's conviction.  The State Supreme Court, though recognizing the unlawfulness of petitioner's arrest, held that the statements were admissible on the ground that the giving of the Miranda warnings served to break the causal connection between the illegal arrest and the giving of the statements, and petitioner's act in making the statements was ""sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion.""  Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471, 486.
Held:
1. The Illinois courts erred in adopting a per se rule that Miranda warnings in and of themselves broke the causal chain so that any subsequent statement, even one induced by the continuing effects of unconstitutional custody, was admissible so long as, in the traditional sense, it was voluntary and not coerced in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  When the exclusionary rule is used to effectuate the Fourth Amendment, it serves interests and policies that are distinct from those it serves under the Fifth, being directed at all unlawful searches and seizures, and not merely those that happen to produce incriminating material or testimony as fruits.  Thus, even if the statements in this case were found to be voluntary under the Fifth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment issue remains.  Wong Sun requires not merely that a statement meet the Fifth Amendment voluntariness standard, but that it be ""sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint"" in light of the distinct policies and interests of the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  422 U. S. 600-603.
2. The question whether a confession is voluntary under Wong Sun must be answered on the facts of each case.  Though  
Page 422 U. S. 591
 Miranda warnings are an important factor in resolving the issue, other factors must be considered; and the burden of showing admissibility of in-custody statements of persons who have been illegally arrested rests on the prosecutor.  Pp.  422 U. S. 603-604.

422 U.S. 659

Syllabus 
Petitioner, individually and on behalf of an asserted class of small investors, filed suit against respondents -- the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and two member firms of the Exchanges -- claiming that the system of fixed commission rates utilized by the Exchanges at that time for transactions of less than $500,000 violated  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals both concluded that the fixed commission rates were immunized from antitrust attack because of the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under  19(b)(9) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to approve or disapprove exchange commission rates and its exercise of that power.
Held:  The system of fixed commission rates, which is under the active supervision of the SEC, is beyond the reach of the antitrust laws.  Pp.  422 U. S. 663-691.
(a) The statutory provision authorizing regulation of rates,  19(b)(9), the SEC's long regulatory practice in reviewing proposed rate changes and in making detailed studies of rates, culminating in the adoption of a rule requiring a transition to competitive rates, and continued congressional approval of the SEC's authority over rates, all show that Congress intended the Securities Exchange Act to leave the supervision of the fixing of reasonable rates to the SEC.  Pp.  422 U. S. 663-682.
(b) To interpose antitrust laws, which would bar fixed commission rates as per se violations of the Sherman Act, in the face of positive SEC action, would unduly interfere with the intended operation of the Securities Exchange Act.  Hence, implied repeal of the antitrust laws is necessary to make that Act work as intended, since failure to imply repeal would render  19(b)(9) nugatory.  Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U. S. 341; Ricci v. Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 409 U. S. 289, distinguished.  Pp.  422 U. S. 682-691.

Petitioner, individually and on behalf of an asserted class of small investors, filed suit against respondents -- the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and two member firms of the Exchanges -- claiming that the system of fixed commission rates utilized by the Exchanges at that time for transactions of less than $500,000 violated  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals both concluded that the fixed commission rates were immunized from antitrust attack because of the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under  19(b)(9) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to approve or disapprove exchange commission rates and its exercise of that power.
Held:  The system of fixed commission rates, which is under the active supervision of the SEC, is beyond the reach of the antitrust laws.  Pp.  422 U. S. 663-691.
(a) The statutory provision authorizing regulation of rates,  19(b)(9), the SEC's long regulatory practice in reviewing proposed rate changes and in making detailed studies of rates, culminating in the adoption of a rule requiring a transition to competitive rates, and continued congressional approval of the SEC's authority over rates, all show that Congress intended the Securities Exchange Act to leave the supervision of the fixing of reasonable rates to the SEC.  Pp.  422 U. S. 663-682.
(b) To interpose antitrust laws, which would bar fixed commission rates as per se violations of the Sherman Act, in the face of positive SEC action, would unduly interfere with the intended operation of the Securities Exchange Act.  Hence, implied repeal of the antitrust laws is necessary to make that Act work as intended, since failure to imply repeal would render  19(b)(9) nugatory.  Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U. S. 341; Ricci v. Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 409 U. S. 289, distinguished.  Pp.  422 U. S. 682-691.

Syllabus 
Section 22(d) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 provides that
""no dealer shall sell [mutual fund shares] to any person except a dealer, a principal underwriter, or the issuer, except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus.""
Section 22(f) authorizes mutual funds to impose restrictions on the negotiability and transferability of shares, provided they conform with the fund's registration statement and do not contravene any rules and regulations that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may prescribe in the interests of the holders of all of the outstanding securities.  Section 2(a)(6) defines a ""broker"" as a person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others, and  2(a)(11) defines a ""dealer"" as a person regularly engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for his own account.  The Maloney Act of 1938 ( 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) supplements the SEC's regulation of over-the-counter markets by providing a system of cooperative self-regulation through voluntary associations of brokers and dealers.  The Government brought this action against appellee National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), certain mutual funds, mutual fund underwriters, and broker-dealers, alleging that appellees, in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act, combined and agreed to restrict the sale and fix the resale prices of mutual fund shares in secondary market transactions between dealers, from an investor to a dealer, and between investors through brokered transactions, and sought to enjoin such agreements.  Count I of the complaint charged a horizontal combination and conspiracy among NASD's members to prevent the growth of a secondary dealer market in the purchase and sale of mutual fund shares, the Government contending that such count was not to be read as a direct attack on NASD rules, but on NASD's interpretations and appellees' extension of the rules so as to include a secondary market.  Counts II-VIII alleged various vertical restrictions on secondary 
Page 422 U. S. 695
 market activities.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that  22(d) and (f), when read in conjunction with the Maloney Act, afforded antitrust immunity from all of the challenged practices.  It further determined that, apart from this statutory immunity, the pervasive regulatory scheme established by these statutes conferred an implied immunity from antitrust sanction.  The court concluded that the  22(d) price maintenance mandate for sales by ""dealers"" applied to transactions in which a broker-dealer acts as statutory ""broker"", rather than a statutory ""dealer,"" and thus that  22(d) governs transactions in which the broker-dealer acts as an agent for an investor as well as those in which he acts as a principal selling shares for his own account.
Held:
1. Neither the language nor legislative history of  22(d) justifies extending the section's price maintenance mandate beyond its literal terms to encompass transactions by broker-dealers acting as statutory ""brokers.""  Pp.  422 U. S. 711-720.
(a) To construe  22(d) to cover all broker-dealer transactions would displace the antitrust laws by implication and also would impinge on the SEC's more flexible authority under  22(f).  Implied antitrust immunity can be justified only by a convincing showing of clear repugnancy between the antitrust laws and the regulatory system, and here no such showing has been made.  Pp.  422 U. S. 719-720.
(b) Such an expansion of  22(d)'s coverage would serve neither this Court's responsibility to reconcile the antitrust and regulatory statutes where feasible nor the Court's obligation to interpret the Investment Company Act in a manner most conducive to the effectuation of its goals.  P.  422 U. S. 720.
2. The vertical restrictions sought to be enjoined in Counts II-VIII are among the kinds of agreements authorized by  22(f), and hence such restrictions are immune from liability under the Sherman Act.  Pp.  422 U. S. 720-730.
(a) The restrictions on transferability and negotiability contemplated by  22(f) include restrictions on the distribution system for mutual fund shares as well as limitations on the face of the shares themselves.  To interpret the section as covering only the latter would disserve the broad remedial function of the section, which, as a complement to  22(d)'s protection against disruptive price competition caused by dealers' ""bootleg market"" trading of mutual fund shares, authorizes the funds and the SEC to deal more flexibly with other detrimental trading practices 
Page 422 U. S. 696
 by imposing SEC-approved restrictions on transferability and negotiability.  Pp.  422 U. S. 722-725.
(b) To contend, as the Government does, that the SEC's exercise of regulatory authority has been insufficient to give rise to an implied immunity for agreements conforming with  22(f) misconceives the statute's intended operation.  By its terms,  22(f) authorizes properly disclosed restrictions unless they are inconsistent with SEC rules or regulations, and thus authorizes funds to impose transferability or negotiability restrictions subject to SEC disapproval.  Pp.  422 U. S. 726-728.
(c) The SEC's authority would be compromised if the agreements challenged in Counts II-VIII were deemed actionable under the Sherman Act.  There can be no reconciliation of the SEC's authority under  22(f) to permit these and similar restrictive agreements with the Sherman Act's declaration that they are illegal per se.  In this instance, the antitrust laws must give way if the regulatory scheme established by the Investment Company Act is to work.  Pp.  422 U. S. 729-730.
3. The activities charged in Count I are neither required by  22(d) nor authorized under  22(f), and therefore cannot find antitrust shelter therein.  The SEC's exercise of regulatory authority under the Maloney and Investment Company Acts is sufficiently pervasive, however, to confer implied immunity from antitrust liability for such activities.  Pp.  422 U. S. 730-735.

Syllabus 
After her husband of less than six months died, appellee widow filed applications for mother's Social Security insurance benefits for herself and child's insurance benefits for her daughter by a previous marriage, but the Social Security Administration (SSA), both initially and on reconsideration at the regional level, denied the applications on the basis of the duration of relationship requirements of the Social Security Act (Act), 42 U.S.C.  416(c)(5) and (e)(2) (1970 ed. and Supp. III), which define ""widow"" and ""child"" so as to exclude surviving wives and stepchildren who had their respective relationships to a deceased wage earner for less than nine months prior to his death.  Appellees widow and child, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, then brought a class action in Federal District Court on behalf of all widows and step-children denied benefits because of the nine-month requirements.  A three-judge court, after concluding that it had federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1331, held that the nine-month requirements constituted constitutionally invalid ""irrebuttable presumptions,"" and accordingly enjoined appellants Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), its Secretary, and the SSA and various of its officials from denying benefits on the basis of those requirements.
Held:
1. The District Court did not have federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1331, because such jurisdiction is barred by the third sentence of 42 U.S.C.  405(h), which provides that no action against the United States, the HEW Secretary, or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under, inter alia, 28 U.S.C.  1331 to recover on any claim arising under Title II of the Act, which covers old-age, survivors', and disability insurance benefits.  Pp.  422 U. S. 756-762.
(a) That  405(h)'s third sentence, contrary to the District Court's view, does not merely codify the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies, is plain from its sweeping language; and, moreover, to construe it so narrowly would render it superfluous in view of 
Page 422 U. S. 750
  405(h)'s first two sentences, which provide that the Secretary's findings and decision after a hearing shall be binding upon all parties to the hearing, and shall not be reviewed except as provided in  405(g), which, inter alia, requires administrative exhaustion.  Pp.  422 U. S. 756-759.
(b) There is no merit to appellees' argument that, because their action arises under the Constitution and not under the Act, it is not barred by  405(h), since, although their claim does arise under the Constitution, it also arises under the Act, which furnishes both the standing and substantive basis for the constitutional claim.  Pp.  422 U. S. 760-761.
(c) Section 405(h)'s third sentence extends to any ""action"" seeking ""to recover on any [Social Security] claim"" -- irrespective of whether resort to judicial processes is necessitated by discretionary decisions of the Secretary or by his nondiscretionary application of allegedly unconstitutional statutory restrictions -- and, although not precluding constitutional challenges, simply requires that they be brought under jurisdictional grants contained in the Act, and thus in conformity with the same standards that apply to nonconstitutional claims arising under the Act.  Johnson v. Robison, 415 U. S. 361, distinguished.  Pp.  422 U. S. 761-762.
2. The District Court had no jurisdiction over the unnamed members of the class under 42 U.S.C.  405(g), which provides that
""[a]ny individual, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action,""
since the complaint as to such class members is deficient in that it contains no allegations that they have even filed an application for benefits with the Secretary, much less that he has rendered any decision, final or otherwise, review of which is sought.  Pp.  422 U. S. 763-764.
3. The District Court had jurisdiction over the named appellees under  405(g).  While the allegations of the complaint with regard to exhaustion of remedies fall short of meeting  405(g)'s literal requirement that there shall have been a ""final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing"" and of satisfying the Secretary's regulations specifying that the finality required for judicial review be achieved only after the further steps of a hearing before an administrative judge and possibly consideration by the Appeals Council, nevertheless the Secretary, by not challenging the sufficiency of such allegations, has apparently determined that, for purposes of this action. the reconsideration determination is ""final.""  
Page 422 U. S. 751
 Under the Act's administrative scheme, the Secretary may make such a determination, because the term ""final decision"" is left undefined by the Act, and its meaning is to be fleshed out by the Secretary's regulations, 42 U.S.C.  405(a), and because no judicial or administrative interest would be served by further administrative proceedings once the Secretary concluded that a matter is beyond his jurisdiction to determine, and that the claim is neither otherwise invalid nor cognizable under a different section of the Act.  Similar considerations control with regard to the requirement that the Secretary's decision be made ""after a hearing,"" since, under such circumstances, a hearing would be futile and wasteful, and since, moreover, the Secretary may award benefits without requiring a hearing.  Pp.  422 U. S. 764-767.
4. The nine-month duration of relationship requirements of  416(c)(5) and (e)(2) are not unconstitutional.  Pp.  422 U. S. 767-785.
(a) A statutory classification in the area of social welfare such as the Social Security program is constitutional if it is rationally based and free from invidious discrimination.  Pp.  422 U. S. 768-770.
(b) A noncontractual claim to receive funds from the public treasury enjoys no constitutionally protected status, although, of course, there may not be invidious discrimination among such claimants.  Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645; Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U. S. 632, distinguished.  The benefits here are available upon compliance with an objective criterion, one that the Legislature considered to bear a sufficiently close nexus with underlying policy objectives as to be used as the test for eligibility.  Appellees are free to present evidence that they meet the specified requirements, failing which, their only constitutional claim is that the test they cannot meet is not so rationally related to a legitimate legislative objective that it can be used to deprive them of benefits available to those who do satisfy that test, Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U. S. 441, distinguished.  Pp.  422 U. S. 770-773.
(c) The duration of relationship test meets the constitutional standard that Congress, its concern having been reasonably aroused by the possibility of an abuse -- the use of sham marriages to secure Social Security benefits -- which it legitimately desired to avoid, could rationally have concluded that a particular limitation or qualification would protect against its occurrence, and that the expense and other difficulties of individual determinations justified the inherent imprecision of an objective, easily administered prophylactic rule.  Pp.  422 U. S. 773-780. 
Page 422 U. S. 752

(d) Neither the fact that  416(c)(5) excludes some wives who married with no anticipation of shortly becoming widows nor the fact that the requirement does not filter out every such claimant, if a wage earner lives longer than anticipated or has an illness that can be recognized as terminal more than nine months prior to death, necessarily renders the statutory scheme unconstitutional.  While it is possible to debate the wisdom of excluding legitimate claimants in order to discourage sham relationships, and of relying on a rule that may not exclude some obviously sham arrangements, Congress could rationally choose to adopt such a course.  Pp.  422 U. S. 781-783.
373 F.Supp. 961, reversed.

(d) Neither the fact that  416(c)(5) excludes some wives who married with no anticipation of shortly becoming widows nor the fact that the requirement does not filter out every such claimant, if a wage earner lives longer than anticipated or has an illness that can be recognized as terminal more than nine months prior to death, necessarily renders the statutory scheme unconstitutional.  While it is possible to debate the wisdom of excluding legitimate claimants in order to discourage sham relationships, and of relying on a rule that may not exclude some obviously sham arrangements, Congress could rationally choose to adopt such a course.

Syllabus 
After being transferred, without explanation or hearing, from a medium security to a maximum security prison in New York because of his involvement in a conflict among inmates concerning a petition for a prisoners' ""union"" at the former prison, respondent brought suit under 28 U.S.C.  1343(3) and (4) and 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioner prison officials, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court, granting relief in part, ruled that the transfer violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because it was made without any explanation to respondent or opportunity to be heard.  The Court of Appeals affirmed with some modification, holding, inter alia, that the suit was not mooted by the fact that respondent was returned to the medium security prison prior to the District Court's ruling.  Respondent was later transferred to a minimum security prison, and will soon be eligible for parole.
Held:  In light of respondent's return to the medium security prison and later transfer to a minimum security prison, the suit does not present a case or controversy as required by Art. III of the Constitution, but is now moot, and must be dismissed, since, as to the original complaint, there is now no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated, and the question presented does not fall within the category of harm capable of repetition, yet evading review.

No. 74-389
Argued April 14, 1975
Decided June 25, 1975*
422 U.S. 405

Syllabus 
Respondents, a certified class of present and former Negro employees, brought this action against petitioners, their employer, Albemarle Paper Co., and the employees' union, seeking injunctive relief against ""any policy, practice, custom or usage"" at the plant violative of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, and, after several years of discovery, moved to add a class backpay demand.  At the trial, the major issues were the plant's seniority system, its program of employment testing, and backpay.  The District Court found that, following a reorganization under a new collective bargaining agreement, the Negro employees had been ""locked' in the lower paying job classifications,"" and ordered petitioners to implement a system of plantwide seniority.  The court refused, however, to order backpay for losses sustained by the plaintiff class under the discriminatory system, on the grounds that (1) Albemarle's breach of Title VII was found not to have been in ""bad faith,"" and (2) respondents, who had initially disclaimed interest in backpay, had delayed making their backpay claim until five years after the complaint was filed, thereby prejudicing petitioners.  The court also refused to enjoin or limit Albemarle's testing program, which respondents had contended had a disproportionate adverse impact on blacks and was not shown to be related to job performance, the court concluding that ""personnel tests administered at the plant have undergone validation studies and have been proven to be job-related.""  Respondents appealed on the backpay and pre-employment tests issues.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's judgment.
Held:
1. Given a finding of unlawful discrimination, backpay should be denied only for reasons that, if applied generally, would not frustrate the central statutory purposes manifested by Congress in enacting Title VII of eradicating discrimination throughout the 
Page 422 U. S. 406
 economy and making persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination.  Pp.  422 U. S. 413-422.
2. The absence of bad faith is not a sufficient reason for denying backpay, Title VII not being concerned with the employer's ""good intent or absence of discriminatory intent,"" for ""Congress directed the thrust of the Act to the consequences of employment practices, not simply the motivation,"" Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424,  401 U. S. 432.  Pp.  422 U. S. 422-423.
3. Whether respondents' tardiness and inconsistency in making their backpay demand were excusable and whether they actually prejudiced petitioners are matters that will be open to review by the Court of Appeals if the District Court, on remand, decides again to decline a backpay award.  Pp.  422 U. S. 423-425.
4. As is clear from Griggs, supra, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Guidelines for employers seeking to determine through professional validation studies whether employment tests are job-related, such tests are impermissible unless shown, by professionally acceptable methods, to be
""predictive of or significantly correlated with important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being evaluated.""
Measured against that standard, Albemarle's validation study is materially defective in that (1) it would not, because of the odd patchwork of results from its application, have ""validated"" the two general ability tests used by Albemarle for all the skilled lines of progression for which the two tests are, apparently, now required; (2) it compared test scores with subjective supervisorial rankings, affording no means of knowing what job performance criteria the supervisors were considering; (3) it focused mostly on job groups near the top of various lines of progression, but the fact that the best of those employees working near the top of a line of progression score well on a test does not necessarily mean that the test permissibly measures the qualifications of new workers entering lower level jobs; and (4) it dealt only with job-experienced, white workers, but the tests themselves are given to new job applicants, who are younger, largely inexperienced, and in many instances nonwhite.  Pp.  422 U. S. 425-435.
5.

No. 73-1924
Argued March 24, 1975
Decided June 25, 1975
422 U.S. 454

Syllabus 
After their request for a jury trial was denied, petitioners, a labor union officer and the union, were adjudged guilty of criminal contempt for violating temporary injunctions issued by the District Court pursuant to  10(l) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) against picketing of an employer pending the National Labor Relations Board's final disposition of the employer's unfair labor practice charge against such picketing.  The District Court suspended sentencing of the officer and placed him on probation, but imposed a $10,000 fine on the union.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' claims that they had a statutory right to a jury trial under 18 U.S.C.  3692, which provides for jury trial in contempt cases arising under any federal law governing the issuance of injunctions ""in any case"" growing out of a labor dispute, and that they also had a right to a jury trial under the Constitution (the latter question being limited in this Court to whether the union had such a constitutional right).
Held:
1. Petitioners are not entitled to a jury trial under 18 U.S.C.  3692.  Pp.  422 U. S. 458-474.
(a) It is clear from  10(l) of the NLRA, as added by the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), and related sections, particularly  10(h) (which provides that the courts' jurisdiction to grant temporary injunctive relief or to enforce or set aside an NLRB unfair practice order shall not be limited by the Norris-LaGuardia Act), and from the legislative history of such sections, that Congress not only intended to exempt injunctions authorized by the NLRA and the LMRA from the Norris-LaGuardia Act's limitations, including original  11 of the latter Act (now repealed) requiring jury trials in contempt actions arising out of that Act, but also intended that civil and criminal contempt proceedings enforcing those injunctions were not to afford contemnors the right to a jury trial.  By providing for labor Act injunctions outside the Norris-LaGuardia Act's framework, Congress necessarily contemplated that there would be no right to a jury trial in such contempt proceedings.  Pp.  422 U. S. 458-467. 
Page 422 U. S. 455

(b) Absent an express provision or any indication in the Reviser's Note to 18 U.S.C.  3692 that a substantive change in the law was contemplated, no intention on Congress' part to change its original intention that there be no jury trials in contempt proceedings arising out of NLRA injunctions is shown by the fact that  11 of the Norris-LaGuardia.Act was repealed and replaced by  3692 as part of the 1948 revision of the Criminal Code.  Just as  3692 may not be read apart from other relevant provisions of the labor law, that section likewise may not be read isolated from its legislative history and the revision process from which it emerged, all of which place definite limitations on this Court's latitude in construing it.  Pp.  422 U. S. 467-474.
2. Nor does petitioner union have a right to a jury trial under Art. III,  2, of the Constitution and the Sixth Amendment.  Despite 18 U.S.C.  1(3), which defines petty offenses as those crimes ""the penalty for which does not exceed imprisonment for a period of six months or a fine of not more than $500, or both,"" a contempt need not be considered a serious crime under all circumstances where the punishment is a fine of more than $500, unaccompanied by imprisonment.  Here, where it appears that petitioner union collects dues from some 13,000 persons, the $10,000 fine imposed was not of such magnitude that the union was deprived of whatever right to a jury trial it might have under the Sixth Amendment.

No. 73-2024
Argued March 17, 1975
Decided June 25, 1975
422 U.S. 490

Syllabus 
This action for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages was brought by certain of the petitioners against respondent town of Penfield (a suburb of Rochester, N.Y.), and respondent members of Penfield's Zoning, Planning, and Town Boards, claiming that the town's zoning ordinance, by its terms and as enforced, effectively excluded persons of low and moderate income from living in the town, in violation of petitioners' constitutional rights and of 42 U.S.C.  1981, 1982, and 1983.  Petitioners consist of both the original plaintiffs -- (1) Metro-Act of Rochester, a not-for-profit corporation among whose purposes is fostering action to alleviate the housing shortage for low and moderate income persons in the Rochester area; (2) several individual Rochester taxpayers; and (3) several Rochester area residents with low or moderate incomes who are also members of minority racial or ethnic groups -- and Rochester Home Builders Association (Home Builders), embracing a number of residential construction firms in the Rochester area, which unsuccessfully sought to intervene as a party plaintiff, and the Housing Council in the Monroe County Area (Housing Council), a not-for-profit corporation consisting of a number of organizations interested in housing problems, which was unsuccessfully sought to be added as a party plaintiff.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground, inter alia, that petitioners lacked standing to prosecute the action, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Whether the rules of standing are considered as aspects of the constitutional requirement that a plaintiff must make out a ""case or controversy"" within the meaning of Art. III, or, apart from such requirement, as prudential limitations on the courts' role in resolving disputes involving ""generalized grievances"" or third parties' legal rights or interests, none of the petitioners has met the threshold requirement of such rules that to have standing a complainant must clearly allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute and the exercise of the court's remedial powers.  Pp.  422 U. S. 498-518. 
Page 422 U. S. 491

(a) As to petitioner Rochester residents who assert standing as persons of low or moderate income and, coincidentally, as members of minority racial or ethnic groups, the facts alleged fail to support an actionable causal relationship between Penfield's zoning practices and these petitioners' alleged injury.  A plaintiff who seeks to challenge exclusionary zoning practices must allege specific, concrete facts demonstrating that such practices harm him, and that he personally would benefit in a tangible way from the court's intervention.  Here, these petitioners rely on little more than the remote possibility, unsubstantiated by allegations of fact, that their situation might have been better had respondents acted otherwise, and might improve were the court to afford relief.  Pp.  422 U. S. 502-508.
(b) With respect to petitioners who assert standing on the basis of their status as Rochester taxpayers, claiming that they are suffering economic injury through increased taxes resulting from Penfield's zoning practices having forced Rochester to provide more tax-abated low  or moderate cost housing than it otherwise would have done, the line of causation between Penfield's actions and such injury is not apparent.  But even assuming that these petitioners could establish that the zoning practices harm them, the basis of their claim is that the practices violate the constitutional and statutory rights of third parties -- persons of low and moderate income who allegedly are excluded from Penfield.  Hence, their claim falls squarely within the prudential standing rule that normally bars litigants from asserting the rights or legal interests of others in order to obtain relief from injury to themselves.  Pp.  422 U. S. 508-510.
(c) Petitioner Metro-Act's claims to standing as a Rochester taxpayer and on behalf of its members who are Rochester taxpayers or persons of low or moderate income are precluded for the reasons applying to the denial of standing to the individual petitioner Rochester taxpayers and persons of low and moderate income.  In addition, with respect to Metro-Act's claim to standing because 9% of its membership is composed of Penfield residents, prudential considerations strongly counsel against according such residents or Metro-Act standing where the complaint is that they have been harmed indirectly by the exclusion of others, thus attempting, in the absence of a showing of any exception allowing such a claim, to raise the putative rights of third parties.  Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins., 409 U. S. 205, distinguished.  Pp.  422 U. S. 512-514. 
Page 422 U. S. 492

(d) Petitioner Home Builders, which alleges no monetary injury to itself, has no standing to claim damages on behalf of its members, since whatever injury may have been suffered is peculiar to the individual member concerned, thus requiring individualized proof of both the fact and extent of injury and individual awards.  Nor does Home Builders have standing to claim prospective relief absent any allegation of facts sufficient to show the existence of any injury to members of sufficient immediacy and ripeness to warrant judicial intervention.  Pp.  422 U. S. 514-516.
(e) Petitioner Housing Council has no standing where the complaint and record do not indicate that any of its members, with one exception, has made any effort involving Penfield, has taken any steps toward building there, or had any dealings with respondents.

			"|"Warth v. Seldin
No. 73-2024
Argued March 17, 1975
Decided June 25, 1975
422 U.S. 490

Syllabus 
This action for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages was brought by certain of the petitioners against respondent town of Penfield (a suburb of Rochester, N.Y.), and respondent members of Penfield's Zoning, Planning, and Town Boards, claiming that the town's zoning ordinance, by its terms and as enforced, effectively excluded persons of low and moderate income from living in the town, in violation of petitioners' constitutional rights and of 42 U.S.C.  1981, 1982, and 1983.  Petitioners consist of both the original plaintiffs -- (1) Metro-Act of Rochester, a not-for-profit corporation among whose purposes is fostering action to alleviate the housing shortage for low and moderate income persons in the Rochester area; (2) several individual Rochester taxpayers; and (3) several Rochester area residents with low or moderate incomes who are also members of minority racial or ethnic groups -- and Rochester Home Builders Association (Home Builders), embracing a number of residential construction firms in the Rochester area, which unsuccessfully sought to intervene as a party plaintiff, and the Housing Council in the Monroe County Area (Housing Council), a not-for-profit corporation consisting of a number of organizations interested in housing problems, which was unsuccessfully sought to be added as a party plaintiff.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground, inter alia, that petitioners lacked standing to prosecute the action, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Whether the rules of standing are considered as aspects of the constitutional requirement that a plaintiff must make out a ""case or controversy"" within the meaning of Art. III, or, apart from such requirement, as prudential limitations on the courts' role in resolving disputes involving ""generalized grievances"" or third parties' legal rights or interests, none of the petitioners has met the threshold requirement of such rules that to have standing a complainant must clearly allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute and the exercise of the court's remedial powers.  Pp.  422 U. S. 498-518. 
Page 422 U. S. 491

(a) As to petitioner Rochester residents who assert standing as persons of low or moderate income and, coincidentally, as members of minority racial or ethnic groups, the facts alleged fail to support an actionable causal relationship between Penfield's zoning practices and these petitioners' alleged injury.  A plaintiff who seeks to challenge exclusionary zoning practices must allege specific, concrete facts demonstrating that such practices harm him, and that he personally would benefit in a tangible way from the court's intervention.  Here, these petitioners rely on little more than the remote possibility, unsubstantiated by allegations of fact, that their situation might have been better had respondents acted otherwise, and might improve were the court to afford relief.  Pp.  422 U. S. 502-508.
(b) With respect to petitioners who assert standing on the basis of their status as Rochester taxpayers, claiming that they are suffering economic injury through increased taxes resulting from Penfield's zoning practices having forced Rochester to provide more tax-abated low  or moderate cost housing than it otherwise would have done, the line of causation between Penfield's actions and such injury is not apparent.  But even assuming that these petitioners could establish that the zoning practices harm them, the basis of their claim is that the practices violate the constitutional and statutory rights of third parties -- persons of low and moderate income who allegedly are excluded from Penfield.  Hence, their claim falls squarely within the prudential standing rule that normally bars litigants from asserting the rights or legal interests of others in order to obtain relief from injury to themselves.  Pp.  422 U. S. 508-510.
(c) Petitioner Metro-Act's claims to standing as a Rochester taxpayer and on behalf of its members who are Rochester taxpayers or persons of low or moderate income are precluded for the reasons applying to the denial of standing to the individual petitioner Rochester taxpayers and persons of low and moderate income.  In addition, with respect to Metro-Act's claim to standing because 9% of its membership is composed of Penfield residents, prudential considerations strongly counsel against according such residents or Metro-Act standing where the complaint is that they have been harmed indirectly by the exclusion of others, thus attempting, in the absence of a showing of any exception allowing such a claim, to raise the putative rights of third parties.  Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins., 409 U. S. 205, distinguished.  Pp.  422 U. S. 512-514. 
Page 422 U. S. 492

(d) Petitioner Home Builders, which alleges no monetary injury to itself, has no standing to claim damages on behalf of its members, since whatever injury may have been suffered is peculiar to the individual member concerned, thus requiring individualized proof of both the fact and extent of injury and individual awards.  Nor does Home Builders have standing to claim prospective relief absent any allegation of facts sufficient to show the existence of any injury to members of sufficient immediacy and ripeness to warrant judicial intervention.  Pp.  422 U. S. 514-516.
(e) Petitioner Housing Council has no standing where the complaint and record do not indicate that any of its members, with one exception, has made any effort involving Penfield, has taken any steps toward building there, or had any dealings with respondents.  With respect to the one exception, this petitioner averred no basis for inferring that an earlier controversy between it and respondents remained a live, concrete dispute.  Pp.  422 U. S. 516-517.

422 U.S. 255

Syllabus 
Respondents requested the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to make available Systems Worthiness Analysis Program (SWAP) Reports which consist of the FAA's analyses of the operation and maintenance performance of commercial airlines.  Section 1104 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 permits the FAA Administrator, upon receiving an objection to public disclosure of information in a report, to withhold disclosure when, in his judgment, it would adversely affect the objecting party's interest and is not required in the public's interest.  The Administrator declined to make the reports available upon receiving an objection from the Air Transport Association, which claimed that confidentiality was necessary to the effectiveness of the program.  Respondents sued in the District Court seeking, inter alia, the requested documents.  The District Court held that the documents were ""as a matter of law, public and non-exempt"" within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court ""insofar as appellants rely upon Exemption (3)"" of the FOIA.
Held:  The SWAP Reports are exempt from public disclosure under Exemption 3 of the FOIA as being ""specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.""  Pp.  422 U. S. 261-267.
(a) Exemption 3 contains no ""built-in"" standard as do some of the exemptions under the FOIA, and the language is sufficiently ambiguous to require resort to the legislative history.  That history reveals that Congress was ""aware of the necessity to deal expressly with inconsistent laws,"" and, as indicated in its committee report, did not intend, in enacting the FOIA, to modify the numerous statutes ""which restrict public access to specific Government records.""  Respondents can prevail only if the FOIA is read to repeal by implication all such statutes.  To interpret ""specific"" as used in such committee reference as meaning that Exemption 3 applies only to precisely named or described documents would be asking Congress to perform an impossible task, 
Page 422 U. S. 256
 and would imply that Congress had undertaken to reassess every delegation of authority to withhold information that it had made before the passage of the FOIA in 1966, a task that the legislative history clearly shows it did not undertake.  Pp. 261-266.
(b) The broad discretion vested by Congress in the FAA under  1104 to withhold information from the public is not necessarily inconsistent with Congress' intent in enacting the FOIA to replace the broad standard of the public disclosure section of the Administrative Procedure Act.  Congress could appropriately conclude that the public interest in air transport safety was better served by guaranteeing confidentiality of information necessary to secure from the airlines the maximum amount of information relevant to safety, and Congress' wisdom in striking such a balance is not open to judicial scrutiny.

Syllabus 
The Government brought this civil antitrust action against appellee, one of the largest suppliers of janitorial services in the country, with 56 branches serving more than 500 communities in the United States and Canada, and providing about 10% of such service sales in Southern California, contending that appellee's acquisition of two Southern California janitorial service firms (the Benton companies), which supplied about 7% of such services in Southern California, violated  7 of the Clayton Act.  That section provides that
""[n]o corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire . . . the stock or other share capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire . . . the assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.""
The Benton companies, some of whose customers engaged in interstate operations, performed all their services within California, locally recruited labor (which accounted for their major expenses) and locally purchased incidental equipment and supplies.  The District Court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, holding that there had been no  7 violation.  The Government contends that ""engaged in commerce."" as used in  7. encompasses corporations like the Benton companies engaged in intrastate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, and that, in any event, the Benton companies' activities were sufficiently interstate to come within  7.
Held:
1. The phrase ""engaged in commerce,"" as used in  7 of the Clayton Act, means engaged in the flow of interstate commerce, and was not intended to reach all corporations engaged in activities subject to the federal commerce power; hence, the phrase does not encompass corporations engaged in intrastate activities substantially affecting interstate commerce, and  7 can be applicable only when both the acquiring corporation and the acquired 
Page 422 U. S. 272
 corporation are engaged in interstate commerce.  Pp.  422 U. S. 275-283.
(a) The jurisdictional requirements of  7 cannot be satisfied merely by showing that allegedly anticompetitive acquisitions and activities affect commerce.  Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving CO., 419 U. S. 186; FTC v. Bunte Bros., 312 U. S. 349.  Pp.  422 U. S. 276-277.
(b) The precise ""in commerce"" language of  7 is not coextensive with the reach of power under the Commerce Clause, and is thus not to be equated with  1 of the Sherman Act, which reaches the impact of intrastate conduct on interstate commerce.  Pp.  422 U. S. 277-279.
(c) When Congress reenacted  7 in 1950 with the same ""engaged in commerce"" limitation, the phrase had long since become a term of art, indicating a limited assertion of federal jurisdiction, and, prior to that time, Congress had frequently distinguished between activities ""in commerce"" and broader activities ""affecting commerce.""  Pp.  422 U. S. 279-281.
(d) Limiting  7 to its plain meaning comports with the enforcement policies that the FTC and the Justice Department have consistently pursued.  Pp.  422 U. S. 281-282.
2. Since the Benton companies did not participate directly in the sale, purchase, or distribution of goods or services in interstate commerce, they were not ""engaged in commerce"" within the meaning of  7.

Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP)
No. 73-1966
Argued March 26, 1975
Decided June 24, 1975*
422 U.S. 289

Syllabus 
In December, 1971, the Nation's railroads, citing sharply increasing costs and decreasing or negative profits, collectively proposed to file tariffs increasing their freight rates by a temporary surcharge across the board.  The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), in the ensuing general revenue proceeding, finding that the railroads had a critical and immediate need for revenue, declined to exercise its power to suspend proposed rate increases, and the surcharge became effective in February, 1972.  The railroads shortly filed for larger, selective rate increases, but, in April, 1972, the ICC suspended the effectiveness of these increases pending its investigation of their lawfulness, the ICC the previous month having served a brief draft environmental impact statement on all parties to the investigation, discussing the environmental consequences of rate increases with respect to recyclables in general terms and concluding that there was no basis yet to believe that the environment would be substantially affected thereby.  Thereafter, appellee SCRAP and other environmental groups filed suit alleging that the ICC had decided not to suspend the surcharge pending its investigation -- which decision would have a substantial effect on the environment -- without preparing an environmental impact statement or considering environmental issues as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); that the preexisting rate structure discriminated against recyclables and in favor of virgin materials; and that the surcharge exacerbated this situation with the unfortunate consequence to the environment that use of recyclable materials would be inhibited and use of virgin materials encouraged.  A three-judge District Court was convened under 28 U.S.C.  2325 (now repealed), which required that an injunction restraining the enforcement operation, or 
Page 422 U. S. 290
 execution of an ICC order would not be granted unless the application therefor was heard and determined by a three-judge court, and relief was granted.  On direct appeal, this Court reversed in United States v. SCRAP, 412 U. S. 669, (SCRAP I), holding that  15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act lodges in the ICC exclusive power to suspend rate increases pending final determination of their lawfulness.  Meanwhile, in October, 1972, after an oral hearing, the ICC issued a final report declining to declare the selective rate increases unlawful, terminating the previously entered suspension order, canceling the surcharge that had been subsumed in the selective increases, and ordering a ceiling on rate increases with respect to some, but not all, recyclables.  The report stated that, having given extensive consideration to environmental factors, the ICC would not file a separate, formal impact statement under the NEPA, and pointed out that the ICC had begun a separate investigation into the entire rate structure focusing on whether it interfered with the Government's environmental program.  However, in November, 1972, the ICC reopened its investigation into the lawfulness of selective rate increases to reconsider the environmental effects of the new rates on recyclables, such rates being suspended for an additional period with the railroads' consent.  In March, 1973, the ICC served an expanded draft impact statement, and in May, 1973, issued a final impact statement, concluding that its order of October, 1972, had been correct, and finally terminating its investigation without declaring any of the proposed rates unlawful except as previously provided in the October, 1972, order.  In May, 1973, shortly before the increased rates on recyclables were to become effective, appellees SCRAP and Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to restrain the implementation of increased rates on recyclables, and the three-judge court granted the motion.  The railroads and the ICC appealed, and in June, 1973, THE CHIEF JUSTICE stayed the order on the railroads' motion, and the full Court declined to vacate the stay, 413 U.S. 917, with the result that the increased rates on recyclables went into, and remain in, effect.  In November, 1973, this Court vacated the preliminary injunction and remanded the cases for reconsideration, 414 U.S. 1035.  Meanwhile, appellees had filed motions for summary judgment in the three-judge court.  Finding that the ICC had failed to comply with the NEPA in that, inter alia, it failed to hold an oral hearing before adopting the final impact statement, having previously held such a hearing (presumptively 
Page 422 U. S. 291
 an ""existing agency review process"") before issuing its October, 1972, order, and should have started over again after it decided to issue a final impact statement, that court set aside the ICC order terminating the general revenue proceeding without declaring the rate increases unlawful, and ordered the ICC to reopen the proceeding, prepare a new impact statement under the NEPA, hold hearings, and reconsider, in light of the new statement, its determination to declare the rate increases on recyclables lawful.  The railroads appealed, claiming that the District Court had no jurisdiction over the case, and that the ICC had, in any event, fully complied with the NEPA, and the ICC and the United States appealed, claiming only that the ICC had so complied with the NEPA.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction over the appeals under 28 U.S.C.  1253, which gives this Court jurisdiction to determine appeals from ""an order granting or denying . . . an . . . injunction in any civil action . . . required . . . to be heard and determined"" by a three-judge district court, since the District Court's order, which not only declared that the ICC had failed to comply with the NEPA but also directed the ICC to perform certain acts, was an ""injunction"" within the meaning of  1253, and since, moreover, such order restrained ""the enforcement, operation or execution"" of the ICC order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  2325, and hence could have been issued only by a three-judge court.  Pp.  422 U. S. 306-309.
2. The District Court had jurisdiction to review the ICC's decision not to declare the increased rates unlawful, notwithstanding such decision was made in a general revenue proceeding.  Pp.  422 U. S. 310-319.
(a) There is no merit to the railroads' argument that the ICC's decision is just as much an interim decision as a decision not to suspend a particular rate pending investigation, and hence is unreviewable under SCRAP I, supra.  Since the District Court did not enjoin collection of the rates so as to come within the rule barring courts from entering disruptive injunctions against collection of rates not finally declared unlawful by the ICC, the rule of SCRAP I is not applicable even if what the railroads say is true.  P.  422 U. S. 317.
(b) Nor is there any merit to the railroads' argument (1) that, treating the District Court's decision as a review of whether the record supported the ICC's decision not to suspend the rates as to recyclables, the District Court reviewed an issue not yet decided finally by the ICC in violation of the principles of finality 
Page 422 U. S. 292
 and exhaustion of remedies, and (2) that the District Court's conclusion that the rule against review of general revenue proceedings does not apply to NEPA cases is contrary to the decision in SCRAP I that the NEPA does not change preexisting jurisdictional rules.  Here, the issue as to whether the ICC had adequately considered under the NEPA environmental factors in the general revenue proceeding had already been finally decided by the ICC, and the relief sought from and granted by the District Court could not have been obtained from the ICC in a subsequent proceeding under  13 of the Interstate Commerce Act.  While the interim nature of a general revenue proceeding may be relevant to the extent of the consideration of environmental factors required, its nature does not prevent review of the question, finally decided by the ICC, whether the environmental impact statement prepared for that proceeding is adequate.  When agency consideration of environmental factors in connection with major ""federal action"" is complete, notions of finality and exhaustion do not bar judicial review of the adequacy of such consideration, even though other aspects of the rate increase are not ripe for review.  Pp.  422 U. S. 317-319.
3. The District Court erred in deciding that the oral hearing that the ICC held prior to its October, 1972, order was an ""existing agency review process"" during which a final environmental impact statement should have been available.  The NEPA provides that a formal impact statement ""shall accompany the proposal through the existing agency review processes,"" and hence does not affect the time when the ""statement"" must be prepared, but simply provides what must be done with the ""statement"" once it is prepared.  Under this provision, the time at which the agency must prepare the final ""statement"" is the time at which it makes a recommendation or report on a proposal for federal action.  Here, until the October, 1972, report, the ICC had made no proposal, and hence the earliest time at which the statute required a statement was the time of the October, 1972, report -- some time after the oral hearing.  Pp.  422 U. S. 319-321.
4. The District Court also erred in deciding that the ICC should have ""started over again"" after it decided to propose a formal impact statement, even assuming that the ICC erred in failing to prepare a separate impact statement to accompany its October, 1972, report or that the consideration given to environmental factors in that report was inadequate.  To the extent that such decision is based on the court's belief that the March, 1973, draft 
Page 422 U. S. 293
 impact statement had to be considered at a hearing, it is incorrect, since it appears that the consultation with environmentally expert agencies required by the NEPA occurred from the outset, that environmental issues pervaded the hearings held, and that all draft impact statements were circulated before the hearings, thus indicating that, procedurally, the NEPA was thoroughly complied with to the time of the October, 1972, report.  And to the extent that such decision is based on the court's belief that the ICC did not in good faith reconsider its October, 1972, order in light of the impact statement, it is without support in the record, since the ICC (as it, in fact, proceeded to do) was in as good a position to correct a statutory error by integrating environmental factors into its reopened investigation and into its May, 1973, decision, as it would have been if the October, 1972, report had never been written.  Pp.  422 U. S. 321-322.
5. The District Court further erred in concluding that the final environmental impact statement was deficient.  Pp.  422 U. S. 322-328.
(a) As in most general revenue proceedings, the ""action"" taken by the ICC was in response to the railroads' claim of a financial crisis, and the inquiry was primarily into whether such a crisis -- usually entitling the railroads to a general increase -- existed, leaving primarily to more appropriate future proceedings the task of answering challenges to rates on individual commodities or categories thereof, the latter question -- usually involved in a general revenue proceeding only to a limited extent -- raising the most serious environmental issues, and the former question raising few such issues, none of which is claimed here to have been inadequately addressed in the impact statement.  Pp.  422 U. S. 322-324.
(b) There is no merit to the appellees' argument that the environmental consequences flowing from a facially neutral rate increase, which, when superimposed on an underlying rate structure, allegedly discriminates against recyclables, must be explored in an impact statement and can be explored only by analyzing the underlying rate structure; and that, moreover, the ICC has been tardy in complying with the NEPA, was required to analyze the underlying rate structure only once with a view toward environmental consequences, had plenty of time and cause to do so before its general revenue proceeding, and therefore should not have been permitted to terminate that proceeding without having done so.  Such argument is not only contrary to the holding in United States v. Louisiana, 290 U. S. 70, giving the ICC wide discretion to decide what issues to address in a general revenue 
Page 422 U. S. 294
 proceeding and to postpone comprehensive consideration of discrimination claims, but it also loses force in view of the fact that the ICC had already begun an investigation of the underlying rate structure before commencing its investigation in the general revenue proceeding, and had started to consider environmental issues in the former investigation before the District Court's decision.  Thus, even if the NEPA were read to require the ICC to address comprehensively the underlying rate structure at least once before approving a facially neutral general rate increase, no purpose could have been served by ordering it to explore the discrimination question in the general revenue proceeding when it was already doing so in a more appropriate proceeding.  Pp.  422 U. S. 324-325.
(c) The District Court's decision to deem the ""federal action"" involved in the general revenue proceeding to include an implicit approval of the underlying rate structure was inaccurate, and led it to an entirely unwarranted intrusion into an apparently sensible decision by the ICC to take much more limited ""action"" in that proceeding and to undertake the larger action in a separate proceeding better suited to the task.  P.  422 U. S. 326.
(d) In view of the scope of the ""federal action"" being taken by the ICC in the general revenue proceeding, the District Court was incorrect in holding that the final impact statement inadequately explored the underlying rate structure and the extent to which the use of recyclables will be affected by the rate structure.  Pp.  422 U. S. 326-328.

Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP)
No. 73-1966
Argued March 26, 1975
Decided June 24, 1975*
422 U.S. 289

Syllabus 
In December, 1971, the Nation's railroads, citing sharply increasing costs and decreasing or negative profits, collectively proposed to file tariffs increasing their freight rates by a temporary surcharge across the board.  The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), in the ensuing general revenue proceeding, finding that the railroads had a critical and immediate need for revenue, declined to exercise its power to suspend proposed rate increases, and the surcharge became effective in February, 1972.  The railroads shortly filed for larger, selective rate increases, but, in April, 1972, the ICC suspended the effectiveness of these increases pending its investigation of their lawfulness, the ICC the previous month having served a brief draft environmental impact statement on all parties to the investigation, discussing the environmental consequences of rate increases with respect to recyclables in general terms and concluding that there was no basis yet to believe that the environment would be substantially affected thereby.  Thereafter, appellee SCRAP and other environmental groups filed suit alleging that the ICC had decided not to suspend the surcharge pending its investigation -- which decision would have a substantial effect on the environment -- without preparing an environmental impact statement or considering environmental issues as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); that the preexisting rate structure discriminated against recyclables and in favor of virgin materials; and that the surcharge exacerbated this situation with the unfortunate consequence to the environment that use of recyclable materials would be inhibited and use of virgin materials encouraged.  A three-judge District Court was convened under 28 U.S.C.  2325 (now repealed), which required that an injunction restraining the enforcement operation, or 
Page 422 U. S. 290
 execution of an ICC order would not be granted unless the application therefor was heard and determined by a three-judge court, and relief was granted.  On direct appeal, this Court reversed in United States v. SCRAP, 412 U. S. 669, (SCRAP I), holding that  15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act lodges in the ICC exclusive power to suspend rate increases pending final determination of their lawfulness.  Meanwhile, in October, 1972, after an oral hearing, the ICC issued a final report declining to declare the selective rate increases unlawful, terminating the previously entered suspension order, canceling the surcharge that had been subsumed in the selective increases, and ordering a ceiling on rate increases with respect to some, but not all, recyclables.  The report stated that, having given extensive consideration to environmental factors, the ICC would not file a separate, formal impact statement under the NEPA, and pointed out that the ICC had begun a separate investigation into the entire rate structure focusing on whether it interfered with the Government's environmental program.  However, in November, 1972, the ICC reopened its investigation into the lawfulness of selective rate increases to reconsider the environmental effects of the new rates on recyclables, such rates being suspended for an additional period with the railroads' consent.  In March, 1973, the ICC served an expanded draft impact statement, and in May, 1973, issued a final impact statement, concluding that its order of October, 1972, had been correct, and finally terminating its investigation without declaring any of the proposed rates unlawful except as previously provided in the October, 1972, order.  In May, 1973, shortly before the increased rates on recyclables were to become effective, appellees SCRAP and Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to restrain the implementation of increased rates on recyclables, and the three-judge court granted the motion.  The railroads and the ICC appealed, and in June, 1973, THE CHIEF JUSTICE stayed the order on the railroads' motion, and the full Court declined to vacate the stay, 413 U.S. 917, with the result that the increased rates on recyclables went into, and remain in, effect.  In November, 1973, this Court vacated the preliminary injunction and remanded the cases for reconsideration, 414 U.S. 1035.  Meanwhile, appellees had filed motions for summary judgment in the three-judge court.  Finding that the ICC had failed to comply with the NEPA in that, inter alia, it failed to hold an oral hearing before adopting the final impact statement, having previously held such a hearing (presumptively 
Page 422 U. S. 291
 an ""existing agency review process"") before issuing its October, 1972, order, and should have started over again after it decided to issue a final impact statement, that court set aside the ICC order terminating the general revenue proceeding without declaring the rate increases unlawful, and ordered the ICC to reopen the proceeding, prepare a new impact statement under the NEPA, hold hearings, and reconsider, in light of the new statement, its determination to declare the rate increases on recyclables lawful.  The railroads appealed, claiming that the District Court had no jurisdiction over the case, and that the ICC had, in any event, fully complied with the NEPA, and the ICC and the United States appealed, claiming only that the ICC had so complied with the NEPA.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction over the appeals under 28 U.S.C.  1253, which gives this Court jurisdiction to determine appeals from ""an order granting or denying . . . an . . . injunction in any civil action . . . required . . . to be heard and determined"" by a three-judge district court, since the District Court's order, which not only declared that the ICC had failed to comply with the NEPA but also directed the ICC to perform certain acts, was an ""injunction"" within the meaning of  1253, and since, moreover, such order restrained ""the enforcement, operation or execution"" of the ICC order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  2325, and hence could have been issued only by a three-judge court.  Pp.  422 U. S. 306-309.
2. The District Court had jurisdiction to review the ICC's decision not to declare the increased rates unlawful, notwithstanding such decision was made in a general revenue proceeding.  Pp.  422 U. S. 310-319.
(a) There is no merit to the railroads' argument that the ICC's decision is just as much an interim decision as a decision not to suspend a particular rate pending investigation, and hence is unreviewable under SCRAP I, supra.  Since the District Court did not enjoin collection of the rates so as to come within the rule barring courts from entering disruptive injunctions against collection of rates not finally declared unlawful by the ICC, the rule of SCRAP I is not applicable even if what the railroads say is true.  P.  422 U. S. 317.
(b) Nor is there any merit to the railroads' argument (1) that, treating the District Court's decision as a review of whether the record supported the ICC's decision not to suspend the rates as to recyclables, the District Court reviewed an issue not yet decided finally by the ICC in violation of the principles of finality 
Page 422 U. S. 292
 and exhaustion of remedies, and (2) that the District Court's conclusion that the rule against review of general revenue proceedings does not apply to NEPA cases is contrary to the decision in SCRAP I that the NEPA does not change preexisting jurisdictional rules.  Here, the issue as to whether the ICC had adequately considered under the NEPA environmental factors in the general revenue proceeding had already been finally decided by the ICC, and the relief sought from and granted by the District Court could not have been obtained from the ICC in a subsequent proceeding under  13 of the Interstate Commerce Act.  While the interim nature of a general revenue proceeding may be relevant to the extent of the consideration of environmental factors required, its nature does not prevent review of the question, finally decided by the ICC, whether the environmental impact statement prepared for that proceeding is adequate.  When agency consideration of environmental factors in connection with major ""federal action"" is complete, notions of finality and exhaustion do not bar judicial review of the adequacy of such consideration, even though other aspects of the rate increase are not ripe for review.  Pp.  422 U. S. 317-319.
3. The District Court erred in deciding that the oral hearing that the ICC held prior to its October, 1972, order was an ""existing agency review process"" during which a final environmental impact statement should have been available.  The NEPA provides that a formal impact statement ""shall accompany the proposal through the existing agency review processes,"" and hence does not affect the time when the ""statement"" must be prepared, but simply provides what must be done with the ""statement"" once it is prepared.  Under this provision, the time at which the agency must prepare the final ""statement"" is the time at which it makes a recommendation or report on a proposal for federal action.  Here, until the October, 1972, report, the ICC had made no proposal, and hence the earliest time at which the statute required a statement was the time of the October, 1972, report -- some time after the oral hearing.  Pp.  422 U. S. 319-321.
4. The District Court also erred in deciding that the ICC should have ""started over again"" after it decided to propose a formal impact statement, even assuming that the ICC erred in failing to prepare a separate impact statement to accompany its October, 1972, report or that the consideration given to environmental factors in that report was inadequate.

422 U.S. 332

Syllabus 
After the police, pursuant to four separate warrants, had seized four copies of an allegedly obscene film from appellees' theater, misdemeanor charges were filed in Municipal Court against two theater employees, and the California Superior Court ordered appellees to show cause why the film should not be declared obscene.  Subsequently, the Superior Court declared the film obscene and ordered seized all copies that might be found at the theater.  Rather than appealing from this order, appellees filed suit in Federal District Court against appellant police officers and prosecuting attorneys, seeking an injunction against enforcement of the California obscenity statute and for return of the seized copies of the film, and a judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional.  A three-judge court was then convened to consider the constitutionality of the statute.  Meanwhile, appellees were added as parties defendant in the Municipal Court criminal proceeding.  Thereafter, the three-judge court declared the obscenity statute unconstitutional, ordered return to appellees of all seized copies of the film, and rejected appellants' claim that Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, and Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66, required dismissal of the case, holding that no criminal charges were pending against appellees in state court and that, in any event, the pattern of search warrants and seizures of the film showed bad faith and harassment on the authorities' part.  The court then denied appellants' motions for rehearing and relief from the judgment, based, inter alia, on this Court's intervening dismissal ""for want of a substantial federal question"" of the appeal in Miller v. California, 418 U. S. 915 (Miller II), from the California Superior Court's judgment sustaining the constitutionality of the California obscenity statute; reaffirmed its Younger v. Harris ruling; and, after concluding that it was not bound by the dismissal of Miller II, supra, adhered to its judgment that the obscenity statute was unconstitutional, although it amended its 
Page 422 U. S. 333
 injunction so as to require appellants to seek return of three of the four copies of the film in the Municipal Court's possession.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C.  1253, and the injunction, as well as the declaratory judgment, is properly before the Court.  Pp.  422 U. S. 342-348.
(a) Although the constitutional issues presented in Miller II and declared insubstantial by this Court could not be considered substantial and decided otherwise by the District Court, Miller II did not require that the three-judge court be dissolved in the circumstances.  Since appellees not only challenged the enforcement of the obscenity statute but also sought to enjoin enforcement of the search warrant statutes (necessarily on constitutional grounds) insofar as they might be applied to permit the multiple seizures of the film, and since Miller II had nothing to do with the issue of the validity of the multiple seizures, that issue remained in the case, and the three-judge court should have remained in session to consider it.  Pp.  422 U. S. 343-346.
(b) The District Court's injunction, requiring appellants to seek return of three copies of the film in the Municipal Court's possession, plainly interfered with the pending criminal prosecution and with enforcement of the obscenity statute, and hence was an injunction reserved to a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C.  2281.  Pp.  422 U. S. 347-348.
2. The District Court erred in reaching the merits of the case despite appellants' insistence that it be dismissed under Younger v. Harris and Samuels v. Mackell.  Pp.  422 U. S. 348-352.
(a) Where state criminal proceedings are begun against the federal plaintiffs after the federal complaint is filed but before any proceedings of substance on the merits have taken place in the federal court, the principles of Younger v. Harris should apply in full force.  Here, appellees were charged in the state criminal proceedings prior to appellants' answering the federal case and prior to any proceedings before the three-judge court, and hence the federal complaint should have been dismissed on appellants' motion absent satisfactory proof of those extraordinary circumstances warranting one of the exceptions to the rule of Younger v. Harris and related cases.  Pp.  422 U. S. 348-350.
(b) Absent at least some effort by the District Court to impeach the prosecuting officials' entitlement to rely on repeated judicial authorization for seizures of the film, official bad faith and

 harassment were not made out, and the District Court erred in holding otherwise.  Pp.  422 U. S. 350-352.

Syllabus 
In 1969, a Virginia court approved annexation by the city of Richmond, effective January 1, 1970, of an adjacent area in Chesterfield County, which reduced the proportion of Negroes in Richmond from 52% to 42%.  The pre-annexation nine-man city council, which was elected at large, had three members who were endorsed by a Negro civic organization.  In a post-annexation at-large election in 1970, three of the nine members elected were also endorsed by that organization.  Following this Court's holding in Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379, that  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Act) reaches the extension of a city's boundaries through annexation, the city of Richmond unsuccessfully sought the Attorney General's approval of the Chesterfield County annexation.  Meanwhile respondent Holt brought an action in federal court in Virginia challenging the annexation on constitutional grounds, and the District Court issued a decision, Holt v. City of Richmond, 334 F.Supp. 228 (Holt I), holding that the annexation had an illegal racial purpose, and ordered a new election.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  In the interim, Holt had brought another suit (Holt II) in the District Court seeking to have the annexation invalidated under  5 of the Act for lack of the approval required by the Act.  As the result of the Holt II suit, which was stayed pending the outcome of the instant litigation, further city council elections have been enjoined, and the 1970 council has remained in office.  Having received no response from the Attorney General to a renewed approval request, the city brought this suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking approval of the annexation and relying on the Court of Appeals' decision in Holt I.  Shortly thereafter, the District Court decided City of Petersburg v. United States, 354 F.Supp. 1021, aff'd, 410 U.S. 962, invalidating another Virginia annexation plan where at-large council elections were the rule before and after annexation, but indicating that approval could be obtained if
""modifications calculated to neutralize 
Page 422 U. S. 359
 any adverse effect upon the political participation of black voters are adopted, i.e., that the plaintiff shift from an at-large to a ward system of electing its city councilmen.""
Richmond thereafter developed and the Attorney General approved a plan for nine wards, four with substantial black majorities, four with substantial white majorities, and the ninth with a 59% white, 41% black division.  Following opposition by intervenors, the plan was referred to a Special Master, who concluded that the city had not met its burden of proving that the annexation's purpose was not to dilute the black vote, and that the ward plan did not cure the racially discriminatory purpose.  Additionally, he concluded that the annexation's diluting effect had not been dissipated to the greatest extent possible, that no acceptable offsetting economic or administrative benefits had been shown, and that deannexation was the only acceptable remedy for the  5 violations.  Except for the deannexation recommendation, the District Court accepted the Special Master's findings and conclusions.  The District Court concluded that,
""[i]f the proportion of blacks in the new citizenry from the annexed area is appreciably less than the proportion of blacks living within the city's old boundaries, and particularly if there is a history of racial bloc voting in the city, the voting power of black citizens as a class is diluted, and thus abridged.""
The matter of the remedy to be fashioned was left for resolution in the still-pending Holt II.
Held:
1. An annexation reducing the relative political strength of the minority race in the enlarged city as compared with what it was before the annexation does not violate  5 of the Act as long as the post-annexation system fairly recognizes, as it does in this case, the minority's political potential. Pp. 367-372.
(a) Although Perkins v. Matthews, supra, held that boundary changes by annexation have a sufficient potential for racial voting discrimination to require  5 approval procedures, this does not mean that every annexation effecting a percentage reduction in the Negro population is prohibited by  5.  Though annexation of an area with a white majority, combined with at-large councilmanic elections and racial voting, create or enhance the power of the white majority to exclude Negroes totally from the city council, that consequence can be satisfactorily obviated if at-large elections are replaced by a ward system of choosing councilmen, affording Negroes representation reasonably equivalent to their political strength in the enlarged community.  Though the black community, if there is racial bloc voting, will have fewer councilmen, 
Page 422 U. S. 360
 a different city council and an enlarged city are involved in the annexation.  Negroes, moreover, will not be underrepresented.  Pp.  422 U. S. 368-371.
(b) The plan here under review does not undervalue the post-annexation black voting strength or have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote within the meaning of  5.  Pp.  422 U. S. 371-372.
2. Since  5 forbids voting changes made for the purpose of denying the vote for racial reasons, further proceedings are necessary to update and reassess the evidence bearing upon the issue whether the city has sound, nondiscriminatory economic and administrative reasons for retaining the annexed area, it not being clear that the Special Master and the District Court adequately considered the evidence in deciding whether there are now justifiable reasons for the annexation that took place on January 1, 1970.

422 U.S. 171

Syllabus 
Following respondent's arrest for robbery, he was taken to the police station, where, advised of his right to remain silent, he made no response to an officer's inquiry as to the source of money found on his person.  Respondent testified at his trial and, in an effort to impeach his alibi, the prosecutor caused respondent to admit on cross-examination that he had not offered the exculpatory information to the police at the time of his arrest.  The trial court instructed the jury to disregard the colloquy, but refused to declare a mistrial.  Respondent was convicted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that inquiry into respondent's prior silence impermissibly prejudiced his defense as well as infringed upon his constitutional right to remain silent under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  The Government, relying on Raffel v. United States, 271 U. S. 494, contends that, since respondent chose to testify in his own behalf, it was permissible to impeach his credibility by proving that he had chosen to remain silent at the time of his arrest.
Held:  Respondent's silence during police interrogation lacked significant probative value, and, under these circumstances, any reference to his silence carried with it an intolerably prejudicial impact.  This Court, exercising its supervisory authority over the lower federal courts, therefore concludes that respondent is entitled to a new trial.  Pp.  422 U. S. 176-181.
(a) Under the circumstances of this case, the failure of respondent, who had just been given the Miranda warnings, to respond during custodial interrogation to inquiry about the money can as easily connote reliance on the right to remain silent as to support an inference that his trial testimony was a later fabrication.  Raffel v. United States, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  422 U. S. 176-177.
(b) Respondent's prior silence was not so clearly inconsistent with his trial testimony as to warrant admission into evidence of that silence as evidence of a prior inconsistent ""statement,"" as is manifested by the facts that (1) respondent had repeatedly asserted innocence during the proceedings; (2) he was being questioned in secretive surroundings, with no one but the police also

(c) Admission of evidence of silence at the time of arrest has a significant potential for prejudice in that the jury may assign much more weight to the defendant's previous silence than is warranted.  P.  422 U. S. 180.

422 U.S. 205

Syllabus 
A Jacksonville, Fla., ordinance making it a public nuisance and a punishable offense for a drive-in movie theater to exhibit films containing nudity, when the screen is visible from a public street or place, held facially invalid as an infringement of First Amendment rights.  Pp.  422 U. S. 208-217.
(a) The ordinance, by discriminating among movies solely on the basis of content, has the effect of deterring drive-in theaters from showing movies containing any nudity, however innocent or even educational, and such censorship of the content of otherwise protected speech cannot be justified on the basis of the limited privacy interest of persons on the public streets, who, if offended by viewing the movies, can readily avert their eyes.  Pp.  422 U. S. 208-212.
(b) Nor can the ordinance be justified as an exercise of the city's police power for the protection of children against viewing the films.  Even assuming that such is its purpose, the restriction is broader than permissible. since it is not directed against sexually explicit nudity or otherwise limited.  Pp.  422 U. S. 212-214.
(c) Nor can the ordinance be justified as a traffic regulation.  If this were its purpose, it would be invalid as a strikingly underinclusive legislative classification, since it singles out movies containing nudity from all other movies that might distract a passing motorist.  Pp.  422 U. S. 214-215.
(d) The possibility of a narrowing construction of the ordinance appears remote, particularly where appellee city offered several distinct justifications for it in its broadest terms.

			"|"Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville
No. 73-1942
Argued February 26, 1975
Decided June 23, 1975
422 U.S. 205

Syllabus 
A Jacksonville, Fla., ordinance making it a public nuisance and a punishable offense for a drive-in movie theater to exhibit films containing nudity, when the screen is visible from a public street or place, held facially invalid as an infringement of First Amendment rights.  Pp.  422 U. S. 208-217.
(a) The ordinance, by discriminating among movies solely on the basis of content, has the effect of deterring drive-in theaters from showing movies containing any nudity, however innocent or even educational, and such censorship of the content of otherwise protected speech cannot be justified on the basis of the limited privacy interest of persons on the public streets, who, if offended by viewing the movies, can readily avert their eyes.  Pp.  422 U. S. 208-212.
(b) Nor can the ordinance be justified as an exercise of the city's police power for the protection of children against viewing the films.  Even assuming that such is its purpose, the restriction is broader than permissible. since it is not directed against sexually explicit nudity or otherwise limited.  Pp.  422 U. S. 212-214.
(c) Nor can the ordinance be justified as a traffic regulation.  If this were its purpose, it would be invalid as a strikingly underinclusive legislative classification, since it singles out movies containing nudity from all other movies that might distract a passing motorist.  Pp.  422 U. S. 214-215.
(d) The possibility of a narrowing construction of the ordinance appears remote, particularly where appellee city offered several distinct justifications for it in its broadest terms.  Moreover, its deterrent effect on legitimate expression in the form of movies is both real and substantial.  Pp.  422 U. S. 215-217.

No. 74-634
Argued April 23, 1975
Decided June 23, 1975
422 U.S. 225

Syllabus 
During respondent's federal criminal trial, which resulted in a conviction, defense counsel sought to impeach the credibility of key prosecution witnesses by testimony of a defense investigator regarding statements previously obtained from the witnesses by the investigator.  When the investigator was called as a witness, the District Court stated that a copy of the investigator's report, inspected and edited by the court in camera so as to excise references to matters not relevant to such statements, would have to be submitted to the prosecution for inspection at the completion of the investigator's testimony.  When defense counsel said he did not intend to produce the report, the court ruled that the investigator could not testify about his interviews with the witnesses.  The Court of Appeals, considering such ruling to be reversible error, held that both the Fifth Amendment and Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 16 prohibited the disclosure condition imposed.
Held:
1. In a proper case, the prosecution, as well as the defense, can invoke the federal judiciary's inherent power to require production of previously recorded witness statements that facilitate full disclosure of all the relevant facts.  Here, the investigator's report might provide critical insight into the issues of credibility that the investigator's testimony would raise, and hence was highly relevant to such issues.  Pp.  422 U. S. 230-232.
2. The Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, being personal to the defendant, does not extend to the testimony or statements of third parties called as witnesses at trial.  In this instance, the fact that the statements of third parties were elicited by a defense investigator on respondent's behalf does not convert them into respondent's personal communications, and requiring their production would in no sense compel respondent to be a witness against himself or extort communications from him.  Pp.  422 U. S. 233-234.
3. Rule 16, whose language and history both indicate that it addresses only pretrial discovery, imposes no constraint on the 
Page 422 U. S. 226
 District Court's power to condition the impeachment testimony of respondent's witness on the production of the relevant portions of his report.  The fact that the Rule incorporates the Jencks Act limitation shows no contrary intent, and does not convert the Rule into a general limitation on the trial court's broad discretion as to evidentiary questions at trial.  Pp.  422 U. S. 234-236.
4. The qualified privilege derived from the attorney work product doctrine is not available to prevent disclosure of the investigative report, since respondent, by electing to present the investigator as a witness, waived the privilege with respect to matters covered in his testimony.  Pp.  422 U. S. 236-240.
5. It was within the District Court's discretion to assure that the jury would hear the investigator's full testimony, rather than a truncated portion favorable to respondent, and the court's ruling, contrary to respondent's contention, did not deprive him of the Sixth Amendment rights to compulsory process and cross-examination.  That Amendment does not confer the right to present testimony free from the legitimate demands of the adversarial system, and cannot be invoked as a justification for presenting what might have been a half-truth.  Pp.  422 U. S. 240-241.

 Douglas WATTSv. UNITED STATES.No. 74-6118. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 23, 1975
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. Upon representation of the Solicitor General set forth in his brief for the United States filed May 2, 1975, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to permit the Government to dismiss charges against the petitioner. 

 Mr. Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Mr. Justice WHITE and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was acquitted in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, of aggravated assault with intent to rob and carrying a concealed weapon. Thereafter, petitioner was convicted in federal court of knowingly possessing an unregistered firearm, a sawed-off shotgun, in violation of 26 U.S.C. 5861(d). The federal charge arose out of the same episode, and involved the same weapon, as the state prosecution. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction, rejecting, inter alia, petitioner's contention that the state acquittal barred his federal prosecution under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 
 The evidence at petitioner's federal trial established that in connection with a robbery attempt on November 14, 1973, petitioner, accompanied by another, assaulted Robert McGibbon with a 12 gauge, single barreled, sawed-off shotgun. McGibbon managed to break away from his assailants and immediately reported the inci- 
Page 422 U.S. 1032 , 1033
 dent to Officer Ward, an Atlanta policeman who was nearby. Ward located petitioner and a companion a few blocks away and, on the basis of McGibbon's description, took them into custody. As petitioner's companion was entering the patrol car, Ward noticed him bend down 'as if he was putting something under the car.' Subsequent investigation revealed the sawed-off shotgun, which was not registered to petitioner, under the patrol car. 
 In rejecting petitioner's double jeopardy claim, the Court of Appeals pointed out that, under Ga.Code Ann. 26-9911a, 9913a, possession of a sawed-off shotgun 15 inches or less in length is prohibited, whereas the shotgun involved here had an overall length of 16 1/2 inches. The Court of Appeals held that, in any event, the prior state prosecution and acquittal were not a bar to the subsequent federal prosecution under Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187 (1959), and Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121 (1959). Although he agrees with the latter conclusion, the Solicitor General nevertheless now requests the Court to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court to permit the Government to move for dismissal of the charges against petitioner. The request is based on the Government's belated claim that the prosecution of petitioner under 5861(d) 'did not conform to the Department of Justice policy of not prosecuting individuals previously tried in a state court for offenses involving the same acts, unless there exist 'most compelling reasons,' and then only after the specific approval of the appropriate Assistant Attorney General has been obtained.' 
 In support of his position, the Solicitor General states that no approval was sought in this case, and he concludes that it 'does not present circumstances which [422 U.S. 1032 , 1034]

Syllabus 
Two hours after retiring for deliberation in petitioner's trial for having allegedly violated 18 U.S.C.  871(a) by threatening the life of the President, the jury by note asked the trial judge whether he would accept a verdict of ""Guilty as charged with extreme mercy of the Court.""  The judge through the marshal answered affirmatively without notifying petitioner or his counsel.  Five minutes later, the jury returned a verdict of guilty with the indicated recommendation, which was upheld on appeal.
Held:

Although a violation of Rule 43 may in some circumstances be harmless error, that conclusion cannot be reached in this case.  At the very least, the trial court should have reminded the jury that its recommendation would not in any way be binding, and should have admonished the jury to reach its verdict without regard to what sentence might be imposed.

422 U.S. 49

Syllabus 
Respondent corporation brought this action against petitioner to enjoin him from voting or pledging his stock in respondent and from acquiring additional shares, and to require him to divest himself of the stock that he already owned.  Respondent claimed that the failure of petitioner, who had acquired more than 5% of respondent's stock, to make timely disclosure as required by  13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by the Williams Act, was a scheme to defraud respondent and its stockholders.  Petitioner, who had filed the disclosure schedule about three months after the statutory filing time, contended that the Williams Act violation, which he readily conceded, resulted from his lack of familiarity with the securities laws, and that neither respondent nor its shareholders had been harmed.  The District Court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment, having found no material issues of fact regarding petitioner's lack of willfulness in failing to make a timely filing and no basis in the record for disputing petitioner's claim that he first considered the possibility of obtaining control of respondent sometime after he discovered his filing obligation.  It concluded that respondent had suffered no cognizable harm from the late filing, and that this was not an appropriate case in which to grant injunctive relief.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that respondent was harmed by having been delayed in its efforts to respond to petitioner's potential to obtain control of the company but that, in any event, respondent was not required to show irreparable harm as a prerequisite to obtaining permanent injunctive relief since, as the securities' issuer, respondent was in the best position to assure that  13(d)'s filing requirements were being timely and fully complied with.
Held:  A showing of irreparable harm, in accordance with traditional principles of equity, is necessary before a private litigant can obtain injunctive relief based upon  13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act.  Pp.  422 U. S. 57-65.
(a) The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that respondent suffered ""harm"" because of petitioner's technical default, since 
Page 422 U. S. 50
 petitioner has not attempted to obtain control of respondent, has now made proper disclosure, and has given no indication that he will not report any material changes in his disclosure schedule.  Pp.  422 U. S. 58-59.
(b) Persons who allegedly sold their stock to petitioner at unfairly depressed pre-disclosure prices have adequate remedies by an action for damages, and those who would not have invested, had they thought a takeover bid was imminent, are not threatened with injury.  Pp.  422 U. S. 59-60.
(c) The District Court was entirely correct in insisting that respondent satisfy the traditional prerequisites of extraordinary equitable relief by establishing irreparable harm, and its conclusions that petitioner acted in good faith and promptly filed a disclosure schedule when he became aware of his obligation to do so support the exercise of that court's sound judicial discretion to deny the application for an injunction, relief that is historically ""designed to deter, not to punish.""

Syllabus 
Respondent stockholder brought this action seeking damages in favor of petitioner Bethlehem Steel Corp., a Delaware corporation, and injunctive relief because of advertisements in connection with the 1972 Presidential election that petitioner corporate directors had authorized from general corporate funds in alleged violation of 18 U.S.C.  610, which prohibits corporations from making contributions or expenditures in connection with specified federal elections.  Respondent alleged jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1331, and sought to state a private claim for relief under 18 U.S.C.  610, and also invoked pendent jurisdiction for an ultra vires claim under Delaware law.  The District Court's denial of a preliminary injunction was upheld on appeal, following which respondent dropped the pendent claim rather than post security for expenses under state law before proceeding with that claim.  The District Court then granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the passage of the election had not mooted the case, since damages were sought, and that
""a private cause of action, whether brought by a citizen to secure injunctive relief or by a stockholder to secure injunctive or derivative damage relief [is] proper to remedy violation of  610.""
After the Court of Appeals decision Congress enacted the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974 (hereinafter the Amendments), under which, inter alia, the Federal Election Commission can receive citizen complaints of statutory violations and, where warranted, request the Attorney General to seek injunctive action.
Held:
1. The Amendments constitute an intervening law that relegates to the Commission's cognizance respondent's complaint as citizen or stockholder for injunctive relief against any alleged violations of  610 in future elections, since this Court must examine this case according to the law existing at the time of its decision.

Page 422 U. S. 67

2. Respondent stockholder's derivative suit with regard to the alleged 1972 violation cannot be implied under 18 U.S.C.  610, and respondent's remedy, if any, must be under Delaware's corporation law.  Pp.  422 U. S. 77-85.
(a) Section 610 was primarily concerned not with the internal relations between corporations and stockholders, but with corporations as a source of aggregated wealth, and therefore of potential corrupting influence; thus, this statute differs from other criminal statutes in which private causes of action have been inferred because of a clearly articulated federal right in the plaintiff, e.g., Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, or a pervasive legislative scheme governing the relationship between the plaintiff class and the defendant class in a particular regard, e.g., J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426.  Pp.  422 U. S. 78-82.
(b) The legislative history of  610 suggests no congressional intention to vest in corporate shareholders a federal right to damages for a violation of the statute.  Pp.  422 U. S. 82-84.
(c) A private remedy would not further the statutory purpose of dulling corporate influence on federal elections, since any compelled repayment to the corporation might well not deter the initial violation.  P.  422 U. S. 84.
(d) The cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law in an area of primarily state concern.  In addition to the ultra vires claim urged by respondent the alleged misuse of corporate funds might, under the law of some States, give rise to a cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty.

No. 73-1933
Argued March 19, 1975
Decided June 17, 1975
422 U.S. 86

Syllabus 
To circumvent Georgia's longstanding stringent restrictions on city banks' opening branches in suburban areas, appellee Citizens & Southern National Bank (C&S National) formed a holding company, which then embarked on a program of forming de facto branch banks in Atlanta's suburbs.  This program included the holding company's ownership of 5 percent of the stock of each of the suburban banks, ownership of much of the remaining stock by parties friendly to the C&S system of banking entities (hereafter C&S), the suburban banks' use of the C&S logogram and of all C&S's banking services, and close C&S oversight of the suburban banks' operation and governance.  In 1970, Georgia amended its banking statutes so as to allow de jure branching upon a county-wide basis.  This meant that C&S could now absorb the 5-percent banks as true branches, because Atlanta is contained within the two counties encompassing the suburbs in which the 5-percent banks operated.  Consequently C&S applied to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under the Bank Merger Act of 1966 for permission to acquire all the stock of six of the 5-percent banks historically operated as de facto branches or ""correspondent associate"" banks within the C&S system.  The FDIC authorized five of the proposed acquisitions.  The Government then brought suit in District Court for injunctive relief, alleging that the five acquisitions would lessen competition in relevant banking markets in violation of  7 of the Clayton Act, and that the historic de facto branch relations between C&S and the six 5-percent banks constituted unreasonable restraints of trade in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  The court rendered judgment for C&S.  Three of the 5-percent banks were formed prior to, and three after, July 1, 1966.  The ""grandfather"" provision of the Bank Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C.  1849(d), as added by the 1966 amendments, provides that
""[a]ny acquisition, merger, or consolidation of the kind described 
Page 422 U. S. 87
 in [12 U.S.C. ] 1842(a). . . which was consummated at any time prior or subsequent to May 9, 1956, and as to which no litigation was initiated by the Attorney General prior to July 1, 1966, shall be conclusively presumed not to have been in violation of any antitrust laws other than""
 2 of the Sherman Act.  Title 12 U.S.C.  1842(a) makes it unlawful, absent the Federal Reserve Board's prior approval, for bank holding companies to engage in certain transactions, including those tending to create or enlarge holding company control of independent banks.
Held:
1. Since the Attorney General took no action by July, 1966, against the three 5-percent banks that were formed prior to that date, the transactions by which these banks became 5-percent banks fall within the terms of the grandfather provision of the Bank Holding Company Act, and therefore the correspondent associate programs in force at these banks are immune from attack under  1 of the Sherman Act.  While C&S's formation of a de facto branch was a unique type of transaction, it may fairly be characterized as an ""acquisition, merger, or consolidation of the kind described in [12 U.S.C. ] 1842(a),"" and clearly falls within the class of dealings by bank holding companies that Congress intended, in the grandfather provision, to shield from retroactive challenge under the antitrust laws.  Pp.  422 U. S. 102-111.
2. In the face of the stringent state restrictions on branching, C&S's program of founding new de facto branches, and maintaining them as such, did not infringe  1 of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  422 U. S. 111-120.
(a) Though the Government contends that the correspondent associate programs encompassed at least a tacit agreement to fix interest rates and service charges so as to make the interrelationships -- to that extent at least -- illegal per se, it cannot be held, in view of the mixed evidence in the record, and of the fact that such programs, as such, were permissible under the Sherman Act, that the District Court clearly erred in finding that the lack of significant price competition flowed not from a tacit agreement, but as an indirect, unintentional, and formally discouraged result of the sharing of expertise and information that was at the heart of the correspondent associate program.  Pp.  422 U. S. 112-114.
(b) The Government's alternative contention, that the correspondent associate programs transcending conventional ""correspondent"" relationships ""unreasonably"" restrained competition 
Page 422 U. S. 88
 among the 5-percent banks and between these banks and C&S National, is not persuasive, since, even if the Government had proved that such programs restrained competition among the defendant banks more thoroughly or effectively than would have a conventional correspondent program (which the District Court found not to be the case), that alone would not make out a Sherman Act violation.  Pp.  422 U. S. 114-116.
(c) Where C&S has operated the 5-percent banks as de facto branches in direct response to Georgia's historic restrictions on de jure branching, restraints of trade integral to this particular, unusual function are not unreasonable.  To characterize the relationships at issue as an unreasonable restraint of trade is to forget that their whole purpose and effect were to defeat a restraint of trade, and by providing new banking options to suburban Atlanta customers, while eliminating no existing options, C&S's de facto branching program has plainly been procompetitive.  Pp.  422 U. S. 116-120.
3. The proposed acquisitions will not violate  7 of the Clayton Act.  Pp.  422 U. S. 120-122.
(a) Since C&S's program of founding and maintaining new de facto branches in the face of Georgia's anti-branching law did not violate the Sherman Act, and since the de facto branches that C&S proposes to acquire were all founded ab initio with C&S sponsorship, it follows that the proposed acquisitions will extinguish no present competitive conduct or relationships.  P.  422 U. S. 121.
(b) As for future competition, there is no evidence of any realistic prospect that denial of the acquisitions would lead the defendant banks to compete against each other, the Clayton Act being concerned with ""probable"" effects on competition, not with ""ephemeral possibilities.""  Pp.  422 U. S. 121-122.

Petitioners then sued respondent for copyright infringement.  The District Court granted awards, but the Court of Appeals reversed.

422 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Section 13 of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act provides that the right to compensation for disability under the Act shall be barred unless a claim therefor is filed within one year after the injury.  Section 22 provides that, upon his own initiative or upon the application of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in his determination of fact, the Deputy Commissioner of the Bureau of Employees' Compensation (the agency charged with administering the Act) may,
""at any time prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation, whether or not a compensation order has been issued, or at any time prior to one year after the rejection of a claim,""
review a compensation case and issue a ""new compensation order"" which may terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, or decrease such compensation, or award compensation.  A claimant, who was injured in 1960 while working for petitioner employer, filed a claim for total permanent disability within  13's one-year statute of limitations.  Petitioner insurance carrier, in advance of an award by the Deputy Commissioner, first paid the weekly amount for total disability, though denying 
Page 422 U. S. 2
 the extent of disability, but, in 1965 ,filed notice that it was contesting the extent of disability and was reducing the weekly compensation to the amount for 50% temporary disability, and, in 1968, stopped payment of compensation after reaching the maximum of its liability for any condition other than permanent disability or death.  In 1970, two years after his last receipt of a voluntary compensation payment, the claimant requested a hearing on his claim for permanent disability, this being the first requested action to adjudicate the merits of the claim by either him or the carrier in the 10 years following the filing of the claim, and no order or award having been entered during this period.  Respondent Deputy Commissioner then entered an award for permanent total disability, and petitioners brought suit to enjoin its enforcement.  The District Court held that  22 barred the claim, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  While the language of  22 is ambiguous, the section's legislative history, including the history of the amendment inserting the phrase ""whether or not a compensation order has been issued,"" shows that the section's one-year time limit was meant to apply only to the Deputy Commissioner's power to modify previously entered orders, and that therefore the section does not bar consideration of a claim timely filed under  13, which has not been the subject of prior action by the Deputy Commissioner, and with respect to which the Deputy Commissioner took no action until more than one year after the claimant's last receipt of a voluntary compensation payment.  Taken in its historical and statutory context, the phrase ""whether or not a compensation order has been issued"" is properly interpreted to mean merely that the one-year time limit imposed on the Deputy Commissioner's power to modify existing orders runs from the date of final payment of compensation even if the order sought to be modified is actually entered only after such date.

			"|"Intercounty Construction Corp. v. Walter
No. 74-362
Argued April 23, 1975
Decided June 16, 1975
422 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Section 13 of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act provides that the right to compensation for disability under the Act shall be barred unless a claim therefor is filed within one year after the injury.  Section 22 provides that, upon his own initiative or upon the application of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in his determination of fact, the Deputy Commissioner of the Bureau of Employees' Compensation (the agency charged with administering the Act) may,
""at any time prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation, whether or not a compensation order has been issued, or at any time prior to one year after the rejection of a claim,""
review a compensation case and issue a ""new compensation order"" which may terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, or decrease such compensation, or award compensation.  A claimant, who was injured in 1960 while working for petitioner employer, filed a claim for total permanent disability within  13's one-year statute of limitations.  Petitioner insurance carrier, in advance of an award by the Deputy Commissioner, first paid the weekly amount for total disability, though denying 
Page 422 U. S. 2
 the extent of disability, but, in 1965 ,filed notice that it was contesting the extent of disability and was reducing the weekly compensation to the amount for 50% temporary disability, and, in 1968, stopped payment of compensation after reaching the maximum of its liability for any condition other than permanent disability or death.  In 1970, two years after his last receipt of a voluntary compensation payment, the claimant requested a hearing on his claim for permanent disability, this being the first requested action to adjudicate the merits of the claim by either him or the carrier in the 10 years following the filing of the claim, and no order or award having been entered during this period.  Respondent Deputy Commissioner then entered an award for permanent total disability, and petitioners brought suit to enjoin its enforcement.  The District Court held that  22 barred the claim, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  While the language of  22 is ambiguous, the section's legislative history, including the history of the amendment inserting the phrase ""whether or not a compensation order has been issued,"" shows that the section's one-year time limit was meant to apply only to the Deputy Commissioner's power to modify previously entered orders, and that therefore the section does not bar consideration of a claim timely filed under  13, which has not been the subject of prior action by the Deputy Commissioner, and with respect to which the Deputy Commissioner took no action until more than one year after the claimant's last receipt of a voluntary compensation payment.  Taken in its historical and statutory context, the phrase ""whether or not a compensation order has been issued"" is properly interpreted to mean merely that the one-year time limit imposed on the Deputy Commissioner's power to modify existing orders runs from the date of final payment of compensation even if the order sought to be modified is actually entered only after such date.  Pp.  422 U. S. 6-12.

No. 74-70
Argued March 25, 1975
Decided June 16, 1975
421 U.S. 773

Syllabus 
Petitioners, husband and wife, contracted to buy a home in Fairfax County, Va. and the lender who financed the purchase required them to obtain title insurance, which necessitated a title examination that could be performed legally only by a member of respondent Virginia State Bar.  Petitioners unsuccessfully tried to find a lawyer who would examine the title for less than the fee prescribed in a minimum fee schedule published by respondent Fairfax County Bar Association and enforced by respondent Virginia State Bar.  Petitioners then brought this class action against respondents, seeking injunctive relief and damages, and alleging that the minimum fee schedule and its enforcement mechanism, as applied to fees for legal services relating to residential real estate transactions, constitute price-fixing in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  Although holding that the State Bar was exempt from the Sherman Act, the District Court granted judgment against the County Bar Association and enjoined the publication of the fee schedule.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding not only that the State Bar's actions were immune from liability as ""state action,"" Parke v. Bown, 317 U. S. 341, but also that the County Bar Association was immune because the practice of law, as a ""learned profession,"" is not ""trade or commerce"" under the Sherman Act; and that, in any event, respondents' activities did not have sufficient effect on interstate commerce to support Sherman Act jurisdiction.
Held:  The minimum fee schedule, as published by the County Bar Association and enforced by the State Bar, violates  1 of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  421 U. S. 780-793.
(a) The schedule and its enforcement mechanism constitute price-fixing, since the record shows that the schedule, rather than being purely advisory, operated as a fixed, rigid price floor.  The fee schedule was enforced through the prospect of professional discipline by the State Bar, by reason of attorneys' desire to comply with announced professional norms, and by the assurance that other lawyers would not compete by underbidding.  Pp.  421 U. S. 781-783. 
Page 421 U. S. 774

(b) Since a significant amount of funds furnished for financing the purchase of homes in Fairfax County comes from outside the State, and since a title examination is an integral part of such interstate transactions, interstate commerce is sufficiently affected for Sherman Act purposes notwithstanding that there is no showing that prospective purchasers were discouraged from buying homes in Fairfax County by the challenged activities, and no showing that the fee schedule resulted in raising fees.  Pp.  421 U. S. 783-785.
(c) Congress did not intend any sweeping ""learned profession"" exclusion from the Sherman Act; a title examination is a service, and the exchange of such a service for money is ""commerce"" in the common usage of that term.  Pp.  421 U. S. 785-788.
(d) Respondents' activities are not exempt from the Sherman Act as ""state action"" within the meaning of Parker v. Brown, supra.  Neither the Virginia Supreme Court nor any Virginia statute required such activities, and, although the State Bar has the power to issue ethical opinions, it does not appear that the Supreme Court approves them.  It is not enough that the anticompetitive conduct is ""prompted"" by state action; to be exempt, such conduct must be compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign.  Here the State Bar, by providing that deviation from the minimum fees may lead to disciplinary action, has voluntarily joined in what is essentially a private anticompetitive activity, and hence cannot claim it is beyond the Sherman Act's reach.  Pp.  421 U. S. 788-792.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who was convicted in state court of robbery, contends in this habeas corpus proceeding that he was denied a fair trial because jurors had learned from news accounts of prior felony convictions or certain facts about the robbery charge.  In the course of jury selection 78 members of the panel were questioned, 70 being excused (30 for personal reasons, 20 peremptorily, and 20 by the court as having prejudged petitioner), and eight being selected (including two alternates).  The District Court and the Court of Appeals denied relief.
Held:
1. Juror exposure to information about a state defendant's prior convictions or to news accounts of the crime with which he is charged do not alone presumptively deprive the defendant of due process.  Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717; Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723; Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532; Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333, distinguished.  Pp.  421 U. S. 797-799.
2. The voir dire in this case indicates no such juror hostility to petitioner as to suggest a partiality that could not be laid aside.  Though some jurors vaguely recalled the robbery and each had some knowledge of petitioner's past crimes, none betrayed any belief in the relevance to the robbery case of petitioner's past, and there was no indication from the circumstances surrounding petitioner's trial or from the number of the panel excused for prejudgment of petitioner, of inflamed community sentiment to counter the indicia of impartiality disclosed by the voir dire transcript.  Thus, in the totality of the circumstances, petitioner failed to show inherent prejudice in the trial setting or actual prejudice from the jury selection process.  Pp.  421 U. S. 799-803.

Decided June 16, 1975
421 U.S. 809

Syllabus 
Appellant, the managing editor of a weekly newspaper published in Virginia, as the result of publishing a New York City organization's advertisement announcing that it would arrange low-cost placements for women with unwanted pregnancies in accredited hospitals and clinics in New York (where abortions were legal and there were no residency requirements), was convicted of violating a Virginia statute making it a misdemeanor, by the sale or circulation of any publication, to encourage or prompt the processing of an abortion.  The trial court had rejected appellant's claim that the statute was unconstitutional under the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth as being facially overbroad and as applied to appellant.  The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, also rejecting appellant's First Amendment claim and holding that the advertisement was a commercial one which could be constitutionally prohibited under the State's police power, and that, because appellant himself lacked a legitimate First Amendment interest inasmuch as his activity ""was of a purely commercial nature,"" he had no standing to challenge the statute as being facially overbroad.
Held:
1. Though an intervening amendment of the statute, as a practical matter, moots the overbreadth issue for the future, the Virginia courts erred in denying appellant standing to raise that issue, since ""pure speech"", rather than conduct, was involved, and no consideration was given to whether or not the alleged overbreadth was substantial.  Pp.  421 U. S. 815-818.
2. The statute as applied to appellant infringed constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment.  Pp.  421 U. S. 818-829.
(a) The Virginia courts erred in assuming that advertising, as such, was entitled to no First Amendment protection and that appellant had no legitimate First Amendment interest, since speech is not stripped of First Amendment protection merely because it appears in the form of a paid commercial advertisement, and the fact that the advertisement in question had commercial 
Page 421 U. S. 810
 aspects or reflected the advertiser's commercial interests did not negate all First Amendment guarantees.  Pp.  421 U. S. 818-821.
(b) Viewed in its entirety, the advertisement conveyed information of potential interest and value to a diverse audience consisting of not only readers possibly in need of the services offered, but also those concerned with the subject matter or the law of another State, and readers seeking reform in Virginia; and thus appellant's First Amendment interests coincided with the constitutional interests of the general public.  Pp.  421 U. S. 821-822.
(c) A State does not acquire power or supervision over another State's internal affairs merely because its own citizens' welfare and health may be affected when they travel to the other State, and while a State may seek to disseminate information so as to enable its citizens to make better informed decisions when they leave, it may not, under the guise of exercising internal police powers, bar a citizen of another State from disseminating information about an activity that is legal in that State, as the placement services here were at the time they were advertised.  Pp.  421 U. S. 822-825.
(d) Virginia's asserted interest in regulating what Virginians may hear or read about the New York services or in shielding its citizens from information about activities outside Virginia's borders (which Virginia's police powers do not reach) is entitled to little, if any, weight under the circumstances.

No. 74-157
Argued April 22, 1975
Decided June 16, 1975*
421 U.S. 837

Syllabus 
Respondents are 57 residents of Co-op City, a massive cooperative housing project in New York City, organized, financed, and constructed under the New York Private Housing Finance Law (Mitchell-Lama Act).  They brought this action on behalf of all the apartment owners and derivatively on behalf of the housing corporation, alleging, inter alia, violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (hereafter collectively Securities Acts), in connection with the sale to respondents of shares of the common stock of the cooperative housing corporation.  Citing substantial increases in the tenants' monthly rental charges as a result of higher construction costs, respondents' claim centered on a Co-op City Information Bulletin issued in the project's initial stages, which allegedly misrepresented that the developers would absorb future cost increases due to such factors as inflation.  Under the Mitchell-Lama Act, which was designed to encourage private developers to build low-cost cooperative housing, the State provides large, long-term low-interest mortgage loans and substantial tax exemptions, conditioned on step-by-step state supervision of the cooperative's development.  Developers must agree to operate the facilities ""on a nonprofit basis,"" and may lease apartments to only state-approved lessees whose incomes are below a certain level.  The corporate petitioners in this case built, promoted, and presently control Co-op City:  United Housing Foundation (UHF), a nonprofit membership corporation, initiated and sponsored the project; Riverbay, a nonprofit cooperative housing corporation, was organized by UHF to own and operate the land and buildings and issue the stock that is the subject of the instant action; and Community Securities, Inc. (CSI), UHF's wholly owned subsidiary, was the project's general 
Page 421 U. S. 838
 contractor and sales agent.  To acquire a Co-op City apartment, a prospective purchaser must buy 18 shares of Riverbay stock for each room desired at $25 per share.  The shares cannot be transferred to a nontenant, pledged, encumbered, or bequeathed (except to a surviving spouse), and do not convey voting rights based on the number owned (each apartment having one vote).  On termination of occupancy, a tenant must offer his stock to Riverbay at $25 per share, and, in the unlikely event that Riverbay does not repurchase, the tenant cannot sell his shares for more than their original price, plus a fraction of the mortgage amortization that he has paid during his tenancy, and then only to a prospective tenant satisfying the statutory income eligibility requirements.  Under the Co-op City Lease arrangement, the resident is committed to make monthly rental payments in accordance with the size, nature, and location of the apartment.  The Securities Acts define a ""security"" as ""any . . . stock, . . . investment contract, . . . or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a security.'""  Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of federal jurisdiction, maintaining that the Riverbay stock did not constitute securities as thus defined.  The District Court granted the motion to dismiss.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that (1) since the shares purchased were called ""stock,"" the definitional sections of the Securities Acts were literally applicable, and (2) the transaction was an investment contract under the Securities Acts, there being a profit expectation from rental reductions resulting from (i) the income produced by commercial facilities established for the use of Co-op City tenants; (ii) tax deductions for the portion of monthly rental charges allocable to interest payments on the mortgage; and (iii) savings based on the fact that Co-op City apartments cost substantially less than comparable nonsubsidized housing.
Held:  The shares of stock involved in this Litigation do not constitute ""securities"" within the purview of the Securities Acts, and since respondents' claims are not cognizable in federal court, the District Court properly dismissed their complaint.  Pp.  421 U. S. 847-858.
(a) When viewed, as they must be, in terms of their substance (the economic realities of the transaction), rather than their form, the instruments involved here were not shares of stock in the ordinary sense of conferring the right to receive ""dividends contingent upon an apportionment of profits,"" Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332,  389 U. S. 339, with the traditional characteristics of being 
Page 421 U. S. 839
 negotiable, subject to pledge or hypothecation, conferring voting rights proportional to the number of shares owned, and possibility of appreciating in value.  On the contrary, these instruments were purchased not for making a profit, but for acquiring subsidized low-cost. housing.  Pp.  421 U. S. 848-851.
(b) A share in Riverbay does not constitute an ""investment contract"" as defined by the Securities Acts, a term which, like the term ""any . . . instrument commonly known as a security,'"" involves investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.  Here, neither of the kinds of profits traditionally associated with securities were offered to respondents; instead, as indicated in the Information Bulletin, which stressed the ""non-profit"" nature of the project, the focus was upon the acquisition of a place to live.  Pp.  421 U. S. 851-854.
(c) Although deductible for tax purposes, the portion of rental charges applied to interest on the mortgage (benefits generally available to home mortgagors) does not constitute ""profits,"" and, in any event, does not derive from the efforts of third parties.  Pp.  421 U. S. 854-855.
(d) Low rent attributable to state financial subsidies no more embodies income or profit attributes than other types of government subsidies.  P.  421 U. S. 855.
(e) Such income as might derive from Co-op City's leasing of commercial facilities within the housing project to be used to reduce tenant rentals (the prospect of which was never mentioned in the Information Bulletin) is too speculative and insubstantial to bring the entire transaction within the Securities Acts.  These facilities were established not for profit purposes, but to make essential services available to residents of the huge complex.  Pp.  421 U. S. 855-857.

			"|"United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman
No. 74-157
Argued April 22, 1975
Decided June 16, 1975*
421 U.S. 837

Syllabus 
Respondents are 57 residents of Co-op City, a massive cooperative housing project in New York City, organized, financed, and constructed under the New York Private Housing Finance Law (Mitchell-Lama Act).  They brought this action on behalf of all the apartment owners and derivatively on behalf of the housing corporation, alleging, inter alia, violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (hereafter collectively Securities Acts), in connection with the sale to respondents of shares of the common stock of the cooperative housing corporation.  Citing substantial increases in the tenants' monthly rental charges as a result of higher construction costs, respondents' claim centered on a Co-op City Information Bulletin issued in the project's initial stages, which allegedly misrepresented that the developers would absorb future cost increases due to such factors as inflation.  Under the Mitchell-Lama Act, which was designed to encourage private developers to build low-cost cooperative housing, the State provides large, long-term low-interest mortgage loans and substantial tax exemptions, conditioned on step-by-step state supervision of the cooperative's development.  Developers must agree to operate the facilities ""on a nonprofit basis,"" and may lease apartments to only state-approved lessees whose incomes are below a certain level.  The corporate petitioners in this case built, promoted, and presently control Co-op City:  United Housing Foundation (UHF), a nonprofit membership corporation, initiated and sponsored the project; Riverbay, a nonprofit cooperative housing corporation, was organized by UHF to own and operate the land and buildings and issue the stock that is the subject of the instant action; and Community Securities, Inc. (CSI), UHF's wholly owned subsidiary, was the project's general 
Page 421 U. S. 838
 contractor and sales agent.  To acquire a Co-op City apartment, a prospective purchaser must buy 18 shares of Riverbay stock for each room desired at $25 per share.  The shares cannot be transferred to a nontenant, pledged, encumbered, or bequeathed (except to a surviving spouse), and do not convey voting rights based on the number owned (each apartment having one vote).  On termination of occupancy, a tenant must offer his stock to Riverbay at $25 per share, and, in the unlikely event that Riverbay does not repurchase, the tenant cannot sell his shares for more than their original price, plus a fraction of the mortgage amortization that he has paid during his tenancy, and then only to a prospective tenant satisfying the statutory income eligibility requirements.  Under the Co-op City Lease arrangement, the resident is committed to make monthly rental payments in accordance with the size, nature, and location of the apartment.  The Securities Acts define a ""security"" as ""any . . . stock, . . . investment contract, . . . or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a security.'""  Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of federal jurisdiction, maintaining that the Riverbay stock did not constitute securities as thus defined.  The District Court granted the motion to dismiss.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that (1) since the shares purchased were called ""stock,"" the definitional sections of the Securities Acts were literally applicable, and (2) the transaction was an investment contract under the Securities Acts, there being a profit expectation from rental reductions resulting from (i) the income produced by commercial facilities established for the use of Co-op City tenants; (ii) tax deductions for the portion of monthly rental charges allocable to interest payments on the mortgage; and (iii) savings based on the fact that Co-op City apartments cost substantially less than comparable nonsubsidized housing.
Held:  The shares of stock involved in this Litigation do not constitute ""securities"" within the purview of the Securities Acts, and since respondents' claims are not cognizable in federal court, the District Court properly dismissed their complaint.  Pp.  421 U. S. 847-858.
(a) When viewed, as they must be, in terms of their substance (the economic realities of the transaction), rather than their form, the instruments involved here were not shares of stock in the ordinary sense of conferring the right to receive ""dividends contingent upon an apportionment of profits,"" Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332,  389 U. S. 339, with the traditional characteristics of being 
Page 421 U. S. 839
 negotiable, subject to pledge or hypothecation, conferring voting rights proportional to the number of shares owned, and possibility of appreciating in value.  On the contrary, these instruments were purchased not for making a profit, but for acquiring subsidized low-cost. housing.  Pp.  421 U. S. 848-851.
(b) A share in Riverbay does not constitute an ""investment contract"" as defined by the Securities Acts, a term which, like the term ""any . . . instrument commonly known as a security,'"" involves investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.  Here, neither of the kinds of profits traditionally associated with securities were offered to respondents; instead, as indicated in the Information Bulletin, which stressed the ""non-profit"" nature of the project, the focus was upon the acquisition of a place to live.  Pp.  421 U. S. 851-854.
(c) Although deductible for tax purposes, the portion of rental charges applied to interest on the mortgage (benefits generally available to home mortgagors) does not constitute ""profits,"" and, in any event, does not derive from the efforts of third parties.  Pp.  421 U. S. 854-855.
(d) Low rent attributable to state financial subsidies no more embodies income or profit attributes than other types of government subsidies.  P.  421 U. S. 855.
(e) Such income as might derive from Co-op City's leasing of commercial facilities within the housing project to be used to reduce tenant rentals (the prospect of which was never mentioned in the Information Bulletin) is too speculative and insubstantial to bring the entire transaction within the Securities Acts.  These facilities were established not for profit purposes, but to make essential services available to residents of the huge complex.  Pp.  421 U. S. 855-857.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 16, 1975
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting. 
 Petitioners are landowners in Magoffin County, Kentucky. Seventy years ago, their predecessors in ownership deeded away all rights to the minerals in and under their land, retaining only the surface rights; respondents are the present holders of the mineral rights, and have strip mined much of the coal which underlies the land. Petitioners brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1983, seeking injunctive relief. [Footnote 1] and damages for the destruction of the land surface through respondents' strip-

 This case is unfortunately no more than a mere footnote in a continuing tragedy of environmental and human despoliation. The rape of Appalachia for its precious coal has been a dark and dismal chapter in our Nation's history, moving one observer to lament: 
 One of the hardest-hit areas has been the Cumberland Plateau in eastern Kentucky. In the late 19th century, the hill country was swept by a virtual wave of coal buyers seeking to acquire precious mineral rights from the often naive and illiterate mountaineers. The contest was hardly an equal one,3 and most coal buyers [422 U.S. 1012 , 1014]

 Mr. Justice BREENAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were charged in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee with the transportation of obscene movies in interstate commerce by means of a common carrier in violation of 18 U.S.C . 1462, transportation of obscene movies in interstate commerce for the purpose of distribution in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1465, and with conspiracy to violate the aforesaid statutes in violation of 18 U.S.C. 371. 18 U.S.C 1462 provides in pertinent part:

 Petitioners moved to dismiss the indictment on two grounds. First, they argued that the obscenity decisions announced by this Court in June 1973, including Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15d 419 (1973), could not be applied retroactively to conduct which occurred prior to those decisions. Second, they contended that Miller and its related decisions rejected application of a national standard to the question of obscenity and that the statutes under which they were indicted contain that national standard. The District Court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss the indictment. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and remanded for a trial on the merits. 506 F.2d 1251.

No. 74-215
Argued March 119, 1975
Decided June 9, 1975
421 U.S. 658

Syllabus 
Acme Markets, Inc., a large national food chain, and respondent, its president, were charged with violating  301(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) in an information alleging that they had caused interstate food shipments being held in Acme's Baltimore warehouse to be exposed to rodent contamination.  Acme, but not respondent, pleaded guilty.  At his trial, respondent conceded that providing sanitary conditions for food offered for sale to the public was something that he was ""responsible for in the entire operation of the company,"" and that it was one of the many phases of the company that he assigned to ""dependable subordinates.""  Evidence was admitted over respondent's objection that he had received a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) letter in 1970 concerning insanitary conditions at Acme's Philadelphia warehouse.  Respondent conceded that the same individuals were largely responsible for sanitation in both Baltimore and Philadelphia, and that, as Acme's president, he was responsible for any result that occurred in the company.  The trial court, inter alia, instructed the jury that, although respondent need not have personally participated in the situation, he must have had ""a responsible relationship to the issue.""  Respondent was convicted, but the Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that, although this Court's decision in United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U. S. 277, had construed the statutory provisions under which respondent had been tried to dispense with the traditional element of ""awareness of some wrongdoing,'"" the Court had not construed them as dispensing with the element of ""wrongful action.""  The Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court's instructions
""might well have left the jury with the erroneous impression that [respondent] could be found guilty in the absence of 'wrongful action' on his part,""
and that proof of that element was required by due process.  The court also held that the admission in evidence of the 1970 FDA warning to respondent was reversible error.
Held:
1. The Act imposes upon persons exercising authority and 
Page 421 U. S. 659
 supervisory responsibility reposed in them by a business organization not only a positive duty to seek out and remedy violations, but also, and primarily, a duty to implement measures that will insure that violations will not occur, United States v. Dotterweich, supra; in order to make food distributors ""the strictest censors of their merchandise,"" Smith v. California, 361 U. S. 147,  361 U. S. 152, the Act punishes ""neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a duty.""  Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246,  342 U. S. 255.  Pp.  421 U. S. 670-673.
2. Viewed as a whole and in context, the trial court's instructions were not misleading, and provided a proper guide for the jury's determination.  The charge adequately focused on the issue of respondent's authority respecting the conditions that formed the basis of the alleged violations, fairly advising the jury that, to find guilt, it must find that respondent ""had a responsible relation to the situation""; that the ""situation"" was the condition of the warehouse; and that, by virtue of his position he had ""authority and responsibility"" to deal therewith.  Pp.  421 U. S. 673-676.
3. The admission of testimony concerning the 1970 FDA warning was proper rebuttal evidence to respondent's defense that he had justifiably relied upon subordinates to handle sanitation matters.  Pp.  421 U. S. 676-678.
499 F.2d 839, reversed.

S. 277, had construed the statutory provisions under which respondent had been tried to dispense with the traditional element of ""awareness of some wrongdoing,'"" the Court had not construed them as dispensing with the element of ""wrongful action.""  The Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court's instructions
""might well have left the jury with the erroneous impression that [respondent] could be found guilty in the absence of 'wrongful action' on his part,""
and that proof of that element was required by due process.  The court also held that the admission in evidence of the 1970 FDA warning to respondent was reversible error.
Held:
1. The Act imposes upon persons exercising authority and 
Page 421 U. S. 659
 supervisory responsibility reposed in them by a business organization not only a positive duty to seek out and remedy violations, but also, and primarily, a duty to implement measures that will insure that violations will not occur, United States v. Dotterweich, supra; in order to make food distributors ""the strictest censors of their merchandise,"" Smith v. California, 361 U. S. 147,  361 U. S. 152, the Act punishes ""neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a duty.""  Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246,  342 U. S. 255.  Pp.  421 U. S. 670-673.
2. Viewed as a whole and in context, the trial court's instructions were not misleading, and provided a proper guide for the jury's determination.  The charge adequately focused on the issue of respondent's authority respecting the conditions that formed the basis of the alleged violations, fairly advising the jury that, to find guilt, it must find that respondent ""had a responsible relation to the situation""; that the ""situation"" was the condition of the warehouse; and that, by virtue of his position he had ""authority and responsibility"" to deal therewith.  Pp.  421 U. S. 673-676.
3. The admission of testimony concerning the 1970 FDA warning was proper rebuttal evidence to respondent's defense that he had justifiably relied upon subordinates to handle sanitation matters.  Pp.  421 U. S. 676-678.

Syllabus 
The State of Maine requires a defendant charged with murder, which upon conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, to prove that he acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation in order to reduce the homicide to manslaughter, in which case the punishment is a fine or imprisonment not exceeding 20 years.

Decided June 9, 1975*
421 U.S. 707

Syllabus 
Under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program of the Social Security Act (Act), the term ""dependent child"" was expanded to include children whose deprivation was caused by a parent's unemployment.  Section 407(b)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, as amended in 1968, makes this expanded definition applicable only if a state plan under the AFDC program denies aid to a dependent child so defined ""with respect to any week for which such child's father receives unemployment compensation.""  Vermont, to qualify for federal funding under this unemployed father program, promulgated a regulation under its participating Aid to Needy Families with Children (ANFC) program, defining an ""unemployed father"" as one who is, inter alia, out of work, provided ""[h]e is not receiving Unemployment Compensation during the same week as assistance is granted.""  Appellees, who are parents and children of Vermont families whose ANFC assistance was terminated or denied because the fathers were receiving unemployment compensation, filed suit against appellant Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Social Welfare and appellant Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to enjoin enforcement of the federal statute and state regulation.  Holding that it had jurisdiction over the parties under 28 U.S.C.  1343(3), and construing  407(b)(2)(C)(ii) as making actual payment of, rather than mere eligibility for, unemployment compensation the disqualifying factor for AFDC benefits, a three-judge District Court held that the Vermont regulation could not be applied so as to conflict with this construction of the federal statute, and entered an injunction to this effect.
Held:
1. The Vermont regulation, as applied to exclude unemployed fathers who are merely eligible for unemployment compensation 
Page 421 U. S. 708
 from receiving ANFC benefits, impermissibly conflicts with  407(b)(2)(C)(ii), as correctly interpreted by the District Court.  As evidenced by that provision's legislative history, Congress did not intend the provision's coverage to be at the State's discretion once it elected to participate.  Pp.  421 U. S. 713-719.
2. This Court will not inquire into the question whether the District Court had jurisdiction over appellant Secretary, but will make an exception to the general rule that this Court has a duty to so inquire where the question has been inadequately briefed, the substantive issue has been decided in the State's case, and the Secretary has stated he will comply with the District Court decision on the statutory issue if it is affirmed.  The exercise of the District Court's jurisdiction over the Secretary has resulted in no adjudication on the merits that could not have been just as properly made without the Secretary, and in no issuance of process against the Secretary that he has properly contended to be wrongful before this Court.

No. 74-124
Argued March 24, 1975
Decided June 9, 1975
421 U.S. 723

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
Under an antitrust consent decree, petitioner New Blue Chip was required to offer a substantial number of common stock shares in its new trading stamp business to retailers like respondent which had previously used the stamp service but which were not shareholders in petitioner's corporate predecessor.  Charging that New Blue Chip and other petitioners devised a scheme to dissuade the offerees by means of materially misleading statements containing an overly pessimistic appraisal of the new business from purchasing the securities so that the rejected shares might later be offered to the public at a higher price, respondent brought this class action for damages for violation of the provisions of  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Act) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which make it unlawful to use deceptive devices or make misleading statements ""in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.""  Acting on the basis of the rule enunciated in 1952 in Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 F.2d 461, which states that a person who is neither a purchaser nor a seller of securities may not bring an action under  10(b) of the Act or the SEC's Rule 10b-5, the District Court dismissed respondent's complaint.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the facts warranted an exception to the Birnbaum rule.  The court noted that prior cases had held that the rule did not exclude persons owning contractual rights to buy or sell securities, and that the offering of securities in this case in compliance with the antitrust decree served the same function as a securities purchase or sales contract.
Held:  A private damages action under Rule 10b-5 is confined to actual purchasers or sellers of securities, and the Birnbaum rule bars respondent from maintaining this suit.  Pp.  421 U. S. 731-755.
(a) The longstanding judicial acceptance of the rule, together with Congress' failure to reject its interpretation of  10(b)

Syllabus 
After being defeated for office by the incumbent in a union election, and after exhausting his union remedies, respondent candidate (hereafter respondent) filed a complaint with petitioner, the Secretary of Labor, alleging violations of  401 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA) and thus invoking  402(b) of the Act, which requires the Secretary to investigate the complaint and decide whether to bring a civil action to set aside the election.  The Secretary, upon investigation, decided that such an action was not warranted, and so advised respondent, who then filed an action to have the Secretary's decision declared arbitrary and capricious and to order him to file suit to set aside the election.  The District Court dismissed the action on the ground that it lacked ""authority"" to afford the relief sought.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that the District Court had jurisdiction of the action under 28 U.S.C.  1337 as a case arising under an Act of Congress regulating commerce (the LMRDA); that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C.  702, 704, subjected the Secretary's decision to judicial review as ""final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court""; that his decision was not agency action pursuant to ""statutes [that] preclude judicial review; or . . . agency action [that] is committed to agency discretion by law,"" excepted by 5 U.S.C.  701(a) from judicial review; and that the scope of judicial review -- governed by 5 U.S.C.  706(2)(A) ""to ensure that the Secretary's actions are not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion"" -- entitled respondent
""to a sufficiently specific statement of the factors upon which the Secretary relied in reaching his decision . . . so that [respondent] may have information concerning the allegations contained in his complaint.""

Syllabus 
A Mississippi Tax Commission regulation requires out-of-state liquor distillers and suppliers to collect from military installations within Mississippi, and remit to the Commission, a tax in the form of a wholesale markup on liquor sold to the installations.  The United States has four military installations in Mississippi, exercising exclusive jurisdiction over two and concurrent jurisdiction over the other two.  The United States paid under protest the markup on liquor purchased from out-of-state distillers by the various nonappropriated fund activities at these installations, and brought action to have the regulation declared unconstitutional and for other relief.  After this Court's reversal of a three-judge District Court's opinion denying relief, United States v. Mississippi Tax Comm'n, 412 U. S. 363, that court on remand again denied relief.
Held:  Viewing the markup as a sales tax, the legal incidence of the tax rests upon instrumentalities of the United States as the purchasers, First Agricultural Nat. Bank v. Tax Comm'n, 392 U. S. 339, and hence the markup is unconstitutional as a tax imposed upon the United States and its instrumentalities, McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316.  Pp.  421 U. S. 604-614.
(a) Since the legal incidence of the tax is upon the United States, in view of the requirement of the regulation that the tax be passed on to the purchaser, the federal immunity with respect to sales of liquor to the two exclusively federal enclaves is preserved by  107(a) of the Buck Act.  Under that provision  105(a) of the Act, which precludes any person from being relieved of any state sales or use tax on the ground that the sale or use occurred in whole or in part within a federal area, ""shall not be deemed to authorize the levy or collection of any tax on or from the United States or any instrumentality thereof.""  Pp.  421 U. S. 611-613.
(b) The Twenty-first Amendment did not abolish federal immunity with respect to taxes on the sales of liquor to the concurrent

Syllabus 
Respondent union, representing the plumbing and mechanical trades in Dallas, was a party to a multiemployer collective bargaining agreement with a mechanical contractors association.  The agreement contained a ""most favored nation"" clause, by which the union agreed that, if it granted a more favorable contract to any other employer, it would extend the same terms to all association members.  Respondent picketed petitioner, a general building contractor which subcontracted all plumbing and mechanical work and had no employees respondent wished to represent, to secure a contract whereby petitioner agreed to subcontract such work only to firms that had a current contract with respondent.  Petitioner signed under protest and, claiming that the agreement violated  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and state antitrust laws, brought suit against respondent seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  By the time this case went to trial, respondent had secured identical agreements from other general contractors and was selectively picketing those who resisted.  The District Court held (1) that the subcontracting agreement was exempt from federal antitrust laws because it was authorized by the first proviso in  8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which exempts jobsite contracting agreements in the construction industry from the statutory ban on secondary agreements requiring employers to cease doing business with other persons, and (2) that federal labor legislation preempted the State's antitrust laws.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Respondent union's agreement with petitioner is not entitled to the nonstatutory exemption from the federal antitrust laws 
Page 421 U. S. 617
 recognized in Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676, because it imposed direct restraints on competition among subcontractors that would not have resulted from the elimination of competition based on differences in wages and working conditions.  Pp.  421 U. S. 621-626.
(a) The agreement indiscriminately excluded nonunion subcontractors from a portion of the market, even if their competitive advantages were derived from efficient operating methods, rather than substandard wages and working conditions.  P.  421 U. S. 623.
(b) The ""most-favored nation"" clause in the multiemployer bargaining agreement, by insuring that no union subcontractor would have a competitive advantage on any matters covered by the agreement, gave respondent's agreements with petitioner and other general contractors the effect of creating a sheltered market for union subcontractors in that portion of the subcontracting market controlled by signatory general contractors.  Pp.  421 U. S. 623-624.
(c) Since the agreement did not simply prohibit subcontracting to any nonunion firm, but to any firm that did not have a contract with respondent, it gave the union complete control over subcontract work offered by general contractors that had signed the agreement and empowered the union to exclude certain subcontractors from that portion of the market by refusing to deal with them.  Pp.  421 U. S. 624-625.
2. The first proviso to  8(e) of the NLRA does not shelter the challenged agreement from the federal antitrust laws, since that proviso was not intended to authorize subcontracting agreements that are neither within the context of a collective bargaining relationship nor limited to any particular jobsite.  Here respondent, which has never sought to represent petitioner's employees or bargain with petitioner on their behalf, makes no claim to be protecting those employees from working with nonunion men; the agreement was not limited to any particular jobsite; and respondent concededly sought the agreement solely as a means of pressuring Dallas mechanical subcontractors to recognize it as their employees' representative.  Pp.  421 U. S. 626-633.
3. There is no indication that Congress in the Taft-Hartley amendments or later meant to make NLRA remedies for ""hot cargo"" agreements exclusive, thus precluding liability for such agreements under the antitrust acts.  Pp.  421 U. S. 633-634.
4. The agreement is not subject to the state antitrust laws, the use of which to regulate union activities in aid of union organization

Syllabus 
The Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security, pursuant to its authority under a Senate resolution to make a complete study of the administration, operation, and enforcement of the Internal Security Act of 1950, began an inquiry into the various activities of respondent organization, to determine whether they were potentially harmful to the morale of United States Armed Forces.  In connection with such inquiry, it issued a subpoena duces tecum to the bank where the organization had an account, ordering the bank to produce all records involving the account.  The organization and two of its members then brought an action against the Chairman, Senator Members, Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee, and the bank to enjoin implementation of the subpoena on First Amendment grounds.  The District Court dismissed the action.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although courts should hesitate to interfere with congressional actions even where First Amendment rights are implicated, such restraint should not preclude judicial review where no alternative avenue of relief is available, and that, if the subpoena was obeyed, respondents' First Amendment rights would be violated.
Held:  The activities of the Senate Subcommittee, the individual Senators, and the Chief Counsel fall within the ""legitimate legislative sphere,"" and since it is determined that such is the case, those activities are protected by the absolute prohibition of the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution against being ""questioned in any other Place,"" and hence are immune from judicial interference.

421 U.S. 519

Syllabus 
The prosecution of respondent as an adult in California Superior Court, after an adjudicatory finding in Juvenile Court that he had violated a criminal statute and a subsequent finding that he was unfit for treatment as a juvenile, violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  421 U. S. 528-541.
(a) Respondent was put in jeopardy at the Juvenile Court adjudicatory hearing, whose object was to determine whether he had committed acts that violated a criminal law and whose potential consequences included both the stigma inherent in that determination and the deprivation of liberty for many years.  Jeopardy attached when the Juvenile Court, as the trier of the facts, began to hear evidence.  Pp.  421 U. S. 528-531.
(b) Contrary to petitioner's contention, respondent's trial in Superior Court for the same offense as that for which he had been tried in Juvenile Court, violated the policies of the Double Jeopardy Clause, even if respondent ""never faced the risk of more than one punishment,"" since the Clause ""is written in terms of potential or risk of trial and conviction, not punishment.""  Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323,  398 U. S. 329.  Respondent was subjected to the burden of two trials for the same offense; he was twice put to the task of marshaling his resources against those of the State, twice subjected to the ""heavy personal strain"" that such an experience represents.  Pp.  421 U. S. 532-533.
(c) If there is to be an exception to the constitutional protection against a second trial in the context of the juvenile court system, it must be justified by interests of society, reflected in that unique institution, or of juveniles themselves, of sufficient substance to render tolerable the costs and burdens that the exception will entail in individual cases.  Pp.  421 U. S. 533-534.
(d) Giving respondent the constitutional protection against multiple trials in this context will not, as petitioner claims, diminish the flexibility and informality of juvenile court proceedings 
Page 421 U. S. 520
 to the extent that those qualities relate uniquely to the goals of the juvenile court system.  A requirement that transfer hearings be held prior to adjudicatory hearings does not alter the nature of the latter proceedings.  More significantly, such a requirement need not affect the quality of decisionmaking at transfer hearings themselves.  The burdens petitioner envisions would not pose a significant problem for the administration of the juvenile court system, and, quite apart from that consideration, transfer hearings prior to adjudication will aid the objectives of that system.  Pp.  421 U. S. 535-541.

Decided May 27, 1975
421 U.S. 542

Syllabus 
The Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 authorized the President to stabilize wages and salaries at certain levels, and the Pay Board was created to oversee the controls.  The Government filed this action to enjoin Ohio and its officials from paying state statutory wage and salary increases to state employees above the amount authorized by the Pay Board.  The Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals, on certification from the District Court, construed the Act as applying to state employees, upheld its constitutionality, and enjoined payment of the increases.
Held:
1. The Act's language contemplating general stabilization of ""prices, rents, wages, salaries, dividends, and interest"" and providing that the controls should ""call for generally comparable sacrifices by business and labor as well as other segments of the economy,"" and its legislative history showing that Congress had rejected an amendment exempting state employees, make it clear that the Act was intended to apply to employees generally, including state employees.  That the Act did not expressly refer to the States warrants no inference that controls could not extend to their employees.  Pp.  421 U. S. 545-546.
2. The Act was constitutional as applied to state employees.  Pp.  421 U. S. 547-548.
(a) General raises to state employees, even though purely intrastate in character, could significantly affect interstate commerce, and thus could be validly regulated by Congress under the Commerce Clause.  P.  421 U. S. 547.
(b) States are not immune from all federal regulation under the Commerce Clause merely because of their sovereign status.  Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183.  Here, where the Act did not appreciably intrude on state sovereignty, but was an emergency measure to counter severe inflation, the effectiveness of federal action would have been drastically impaired if wage increases to state and local governmental employees (who, at the time the wage freeze was activated, composed 14% of the Nation's workforce) were left outside the Act's reach.  Pp.  421 U. S. 547-548.

(c) Since the Ohio wage legislation conflicted with the Pay Board's ruling, the State must yield under the Supremacy Clause to the federal mandate.  P.  421 U. S. 548.

421 U.S. 309

Syllabus 
Respondents, who had been charged, along with one Anderson, in separate indictments for separate bank robberies and who pleaded guilty, were summoned as prosecution witnesses at Anderson's trial, but refused to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds and still refused to do so after being granted immunity and ordered to testify.  The District Court then summarily held them in contempt under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 42(a), which permits summary criminal contempt punishment ""if the judge certifies that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was committed in the actual presence of the court.""  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the use of the summary contempt power under Rule 42(a) was improper, and remanded for proceedings under Rule 42(b), which calls for disposition of criminal contempt only after notice and hearing and ""a reasonable time for the preparation of the defense.""
Held:  The District Court properly imposed summary contempt punishment under the circumstances.  Harris v. United States, 382 U. S. 162, distinguished.  Pp.  421 U. S. 314-319.
(a) Respondents' refusals to answer, although not delivered disrespectfully, fall within Rule 42(a)'s express language, and plainly constitute conduct contemptuous of judicial authority, since they were intentional obstructions of court proceedings that literally disrupted the progress of the trial, and hence the orderly administration of justice.  Pp.  421 U. S. 314-316.
(b) The face-to-face refusal to comply with the court's order itself constituted an affront to the court, and when that kind of refusal disrupts and frustrates an ongoing trial, as it did here, summary contempt must be available to vindicate the court's authority, as well as to provide the recalcitrant witness with some incentive to testify.  P.  421 U. S. 316.
(c) Harris v. United States, supra, involved a refusal to answer before a grand jury, where, unlike an ongoing trial, time generally is not of the essence, because the grand jury may turn to other matters during any delay.  Pp.  421 U. S. 318-319.

Syllabus 
After the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had made federal tax assessments against a company and the company failed to pay the taxes after formal demand, the company transferred its assets to an assignee for the benefit of creditors, who converted the assets into cash.  The IRS then filed a notice of tax lien respecting the assessments and served a levy notice on the assignee, who did not, however, comply with the IRS's payment demand.  The company was thereafter adjudicated bankrupt, and petitioner receiver in bankruptcy made application to the bankruptcy Referee for an order requiring the assignee to turn over the cash proceeds.  The IRS opposed the application on the ground that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the application because the United States was entitled to possession of the cash proceeds held by the bankrupt's assignee.  The Referee rejected the IRS's contention, holding that the assignment passed inalienable title to the assets of the company to the assignee, and the District Court upheld the Referee.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The United States, by serving the bankrupt taxpayer's assignee with a valid notice of levy, took constructive custody of the cash proceeds in the assignee's possession, and neither the bankrupt nor petitioner as receiver could assert a claim to those proceeds.  The receiver's recourse is limited to a plenary suit under  23 of the Bankruptcy Act.  Pp.  421 U. S. 333-337.

421 U.S. 338

Syllabus 
Petitioners in No. 74-5054 brought class actions in two District Courts challenging New York's ""lodger"" regulations, which require a pro-rata reduction in shelter allowance of a family receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) solely because a parent allows a nonlegally responsible person to reside in the home.  Petitioners claimed that the state regulations conflicted with a provision of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  606(a), which, in relevant part, defines a dependent child as one
""who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent,""
and an implementing regulation, 45 CFR  233.90(a), which provides that, in determining a child's financial eligibility and the amount of the assistance payment ""the income only of the [legally obligated] parent . . . will be considered available . . . in the absence of proof of actual contributions.""  Petitioners also contended that the state regulations were violative of due process and equal protection.  Each District Court held that the New York regulations were in conflict with the federal statutory and regulatory provisions.  The Court of Appeals held that there was no such conflict, and reversed the judgments and remanded the cases for convention of a three-judge court to decide the constitutional challenges.  That court sustained petitioners' due process claim.  This Court noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal from the three-judge court holding (No. 74-453), and granted certiorari in the case of the judgment of the Court of Appeals (No. 74-5054).
Held:  The New York ""lodger"" regulations, which are based on the assumption that the nonpaying lodger is contributing to the welfare of the household, without inquiry into whether he, in fact, does 
Page 421 U. S. 339
 so, violate the Social Security Act and implementing regulations.  Pp.  421 U. S. 344-348.
(a) A State is barred from assuming that nonlegally responsible persons will apply their resources to aid the welfare child, King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309; Lewis v. Martin, 397 U. S. 552, yet under the New York regulations, the nonpaying lodger's mere presence results in a decrease in benefits though he may contribute nothing to the needy child.  Pp.  421 U. S. 346-347.
(b) The New York regulations cannot be justified on the ground that the lodger's presence establishes the existence of excess space, because, if that were so, the allowance would remain reduced after the lodger leaves, which is not the case.  P.  421 U. S. 347.
(c) The regulations do not prohibit lodgers from living in welfare homes, and therefore cannot be justified on the ground that they are designed to prevent lodgers (who are ineligible for welfare) from receiving welfare benefits.  Pp.  421 U. S. 347-348.

Petitioners in No. 74-5054 brought class actions in two District Courts challenging New York's ""lodger"" regulations, which require a pro-rata reduction in shelter allowance of a family receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) solely because a parent allows a nonlegally responsible person to reside in the home.  Petitioners claimed that the state regulations conflicted with a provision of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  606(a), which, in relevant part, defines a dependent child as one
""who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent,""
and an implementing regulation, 45 CFR  233.90(a), which provides that, in determining a child's financial eligibility and the amount of the assistance payment ""the income only of the [legally obligated] parent . . . will be considered available . . . in the absence of proof of actual contributions.""  Petitioners also contended that the state regulations were violative of due process and equal protection.  Each District Court held that the New York regulations were in conflict with the federal statutory and regulatory provisions.  The Court of Appeals held that there was no such conflict, and reversed the judgments and remanded the cases for convention of a three-judge court to decide the constitutional challenges.  That court sustained petitioners' due process claim.  This Court noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal from the three-judge court holding (No. 74-453), and granted certiorari in the case of the judgment of the Court of Appeals (No. 74-5054).
Held:  The New York ""lodger"" regulations, which are based on the assumption that the nonpaying lodger is contributing to the welfare of the household, without inquiry into whether he, in fact, does 
Page 421 U. S. 339
 so, violate the Social Security Act and implementing regulations.  Pp.  421 U. S. 344-348.
(a) A State is barred from assuming that nonlegally responsible persons will apply their resources to aid the welfare child, King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309; Lewis v. Martin, 397 U. S. 552, yet under the New York regulations, the nonpaying lodger's mere presence results in a decrease in benefits though he may contribute nothing to the needy child.  Pp.  421 U. S. 346-347.
(b) The New York regulations cannot be justified on the ground that the lodger's presence establishes the existence of excess space, because, if that were so, the allowance would remain reduced after the lodger leaves, which is not the case.  P.  421 U. S. 347.
(c) The regulations do not prohibit lodgers from living in welfare homes, and therefore cannot be justified on the ground that they are designed to prevent lodgers (who are ineligible for welfare) from receiving welfare benefits.  Pp.  421 U. S. 347-348.

Syllabus 
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is authorized to provide directly to all children enrolled in nonpublic elementary and secondary schools meeting Pennsylvania's compulsory attendance requirements ""auxiliary services"" (Act 194) and loans of textbook ""acceptable for use in"" the public schools (Act 195).  Act 195 also provides for loans directly to the nonpublic schools of ""instructional materials and equipment, useful to the education"" of nonpublic school children.  The auxiliary services include counseling, testing, psychological services, speech and hearing therapy, and related services for exceptional, remedial, or educationally disadvantaged students, ""and such other secular, neutral, non-ideological service as are of benefit to nonpublic school children"" and are provided for those in public schools.  The instructional materials include periodicals, photographs, maps, charts, recordings, and films.  The instructional equipment includes projectors, recorders, and laboratory paraphernalia.  Appellants brought this suit in the District Court challenging the constitutionality of both Acts.  The court upheld the constitutionality of the textbook and instructional materials loan programs and the auxiliary services program, but invalidated the instructional equipment loan program to the extent that it sanctioned the loan of equipment ""which, from its nature, can be diverted to religious purposes.""
Held:  Act 194 and all but the textbook loan provisions of Act 195 violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.  Pp.  421 U. S. 359-372;  421 U. S. 388.
374 F.Supp. 39, affirmed in part, reversed in part.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, IV, and V, finding:
1. The direct loan of instructional materials and equipment to nonpublic schools authorized by Act 195 has the unconstitutional primary effect of establishing religion because of the predominantly 
Page 421 U. S. 350
 religious character of the schools benefiting from the Act, since 75% of Pennsylvania's nonpublic schools that comply with the compulsory attendance law, and thus qualify for aid under Act 195 are church-related or religiously affiliated.  The massive aid that nonpublic schools thus receive is neither indirect nor incidental, and, even though such aid is ostensibly limited to secular instructional material and equipment, the inescapable result is the direct and substantial advancement of religious activity.  Pp.  421 U. S. 362-366.
2.Act 194 also violates the Establishment Clause because the auxiliary services are provided at predominantly church-related schools.  The District Court erred in holding that such services are permissible because they are only secular, neutral, and nonideological, since excessive entanglement would be required for Pennsylvania to be assured that the public school professional staff members who provide the services do not advance the religious mission of the church-related schools in which they serve.  Cf. Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602,  403 U. S. 618.  Pp.  421 U. S. 367-372.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, joined by MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded in Part III that Act 195's textbook loan provisions, which are limited to textbooks acceptable for use in the public schools, are constitutional, since they ""merely [make] available to all children the benefits of a general program to lend schools books free of charge,"" and the ""financial benefit is to parents and children, not to schools,"" Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236,  392 U. S. 243-244.  Pp.  421 U. S. 359-362.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concluded that the textbook loan program of Act 195 is constitutionally indistinguishable from the program upheld in Board of Education v. Allen, supra.  P.  421 U. S. 388.

421 U.S. 412

Syllabus 
Petitioner Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC) was established by Congress under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (SIPA) as a nonprofit membership corporation, to provide, inter alia, financial relief to the customers of failing broker-dealers with whom the customers had left cash or securities on deposit.  The SIPA creates procedures for the orderly liquidation of financially troubled member firms under which the SIPC is required, by assessing members, to maintain a fund for customer protection.   The SIPC may file an application with a court for a decree initiating liquidation proceedings if it determines that a member has failed or is in danger of failing to meet its obligations to customers, and that any one of five specified conditions indicating financial difficulty exist, and the filing of the application vests the court with exclusive jurisdiction over the member and its property.  If the court finds the existence of a specified condition, it must grant the application, issue the decree, and appoint the SIPC's designee as trustee to liquidate the business, and the SIPC is obligated, if necessary, to advance funds to meet certain customer claims.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is given ""plenary authority"" to supervise the SIPC, and is specifically authorized to apply to a district court for an order requiring the SIPC to discharge its statutory obligations.  This action was brought by respondent receiver appointed to wind up the affairs of Guaranty Bond, an insolvent registered broker-dealer, to compel the SIPC to exercise its statutory authority for the benefit of Guaranty Bond's customers.  The District Court denied relief.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Customers of failing broker-dealers have no implied right of action under the SIPA to compel the SIPC to act for their benefit, the SEC's statutory authority to compel the SIPC to discharge its obligations being the exclusive means by which the SIPC can be forced to act.  Pp. 418-425.
(a) The express statutory provision for one form of proceeding ordinarily implies that no other enforcement means was intended 
Page 421 U. S. 413
 by the legislature, and here the SIPA's legislative history was entirely consonant with the implication of the statutory language that no private right of action was intended.  Cf. Passenger Corp. v. Passengers Assn., 414 U. S. 453.  Pp.  421 U. S. 418-420.
(b) The overall structure and purpose of the SIPC scheme are incompatible with an implied private right of action, which might well precipitate liquidations that the SIPC, which treat that approach as a last resort, might be able to avoid.  Pp.  421 U. S. 420-423.

Syllabus 
After being convicted and fined by the Municipal Court, on pleas of nolo contendere, for violating the Dallas loitering ordinance, petitioners, rather than seeking a trial de novo in County Court, and thus subjecting themselves to the possibility of a larger fine, brought action in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance and seeking declaratory and other relief.  The District Court dismissed the action, holding that federal declaratory and injunctive relief against future state criminal prosecutions was not available absent allegations of bad faith prosecution, harassment, or other unusual circumstances presenting a likelihood of irreparable injury to petitioners if the ordinance were enforced, a result felt to be mandated by the decision in Becker v. Thompson, 459 F.2d 919 (CA5), wherein it was held that the principles of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.

The Alabama statutory system providing for countywide balloting for each of the four members of the Dallas County Commission, but requiring that a member be elected from each of the four residency districts, is not unconstitutional though the populations of the four districts vary widely, with the result that only one Selma resident can be a commission member, although the city contains about one-half of the county's population.  Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U. S. 433; Dusch v. Davis, 387 U. S. 112.

Decided May 19, 1975
421 U.S. 482

Syllabus 
On respondent's direct appeal from a rape conviction, the California appellate courts rejected his contention that the prosecution's failure to turn over to him an exculpatory laboratory report stating that scientific tests failed to reveal the presence of sperm on vaginal smear slides taken from the victim or on her clothing, violated his right to a fair trial.  Subsequently, the Federal District Court upheld such contention in a habeas corpus petition and issued a conditional writ compelling respondent's release unless the State provided him with the report and retried him, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  But in advance of the scheduled retrial, it was discovered that the slides and the victim's clothing had been routinely destroyed after respondent's conviction had become final, and respondent moved to dismiss the charges on the ground that the destruction of this evidence deprived him of the opportunity for a fair trial.  After the trial court had denied this motion, the California Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court denied respondent's applications for writs of prohibition.  In the meantime, the District Court granted respondent's motion to replace the conditional writ of habeas corpus with an absolute writ because of the destruction of evidence, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Respondent failed to exhaust available state remedies on the claim that formed the basis for the unconditional writ, and hence he is entitled to no relief based upon a claim with respect to which state remedies have not been exhausted.
(a) Since the state appellate courts' denials of respondent's applications for writs of prohibition cannot be fairly taken to adjudicate the merits of his claim, and full post-trial appellate review is available if respondent is convicted again on retrial, the denial of the applications did not exhaust respondent's available state remedies.
(b) Neither Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 60(b), which permits a district court to grant relief from a final order, nor 28 U.S.C.  2254, which requires exhaustion of available state remedies as 
Page 421 U. S. 483
 a precondition to consideration of a federal habeas corpus petition, nor the two read together, permit a federal habeas court to maintain a continuing supervision over a retrial conducted pursuant to a conditional writ granted by the habeas court.

Syllabus 
Mississippi imposes a 5% sales tax upon the ""gross proceeds"" of retail sales of tangible personal property, including gasoline, and such gross proceeds are computed without deduction for any taxes. Mississippi also imposes a gasoline excise tax on each gallon sold by a distributor, which, in the case of a distributor bringing gasoline into the State otherwise than by common carrier, accrues at the time when and at the point where the gasoline is brought into the State.  And a federal gasoline excise tax is imposed on each gallon sold by a ""producer,"" 26 U.S.C.  4081(a), defined to include any person to whom gasoline is sold tax-free,  4082(a).  Contending that the denial of a deduction for the Mississippi and federal excise taxes in computing the gross proceeds of retail gasoline sales for purpose of the sales tax was unconstitutional as a taking of property without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that he acts as a mere collector of the excise taxes whose legal incidence is upon the purchaser-consumer, petitioner, an operator of several service stations in Mississippi who purchased his gasoline tax-free in other States and transported it to Mississippi in his own trucks, paid the sales taxes under protest and sued for a refund in state court.  His suit was dismissed, and the Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the legal incidence of both excise taxes is on petitioner, and not on the purchaser-consumer.
Held:  The denial of the deduction of the Mississippi and federal gasoline excise taxes in computing the gross proceeds of retail sales for purposes of the sales tax is not unconstitutional.  Pp.  421 U. S. 203-212
(a) As reflected by the language of 26 U.S.C.  4081(a) and 4082(a), and their legislative history, the legal incidence of the federal excise tax is on the statutory ""producer,"" such as petitioner, and not on his purchaser-consumer.  Pp.  421 U. S. 204-208.
(b) The Mississippi Supreme Court's holding that the legal incidence of the state excise tax falls on petitioner, being consistent

 with a reasonable interpretation of the statute, is conclusive.  Pp.  421 U. S. 208-210.
(c) Petitioner's claim that liability for the excise taxes and sales tax arises simultaneously and results in a sales tax upon the excise tax is without merit, since the excise taxes attach prior to the point of the retail sale.  Pp.  421 U. S. 210-211.
(d) Petitioner is not denied equal protection as against dealers in other States who are not required to include the federal excise tax as part of the sales tax base, since the prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause is against its denial by the State as between taxpayers subject to its laws.

Syllabus 
Petitioners, six Negroes, who had been picketing and urging boycott of certain business establishments in Vicksburg, Miss., because of their alleged racial discrimination in employment, were arrested with others and charged with unlawfully conspiring to bring about a boycott.  Those arrested then sought removal of the prosecutions from state to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1443(1), which provides for removal of state proceedings
""[a]gainst any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens,""
alleging that the conspiracy statutes underlying the charges were unconstitutional, that the charges were groundless, and made solely to deprive those arrested of their federally protected rights, and, more particularly, that their activities were protected by 18 U.S.C.  245 (Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1968).  Section 245(b)(5), inter alia, makes it a crime by ""force or threat of force"" to injure, intimidate, or interfere with any person because he has been ""participating lawfully in speech or peaceful assembly"" opposing racial discrimination in employment, but  245(a)(1) provides that  245 shall not be construed as indicating Congress' intent to prevent any State from exercising jurisdiction over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the absence of  245.  The District Court denied removal, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that  245 ""confers no rights whatsoever,"" and that a federal statute must ""provide"" for the equal rights of citizens before it can be invoked as a basis for removal of prosecutions under  1443(1).
Held:  Removal under  1443(1) was not warranted based solely on petitioners' allegations that the statutes underlying the charges were unconstitutional, that there was no basis in fact for those charges, or that their arrest and prosecution otherwise denied them their constitutional rights.  Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U. S. 780; City of Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U. S. 808.  Nor does  245 furnish adequate basis for removal under  1443(1).  Pp.  421 U. S. 222-227.
(a) The Mississippi courts undoubtedly have jurisdiction over conspiracy and boycott cases brought under state law, and  245(a)(1) 
Page 421 U. S. 214
 appears to disavow any intent to interrupt such state prosecutions, a conclusion that is also implicit in  245's operative provisions, since  245(b), on its face, focuses on the use of force, and its legislative history confirms that its central purpose was to prevent and punish violent interferences with the exercise of specified rights, and that it was not aimed at interrupting or frustrating the otherwise orderly processes of state law.  Pp.  421 U. S. 223-227.
(b) Thus, viewed in the context of  245's being directed at crimes of racial violence, a state prosecution, proceeding as it does in a court of law, cannot be characterized as an application of ""force or threat of force"" within the meaning of  245, and, whatever ""rights"" that section may confer, none of them is denied by a state criminal prosecution for conspiracy or boycott, there being no ""federal statutory right that no State should even attempt to prosecute [petitioners] for their conduct,"" Peacock, supra, at  384 U. S. 826.  P.  421 U. S. 227.
(c) The absence of any evidence or legislative history indicating that Congress intended to accomplish in 18 U.S.C.  245 what it has failed or refused to do directly through amendment to 28 U.S.C.  1443 also necessitates rejection of the right of removal in this case, in addition to which there are other avenues of relief open to petitioners for vindication of their federal rights that may have been or will be violated.

Decided May 12, 1975
421 U.S. 289

Syllabus 
After a bond authorization election to finance construction of a city library was defeated in Fort Worth, Tex., appellee Fort Worth residents brought an action in the Federal District Court challenging the provisions of the State Constitution, Election Code, and city charter limiting the right to vote in city bond issue elections to persons who have ""rendered"" or listed real, mixed, or personal property for taxation in the election district in the year of the election.  A three-judge District Court held that this restriction on suffrage did not serve any compelling state interest, and therefore violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:
1. The Texas rendering requirement erects a classification that impermissibly disfranchises persons otherwise qualified to vote, solely because they have not rendered some property for taxation.  Pp.  421 U. S. 294-301.
(a) As long as the election is not one of special interest, any classification restricting the franchise on grounds other than residence, age, and citizenship cannot stand unless the district or State can demonstrate that the classification serves a compelling state interest.  Kramer v. Union School District, 395 U. S. 621,  395 U. S. 626-627; Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701,  395 U. S. 704.  Pp.  421 U. S. 295-297.
(b) Fort Worth's election was not a ""special interest"" election, since a general obligation bond issue, even where the debt services will be paid entirely out of property taxes, is a matter of general interest.  City of Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U. S. 204.  And the rendering requirement's alleged furtherance of the state interests in protecting property owners who will bear the direct burden of retiring the city's bond indebtedness and in encouraging prospective voters to render their property and thereby help enforce the State's tax laws, falls far short of meeting the ""compelling state interest"" test applied in Kramer, Cipriano, and Phoenix, supra.  Pp.  421 U. S. 298-301. 
Page 421 U. S. 290

2. The District Court's ruling should apply only to those bond authorization elections that were not final on the date of that court's judgment, and as to other jurisdictions that may have similar restrictive voting classifications, this Court's decision should apply only to elections not final as of the date of this decision.

No. 74-80
Argued March 25, 1975
Decided April 28, 1975*
421 U.S. 117

Syllabus 
One Helfant, who was a Municipal Court judge and a member of the New Jersey bar, brought this action in District Court permanently to enjoin the State Attorney General and other officials from proceeding with the prosecution of an indictment of Helfant, which had grown out of grand jury testimony that he had given as a result of assertedly collusive coercion by a State Deputy Attorney General and members of the New Jersey Supreme Court, whose significant involvement allegedly made it impossible for Helfant to receive a fair trial in the New Jersey state courts.  The District Court issued an order dismissing the complaint, on the basis of Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, which held that, unless ""extraordinary circumstances"" exist in which irreparable injury can be shown even in the absence of bad faith and harassment, a federal court must not intervene by way of granting injunctive or declaratory relief against a state criminal prosecution.  The Court of Appeals, though holding that a permanent injunction of the state criminal prosecution would be inappropriate, reversed the order and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on Helfant's coercion charge and for entry of a declaratory judgment, based upon that hearing, on the question whether his grand jury testimony was admissible in the state criminal trial.  Helfant claims that federal judicial intervention is warranted under Younger's ""extraordinary circumstances"" exception because of the assertedly coercive involvement of the members of the New Jersey Supreme Court, who have formidable supervisory and administrative powers over the state court system.
Held:
1. Helfant's claim that he cannot obtain a fair hearing in the state courts is without merit, and the facts he alleges do not bring this matter within any exception to the Younger rule so as to warrant the granting of injunctive relief against the state criminal prosecution.  Pp.  421 U. S. 123-129. 
Page 421 U. S. 118

(a) The New Jersey judicial system safeguards a defendant like Helfant against denial of due process of law in the state trial or appellate process by providing that a defendant can disqualify a particular judge from participating in his case, mandating disqualification of an appellate judge whose participation might reasonably lead counsel to believe he was biased, and providing for temporary assignment of substitute Justices where a Supreme Court quorum is lacking.  Pp.  421 U. S. 126-128.
(b) Four of the six members (including the then Chief Justice) of the New Jersey Supreme Court who participated in the alleged coercion are no longer on that court, and, of the two remaining members, only one was active in the conduct complained of.  P.  421 U. S. 128.

No. 73-1233
Argued January 14, 1975
Decided April 28, 1975
421 U.S. 132

Syllabus 
Under the procedure for adjudicating unfair labor practice cases under the National Labor Relations Act, if a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) Regional Director, with whom unfair labor practice charges are filed in the first instance and to whom the NLRB's General Counsel has delegated the initial power to decide whether or not to issue a complaint, believes that the charge has no merit, the charging party has a right to appeal to the General Counsel.  If this right is exercised, the file is sent to the Office of Appeals in the General Counsel's Office, and the Appeals Committee then decides either to sustain or overrule the Regional Director, and sets forth the decision and supporting reasons in an Appeals Memorandum, which is cleared through the General Counsel and sent to the Regional Director, who must follow its instructions.  In addition to this appeals process, the General Counsel requires the Regional Director, before reaching an initial decision in connection with unfair labor practice charges raising certain issues, to submit the matter to the General Counsel's Advice Branch, and, in other kinds of unfair labor practice cases, the Regional Directors are permitted to seek the Advice Branch's advice.  The Advice Branch, after studying the matter, makes a recommendation to the General Counsel, who then makes a ""final determination"" which is communicated to the Regional Director by way of an Advice Memorandum.  Depending upon the conclusion reached in such memorandum, the Regional Director will either file a complaint or notify the complaining party of the decision not to proceed and of his right to appeal.  Respondent, after the General Counsel had declined to disclose all Advice and Appeals Memoranda pertaining to certain matters issued within a certain number of years, filed suit to require disclosure of such memoranda, alleging violations of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.  552.  The District Court granted respondent's motion for a summary judgment, holding that the Advice Memoranda were ""instructions to staff that affect a member of the public"" required 
Page 421 U. S. 133
 to be disclosed under  552(a)(2)(C), that the Appeals Memoranda were ""final opinions"" required to be disclosed under  552(a)(2)(A), and that both kinds of memoranda were not exempt from disclosure as ""intra-agency memorandums""under  552(b)(5) (Exemption 5).  The Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion.
Held:
1. Exemption 5 can never apply to ""final opinions,"" which not only invariably explain agency action already taken or an agency decision already made, but also constitute ""final dispositions"" of matters by an agency.  Pp.  421 U. S. 150-154.
2. Exemption 5 covers the attorney work-product rule, which clearly applies to memoranda prepared by an attorney in contemplation of litigation and setting forth the attorney's theory of the case and his litigation strategy.  Pp.  421 U. S. 154-155.
3. Those Advice and Appeals Memoranda that explain decisions by the General Counsel not to file a complaint are ""final opinions"" made in the ""adjudication of cases"" within the meaning of  552(a)(2)(A), and hence fall outside the scope of Exemption 5 and must be disclosed.  Pp.  421 U. S. 155-159.
(a) In the case of decisions not to file a complaint, each of such memoranda effects as ""final"" a ""disposition"" as an administrative decision can, and disclosure of these memoranda would not intrude on pre-decisional processes, nor would protecting them improve the quality of agency decisions within the purposes of the ""executive privilege"" embodied in Exemption 5, since when the memoranda are communicated to the Regional Director, the General Counsel has already reached his decision, and the Regional Director has no decision to make, but is bound to dismiss the charge.  P.  421 U. S. 155.
(b) Moreover, the General Counsel's decisions not to file complaints, together with the Advice and Appeals Memoranda explaining them, are precisely the kind of agency law in which the public is so vitally interested, and which Congress sought to prevent the agency from keeping secret.  Pp.  421 U. S. 155-157.
4. Those Advice and Appeals Memoranda that explain decisions by the General Counsel to file a complaint and commence litigation before the NLRB are not ""final opinions"" made in the ""adjudication of cases"" within the meaning of  552(a)(2)(A), and do fall within the scope of Exemption 5.  Pp.  421 U. S. 159-160.
(a) The filing of a complaint does not finally dispose even of the General Counsel's responsibility with respect to the case, since the case will be litigated before and decided by the NLRB, 
Page 421 U. S. 134
 and the General Counsel will be responsible for advocating the charging party's position before the NLRB.  P.  421 U. S. 159.
(b) Since the memoranda will also have been prepared in contemplation of the upcoming litigation, they fall squarely within Exemption 5's protection of an attorney's work product, and, at the same time, the public's interest in disclosure is substantially reduced by the fact that the basis for the General Counsel's decision to file a complaint will develop in the course of litigation before the NLRB, and that the ""law"" with respect to these cases will ultimately be made not by the General Counsel, but by the NLRB or the courts.  Pp.  421 U. S. 159-160.
5. The documents incorporated by reference in nonexempt Advice and Appeals Memoranda lose any exemption they might previously have held as ""intra-agency"" memoranda under Exemption 5, and if an agency chooses expressly to adopt or incorporate by reference an intra-agency memorandum previously covered by Exemption 5 in what would otherwise be a final opinion, that memorandum may be withheld only on the ground that it is covered by some exemption other than Exemption 5.  P.  421 U. S. 161.
6. Petitioners are not required to produce or create explanatory material in those instances in which an Appeals Memorandum refers to the ""circumstances of the case,"" nor are they required to identify, after the fact, those preexisting documents that contain the ""circumstances of a case"" to which an opinion may have referred, and which are not identified by the party seeking disclosure.  Pp.  421 U. S. 161-162.
7. This Court will not adjudicate petitioners' claim that the Advice and Appeals Memoranda are exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C.  552(b)(7) (Exemption 7) as ""investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes.""  That claim was not made in the District Court and, although it was made in the Court of Appeals, that court affirmed without opinion on the basis of its prior decision in another case not involving Exemption 7, and it is therefore not clear whether that court passed on the claim.  Moreover, Congress passed a limiting amendment to Exemption 7 after petitioners filed their brief, and thus any decision of the Exemption 7 issue in this case would have to be made under the exemption as amended, which could not have been done by the courts below.  Pp.  421 U. S. 162-165.
8. Nor will this Court reach petitioners' claim that the Advice and Appeals Memoranda are exempt from disclosure under  552(b)(2) (Exemption 2) as documents ""related solely to the 
Page 421 U. S. 135
 internal personnel rules and practices of an agency,"" that claim not having been raised below.  P.  421 U. S. 165.
9. Petitioners' claim that the documents incorporated by reference in Advice and Appeals Memoranda, which were previously protected from disclosure by Exemption 7, should not lose their exempt status by reason of incorporation has merit, since a document protected by Exemption 7 does not become disclosable solely because it is referred to in a ""final opinion,"" and, accordingly, the case must be remanded to the District Court for a determination whether such documents are protected by Exemption 7, as amended.  Pp.  421 U. S. 165-167.

Pursuant to the Government contract renegotiation process in effect under the Renegotiation Act of 1951 for so-called Class A cases (those in which the contractor reported profits of more than $800,000 on the relevant contracts) during the period involved in this case, if the Regional Board made a recommendation as to the amount of excessive profits in the year in issue, rather than recommending a clearance, i.e., a unilateral determination that a contractor realized no excessive profits during the year in issue, the case, if the contractor declined to enter into an agreement, would be reassigned to the Renegotiation Board (Board).  The case file, including the Regional Board Report, was then transmitted to the Board and assigned to a division of the Board, usually consisting of three of its five members, which, in due course, would make its own decision and submit to the full Board a Division Report, including a recommendation for final disposition of the case.  If the Regional Board concluded that no excessive profits had been realized and that a clearance should therefore issue, a ""final recommendation"" that a clearance be issued was sent to the Board, which considered the case on the basis of the Regional Board Report.  Respondent brought an action pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C.  552, seeking disclosure of certain Regional Board Reports resulting in a recommendation of clearance and Board approval, and of Division Reports in other cases, all related to and issued during renegotiation proceedings involving 14 other companies during the period 1962-1965.  The District Court ultimately granted relief on the grounds that both the Regional Board and Division Reports were ""final opinions"" within the meaning of  552(a)(2)(A), which requires a Government agency to make available to the public ""final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases,"" and were not exempt from disclosure under  552(b)(5) (Exemption

 5) as ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums . . . which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed, further holding that, even if the Regional Board Report were not ""final opinions"" of the Board, they were disclosable as final opinions of the Regional Board, which was to be considered an ""agency"" for purposes of the FOIA.
Held:  Neither the Regional Board nor Division Reports are final opinions, and they do fall within Exemption 5, since (1) only the full Board has the power by law to make the decision whether excessive profits exist; (2) both types of reports are prepared prior to that decision, and are used by the Board in its deliberations; and (3) the evidence fails to support the conclusion that the reasoning in the reports is adopted by the Board as its reasoning, even when it agrees with a report's conclusion.  Pp.  421 U. S. 183-190.
(a) The Regional Board Reports, being prepared long before the Board reached its decision and being used by it as a basis for discussion, are precisely the kind of pre-decisional deliberative advice and recommendations contemplated by Exemption 5 which must remain uninhibited, and thus undisclosed, in order to supply maximum assistance to the Board in reaching its decision.  Regardless of whether the Regional Boards are agencies for Class A purposes, so that their final recommendations are inter-agency memoranda, or are not agencies separate from the Board, so that their recommendations are intra-agency memoranda, the Regional Boards' total lack of decisional authority brings their reports within Exemption 5 and prevents them from being ""final opinions.""  Pp.  421 U. S. 185-188.
(b) Since the Division Reports were prepared before the Board reached its decision and to assist it in its deliberations, and were used by the full Board as a basis for discussion, the Board should not be deprived of such a thoroughly uninhibited version of this valuable deliberative tool by making such reports public on the unsupported assumption that they always disclose the final views of at least some Board members.

Syllabus 
After the Boston Municipal Court, in which no jury is provided, denied his motion for a jury trial on a criminal charge and that court adjudged him guilty after trial, appellant appealed, pursuant to Massachusetts' two-tier trial system, to the Superior Court where he could obtain a de novo trial with a jury.  But before proceedings were had in the Superior Court, appellant appealed to this Court, claiming, inter alia, that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments required a jury trial in his first trial, whether in the Municipal or Superior Court.
Held:  This Court has no jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C.  1257, since the Municipal Court's judgment is not a judgment of the highest state court in which a decision could be had, it appearing that, under Massachusetts procedure, appellant can raise his constitutional issues in Superior Court by a motion to dismiss and can obtain appellate review of an adverse decision through appeal to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

 Stanley MARKS et al.v. Simon L. LEIS, Jr., etc., et al.No. 74-793. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 28, 1975
 The judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio is vacated and the cause is remanded for further consideration in light of Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 42 L. Ed.2d 532, n. [Footnote 3] (1975), and Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592 (1975).
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Nuisance proceedings were begun against appellants in Ohio courts on the theory that some of the books sold in a bookstore on premises owned by one appellant and leased by the others were obscene, and that the bookstore was therefore a nuisance. The Ohio statutory scheme underlying these nuisance proceedings is outlined in Huffman v. Pursue, 420 U.S. 592 (1975). 
Page 421 U.S. 940 , 941
 Appellants filed suit in Federal District Court while the state proceedings were pending seeking injunctions against the state proceedings. The parties agreed not to go forward with the state court proceedings until the Federal District Court litigation was completed. The federal court refused to enjoin the state proceedings because it believed that Ohio could treat as a nuisance and close for a year a bookstore which sold some obscene materials, without running afoul of the constitutional proscriptions against prior restraint of materials protected by the First Amendment. 
 A similar issue was presented on the merits in Huffman, supra. However, the Court refused to pass on the merits, because it believed that the federal court was barred from intervening in the state proceedings. The Court now remands this case for consideration in light of Huffman, supra, and Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393. But I think it clear that even if Huffman was correctly decided, see Brennan, J., dissenting, 420 U.S., at 613, it does not govern this case. Here, the prosecuting authorities expressly agreed to submit to federal court jurisdiction, and they do not in this Court argue that the District Court could not have enjoined the state proceedings even if it believed them unconstitutional. Thus, any reliance on the principles of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), has been waived. See Sosna v. Iowa, supra, 419 U.S., at 396 n. 3 n. 3. 
 I need not reach the question of whether the Ohio scheme constitutes an impermissible prior restraint upon books never judicially determined to be obscene, because I believe that suppression even of specific books adjudicated obscene in nuisance proceedings is unconstitutional. 
 Ohio defines obscenity as follows:

 April 28, 1975
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted in the Criminal Court of Fulton County, Georgia, of exhibiting an allegedly obscene film in violation of Ga.Code Ann. 26-2101, which provides in pertinent part as follows: 
Page 421 U.S. 952 , 953
 terly without redeeming social value and if, in addition it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matters.'
 The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed. 
 It is my view that 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obstrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.' Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, the definition of 'obscene' as contained in 26-2101, is unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47d 419 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia was rendered after Miller, reverse.* In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 483, 494, 495 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). 
 Finally, it does not appear that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 141, 41 L. Ed.2d 590 (1974), I believe that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, petitioner must be given an opportunity to have his case decided on, and introduce evidence relevant to, the legal standard upon which his conviction has ultimately come to depend. Thus, even on its own terms, the Court should vacate [421 U.S. 952 , 954]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California of using the mails to distribute allegedly obscene materials in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1461, which provides in pertinent part as follows: 'Every obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile articles, matter, thing, device, or substance; . . . * * * * * 'Is declared to be nonmailable matter and shall not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier.

Id., at 147-148. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would

 ART THEATER GUILD, INC., et al.v. Clark L. EWING.No. 73-1973. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 21, 1975
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Appellee brought this action in the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County, Ohio, to prohibit showing of the motion picture 'Without A Stitch' on the theory that the film's exhibition rendered the theater itself a nuisance. Under Ohio law, any place which exhibits filmed obscenity is a nuisance. See State ex rel. Keating v. 'Vixen', 35 Ohio St.2d 215, 301 N.E. 2d 880 (1973). Obscenity is defined as follows: 
Page 421 U.S. 923 , 924
 or for commercial exploitation, rather than for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral, or artistic purpose.' Ohio Rev.Code Ann. 2905.34.
 The Court of Common Pleas found the film obscene and enjoined its exhibition. The Lucas County Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed. 37 Ohio St.2d 95, 307 N.E.2d 911 (1974). 
 It is my view that 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.'

 For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), and because the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court was rendered after Miller, I would reverse.

 ART THEATER GUILD, INC., et al.v. Clark L. EWING.No. 73-1973. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 21, 1975
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Appellee brought this action in the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County, Ohio, to prohibit showing of the motion picture 'Without A Stitch' on the theory that the film's exhibition rendered the theater itself a nuisance. Under Ohio law, any place which exhibits filmed obscenity is a nuisance. See State ex rel. Keating v. 'Vixen', 35 Ohio St.2d 215, 301 N.E. 2d 880 (1973). Obscenity is defined as follows: 
Page 421 U.S. 923 , 924
 or for commercial exploitation, rather than for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral, or artistic purpose.' Ohio Rev.Code Ann. 2905.34.
 The Court of Common Pleas found the film obscene and enjoined its exhibition. The Lucas County Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed. 37 Ohio St.2d 95, 307 N.E.2d 911 (1974). 
 It is my view that 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.' Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). Since it is clear that, when tested by that constitutional standard, 2905.34 is unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore facially invalid, I disagree with the holding that the appeal does not present a substantial federal question, and therefore dissent from the Court's dismissal of the appeal.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 21, 1975
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
 The motion of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe for leave to file a brief, as amicus curiae, is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 Petitioner and respondent are both enrolled Indians residing on the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation, a reservation which straddles the border of North and South Dakota. Petitioner is resident in the portion of the reservation in South Dakota, and respondent lives within that portion in North Dakota. This ligigation arose from an automobile accident occurring on the Reservation in North Dakota. Respondent's son was injured by a car 
Page 421 U.S. 934 , 935
 driven by petitioner and died as a result. Respondent brought this wrongful death action based upon North Dakota law in the Federal District Court, invoking its jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1332(a). When petitioner failed to respond, the North Dakota Unsatisfied Judgment Fund appeared and moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. 
 The District Court, basing its decision upon Erie v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over respondent's suit. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe had not consented to the jurisdiction of the North Dakota state courts, as required for the exercise of state court jurisdiction in civil suits between Indians under 25 U.S.C. 1322(a), and the state courts would not have jurisdiction over respondent's suit although based upon North Dakota substantive law. See Gourneau v. Smith, 207 N.W.2d 256 (N.D.1973). Viewing itself as another state court in diversity cases, the District Court concluded that it too could not entertain the suit. 369 F.Supp. 257 (N.D. 1973). 
 The Court of Appeals reversed. It concluded that there was no state policy involved in the absence of state-court jurisdiction over this type of litigation. The lack of jurisdiction arose from the federal requirement of consent by the Indians to such jurisdiction and the failure of the Tribe here to consent. The federal 'consent' statute, 25 U.S.C. 1322(a), was not intended to deprive Indians of state-created substantive rights, but rather had as its purpose an effort to prevent the States from interfering with Indian affairs. See 502 F.2d 23 (CA8 1974). 
 The court below acknowledged that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had in two decisions held that a district court could not exercise diversity jurisdiction in situations in which the state courts would not exercise [421 U.S. 934 , 936]

 Rehearing Denied June 2, 1975. 
 See 421 U.S. 1006. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BLACKMUN and Mr. Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 Respondent La Chemise Lacoste (LCL) initiated this trademark litigation by filing a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in the Delaware state courts. Petitioner removed it to the District Court under 28 U.S.C. 1441(a). The District Court denied respondent's motion for a remand under 28 U.S.C. 1447(c). See 313 F.Supp. 915 (Del.1970). The District Court also denied respondent's motion for a certificate allowing an interlocutory appeal of the removal question under 28 U.S.C. 1292(b). When the trial court denied its motion for a preliminary injunction, respondent appealed but did not raise the removal issue; and in affirming the denial of the preliminary injunction, the Court of Appeals did not discuss the question. La Chemise Lacoste v. General Mills, Inc., 487 F.2d 312 (CA3 1973). 
 The District Court then conducted a six-day trial on the merits and concluded that petitioner was entitled to injunctive relief. 374 F.Supp. 52 (1974). Respondent then appealed from the final judgment. This time it also raised the removal question. The Court of Appeals ruled that this appeal represented the first opportunity that LCL had to have the District Court's decision denying remand review. There thus had been no waiver of the removal question, and this Court's decision in Grubbs v. General Electric Credit Corp., 405 U.S. 699 (1972), had no application. See 506 F.2d 339 (CA3 1974). The Court of Appeals then reversed 
Page 421 U.S. 937 , 938
 the District Court on the removal question and ordered a remand to the state court. 
 In holding that the refusal to remand a removal case could not be raised on an appeal from a denial of a preliminary injunction, the decision of the Court of Appeals departed from its prior holding in Mayflower Industries v. Thor Corp., 184 F.2d 537, 538 (3 Cir. 1950), cert. denied, 341 U.S. 903 (1951), and conflicts with the decisions of other courts of appeals in Beech-Nut, Inc. v.

Furthermore, it would appear that jurisdictional questions should be reviewed at the first available opportunity, and I perceive no good reason for not permitting the removal issue to be raised in connection with an appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction.* Had that course been followed here, six days of trial and a decision on the merits would not have been wasted. Also, if it were to be held that the appeal on the injunction issue is a suitable occasion for considering the remand question, then Grubbs, supra, should be extended so as to require that the question be raised on such an appeal.

|421 u.s. 35|"Withrow v. Larkin
No. 73-1573
Argued December 18, 1974
Decided April 16, 1975
421 U.S. 35

Syllabus 
Wisconsin statutes prohibit various acts of professional misconduct by physicians and empower a State Examining Board to warn and reprimand physicians, to temporarily suspend licenses, and to institute criminal action or action to revoke a license.  When the Board notified appellee licensed physician that a closed investigative hearing, which appellee and his attorney could attend, would be held to determine whether appellee had engaged in certain proscribed acts, appellee brought an action against appellant Board members seeking injunctive relief and a temporary restraining order against the hearing on the ground that the statutes were unconstitutional and that appellants' acts with respect to appellee violated his constitutional rights.  The District Court denied the restraining order, and the Board proceeded with the hearing, and, after hearing testimony, notified appellee that a ""contested hearing"" would be held at which the Board would determine whether his license would be temporarily suspended.  The court then granted appellee's motion for a restraining order against the contested hearing on the ground that a substantial federal due process question had arisen.  The Board complied with the order and did not proceed with the contested hearing, but instead held a final investigative session and made ""findings of fact"" that appellee had engaged in certain proscribed conduct and ""conclusions of law"" that there was probable cause to believe he had violated certain criminal provisions.  Subsequently, a three-judge court declared that the statute empowering the Board temporarily to suspend a physician's license without formal proceedings was unconstitutional, and preliminarily enjoined the Board from enforcing it on the ground that it would be a denial of due process for the board to suspend appellee's license ""at its own contested hearing on charges evolving from its own investigation.""  After appellants appealed from this decision the District Court modified the judgment so as to withdraw its declaration of unconstitutionality and to preliminarily enjoin its enforcement against appellee only, stating that appellee would suffer irreparable injury if the 
Page 421 U. S. 36
 statute were applied to him, and that his challenge to its constitutionality had a high likelihood of success.
Held:
1. The three-judge court's initial judgment should not have declared the statute unconstitutional and erroneously enjoined the Board from applying it against all licensees.  Mayo v. Lakeland Highlands Canning Co., 309 U. S. 310. P. 43.
2. While a decision to vacate and remand for fuller emendation of the District Court's findings, conclusions, and judgment would be justified in view of their lack of specificity, such action, under the circumstances, would not add anything essential to the determination of the merits, and would be a costly procedure to emphasize points already made and recognized by the parties, as well as by the District Court.  Pp.  421 U. S. 44-46.
3. The District Court erred when it restrained the Board's contested hearing and when it preliminarily enjoined the enforcement of the statute against appellee, since, on the record, it is quite unlikely that appellee would ultimately prevail on the merits of the due process issue.  Pp.  421 U. S. 46-55
(a) The combination of investigative and adjudicative functions does not, without more, constitute a due process violation as creating an unconstitutional risk of bias.  Pp.  421 U. S. 46-54.
(b) Here, the processes utilized by the Board do not in themselves contain an unacceptable risk of bias, since, although the investigative hearing had been closed to the public, appellee and his attorney were permitted to be present throughout, and, in fact, his attorney did attend the hearings, and knew the facts presented to the Board; moreover, no specific foundation has been presented for suspecting that the Board had been prejudiced by its investigation or would be disabled from hearing and deciding on the basis of the evidence to be presented at the contested hearing, the mere exposure to evidence presented in nonadversary investigative procedures being insufficient in itself to impugn the Board's fairness at a later adversary hearing.  Pp.  421 U. S. 54-55.
4. The fact that the Board, when prevented from going forward with the contested hearing, proceeded to issue formal findings of fact and conclusions of law that there was probable cause to believe appellee had engaged in various prohibited acts, does not show prejudice and prejudgment, and the Board stayed within accepted bounds of due process by issuing such findings and conclusions after investigation.  The initial charge or determination of probable cause and the ultimate adjudication have different 
Page 421 U. S. 37
 bases and purposes, and the fact that the same agency makes them in tandem, and that they relate to the same issues, does not result in a procedural due process violation.  Pp.  421 U. S. 55-58.
Reversed and remanded. See 368 F.Supp. 796.
WHITE, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

When the Board notified appellee licensed physician that a closed investigative hearing, which appellee and his attorney could attend, would be held to determine whether appellee had engaged in certain proscribed acts, appellee brought an action against appellant Board members seeking injunctive relief and a temporary restraining order against the hearing on the ground that the statutes were unconstitutional and that appellants' acts with respect to appellee violated his constitutional rights.  The District Court denied the restraining order, and the Board proceeded with the hearing, and, after hearing testimony, notified appellee that a ""contested hearing"" would be held at which the Board would determine whether his license would be temporarily suspended.  The court then granted appellee's motion for a restraining order against the contested hearing on the ground that a substantial federal due process question had arisen.  The Board complied with the order and did not proceed with the contested hearing, but instead held a final investigative session and made ""findings of fact"" that appellee had engaged in certain proscribed conduct and ""conclusions of law"" that there was probable cause to believe he had violated certain criminal provisions.  Subsequently, a three-judge court declared that the statute empowering the Board temporarily to suspend a physician's license without formal proceedings was unconstitutional, and preliminarily enjoined the Board from enforcing it on the ground that it would be a denial of due process for the board to suspend appellee's license ""at its own contested hearing on charges evolving from its own investigation.""  After appellants appealed from this decision the District Court modified the judgment so as to withdraw its declaration of unconstitutionality and to preliminarily enjoin its enforcement against appellee only, stating that appellee would suffer irreparable injury if the 
Page 421 U. S. 36
 statute were applied to him, and that his challenge to its constitutionality had a high likelihood of success.
Held:
1. The three-judge court's initial judgment should not have declared the statute unconstitutional and erroneously enjoined the Board from applying it against all licensees.  Mayo v. Lakeland Highlands Canning Co., 309 U. S. 310. P. 43.
2. While a decision to vacate and remand for fuller emendation of the District Court's findings, conclusions, and judgment would be justified in view of their lack of specificity, such action, under the circumstances, would not add anything essential to the determination of the merits, and would be a costly procedure to emphasize points already made and recognized by the parties, as well as by the District Court.  Pp.  421 U. S. 44-46.
3. The District Court erred when it restrained the Board's contested hearing and when it preliminarily enjoined the enforcement of the statute against appellee, since, on the record, it is quite unlikely that appellee would ultimately prevail on the merits of the due process issue.  Pp.  421 U. S. 46-55
(a) The combination of investigative and adjudicative functions does not, without more, constitute a due process violation as creating an unconstitutional risk of bias.  Pp.  421 U. S. 46-54.
(b) Here, the processes utilized by the Board do not in themselves contain an unacceptable risk of bias, since, although the investigative hearing had been closed to the public, appellee and his attorney were permitted to be present throughout, and, in fact, his attorney did attend the hearings, and knew the facts presented to the Board; moreover, no specific foundation has been presented for suspecting that the Board had been prejudiced by its investigation or would be disabled from hearing and deciding on the basis of the evidence to be presented at the contested hearing, the mere exposure to evidence presented in nonadversary investigative procedures being insufficient in itself to impugn the Board's fairness at a later adversary hearing.  Pp.  421 U. S. 54-55.
4. The fact that the Board, when prevented from going forward with the contested hearing, proceeded to issue formal findings of fact and conclusions of law that there was probable cause to believe appellee had engaged in various prohibited acts, does not show prejudice and prejudgment, and the Board stayed within accepted bounds of due process by issuing such findings and conclusions after investigation.  The initial charge or determination of probable cause and the ultimate adjudication have different 
Page 421 U. S. 37
 bases and purposes, and the fact that the same agency makes them in tandem, and that they relate to the same issues, does not result in a procedural due process violation.  Pp.  421 U. S. 55-58.

Syllabus 
Under the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, which establish a program for controlling air pollution, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to set ""ambient air"" quality standards which, in the EPA's judgment, are ""requisite to protect the public health,""  109(b)(1) (""primary"" standards), and
""requisite to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects associated with the presence of such air pollutant in the ambient air,""
 109(b)(2) (""secondary"" standards).  Each State, after promulgation of these standards, must submit an implementing and maintenance plan, which must be approved by the EPA if, inter alia, it meets eight general conditions set forth in  110(a)(2), the principal one of which is that the plan provide for the attainment of the national primary ambient air quality standards in the State ""as expeditiously as practicable,"" but no later than three years from the date of the plan's approval.   110(a)(2)(A).  The State's plan must include emission limitations, schedules, compliance timetables, and other measures insuring timely attainment and subsequent maintenance of the national standards.  In order to develop the requisite plan within the statutory deadline, Georgia elected to follow an EPA-endorsed approach providing for immediately effective categorical emission limitations accompanied, however, by a variance procedure whereby particular sources could obtain individually tailored relief from the general requirements.  Section 110(a)(3) provides that the EPA shall approve any ""revision"" of an implementation plan that meets the  110(a)(2) requirements applicable to an original plan, and the EPA, concluding that that provision permits a State to grant individual variances meeting  110(a)(2) requirements from generally applicable emission standards, both before and after the attainment date, approved the Georgia plan.  Respondents initiated review proceedings in the Court of Appeals, taking the position that variances applicable to individual sources may be approved only if they meet the much 
Page 421 U. S. 61
 more stringent procedural and substantive standards of  110(f), which, upon application prior to the compliance date for a stationary source or class of moving sources, permits ""postponements"" of no more than one year of any requirement of  plan, subject to specified conditions.  That court upheld respondents' contentions, and ordered the EPA to disapprove Georgia's variance provision.
Held:  The EPA's construction of the Act permitting treatment of individual variances from state requirements as ""revisions,"" under  110(a)(3), of state implementation plans if they will not interfere with timely attainment and subsequent maintenance of national air quality standards, rather than as ""postponements"" under  110(f), was sufficiently reasonable to preclude the Court of Appeals from substituting its judgment for that of the EPA.  Pp.  421 U. S. 75-99.
(a) Section 110(f) is a safety valve by which may be accorded, under certain carefully specified circumstances, exceptions to the mandatory deadlines for meeting national standards, and, contrary to respondents' contention, does not constitute the sole mechanism by which exceptions to a plan's requirements may be obtained.  Pp.  421 U. S. 78-84.
(b) This concept of  110(f)'s limited role is reinforced by comparison with  110(e), which permits a two-year extension of the three-year period referred to in  110(a)(2)(A)(i) on a showing far less stringent than that required for a  110(f) one-year postponement, which would be inexplicable were  110(f) the sole mechanism for States to modify their initial formulations of emission limitations.  Pp.  421 U. S. 84-86.
(c) Noting that  110(f) provides that a postponement may be granted with respect to the date that ""any stationary source"" must comply with ""any requirement of an applicable state implementation plan,"" the Court of Appeals reached an erroneous conclusion that the  110(f) procedure was exclusive; the language of that provision does not mandate that all modifications of a plan's requirements necessarily be treated as postponements, precluding other forms of relief.  Pp.  421 U. S. 87-88.
(d) The Court of Appeals also erred in its conclusion that ""a revision is a change in a generally applicable requirement,"" whereas a ""postponement or variance"" deals with particular parties, for here the implementation plans being revised are quite detailed; moreover, the court's analysis overlooks obvious distinctions between revisions and postponements in the statutory context.  Pp.  421 U. S. 88-90. 
Page 421 U. S. 62

(e) Section 110(a)(3) revisions are granted by the EPA only if they comport with the  110(a)(2)(A) requirement that the national standards be attained as expeditiously as practicable and thereafter maintained, so the ""technology-forcing"" nature of the Amendments is no reason for judging under  110(f) variances which qualify for approval under  110(a)(3).  Pp.  421 U. S. 90-91.
(f) Congress felt that the EPA could feasibly and reliably perform the measurement and predictive functions necessary to pass on variances as revisions under  110(a)(3).  Pp.  421 U. S. 91-94.
(g) Respondents' argument that, because any variance would delay attainment of national standards beyond what was previously considered as the earliest practicable date, and that, because the Act requires attainment as soon as practicable, any variance must therefore be treated as a postponement, is not supported by the legislative history or otherwise.  Pp.  421 U. S. 94-97.
(h) Respondents' contention, based on  110(a)(2)(H), that revision authority is limited to general changes initiated by the EPA in order to ""accelerate abatement or attain it in greater concert with other national goals,"" is specious.  That provision, which does no more than impose a minimum requirement that state plans be capable of such modifications as are necessary to meet the basic goal of cleansing the ambient air to the extent necessary to protect public health, as expeditiously as possible within the three-year period, does not prevent the States from also permitting ameliorative revisions not contrary to that goal.  Pp.  421 U. S. 97-98.

Syllabus 
When appellant wife and appellee husband were divorced in Utah in 1960, the decree, incorporating the parties' stipulation, ordered appellee to make monthly payments to appellant for the support of the parties' children, a daughter, then age seven, and a son, then age five.  Subsequently, when the daughter became 18, appellee discontinued payments for her support, and the divorce court, pursuant to a Utah statute which provides that the period of minority for males extends to age 21 and for females to age 18, denied appellant's motion for support of the daughter for the period after she attained 18.  On appeal the Utah Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting appellant's contention, inter alia, that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:
1. The support issue is not rendered moot by the fact that appellant and the daughter are now both over 21, since, if appellee is obligated by the divorce decree to support the daughter between ages 18 and 21, there is an amount past due and owing.  Nor does appellant lack standing because she is not of the age group affected by the statute; another statute obligates her to support the daughter to age 21.  Pp.  421 U. S. 11-12.
2. In the context of child support, the classification effectuated by the challenged statute denies the equal protection of the laws, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Reed v. Reed, 404 U.

Notwithstanding the ""old notions"" cited by the state court, that it is the man's primary responsibility to provide a home, that it is salutary for him to have education and training before he assumes that responsibility, and that females tend to mature and marry earlier than males, there is nothing rational in the statutory distinction between males and females which, when related to the divorce decree, results in appellee's liability for support for the daughter only to age 18, but for the son to age 21, thus imposing ""criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of that statute.""

Appellee, an Air Force master sergeant whose court-martial conviction for violations of Art. 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice involving, inter alia, unauthorized use of classified documents and information, had been reversed for improper admission of certain evidence, and whose retrial was about to commence, filed this action for injunctive relief in Federal District Court against appellant military authorities, asserting that Art. 134 was unconstitutionally vague and that certain limitations imposed by the military authorities on the defense's pretrial access to classified documents in issue denied him due process and effective assistance of counsel.  The District Court preliminarily enjoined appellants from proceeding with the court-martial on the Art. 134 charges, and also on any other charges unless civilian defense counsel and certain other persons were allowed unlimited access to documents material to the defense.  The court held that the circumstances justified an exception to the rule requiring a serviceman to exhaust his military remedies before a federal court will interfere with court-martial proceedings, that the unconstitutionality of Art. 134 was clear from the Courts of Appeals decisions in Avrech v. Secretary of the Navy, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 352, 477 F.2d 1237, and Levy v. Parker, 478 F.2d 772, that the restrictions placed on access to documents were excessive, and that appellee had adequately shown irreparable injury.  Appellants directly appealed to this Court under 28 U.S.C.  1252, which allows appeal from

""when a serviceman charged with crimes by military authorities can show no harm other than that attendant to resolution of his case in the military court system, the federal district courts must refrain from intervention,""

420 U.S. 738

Syllabus 
After court-martial charges were preferred against respondent Army captain for the sale, transfer, and possession of marihuana, he brought suit in Federal District Court to enjoin petitioner military authorities from proceeding with the court-martial.  The District Court granted a permanent injunction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, on the ground that the offenses charged were not ""service-connected"" and hence were not within court-martial jurisdiction.  Petitioners contend in this Court (1) that any federal question jurisdiction that the District Court might have had under 28 U.S.C.  1331 had been removed by Art. 76 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), which provides that court-martial proceedings ""are final and conclusive"" and that ""all action taken pursuant to those proceedings [is] binding upon all . . . courts . . . of the United States,"" and (2) that the District Court improperly intervened in a pending court-martial proceeding.
Held:
1. Article 76 does not stand as a jurisdictional bar to respondent's suit, and the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1331, assuming the requisite jurisdictional amount.  Pp.  420 U. S. 744-753
(a) The general rule that ""the acts of a court martial, within the scope of its jurisdiction and duty, cannot be controlled or reviewed in the civil courts, by writ of prohibition or otherwise,"" Smith v. Whitney, 116 U. S. 167,  116 U. S. 177, is subject to its own qualification that the court-martial's acts be ""within the scope of its jurisdiction and duty,"" and hence collateral relief from the consequences of a court-martial judgment is not barred if the judgment was void.  Pp.  420 U. S. 746-748.
(b) The finality clause of Art. 76 does no more than describe the terminal point for proceedings within the court-martial system, Gusik v. Schilder, 340 U. S. 128, and the legislative history of the article does not support a conclusion that it was intended to confine collateral attack on court-martial proceedings in Art.

No. 73-64
Argued December 17, 1974
Decided March 25, 1975
420 U.S. 770

Syllabus 
Each of the eight petitioners, along with seven unindicted coconspirators and six codefendants, was charged with conspiring to violate (18 U.S.C.  371), and with violating, 18 U.S.C.  1955, a provision of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (Act) aimed at large-scale gambling activities; and each petitioner was convicted and sentenced under both counts.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that prosecution and punishment for both offenses were permitted by a recognized exception to Wharton's Rule.  Under that Rule, an agreement by two persons to commit a particular crime cannot be prosecuted as a conspiracy when the crime is of such a nature as necessarily to require the participation of two persons for its commission, in such a case the conspiracy being deemed to have merged into the completed offense.
Held:  Petitioners were properly convicted and punished for violating 18 U.S.C.  1955 and for conspiring to violate that statute, it being clear that Congress, in enacting the Act, intended to retain each offense as an independent curb in combating organized crime.  Pp.  420 U. S. 777-791.
(a) Traditionally, conspiracy and the completed offense have been considered to constitute separate crimes, and this Court has recognized that a conspiracy poses dangers quite apart from the substantive offense.  Wharton's Rule is an exception to the general principle that a conspiracy and the substantive offense that is its immediate end do not merge upon proof of the latter.  Pp.  420 U. S. 777-782.
(b) The Rule -- which traditionally has been applied to offenses such as adultery where the harm attendant upon commission of the substantive offense is confined to the parties to the agreement and where the offense requires concerted criminal activity -- has current vitality only as a judicial presumption to be applied in the absence of a contrary legislative intent.  Pp.  420 U. S. 782-786.
(c) Here such a contrary intent existed, for, in drafting the Act, Congress manifested its awareness of the distinct nature of a conspiracy 
Page 420 U. S. 771
 and the substantive offenses that might constitute its immediate end, as well as a desire to provide a number of discrete weapons for the battle against organized crime.  Pp.  420 U. S. 786-789.
(d) The requirement of participation of ""five or more persons"" as an element of the  1955 substantive offense reflects no more than an intent to limit federal intervention to cases where federal interests are substantially implicated, leaving to local law enforcement efforts the prosecution of small-scale gambling activities.  Pp.  420 U. S. 789-790.

Syllabus 
The gender-based distinction mandated by the provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  402(g), that grant survivors' benefits based on the earnings of a deceased husband and father covered by the Act both to his widow and to the couple's minor children in her care, but that grant benefits based on the earnings of a covered deceased wife and mother only to the minor children and not to the widower, violates the right to equal protection secured by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, since it unjustifiably discriminates against female wage earners required to pay social security taxes by affording them less protection for their survivors than is provided for male wage earners.  Pp.  420 U. S. 642-653.
(a) The distinction is based on an ""archaic and overbroad"" generalization not tolerated under the Constitution, namely, that male workers' earnings are vital to their families' support, while female workers' earnings do not significantly contribute to families' support.  Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677.  Pp.  420 U. S. 642-643.
(b) That social security benefits are ""noncontractual,"" and do not compensate for work performed or necessarily correlate with contributions to the program, cannot sanction the solely gender-based differential protection for covered employees.  Since the benefits depend significantly upon a covered employee's participation in the workforce, and since only covered employees and not others are required to pay taxes toward the system, benefits must be distributed according to classifications that do not differentiate among covered employees solely on the basis of sex.  Pp.  420 U. S. 646-647.
(c) Since, as is apparent from the statutory scheme itself and from  402(g)'s legislative history,  402(g)'s purpose in providing benefits to young widows with children was not, as the Government contends, to provide an income to women who, because of economic discrimination, were unable to provide for themselves, but to permit women to elect not to work and to devote themselves to care of children (and thus was not premised upon

No. 73-2060
Argued January 15, 1975
Decided March 19, 1975
420 U.S. 656

Syllabus 
The New Hampshire Commuters Income Tax imposes a tax on nonresidents' New Hampshire-derived income above $2,000 at a 4% rate, except that, if the nonresident's State of residence would impose a lesser tax had the income been earned in that State, the New Hampshire tax is reduced to that amount.  The Commuters Income Tax contains provisions that, in practical effect exempt from tax income earned by New Hampshire residents outside the State, and New Hampshire imposes no tax on its residents' domestic earned income.
Held:  Under the rule requiring substantial equality of treatment for the citizens of the taxing State and nonresident taxpayers, the New Hampshire Commuters Income Tax violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause, since the tax falls exclusively on nonresidents' incomes and is not offset even approximately by other taxes imposed upon residents alone.  Pp.  420 U. S. 665-668.
(a) The State's contention that the tax's ultimate burden is not in effect more onerous on nonresidents because their total tax liability is unchanged once the tax credit received from their State of residence is taken into account cannot be squared with the underlying policy of comity that the Privileges and Immunities Clause requires.  Pp.  420 U. S. 665-666.
(b) The possibility that, in this case, Maine, the appellant taxpayers' State of residence, could shield its residents from the New Hampshire tax by amending its credit provisions does not cure, but, in fact, compounds, the constitutional defect of the discrimination in the New Hampshire tax, since New Hampshire in effect invites appellants to induce their representatives to retaliate against such discrimination.  The constitutionality of one State's statutes affecting nonresidents cannot depend upon the present configuration of another State's statutes.  Pp.  420 U. S. 666-668.

			"|"Austin v. New Hampshire
No. 73-2060
Argued January 15, 1975
Decided March 19, 1975
420 U.S. 656

Syllabus 
The New Hampshire Commuters Income Tax imposes a tax on nonresidents' New Hampshire-derived income above $2,000 at a 4% rate, except that, if the nonresident's State of residence would impose a lesser tax had the income been earned in that State, the New Hampshire tax is reduced to that amount.  The Commuters Income Tax contains provisions that, in practical effect exempt from tax income earned by New Hampshire residents outside the State, and New Hampshire imposes no tax on its residents' domestic earned income.
Held:  Under the rule requiring substantial equality of treatment for the citizens of the taxing State and nonresident taxpayers, the New Hampshire Commuters Income Tax violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause, since the tax falls exclusively on nonresidents' incomes and is not offset even approximately by other taxes imposed upon residents alone.  Pp.  420 U. S. 665-668.
(a) The State's contention that the tax's ultimate burden is not in effect more onerous on nonresidents because their total tax liability is unchanged once the tax credit received from their State of residence is taken into account cannot be squared with the underlying policy of comity that the Privileges and Immunities Clause requires.  Pp.  420 U. S. 665-666.
(b) The possibility that, in this case, Maine, the appellant taxpayers' State of residence, could shield its residents from the New Hampshire tax by amending its credit provisions does not cure, but, in fact, compounds, the constitutional defect of the discrimination in the New Hampshire tax, since New Hampshire in effect invites appellants to induce their representatives to retaliate against such discrimination.  The constitutionality of one State's statutes affecting nonresidents cannot depend upon the present configuration of another State's statutes.  Pp.  420 U. S. 666-668.

No. 73-1123
Argued November 19, 1974
Decided March 19, 1975
420 U.S. 671

Syllabus 
Respondent and others were convicted in a jury trial of violating 18 U.S.C.  111 for having assaulted federal officers (here undercover narcotics agents) in the performance of their official duties, and of conspiring to commit that offense, in violation of the general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C.  371.  The trial court had instructed the jurors that, in order to find any of the defendants guilty on either the conspiracy count or the substantive count, they were not required to conclude that the defendants were aware that their quarry were federal officers.  The Court of Appeals approved the instructions on the substantive charges but, in reliance on United States v. Crimmins, 123 F.2d 271,. and its progeny, reversed the conspiracy convictions on the ground that the trial court had erred in not charging that knowledge of the victim's official identity must be proved in order to convict on the  371 charge.
Held:
1. Section 111, which was enacted both to protect federal officers and federal functions and to provide a federal forum in which to try alleged offenders, requires no more than proof of an intent to assault, not of an intent to assault a federal officer; and it was not necessary under the substantive statute to prove that respondent and his confederates knew that their victims were federal officers.  Pp.  420 U. S. 676-686.
2. Where knowledge of the facts giving rise to federal jurisdiction is not necessary for conviction of a substantive offense embodying a mens rea requirement, such knowledge is equally irrelevant to questions of responsibility for conspiring to commit the offense.  Thus, in this case, where proof of knowledge that the intended victims were federal officers was not necessary to convict under  111, such knowledge did not have to be proved to convict under  371.  Pp.  420 U. S. 686-696.
(a) There is nothing on the face of  371 that would appear to require a greater degree of knowledge of the official status of the victim than is required in the case of the substantive statute, and at least two decisions repudiate respondent's contentions to the 
Page 420 U. S. 672
 contrary, In re Coy, 127 U. S. 731; United States v. Freed, 401 U. S. 601.  Pp.  420 U. S. 687-688.
(b) The principle of the Crimmins case, supra, that to permit conspiratorial liability where the conspirators were ignorant of the federal implications of their acts would be to enlarge their agreement beyond its terms as they understood them, has no bearing on a case like the instant one where the substantive offense, assault, is not of the type outlawed without regard to the intent of the actor to accomplish the result that is made criminal.  Nor can it be said that the acts contemplated by the conspirators are legally different from those actually performed solely because of the official identity of the victim.  Pp.  420 U. S. 688-693.
(c) Imposition of a strict ""anti-federal"" scienter requirement has no relationship to the purposes of the law of conspiracy, which are to protect society from the dangers of concerted criminal activity and to identify an agreement to engage in crime as sufficiently threatening to the social order to warrant its being the subject of criminal sanctions regardless of whether the crime agreed upon is actually committed.

420 U.S. 546

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a promoter of theatrical productions, applied to respondents, members of a municipal board charged with managing a city auditorium and a city leased theater, to present a musical production at the theater.  Upon the basis of outside reports from which it concluded that the production would not be ""in the best interest of the community,"" respondents rejected the application.  Petitioner's subsequent motion for a preliminary injunction was denied following a hearing by the District Court, which did not review the merits of respondents' decision but concluded that petitioner had not met the burden of proving irreparable injury.  Petitioner then sought a permanent injunction permitting it to use the auditorium.  Several months later, respondents filed their first responsive pleading, and the District Court, after a three-day hearing on the content of the musical, concluded that the production contained obscene conduct not entitled to First Amendment protection, and denied injunctive relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Respondents' denial of use of the municipal facilities for the production, which was based on the board members' judgment of the musical's content, constituted a prior restraint.  Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U. S. 147; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296.  Pp.  420 U. S. 552-558.

Held:  The term ""dependent child,"" as so defined, does not include unborn children, and hence States receiving federal financial aid under the AFDC program are not required to offer welfare benefits to pregnant women for their unborn children.  Pp.  420 U. S. 578-586.
(a) Under the axiom that words used in a statute are to be given their ordinary meaning absent persuasive reasons to the contrary, and reading the definition of ""dependent child"" in its statutory context, it is apparent that Congress used the word ""child"" to refer to an individual already born, with an existence separate from its mother.  Pp.  420 U. S. 580-581.
(b) This conclusion is also supported by the limited purpose of the AFDC program to substitute for the practice of removing needy children from their homes, and to free widowed and divorced mothers from the necessity of working, so that they could remain home to supervise their children, and by the fact that the Social Security Act also provides federal funding for prenatal and postnatal health services to mothers and infants, explicitly designed to reduce infant and maternal mortality, rather than for ""maternity benefits"" to support expectant mothers.

Syllabus 
Ohio's public nuisance statute provides, inter alia, that a place exhibiting obscene films is a nuisance, requires up to a year's closure of any place determined to be a nuisance, and also provides for the sale of personalty used in conducting the nuisance.  Appellant officials instituted a proceeding under the statute in state court against appellee's predecessor as operator of a theater displaying pornographic films.  Concluding that the defendant had displayed obscene movies, the trial court rendered a judgment in appellants' favor and ordered the theater closed for a year and the seizure and sale of the personal property used in its operation.  Appellee, which had taken over operation of the theater prior to the judgment, rather than appealing within the state system, immediately filed suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that appellants' use of the nuisance statute constituted a deprivation of constitutional rights under the color of state law, and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.  Without considering whether it should have stayed its hand in deference to the federalism principles set forth in Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, the District Court declared the nuisance statute unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds and enjoined the execution of the state court's judgment insofar as it closed the theater to films that had not been adjudged obscene in prior adversary hearings.
Held:
Under the circumstances, the principles of Younger are applicable even though the state proceeding is civil in nature, and the District Court should have applied the tests laid down in Younger in determining whether to proceed to the merits, and should not have entertained the action unless appellee established that early intervention was justified under the exceptions recognized in Younger, where the state proceeding is conducted with an intent to harass or in bad faith, or the challenged statute is flagrantly and patently unconstitutional.  Pp. 603-613.
(a) The component of Younger, which rests upon the threat to our federal system if federal judicial interference with state criminal 
Page 420 U. S. 593
 proceedings were permitted, applies equally to a civil proceeding such as this, which is more akin to a criminal prosecution than are most civil cases.  Pp.  420 U. S. 603-605.
(b) Apart from any right which appellee might have had to appeal to this Court if it had remained in state court, it should not, in view of the comity and federalism interests that Younger seeks to protect, be permitted the luxury of federal litigation of issues presented by ongoing state proceedings.

			"|"Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.
No. 73-296
Argued December 10, 1974
Decided March 18, 1975
420 U.S. 592

Syllabus 
Ohio's public nuisance statute provides, inter alia, that a place exhibiting obscene films is a nuisance, requires up to a year's closure of any place determined to be a nuisance, and also provides for the sale of personalty used in conducting the nuisance.  Appellant officials instituted a proceeding under the statute in state court against appellee's predecessor as operator of a theater displaying pornographic films.  Concluding that the defendant had displayed obscene movies, the trial court rendered a judgment in appellants' favor and ordered the theater closed for a year and the seizure and sale of the personal property used in its operation.  Appellee, which had taken over operation of the theater prior to the judgment, rather than appealing within the state system, immediately filed suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that appellants' use of the nuisance statute constituted a deprivation of constitutional rights under the color of state law, and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.  Without considering whether it should have stayed its hand in deference to the federalism principles set forth in Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, the District Court declared the nuisance statute unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds and enjoined the execution of the state court's judgment insofar as it closed the theater to films that had not been adjudged obscene in prior adversary hearings.
Held:
Under the circumstances, the principles of Younger are applicable even though the state proceeding is civil in nature, and the District Court should have applied the tests laid down in Younger in determining whether to proceed to the merits, and should not have entertained the action unless appellee established that early intervention was justified under the exceptions recognized in Younger, where the state proceeding is conducted with an intent to harass or in bad faith, or the challenged statute is flagrantly and patently unconstitutional.  Pp. 603-613.
(a) The component of Younger, which rests upon the threat to our federal system if federal judicial interference with state criminal 
Page 420 U. S. 593
 proceedings were permitted, applies equally to a civil proceeding such as this, which is more akin to a criminal prosecution than are most civil cases.  Pp.  420 U. S. 603-605.
(b) Apart from any right which appellee might have had to appeal to this Court if it had remained in state court, it should not, in view of the comity and federalism interests that Younger seeks to protect, be permitted the luxury of federal litigation of issues presented by ongoing state proceedings.  But even assuming, arguendo, that litigants are entitled to a federal forum for resolution of all federal issues, that entitlement is most appropriately asserted by a state litigant when he seeks to relitigate a federal issue adversely determined in completed state court proceedings.  Pp.  420 U. S. 605-607.
(c) Regardless of when the state trial court's judgment became final, Younger standards must be met to justify federal intervention in a state judicial proceeding as to which a losing litigant has not exhausted his state appellate remedies before seeking relief in federal district court.  The considerations of comity and federalism which underlie Younger permit no truncation of the exhaustion requirement merely because the losing party in the state court of general jurisdiction believes, as appellee did here, that his chances of prevailing on appeal are not auspicious.

No. 73-1541
Argued January 20, 1975
Decided March 18, 1975
420 U.S. 619

Syllabus 
The Immigration and Naturalization Service, relying on  241(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, instituted deportation proceedings against petitioners, a husband and wife who had entered this country after falsely representing themselves to be United States citizens, and thereafter had two children who were born in this country.  Section 241(a), inter alia, specifies that an alien shall be deported who (1) at the time of entry was within a class of aliens excludable by the law existing at the time of such entry, or (2) entered the United States without inspection.  Section 241(f) states:
""The provisions of this section relating to the deportation of aliens within the United States on the ground that they were excludable at the time of entry as aliens who have sought to procure, or have procured visas or other documentation, or entry into the United States by fraud or misrepresentation shall not apply to an alien otherwise admissible at the time of entry who is the spouse, parent, or a child of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.""
Petitioners were found deportable, and, on petition for review, the Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners' contention that they were saved by  241(f).
Held:  Petitioners were deportable under  241(a)(2) of the Act, which establishes as a separate ground for deportation, quite independently of whether the alien was excludable at the time of his arrival, the failure of an alien to present himself for inspection at the time he made his entry.  Aliens, like petitioners, who accomplish entry into this country by making a willfully false representation of United States citizenship are not only excludable under  212(a)(19), but have also so significantly frustrated the process for inspecting incoming aliens that they are also deportable as persons who have ""entered the United States without inspection.""

No. 74-479
Decided March 17, 1975

Syllabus 
A Texas statute provides for the automatic dismissal of an appeal by a felony defendant if he escapes from custody pending the appeal, except that the appeal will be reinstated if he voluntarily surrenders within 10 days of his escape, or, if he is under sentence of life imprisonment or death, the appellate court, in its discretion, may reinstate the appeal if he returns to custody within 30 days of his escape.
Held:  The statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(a) It is not rendered unconstitutional by its separate treatment of prisoners under sentence of life imprisonment or death.  Texas can reasonably balance its concern with deterring escapes and encouraging surrenders with its alternative interest in allowing the validity of particularly severe sentences to be tested by appellate review.
(b) Nor is the statute rendered unconstitutional by its limiting the appeal-dismissal requirement to those prisoners with appeals pending at the time of their escape.  Texas, as part of its policy to deter escapes, is free to impose more severe sanctions on those prisoners whose escape is reasonably calculated to disrupt the very appellate process that they themselves have set in motion, than it does on those who first escape, return, and then invoke the appellate process.

No. 73-1424
Argued December 9, 1974
Decided March 3, 1975
420 U.S. 377

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who had submitted a post-induction order claim for conscientious objector status to his local board, was later indicted for willful failure to report for and submit to induction into the Armed Forces.  He filed a pretrial motion, accompanied by an affidavit, to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the local board did not state adequate reasons for refusing to reopen his file, and a motion to postpone the trial
""for the reason that a Motion to Dismiss has been simultaneously filed, and the expeditious administration of justice will be served best by considering the Motion prior to trial.""
The District Court dismissed the indictment, noting that the material facts were derived from the affidavit, petitioner's Selective Service file, and a stipulation that the information petitioner had submitted to the board ""establishes a prima facie claim for conscientious objector status based upon late crystallization.""  The court held that dismissal of the indictment was appropriate because petitioner was entitled to full consideration of his claim before he was assigned to combatant training and because the local board's statement of reasons for its refusal to reopen petitioner's file was ""sufficiently ambiguous to be reasonably construed as a rejection on the merits, thereby prejudicing his right to in service review.""  The Government appealed under 18 U.S.C.  3731.  The Court of Appeals, rejecting petitioner's contention that it lacked jurisdiction under  3731 because the Double Jeopardy Clause barred further prosecution, reversed.
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar an appeal by the United States under 18 U.S.C.  3731 from a pretrial order dismissing an indictment since, in that situation, the criminal defendant has not been ""put to trial before the trier of the facts, whether the trier be a jury or a judge.""  United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S. 470,  400 U. S. 479.  Pp.  420 U. S. 383-394.
(a) In light of the language of the present version of  3731 and of its legislative history, it is clear that Congress intended to authorize an appeal to a court of appeals so long as further prosecution would not be barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.  420 U. S. 383-387. 
Page 420 U. S. 378

(b) The concept of ""attachment of jeopardy"" defines a point in criminal proceedings at which the purposes and policies of the Double Jeopardy Clause are implicated.  Jeopardy does not attach until a defendant is put to trial, which, in a jury trial, occurs when the jury is empaneled and sworn, and, in a nonjury trial, when the court begins to hear evidence.  P.  420 U. S. 388.
(c) Jeopardy had not attached in this case when the District Court dismissed the indictment, because petitioner had not then been put to trial.  There had been no waiver of a jury trial; the court had no power to determine petitioner's guilt or innocence; and petitioner's motion was premised on the belief that its consideration before trial would serve the ""expeditious administration of justice.""  P.  420 U. S. 389.
(d) The principle that jeopardy does not attach until a defendant is put to trial before the trier of facts is no mere technicality or mechanical rule, and petitioner's contention that the District Court's dismissal of the indictment was the ""functional equivalent of an acquittal on the merits"" is without substance, as the word ""acquittal"" has no significance unless jeopardy has attached.

No. 73-938
Argued November 11, 1974
Decided March 3, 1975
420 U.S. 469

Syllabus 
Appellant reporter, employed by a television station owned by appellant broadcasting company, during a news report of a rape case, broadcast the deceased rape victim's name, which he had obtained from the indictments, which were public records available for inspection.  The victim's father, appellee, brought a damages action against appellants in reliance on a Georgia statute making it a misdemeanor to broadcast a rape victim's name, claiming that his right to privacy had been invaded by the broadcast of his daughter's name.  The trial court, rejecting appellants' claims that the broadcast was privileged under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, held that the Georgia statute gave a civil remedy to those injured by its violation and granted summary judgment for appellee.  On appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court initially held that, while the trial court erred in construing the Georgia statute to extend a cause of action for invasion of privacy, the complaint stated a cause of action for common law invasion of privacy, and that the First and Fourteenth Amendments did not, as a matter of law, require judgment for appellants.  On a motion for rehearing, appellants contended that a rape victim's name was a matter of public interest, and hence could be published with impunity, but the Supreme Court denied the motion on the ground that the statute declared a state policy that a rape victim's name was not a matter of public concern, and sustained the statute as a legitimate limitation on the First Amendment's freedom of expression.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C.  1257(2).  Pp.  420 U. S. 476-487.
(a) The constitutionality of the Georgia statute was ""drawn in question"" within the meaning of  1257(2), since, when the Georgia Supreme Court relied upon it as a declaration of state public policy, the statute was drawn in question in a manner directly bearing upon the merits of the action, and the decision upholding its constitutional validity invokes this Court's appellate jurisdiction.  P.  420 U. S. 476.
(b) The Georgia Supreme Court's decision is a ""final judgment or decree"" within the meaning of  1257.  It was plainly final on the federal issue of whether the broadcasts were privileged 
Page 420 U. S. 470
 under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and is not subject to further review in the state courts; and appellants would be liable for damages if the elements of the state cause of action were proved.  Moreover, since the litigation could be terminated by this Court's decision on the merits and a failure to decide the free speech question now will leave the Georgia press operating in the shadow of civil and criminal sanctions of a rule of law and statute whose constitutionality is in serious doubt, this Court's reaching the merits comports with its past pragmatic approach in determining finality.  Pp.  420 U. S. 476-487.
2. The State may not, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, impose sanctions on the accurate publication of a rape victim's name obtained from judicial records that are maintained in connection with a public prosecution and that themselves are open to public inspection.  Here, under circumstances where appellant reporter based his televised report upon notes taken during court proceedings and obtained the rape victim's name from official court documents open to public inspection, the protection of freedom of the press provided by the First and Fourteenth Amendments bars Georgia from making appellants' broadcast the basis of civil liability in a cause of action for invasion of privacy that penalizes pure expression -- the content of a publication.  Pp.  420 U. S. 487-497.
(a) The commission of a crime, prosecutions resulting therefrom, and judicial proceedings arising from the prosecutions are events of legitimate concern to the public, and consequently fall within the press' responsibility to report the operations of government.  Pp.  420 U. S. 492-493.
(b) The interests of privacy fade when the information involved already appears on public record, especially when viewed in terms of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and in light of the public interest in a vigorous press.  Pp.  420 U. S. 493-495.

P.  420 U. S. 476.
(b) The Georgia Supreme Court's decision is a ""final judgment or decree"" within the meaning of  1257.  It was plainly final on the federal issue of whether the broadcasts were privileged 
Page 420 U. S. 470
 under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and is not subject to further review in the state courts; and appellants would be liable for damages if the elements of the state cause of action were proved.  Moreover, since the litigation could be terminated by this Court's decision on the merits and a failure to decide the free speech question now will leave the Georgia press operating in the shadow of civil and criminal sanctions of a rule of law and statute whose constitutionality is in serious doubt, this Court's reaching the merits comports with its past pragmatic approach in determining finality.  Pp.  420 U. S. 476-487.
2. The State may not, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, impose sanctions on the accurate publication of a rape victim's name obtained from judicial records that are maintained in connection with a public prosecution and that themselves are open to public inspection.  Here, under circumstances where appellant reporter based his televised report upon notes taken during court proceedings and obtained the rape victim's name from official court documents open to public inspection, the protection of freedom of the press provided by the First and Fourteenth Amendments bars Georgia from making appellants' broadcast the basis of civil liability in a cause of action for invasion of privacy that penalizes pure expression -- the content of a publication.  Pp.  420 U. S. 487-497.
(a) The commission of a crime, prosecutions resulting therefrom, and judicial proceedings arising from the prosecutions are events of legitimate concern to the public, and consequently fall within the press' responsibility to report the operations of government.  Pp.  420 U. S. 492-493.
(b) The interests of privacy fade when the information involved already appears on public record, especially when viewed in terms of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and in light of the public interest in a vigorous press.  Pp.  420 U. S. 493-495.

No. 73-1285
Argued October 16, 1974
Decided February 25, 1975
420 U.S. 308

Syllabus 
Respondent Arkansas high school students, who had been expelled from school for violating a school regulation prohibiting the use or possession of intoxicating beverages at school or school activities, brought suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioner school officials, claiming that such expulsions infringed respondents' rights to due process and seeking damages and injunctive and declaratory relief.  The District Court directed verdicts for petitioners on the ground that they were immune from damages suits absent proof of malice in the sense of ill will toward respondents.  The Court of Appeals, finding that the facts showed a violation of respondents' rights to ""substantive due process,"" since the decisions to expel respondents were made on the basis of no evidence that the regulation had been violated, reversed and remanded for appropriate injunctive relief and a new trial on the question of damages.
Held:
1. While, on the basis of common law tradition and public policy, school officials are entitled to a. qualified good faith immunity from liability for damages under  1983, they are not immune from such liability if they knew or reasonably should have known that the action they took within their sphere of official responsibility would violate the constitutional rights of the student affected, or if they took the action with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of such rights or other injury to the student.  But a compensatory award will be appropriate only if the school officials acted with such an impermissible motivation or with such disregard of the student's clearly established constitutional rights that their action cannot reasonably be characterized as being in good faith.  Pp.  420 U. S. 313-322.
2. When the regulation in question is construed, as it should have been and as the record shows it was construed by the responsible school officials, to prohibit the use and possession of beverages containing any alcohol, rather than as erroneously construed by the Court of Appeals to refer only to beverages containing in excess of a certain alcoholic content, there was no absence of evidence to prove the charge against respondents, and hence the 
Page 420 U. S. 309
 Court of Appeals' contrary judgment is improvident.  Section 1983 does not extend the right to relitigate in federal court evidentiary questions arising in school disciplinary proceedings or the proper construction of school regulations, and was not intended to be a vehicle for federal court correction of errors in the exercise of school officials' discretion that do not rise to the level of violations of specific constitutional guarantees.  Pp.  420 U. S. 322-326
3. Since the District Court did not discuss whether there was a procedural due process violation, and the Court of Appeals did not decide the issue, the Court of Appeals, rather than this Court, should consider that question in the first instance.  Pp.  420 U. S. 326-327.

No. 73-1395

Decided February 25, 1975
420 U.S. 332

Syllabus 
The jury entered a guilty verdict against respondent for a federal offense, but on one of respondent's post-verdict motions, the District Court dismissed the indictment on the ground that the delay between the offense and the indictment prejudiced respondent's right to a fair trial.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the Government's appeal on the ground that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred review of the District Court's ruling.  Because the ruling was based on facts brought out at the trial, the Court of Appeals held it was, in effect, an acquittal.
Held:  When a trial judge rules in favor of the defendant after a guilty verdict has been entered by the trier of fact, the Government may appeal from that ruling without contravening the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.  420 U. S. 335-353.
(a) That Clause protects against Government appeals only where there is a danger of subjecting the defendant to a second trial for the same offense, and hence such protection does not attach to a trial judge's post-verdict correction of an error of law which would not grant the prosecution a new trial or subject the defendant to multiple prosecutions.  Pp.  420 U. S. 339-353.
(b) Here, the District Court's ruling in respondent's favor could be disposed of on appeal without subjecting him to a second trial at the Government's behest.  If he prevails on appeal, the matter will become final, and the Government will not be permitted to bring a second prosecution for the same offense, whereas, if he loses, the case must return to the District Court for disposition of his remaining motions.

No. 73-1513
Argued December 9, 1974
Decided February 25, 1975
420 U.S. 358

Syllabus 
After respondent was ordered to report for induction, his local draft board refused to postpone his induction to allow him to claim a conscientious objector classification, and he was subsequently indicted for refusing and failing to report for induction.  Following a bench trial, the District Court ""dismissed"" the indictment and ""discharged"" respondent, holding that, although, under Ehlert v. United States, 402 U. S. 99, the board was not required to entertain conscientious objector claims arising between notice of induction and the scheduled induction date, nevertheless, since respondent failed to report at a time when Ehlert had not yet been decided and when the prevailing law of the Circuit required a local board to reopen a registrant's classification if his conscientious objector views ripened only after he had been notified to report for induction, respondent was entitled to a postponement of induction until the board considered his conscientious objector claim, and that it would be unfair to apply Ehlert to respondent.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the Government's appeal under 18 U.S.C.  3731 on the ground that it was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, concluding that, although the District Court had characterized its action as a dismissal of the indictment, respondent had, in effect, been acquitted, since the District Court had relied upon facts developed at trial and had concluded ""that the statute should not be applied to [respondent] as a matter of fact.""
Held:  Although it is not clear whether or not the District Court's judgment discharging respondent was a resolution of the factual issues against the Government, it suffices for double jeopardy purposes, and therefore for determining appealability under 18 U.S.C.  3731, that further proceedings of some sort, devoted to resolving factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged and resulting in supplemental findings, would have been required upon reversal and remand.  The trial, which could have resulted in a conviction, has long since terminated in respondent's favor, and to subject him to any

A licensed New Jersey radio station sought, but was denied, declaratory relief from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) against the application of 18 U.S.C.  1304 to the broadcast of winning numbers in a lawful state-run lottery such as New Jersey has.  Subsequent to the Court of Appeals' reversal of the FCC's denial of relief, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C.  1307(a)(2) making  1304 inapplicable to information concerning a state-authorized lottery broadcast in that State or an adjacent State having such a lottery.
Held:  In view of the enactment of  1307, the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals so that it may consider whether the case is moot as the Government contends, or is not moot because, as intervenor State of New Hampshire contends,  1307, in violation of First Amendment rights, would still not allow broadcasters in Vermont, which has no lottery, to broadcast winning numbers in the New Hampshire lottery.

 James Norman HILL v. UNITED STATES.No. 74-670. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 24, 1975
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida of shipping obscene films by common carrier in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1462 and of transporting the films in interstate commerce for the purpose of sale or distribution in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1465. 18 U.S.C. 1462 provides in pertinent part: 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the convictions, 500 F.2d 733 (1974). 
 I adhere to my dissent in United States v. Orito, 413 U.S. 139, 147, in which, speaking of 18 U.S.C. 
Page 420 U.S. 952 , 953
 1462, I expressed the view that '[w]hatever the extent of the Federal Government's power to bar the distribution of allegedly obscene material to juveniles or the offensive exposure of such material to unconsenting adults, the statute before us is clearly overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.' Id., at 147-148. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47d 419 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and since the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was rendered after Orito, reverse. 
 In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 483, 494 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). 
 Finally, it does not appear from the petition and response that the obscenity of the disputed materials was adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 141 (1974), I believe that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, petitioner must be given an opportunity to have his case decided on, and introduce evidence relevant to, the legal standard upon which his convictions have ultimately come to depend. Thus, even on its own terms, the Court should vacate the judgment below and remand for a determination whether petitioner should be afforded a new trial under local community standards.

No. 73-638
Argued November 13, 1974
Decided February 19, 1975
420 U.S. 162

Syllabus 
In 1969 petitioner was indicted, with two others, for rape of petitioner's wife.  Following severance of petitioner's case, he filed a motion for a continuance so that he might be further examined and receive psychiatric treatment, attaching thereto the report of a psychiatrist who had examined him at his counsel's request and had suggested such treatment.  The motion was denied, and the case proceeded to trial.  Petitioner's wife testified, repeating and confirming information concerning petitioner's ""strange behavior"" which was contained in the report and stating that she had changed her mind about not wanting to prosecute petitioner because he had tried to kill her on the Sunday prior to trial.  On the second day of the trial, petitioner shot himself in a suicide attempt and was hospitalized, but, despite his absence, the trial court denied a motion for a mistrial on the ground that his absence was voluntary, and the trial continued.  The jury returned a guilty verdict, and petitioner was sentenced to life imprisonment.  His motion for a new trial, asserting that the trial court had erred in proceeding with the trial when no evidence was produced that his absence was voluntary, was denied, the trial court finding again that his absence was voluntary.  The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed, sustaining that finding and also holding that the trial court's denial of the continuance motion was not an abuse of discretion.  Subsequently, petitioner's motion to vacate the conviction and sentence, alleging, inter alia, that his constitutional rights had been violated by the failure to order a pretrial psychiatric examination and by completing the trial in his absence, was denied.  The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that neither the psychiatric report attached to petitioner's motion for a continuance nor his wife's testimony raised a reasonable doubt of his fitness to proceed, that petitioner's suicide attempt did not create a reasonable doubt of his competence as a matter of law, and that he had failed to demonstrate the inadequacy of the procedures employed for protecting his rights.  The court also held that the 
Page 420 U. S. 163
 trial court's finding as to voluntary absence was not clearly erroneous.
Held:
1. The Missouri courts failed to accord proper weight to the evidence suggesting petitioner's incompetence.  When considered together with the information available prior to trial and the testimony of petitioner's wife at trial, the information concerning petitioner's suicide attempt created a sufficient doubt of his competence to stand trial to require further inquiry.  Pp.  420 U. S. 178-181.
2. Whatever the relationship between mental illness and incompetence to stand trial, in this case, the bearing of the former on the latter was sufficiently likely that, in light of the evidence of petitioner's behavior, including his suicide attempt, and there being no opportunity without his presence to evaluate that bearing in fact, the correct course was to suspend the trial until such an evaluation could be made.  Pp.  420 U. S. 181-182.
3. Assuming petitioner's right to be present at the trial was one that could be waived, there was an insufficient inquiry to afford a basis for deciding the issue of waiver.  P.  420 U. S. 182.
4. Petitioner's due process rights would not be adequately protected by remanding the case for a psychiatric examination to determine whether he was, in fact, competent to stand trial in 1969, but the State is free to retry him, assuming that, at the time of such trial, he is competent to be tried.  P.  420 U. S. 183.

Decided February 19, 1975

Syllabus 
Appellant Indians were convicted of state statutory game violations that had allegedly been committed in an area of a former Indian reservation that the tribe had ceded to the Government by an Agreement made in 1891, later ratified and implemented by Congress, one of whose provisions (Art. 6), relied upon as a defense by appellants, specified that the hunting rights of Indians in common with other persons would not be taken away or abridged.  The State Supreme Court, upholding the lower court's rejection of appellants' defense, held that Congress was not constitutionally empowered to inhibit a State's exercise of its police power by legislation ratifying a contract, to which as here the State was not a party, between the Executive Branch and an Indian tribe; that, in any event, the federal implementing statutes (which did not mention Art. 6) did not render the State's game laws inapplicable to the Indian beneficiaries of the Agreement; and that Art. 6 was merely a promise by the United States that, so long as it retained any ceded land and allowed others to hunt thereon, Indians also would be permitted to hunt there.
Held:
1. The ratifying legislation must be construed in the light of the longstanding canon of construction that the wording of treaties and statutes ratifying agreements with the Indians is not to be construed to their prejudice.  Pp.  420 U. S. 199-200.
2. The Supremacy Clause precludes application of the state game laws here, since the federal statutes ratifying the 1891 Agreement between the Executive Branch and the Indian tribe are ""Laws of the United States . . . made in Pursuance"" of the Constitution, and therefore, like all ""Treaties made,"" are made binding upon affected States.  Nor does the fact that Congress had abolished the contract-by-treaty method of dealing with Indian tribes affect Congress' power to legislate on the problems of Indians, including legislation ratifying contracts between the Executive Branch with Indian tribes to which affected States were not parties.  Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665; Perrin v. United States, 232 U. S. 478.  Pp.  420 U. S. 200-204.
3. In ratifying the Agreement pursuant to its plenary constitutional powers, Congress manifested no purpose of subjecting the 
Page 420 U. S. 195
 rights conferred upon the Indians to state regulation, and, in view of the unqualified ratification of Art. 6, any state qualification of those rights is precluded by the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.  420 U. S. 204-205.
4. Although the State is free to regulate non-Indian hunting rights in the ceded area, the ratifying legislation must be construed to exempt the Indians from like state control or Congress would have preserved nothing that the Indians would not have had without the legislation, which would have been ""an impotent outcome to [the] negotiations,"" United States v.

Appellant Indians were convicted of state statutory game violations that had allegedly been committed in an area of a former Indian reservation that the tribe had ceded to the Government by an Agreement made in 1891, later ratified and implemented by Congress, one of whose provisions (Art. 6), relied upon as a defense by appellants, specified that the hunting rights of Indians in common with other persons would not be taken away or abridged.  The State Supreme Court, upholding the lower court's rejection of appellants' defense, held that Congress was not constitutionally empowered to inhibit a State's exercise of its police power by legislation ratifying a contract, to which as here the State was not a party, between the Executive Branch and an Indian tribe; that, in any event, the federal implementing statutes (which did not mention Art. 6) did not render the State's game laws inapplicable to the Indian beneficiaries of the Agreement; and that Art. 6 was merely a promise by the United States that, so long as it retained any ceded land and allowed others to hunt thereon, Indians also would be permitted to hunt there.
Held:
1. The ratifying legislation must be construed in the light of the longstanding canon of construction that the wording of treaties and statutes ratifying agreements with the Indians is not to be construed to their prejudice.  Pp.  420 U. S. 199-200.
2. The Supremacy Clause precludes application of the state game laws here, since the federal statutes ratifying the 1891 Agreement between the Executive Branch and the Indian tribe are ""Laws of the United States . . . made in Pursuance"" of the Constitution, and therefore, like all ""Treaties made,"" are made binding upon affected States.  Nor does the fact that Congress had abolished the contract-by-treaty method of dealing with Indian tribes affect Congress' power to legislate on the problems of Indians, including legislation ratifying contracts between the Executive Branch with Indian tribes to which affected States were not parties.  Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665; Perrin v. United States, 232 U. S. 478.  Pp.  420 U. S. 200-204.
3. In ratifying the Agreement pursuant to its plenary constitutional powers, Congress manifested no purpose of subjecting the 
Page 420 U. S. 195
 rights conferred upon the Indians to state regulation, and, in view of the unqualified ratification of Art. 6, any state qualification of those rights is precluded by the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.  420 U. S. 204-205.
4. Although the State is free to regulate non-Indian hunting rights in the ceded area, the ratifying legislation must be construed to exempt the Indians from like state control or Congress would have preserved nothing that the Indians would not have had without the legislation, which would have been ""an impotent outcome to [the] negotiations,"" United States v.

No. 73-1290
Argued November 13, 1974
Decided February 19, 1975
420 U.S. 223

Syllabus 
The civil penalty provisions of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  21(l), and the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.  45(l), similarly provide in part that each separate violation of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) cease and desist order issued under the respective Acts shall be a separate offense, except that, in the case of a violation through ""continuing failure or neglect to obey"" a final order of the FTC each day of continuance of such failure shall be deemed a separate offense.  After the FTC had charged the Continental Baking Co. (Continental), a bakery which later merged with respondent, with violations of  7 of the Clayton Act and  5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by various acquisitions of other bakeries, the parties agreed to a consent order prohibiting Continental from ""acquiring"" other bakeries.   Thereafter, alleging that Continental had acquired assets in other companies in violation of this order, the Government brought suit for civil penalties to be imposed daily from the date of the contract of acquisition to the date of filing of the complaint.  The District Court, while holding that the order had been violated, declined to order daily penalties, finding that the order proscribed only the initial act of acquisition, that the violations did not constitute ""a continuing failure or neglect to obey"" within the meaning of  21(l) and 45(l), and that, therefore, only a single penalty might be imposed. The Court of Appeals affirmed that holding.
Held:  ""Acquiring"" as used in the consent order means both the initial transaction and the maintaining of the rights obtained without resale, and therefore violation of the order is a ""continuing failure or neglect to obey"" an FTC order within the meaning of  21(l) and 45(l) and thus subject to daily penalties thereunder.  Pp.  420 U. S. 230-243.
(a) The purpose of the ""continuing failure or neglect to obey"" provisions of  21(l) and 45(l), as shown by their legislative 
Page 420 U. S. 224
 histories, to assure that the penalty provisions would meaningfully deter violations whose effect is continuing and whose detrimental effect could be terminated or minimized by the violator at some time after initiating the violation, would be undermined and the penalty would be converted into a minor tax if violation of an order prohibiting ""acquiring"" assets were treated as a single violation.  Pp.  420 U. S. 230-233.
(b) Since the consent order ""as it is written"" supports an interpretation that the act of acquisition continues until the assets are disgorged (see (c), infra), there is no need to determine whether  21(l) and 45(l) would permit the imposition of daily penalties even if the consent order must be read, as respondent claims, to proscribe only the initial act of acquisition.  Pp.  420 U. S. 233-238.
(c) Under the consent order ""as it is written,"" ""acquiring"" must mean both the act of first obtaining assets and the retention and use of those assets, since to conclude otherwise would be to ignore the flexibility of the English language, as well as the circumstances surrounding the order and the context in which the parties were operating.  That conclusion is supported by both the ""appendix"" to the parties' agreement of which the order is a part and the complaint, as proper aids for construing the order which is to be construed basically as a contract.  But even without the aid of these documents, ""acquiring,"" as used in an antitrust decree or order, continues until the assets are disgorged, since ""acquiring"" and related words, as used in the antitrust context, encompass the continuing act of obtaining certain rights and treating them as one's own.

Syllabus 
During the course of an investigatory interview at which an employee of respondent was being interrogated by a representative of respondent about reported thefts at respondent's store, the employee asked for but was denied the presence at the interview of her union representative.  The union thereupon filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  In accordance with its construction in Mobil Oil Corp., 196 N.L.R.B. 1052, enforcement denied, 482 F.2d 842, and Quality Mfg. Co., 195 N.L.R.B.197, enforcement denied, 481 F.2d 1018, rev'd, post, p.  420 U. S. 276, the NLRB held that the employer had committed an unfair labor practice and issue a cease and desist order which, however, the Court of Appeals subsequently refused to enforce, concluding that an employee has no ""need"" for union assistance at an investigatory interview.
Held:  The employer violated  8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act because it interfered with, restrained, and coerced the individual right of an employee, protected by  7, ""to engage in . . . concerted activities for . . . mutual aid or protection . . . ,"" when it denied the employee's request for the presence of her union representative at the investigatory interview that the employee reasonably believed would result in disciplinary action.  Pp.  420 U. S. 256-268.
(a) The NLRB's holding is a permissible construction of ""concerted activities for . . . mutual aid or protection"" by the agency charged by Congress with enforcement of the Act.  Pp.  420 U. S. 260-264.
(b) The NLRB has the ""special function of applying the general provisions of the Act to the complexities of industrial life,"" NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., 373 U. S. 221,  373 U.

Section 207 of Title II authorizes the appropriation of ""not to exceed"" specified amounts for each of three fiscal years, and  205(a) provides that the ""[s]ums authorized to be appropriated pursuant to [ 207] . . . shall be allotted by the Administrator"" of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The President directed the Administrator not to allot among the States  207's maximum amounts, but instead to allot no more than $2 billion of the $5 billion authorized for fiscal year 1973, and no more than $3 billion of the $6 billion authorized for fiscal year 1974, and the Administrator complied with this directive.  Thereupon, respondent city of New York brought this class action seeking a declaratory judgment that the Administrator was obligated to allot to the States the full amounts authorized by  207 for fiscal years 1973 and 1974, and an order directing him to make those allotments.  The District Court granted the respondents' motion for summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that ""the Act requires the Administrator to allot the full sums authorized to be appropriated in  207.""
Held:  The 1972 Amendments do not permit the Administrator to allot to the States under  205(a) less than the entire amounts authorized to be appropriated by  207.  Pp.  420 U. S. 42-49.
(a) That  205(a) directs the allotment of only ""sums"" -- not ""all sums,"" as originally provided when the legislation went to Conference -- and that the Conference Committee added the ""not to exceed"" qualifying language to  207, which authorized the appropriation of specific amounts for the three fiscal years, show no congressional intention of giving the Executive discretionary control 
Page 420 U. S. 36
 over the rate of allotments under the Title II programs.  The ""not to exceed"" qualifying language in  207 has meaning of its own, apart from  205(a), and reflects the realistic possibility that approved applications for grants from funds already allotted would not total the maximum amount authorized to be appropriated.  And the word ""sums"" has no different meaning, and can be ascribed no different function in the context of  20(a), than would the words ""all sums.""  Pp.  420 U. S. 42-46.
(b) The modified position taken by petitioner in this Court that  205(a) and 207 merely give the Administrator discretion as to the timing of expenditures, not as to the ultimate amounts to be allotted and obligated, as was urged in the lower courts, does not alter this Court's conclusion.  The Administrator's power to allot under  205(a) extends only to ""sums"" authorized to be appropriated under  207, since, even assuming some sort of power in the Executive to control outlays under the Act, the legislative history indicates that the power to control was to be exercised at the obligation phase, rather than the allotment stage, of the process.

420 U.S. 50

Syllabus 
A union, after investigating complaints that the company with which it had a collective bargaining agreement was racially discriminating against employees, invoked the contract grievance procedure by demanding that the joint union-management Adjustment Board be convened ""to hear the entire case.""  Certain employees who felt that procedure inadequate refused to participate, and, against the union's advice, picketed the company's store.  The company, after warning the employees, fired them on their resumption of picketing, whereupon a local civil rights association to which the fired employees belonged (hereinafter respondent) filed charges against the company with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) under  8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with an employee's right under  7 to engage in concerted action ""for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.""  The NLRB found that the employees were discharged for attempting to bargain with the company over the terms and conditions of employment as they affected racial minorities, and held that they could not circumvent their elected representative's efforts to engage in such bargaining.  On respondent's petition for review, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, concluding that concerted activity against racial discrimination enjoys a ""unique status"" under the NLRA and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; that the NLRB
""should inquire, in cases such as this, whether the union was actually remedying the discrimination to the fullest extent possible, by the most expedient and efficacious means,""
and that, ""[w]here the union's efforts fall short of this high standard, the minority group's concerted activities cannot lose [their] section 7 protection.""

Appellee justices of the peace and constables, threatened with removal before their elected terms expired, brought this action in federal court, challenging on due process and equal protection grounds the constitutionality of a Texas statute providing, inter alia, that, when the boundaries of certain precincts are changed and more than the allotted number of justices of the peace or constables reside within the changed district, the offices shall become vacant and shall be filled as are other vacancies.  Under Texas constitutional provisions, (a) a justice of the peace or constable ""shall hold his office for four years and until his successor shall be elected and qualified,"" and (b) such officers may be removed by state district court judges for various causes after notice and jury trial.  A three-judge Federal District Court held that the statute violated equal protection by removing some county officers but not others, and ordered appellee officials' reinstatement.
Held:  In view of the unsettled state of Texas law as to whether the state constitutional provisions ensure justices of the peace and constables tenure until their elected terms expire even when the challenged statute would require their ouster, the District Court should have abstained from deciding the federal constitutional issue, it being far from certain under various Texas precedents that appellee officeholders must lose their jobs or that the reinstatement relief ordered by the District Court is available.

Syllabus 
The Military Selective Service Act provides that a veteran who applies for reemployment if still qualified shall be restored by his employer to his former position ""or a position of like seniority, status, and pay.""  The Act further assures that benefits and advancements that would necessarily have accrued by virtue of continued employment will not be denied the veteran merely because of his absence in the military service.  These provisions, however, do not apply to claimed benefits requiring more than simple continued status as an employee.
Held:
1. In this case, the Act's provisions do not entitle petitioner employee to full vacation benefits for the years he was in military service, under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement that conditioned the award of such benefits on the receipt of earnings during 25 weeks of the previous year, since the vacation scheme was intended as a form of short-term deferred compensation for work performed, and not as accruing automatically as a function of continued association with the company.  Pp.  420 U. S. 96-101.
2. Whether petitioner might be entitled to some pro rata vacation benefits under a contract provision applicable to those employees who were unable to accumulate the minimum of 25 weeks' employment because of layoffs should be determined by the District Court on remand.  Pp.  420 U. S. 101-102.

In respondent's action to compel petitioner Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to allot among the States the full sums authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 1973 and 1974 by  207 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 for municipal waste treatment plants, the District Court held that the Administrator had abused his discretion by allotting only 45% of the authorized sums.  The Court of Appeals, on the premise that there was discretion to control or delay allotments, concluded that further proceedings were essential to determine whether that discretion had been abused.
Held:  Since the holding in Train v. City of New York, ante, p.  420 U. S. 35, that the Administrator has no authority to allot less than the full amounts authorized to be appropriated under  207, is at odds with the Court of Appeals' premise, that court's judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with Train v.

In respondent's action to compel petitioner Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to allot among the States the full sums authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 1973 and 1974 by  207 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 for municipal waste treatment plants, the District Court held that the Administrator had abused his discretion by allotting only 45% of the authorized sums.  The Court of Appeals, on the premise that there was discretion to control or delay allotments, concluded that further proceedings were essential to determine whether that discretion had been abused.
Held:  Since the holding in Train v. City of New York, ante, p.  420 U. S. 35, that the Administrator has no authority to allot less than the full amounts authorized to be appropriated under  207, is at odds with the Court of Appeals' premise, that court's judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with Train v. City of New York.
489 F.2d 492, vacated and remanded.

Decided January 27, 1975
420 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
This case involves the issue of the constitutionality of a federal court-ordered reapportionment of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly.  Following protracted state and federal litigation challenging various apportionment plans, statutes, and state constitutional provisions, including a federal action in which a three-judge District Court in 1965 approved a reapportionment plan that included five multi-member senatorial districts, appellants brought the present federal action against appellee, the Secretary of State, alleging that substantial population shifts had occurred and that the 1965 plan no longer met equal protection requirements, and requesting the court to order apportionment based on the 1970 census figures, to provide for single member districts, to declare the 1965 plan invalid, and to restrain appellee from administering the election laws under that plan.  A three-judge District Court, holding that such plan failed to meet constitutional standards, approved another plan that called for five multi-member senatorial districts and that contained a 20% population variance between the largest and smallest senatorial districts.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction of the appeal under 28 U.S.C.  1253.  Although the challenged reapportionment plan was court-ordered, 
Page 420 U. S. 2
 its enforcement is based on the State's Constitution and statutes, its effectuation directly depends on the state election law machinery, and the plan itself is a court-imposed replacement of state constitutional provisions and reapportionment statutes.  Pp.  420 U. S. 13-14.
2. Absent persuasive justification, a federal district court, in ordering state legislative reapportionment, should refrain from imposing multi-member districts upon a State.  Here, the District Court has failed to articulate a significant state interest supporting its departure from the general preference for single member districts in court-ordered reapportionment plans that this Court recognized in Connor v. Johnson, 402 U. S. 690, and unless the District Court can articulate such a ""singular combination of unique factors"" as was found to exist in Mahan v. Howell, 410 U. S. 315,  410 U. S. 333, or unless the 1975 Legislative Assembly appropriately acts, the court should proceed expeditiously to reinstate single member senatorial districts.  Pp.  420 U. S. 121.
3. A population deviation of such magnitude in a court-ordered reapportionment plan as the 20% variance involved here is constitutionally impermissible absent significant state policies or other acceptable considerations requiring its adoption.  The burden is on the District Court to elucidate the reasons necessitating any departure from approximate population equality and to articulate clearly the relationship between the variance and the state policy furthered.  Here, the District Court's allowance of the 20% variance is not justified, as the court claimed, by the absence of ""electorally victimized minorities,"" by the sparseness of North Dakota's population, by the division of the State caused by the Missouri River, or by the asserted state policy of observing geographical boundaries and existing political subdivisions, especially when it appears that other, less statistically offensive, reapportionment plans already devised are feasible.

 See 420 U.S. 984. 
 The judgment is affirmed.
 Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 I dissent from the Court's summary affirmance of judgment of the District Court for the District of Columbia, which denied Virginia's request to be exempted from coverage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Although the court agreed that Virginia had made a prima facie case for entitlement to relief, it nevertheless concluded that the continued use until 1965 of a minimal literacy requirement had the effect of discriminating on the basis 
Page 420 U.S. 901 , 902
 of race. The question of whether Virginia should remain subject to the extensive consequences of continuing federal oversight under the Act, in a case where the conceded prima facie showing suggests the absence of any demonstrable need for such oversight, warrants plenary consideration by this Court. This is especially true in view of the dubious relevance of the grounds relied upon by the District Court to overcome Virginia's prima facie showing.* The fact that under the language of the present Act Virginia may well escape from federal tutelage sometime this year makes the case of less importance to her than it otherwise might be. But while this would be a sound reason for denying certiorari, it does not justify the Court's summary affirmance of the judgment of the District Court. 
[Footnote *] The only 'literacy test' employed in Virginia was a requirement that a person wishing to register to vote 'make application to register in his own handwriting, without aid, suggestion, or memorandum,' using for this purpose a standard, relatively simple form. No literacy test of any kind has been required since 1965. The District Court believed that it could infer that the Virginia requirement had a discriminatory effect in 1963-1965 because the registration rate of Negro citizens was 10% lower than the rate among whites. But there was a differential of 11.5% in the Nation as a whole in 1966, the year following passage of the Act. U. S. Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports, Series P-20, No. 208 ( 1970). 
 The residual impact of segregated schools, also relied upon by the Court of Appeals, is a condition not peculiar to Virginia or even to the limited number of States covered by the Act. If the consequences of segregated education were the justification for the Act, it would have embraced all of the substantial number of States in various sections of the country which have segregated schools. See, e. g., Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717 (1974); Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado, 413 U.S. 189 (1973).

Appellant's one Washington-based employee, an engineer, whose office was in his home but who took no fastener orders from Boeing, primarily consulted with Boeing regarding its anticipated fastener needs and followed up any difficulties in the use of fasteners after delivery.

Syllabus 
Appellee Ohio public high school students, who had been suspended from school for misconduct for up to 10 days without a hearing, brought a class action against appellant school officials seeking a declaration that the Ohio statute permitting such suspensions was unconstitutional and an order enjoining the officials to remove the references to the suspensions from the students' records.  A three-judge District Court declared that appellees were denied due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because they were ""suspended without hearing prior to suspension or within a reasonable time thereafter,"" and that the statute and implementing regulations were unconstitutional, and granted the requested injunction.
Held:
1. Students facing temporary suspension from a public school have property and liberty interests that qualify for protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  419 U. S. 572-576.
(a) Having chosen to extend the right to an education to people of appellees' class generally, Ohio may not withdraw that right on grounds of misconduct absent fundamentally fair procedures to determine whether the misconduct has occurred, and must recognize a student's legitimate entitlement to a public education as a property interest that is protected by the Due Process Clause, and that may not be taken away for misconduct without observing minimum procedures required by that Clause.  Pp.  419 U. S. 573-574.
(b) Since misconduct charges, if sustained and recorded, could seriously damage the students' reputation, as well as interfere with later educational and employment opportunities, the State's claimed right to determine unilaterally and without process whether that misconduct has occurred immediately collides with the Due Process Clause's prohibition against arbitrary deprivation of liberty.  Pp.  419 U. S. 574-575.
(c) A 10-day suspension from school is not de minimis and may not be imposed in complete disregard of the Due Process 
Page 419 U. S. 566
 Clause.  Neither the property interest in educational benefits temporarily denied nor the liberty interest in reputation is so insubstantial that suspensions may constitutionally be imposed by any procedure the school chooses, no matter how arbitrary.  Pp.  419 U. S. 575-576.
2. Due process requires, in connection with a suspension of 10 days or less, that the student be given oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his version.  Generally, notice and hearing should precede the student's removal from school, since the hearing may almost immediately follow the misconduct, but if prior notice and hearing are not feasible, as where the student's presence endangers persons or property or threatens disruption of the academic process, thus justifying immediate removal from school, the necessary notice and hearing should follow as soon as practicable.  Pp.  419 U. S. 577-584.

(a) Having chosen to extend the right to an education to people of appellees' class generally, Ohio may not withdraw that right on grounds of misconduct absent fundamentally fair procedures to determine whether the misconduct has occurred, and must recognize a student's legitimate entitlement to a public education as a property interest that is protected by the Due Process Clause, and that may not be taken away for misconduct without observing minimum procedures required by that Clause.  Pp.  419 U. S. 573-574.
(b) Since misconduct charges, if sustained and recorded, could seriously damage the students' reputation, as well as interfere with later educational and employment opportunities, the State's claimed right to determine unilaterally and without process whether that misconduct has occurred immediately collides with the Due Process Clause's prohibition against arbitrary deprivation of liberty.  Pp.  419 U. S. 574-575.
(c) A 10-day suspension from school is not de minimis and may not be imposed in complete disregard of the Due Process 
Page 419 U. S. 566
 Clause.  Neither the property interest in educational benefits temporarily denied nor the liberty interest in reputation is so insubstantial that suspensions may constitutionally be imposed by any procedure the school chooses, no matter how arbitrary.  Pp.  419 U. S. 575-576.
2. Due process requires, in connection with a suspension of 10 days or less, that the student be given oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his version.  Generally, notice and hearing should precede the student's removal from school, since the hearing may almost immediately follow the misconduct, but if prior notice and hearing are not feasible, as where the student's presence endangers persons or property or threatens disruption of the academic process, thus justifying immediate removal from school, the necessary notice and hearing should follow as soon as practicable.  Pp.  419 U. S. 577-584.

No. 73-5744
Argued October 16, 1974
Decided January 21, 1975
419 U.S. 522

Syllabus 
Appellant, a male, was convicted of a crime by a petit jury selected from a venire on which there were no women and which was selected pursuant to a system resulting from Louisiana constitutional and statutory requirements that a woman should not be selected for jury service unless she had previously filed a written declaration of her desire to be subject to jury service.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, having rejected appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of the state jury selection scheme.
Held:
1. Appellant had standing to make his constitutional claim, there being no rule that such a claim may be asserted only by defendants who are members of the group excluded from jury service.  Peters v. Kiff, 407 U. S. 493.  P.  419 U. S. 526.
2. The requirement that a petit jury be selected from a representative cross-section of the community, which is fundamental to the jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, is violated by the systematic exclusion of women from jury panels, which in the judicial district here involved amounted to 53% of the citizens eligible for jury service.  Pp.  419 U. S. 526-533.
3. No adequate justification was shown here for the challenged jury selection provisions and the right to a jury selected from a fair cross-section of the community cannot be overcome on merely rational grounds.  Pp.  419 U. S. 533-535.
4. It can no longer be held that women as a class may be excluded from jury service or given automatic exemptions based solely on sex if the consequence is that criminal jury venires are almost all male, and contrary implications of prior cases, e.g., Hoyt v.

Argued November 12, 1974
Decided January 21, 1975
419 U.S. 544

Syllabus 
Respondents, who operated a bar on non-Indian land on the outskirts of an unincorporated village within the Wind River Reservation and who had been denied a tribal liquor license by the Wind River Tribes pursuant to their option under 18 U.S.C.  1161 to regulate the introduction of liquor into Indian country, were convicted at a nonjury trial of introducing spirituous beverages into Indian country in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1154.  Section 1154(c) defines the term ""Indian country"" as not including fee-patented lands in non-Indian communities, but does not define the term ""non-Indian communities.""  In entering the judgment of conviction, the District Court, on the basis of testimony about the bar's location and the racial composition of residents of the surrounding area as being largely Indian families, concluded that the bar was located within ""Indian country"" and held that federal authority could reach non-Indians located on privately held land within a reservation's boundaries.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the prosecution had not met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the bar was not excluded from Indian country by the  1154(c) exception for ""fee-patented lands in non-Indian communities""; that  1154 was fatally defective because of the indefiniteness and vagueness of the term ""non-Indian community""; and that, insofar as  1161 authorized Indian tribes to control the introduction of alcoholic beverages onto non-Indian land, it was an invalid congressional attempt to delegate authority.
Held:
1. Section 1154 is not unconstitutionally vague. Given the nature of the bar's location and the surrounding population, the statute was sufficient to advise respondents that their bar was not excepted from tribal regulation by virtue of being located in a non-Indian community.  Pp.  419 U. S. 550-553
2. Congress has the authority under Art. I,  8, of the Constitution to regulate the distribution of alcoholic beverages by establishments such as respondents' bar.  Such authority is adequate, 
Page 419 U. S. 545
 even though the land was held in fee by non-Indians and the persons regulated were non-Indians.  Pp.  419 U. S. 553-556.
3. Congress could validly delegate such authority to a reservation's tribal council.  The independent authority of Indian tribes over matters that affect the internal and .social relations of tribal life is sufficient to protect Congress' decision to vest in tribal councils this portion of its own authority ""to regulate Commerce . . . with the Indian tribes"" under Art.

Syllabus 
A lawyer is not subject to the penalty of contempt for advising his client, during the trial of a civil case, to refuse on Fifth Amendment grounds to produce material demanded by a subpoena duces tecum when the lawyer believes in good faith that the material may tend to incriminate his client.  To hold otherwise would deny the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination the means of its own implementation, since, when a witness is so advised the advice becomes an integral part of the protection accorded the witness by the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  419 U. S. 458-470.
(a) That the client in any ensuing criminal action could move to suppress the subpoenaed material after it had been produced does not afford adequate protection, because, without something more, ""he would be compelled to surrender the very protection which the privilege is designed to guarantee,"" Hoffman v.

(b) Here, where petitioner lawyer admitted that the allegedly obscene magazines subpoenaed for the purpose of enjoining their distribution were ""of the same character"" as magazines for distribution of which his client had recently been convicted (so that petitioner had, at the very least, a reasonable basis for assuming that a risk of further criminal prosecution existed), and where there was no assurance under state law that the material could be suppressed and no avenue other than assertion of the privilege, with the risk of contempt, that would have assured appellate review in advance of surrendering the magazines, the advice was given in good faith.

No. 73-1106
Argued November 11, 1974
Decided January 15, 1975
419 U.S. 477

Syllabus 
Petitioners (Cousins delegates) challenged before the National Democratic Party Credentials Committee, as violative of Party guidelines, the seating of respondents (Wigoda delegates) who had been elected from Chicago districts at the March, 1972, Illinois primary election as delegates to the 1972 Democratic National Convention to be held in July, 1972.  The Committee decided that the Cousins delegates should be seated instead of the Wigoda delegates, who, on July 8, 1972, two days before the Convention opened, were granted an injunction by the Illinois Circuit Court enjoining the Cousins group from acting as delegates at the Convention.  The Cousins delegates nevertheless were seated by the Convention and functioned a. delegates.  The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed, holding that ""[t]he right to sit as a delegate representing Illinois at the national nominating convention is governed exclusively by the Illinois Election Code,"" and that the ""interest of the State in protecting the effective right to participate in primaries is superior to whatever other interests the party itself might wish to protect.""  In another suit, which had been brought in the District Court for the District of Columbia, one Keane, a Wigoda delegate, challenged the constitutionality of the Party guidelines allegedly violated in the Wigoda delegates' selection.  The District Court sustained one of the challenged guidelines and dismissed Keane's suit while denying the Party's counterclaim for an injunction against the Wigoda delegates' proceeding with the state court action.  The Court of Appeals, on July 5, affirmed the dismissal but granted the counterclaim.  This Court, in a per curiam opinion, stayed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and later, having granted Keane's petition for certiorari, vacated the Court of Appeals' judgment and remanded for a determination of mootness.  The Court of Appeals thereafter held the case moot insofar as it involved the seating of delegates at the completed Convention and affirmed dismissal of the Keane suit.  In addition to their arguments on the merits, petitioners contend that language in the 
Page 419 U. S. 478
 per curiam established the Convention's right to decide the Chicago credentials contest, and that this Court's action in staying, but not vacating, the Court of Appeals' judgment left that judgment as a res judicata bar to the injunction.
Held:
1. This Court's per curiam unqualifiedly suspended the operative effects of the Court of Appeals judgment without resolving the merits of the controversy; and petitioners' res judicata contention is not open for consideration, not having been pleaded and proved in the Circuit Court as required by state law.  Pp.  419 U. S. 485-487.
2. In the selection of candidates for national office, a National Party Convention serves the pervasive national interest, which is paramount to any interest of a State in protecting the integrity of its electoral process, and the Circuit Court erred in issuing an injunction that abridged the associational rights of petitioners and their Party and the Party's right to determine the composition of its National Convention in accordance with Party standards.

In addition to their arguments on the merits, petitioners contend that language in the 
Page 419 U. S. 478
 per curiam established the Convention's right to decide the Chicago credentials contest, and that this Court's action in staying, but not vacating, the Court of Appeals' judgment left that judgment as a res judicata bar to the injunction.
Held:
1. This Court's per curiam unqualifiedly suspended the operative effects of the Court of Appeals judgment without resolving the merits of the controversy; and petitioners' res judicata contention is not open for consideration, not having been pleaded and proved in the Circuit Court as required by state law.  Pp.  419 U. S. 485-487.
2. In the selection of candidates for national office, a National Party Convention serves the pervasive national interest, which is paramount to any interest of a State in protecting the integrity of its electoral process, and the Circuit Court erred in issuing an injunction that abridged the associational rights of petitioners and their Party and the Party's right to determine the composition of its National Convention in accordance with Party standards.

Syllabus 
Appellee, a naval officer with more than nine years of active service, who failed for a second time to be selected for promotion and thus under 10 U.S.C.  6382(a) was subject to mandatory discharge, brought this action claiming that application of that statute to him, when compared to 10 U.S.C.  6401 (under which, had he been a woman officer, he would have been entitled to 13 years of commissioned service before a mandatory discharge for want of promotion), was an unconstitutional discrimination based on sex in violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.  A three-judge District Court, relying on Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, concluded that the challenged mandatory discharge provisions are supported solely by considerations of fiscal and administrative policy, and upheld appellee's claim.
Held:  The challenged legislative classification is completely rational, and does not violate the Due Process Clause.  Pp.  419 U. S. 505-510.
(a) The different treatment of men and women naval officers under  6382 and 6401 results not from mere administrative or fiscal convenience, but from the fact that female line officers, because of restrictions on their participating in combat and most sea duty, do not have opportunities for professional service equal to those of male line officers, and Congress could rationally conclude that a longer period of tenure for women officers comported with the goal of providing women officers with ""fair and equitable career advancement programs.""  Frontiero v. Richardson, supra; Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71, distinguished.  Pp.  419 U. S. 505-508.
(b) In naval corps where male and female officers are similarly situated Congress, made no tenure distinctions, thus underscoring the rationality of the legislative classification.  P.  419 U. S. 509.
(c) The challenged statutes further a flow of promotions commensurate with the Navy's current needs, and serve to motivate qualified commissioned officers so to conduct themselves that they may realistically anticipate higher command levels.  P.  419 U. S. 510.

Syllabus 
Appellant's petition for divorce was dismissed by an Iowa trial court for lack of jurisdiction because she failed to meet the Iowa statutory requirement that a petitioner in a divorce action be a resident of the State for one year preceding the filing of the petition.  Appellant then brought a class action under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23 in the Federal District Court against appellees State and state trial judge, asserting that Iowa's durational residency requirement violated the Federal Constitution on equal protection and due process grounds and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.  After certifying that appellant represented the class of persons residing in Iowa for less than a year who desired to initiate divorce actions, the three-judge District Court upheld the constitutionality of the statute.
Held:
1. The fact that appellant had long since satisfied the durational residency requirement by the time the case reached this Court does not moot the case, since the controversy remains very much alive for the class of unnamed persons whom she represents and who, upon certification of the class action, acquired a legal status separate from her asserted interest.  Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330.  Pp.  419 U. S. 397-403.
(a) Where, as here, the issue sought to be litigated escapes full appellate review at the behest of any single challenger, the case does not inexorably become moot by the intervening resolution of the controversy as to the named plaintiffs.  P.  419 U. S. 401.
(b) At the time the class action was certified, appellant demonstrated a ""real and immediate"" threat of injury and belonged to the class that she sought to represent.  Pp.  419 U. S. 402-403.
(c) The test of Rule 23(a) that the named representative in a class action ""fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class,"" is met here, where it is unlikely that segments of the class represented would have interests conflicting with appellant's, and the interests of the class have been competently urged at each level of the proceeding.  P.  419 U. S. 403. 
Page 419 U. S. 394

2. The Iowa durational residency requirement for divorce is not unconstitutional.  Pp.  419 U. S. 404-410.
(a) Such requirement is not unconstitutional on the alleged ground that it establishes two classes of persons and discriminates against those who have recently exercised their right to travel to Iowa.  Appellant was not irretrievably foreclosed from obtaining some part of what she sought, and such requirement may reasonably be justified on grounds of the State's interest in requiring those seeking a divorce from its courts to be genuinely attached to the State, as well as of the State's desire to insulate its divorce decrees from the likelihood of successful collateral attack.  Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618; Dunn, supra; Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U. S. 250, distinguished.  Pp.  419 U. S. 406-409.
(b) Nor does the durational residency requirement violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment on the asserted ground that it denies a litigant the opportunity to make an individualized showing of bona fide residence, and thus bars access to the divorce courts.  Even if appellant could make an individualized showing of physical presence plus the intent to remain, she would not be entitled to a divorce, for Iowa requires not merely ""domicile"" in that sense, but residence in the State for one year.  See Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U. S. 441,  412 U. S. 452.  Moreover, no total deprivation of access to divorce courts, but only delay in such access, is involved here.  Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.

Syllabus 
Petitioner employer filed an unfair labor practice charge against respondent union under  8(b)(4)(D) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to induce employees to strike to force an employer to assign particular work to employees in a particular labor organization.  Section 10(k) of the NLRA provides that, whenever a  8(b)(4)(D) unfair labor practice charge is filed, the National Labor Relations Board shall hear and determine the dispute out of which such unfair labor practice arose, unless, within 10 days after notice that such charge has been filed, the parties submit evidence that they have adjusted the dispute, in which case or upon compliance with the Board's decision, such charge shall be dismissed.  Pursuant to  10(k), a hearing was held before a hearing officer, and subsequently the Board rendered a decision adverse to respondent, which then indicated it would not comply therewith.  The Board's General Counsel thereafter issued a complaint on the unfair labor practice charge, and at a trial examiner's hearing, at which the General Counsel was represented by the same attorney who had been the hearing officer in the  10(k) proceeding, the trial examiner concluded that respondent had violated  8(b)(4)(D), and the Board issued a cease and desist order.  The Court of Appeals, on respondent's petition to set aside the order, agreed that respondent had violated  8(b)(4)(D), but refused to enforce the order, on the ground that, because the  10(k) hearing officer had participated in both the  10(k) and the  8(b)(4)(D) proceedings, the Board had not complied with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5

 Archie James SHUMAR v. UNITED STATES.No. 74-1414. 
 Claude W. CLARKE v. UNITED STATES.No. 74-6518. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 6, 1975
 Leave to File Petition for Rehearing Denied Jan. 12, 1976. 
 See 423 U.S. 1067. 
 On petition for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Rule 26(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure authorizes the courts of appeals to permit motions to be made out-of-time only 'for good cause shown.' The question in these cases is whether the Government showed good cause for its untimely motion to extend time to petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals. 
 Petitioners Shumar and Clarke were convicted in the District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on one count of conspiring to violate 18 U.S.C. 1955 and on two counts of actually violating 1955. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the convictions on the substantive counts, but reversed on the conspiracy count, holding that Wharton's Rule barred conviction for both violating and conspiring to violate 1955. The Court of Appeals entered judgment on July 31, 1974, and denied petitioners' petition for rehearing on September 30. The Government moved on October 4 to stay the mandate pending our decision in Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770 ( 1975), a case which presented the identical Wharton's Rule question decided by the Court of Appeals. The Government did not seek an extension of time to petition for 
Page 423 U.S. 879 , 880
 rehearing until October 24, when it sought an extension pending our decision in Iannelli. The Court of Appeals granted the extension. Several months later, we held in Iannelli that Wharton's Rule does not bar conviction for both violation of 1955 and conspiracy to do so. The Government then petitioned for rehearing. The Court of Appeals granted rehearing and modified its decision in light of Iannelli, affirming petitioners' convictions on the conspiracy count. 
 Absent an extension of time or a new entry of judgment, time to petition for rehearing expired on August 14, 14 days after entry of judgment by the Court of Appeals on July 31. Fed.Rule App.Proc. 40(a). The Government contends, however, that its time to petition for rehearing began to run from the denial of petitioners' petition for rehearing on September 30. But even accepting this doubtful contention,1 time to petition for rehearing expired on October 14, and, as the Government concedes, its motion to extend time on October 24 was untimely. 
 The Government argues instead that it satisfied the good cause requirement of Rule 26(b) by pointing out that we had granted certiorari in Iannelli on the same Wharton's Rule question decided by the Court of Appeals. Admittedly, our grant of certiorari in Iannelli would have been good cause to grant a timely motion to extend time to petition for rehearing, but that is not the question presented by these cases. 
 The Government's motion to extend time was itself untimely. Its burden was to show good cause, not only for the extension, but also for its untimely motion [423 U.S. 879 , 881]

 Claude W. CLARKE v. UNITED STATES.No. 74-6518. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 6, 1975
 Leave to File Petition for Rehearing Denied Jan. 12, 1976. 
 See 423 U.S. 1067. 
 On petition for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Rule 26(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure authorizes the courts of appeals to permit motions to be made out-of-time only 'for good cause shown.' The question in these cases is whether the Government showed good cause for its untimely motion to extend time to petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals. 
 Petitioners Shumar and Clarke were convicted in the District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on one count of conspiring to violate 18 U.S.C. 1955 and on two counts of actually violating 1955. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the convictions on the substantive counts, but reversed on the conspiracy count, holding that Wharton's Rule barred conviction for both violating and conspiring to violate 1955. The Court of Appeals entered judgment on July 31, 1974, and denied petitioners' petition for rehearing on September 30. The Government moved on October 4 to stay the mandate pending our decision in Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770 ( 1975), a case which presented the identical Wharton's Rule question decided by the Court of Appeals. The Government did not seek an extension of time to petition for 
Page 423 U.S. 879 , 880
 rehearing until October 24, when it sought an extension pending our decision in Iannelli. The Court of Appeals granted the extension. Several months later, we held in Iannelli that Wharton's Rule does not bar conviction for both violation of 1955 and conspiracy to do so. The Government then petitioned for rehearing. The Court of Appeals granted rehearing and modified its decision in light of Iannelli, affirming petitioners' convictions on the conspiracy count. 
 Absent an extension of time or a new entry of judgment, time to petition for rehearing expired on August 14, 14 days after entry of judgment by the Court of Appeals on July 31. Fed.Rule App.Proc. 40(a). The Government contends, however, that its time to petition for rehearing began to run from the denial of petitioners' petition for rehearing on September 30. But even accepting this doubtful contention,1 time to petition for rehearing expired on October 14, and, as the Government concedes, its motion to extend time on October 24 was untimely. 
 The Government argues instead that it satisfied the good cause requirement of Rule 26(b) by pointing out that we had granted certiorari in Iannelli on the same Wharton's Rule question decided by the Court of Appeals. Admittedly, our grant of certiorari in Iannelli would have been good cause to grant a timely motion to extend time to petition for rehearing, but that is not the question presented by these cases.

 Irving BIRNBAUM v. UNITED STATES.No. 74-6411. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 11, 1975
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 The 'minimization' provision of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 provides that every order and extension thereof authorizing electronic surveillance shall 'contain a provision that the authorization to intercept shall be . . . conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter . . ..' 18 U.S.C. 2518(5) ( 1970). This 'minimization' provision, together with other safeguards, e. g. , 2518(3)(a), (b), (c), (d), constitutes the congressionally designed bulwark against conduct of authorized electronic surveillance in a manner that violates the constitutional guidelines announced in Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967), and Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). Congress has explicitly informed us that the 'minimization' and companion safeguards were designed to assure that 'the order will link up specific person, specific offense, and specific place. Together [the provisions of Title III] are intended to meet the test of the Constitution that electronic surveillance techniques be used only under the most precise and discriminate circumstances, which fully comply with the requirement of particularity.' S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 102 (1968), U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, p. 2112. These cases afford the Court a particularly appropriate vehicle for fashioning principles to guide authorizing judges in administering the 'minimization' 
Page 423 U.S. 952 , 953
 provision-guidance which is absolutely essential if the congressional mandate to confine execution of authorized surveillances within constitutional and statutory bounds is to be carried out. 
 The urgent need for guidance from this Court clearly emerges from the record in these cases. For the record fairly bristles with apparent instances of indiscriminate and unwarranted invasions of privacy of nontargets of the surveillance. 
 Two telephones at the home of a friend of petitioner Bynum were the subjects of surveillance orders. The orders authorized federal narcotics agents to overhear and electronically record incoming and outgoing conversations of 'Bynum and others as yet unknown.' The order as extended for one telephone was for a period of 34 days, and the order for the second telephone covered the last 20 days of that period. The judge who authorized the surveillance left administration of the 'minimization' provision to the monitoring agents, being of the view that the facts of the massive narcotics conspiracy under investigation precluded per se surveillance guidelines promulgated by him and that minimization would be better achieved by allowing the agents discretion in determining what should be intercepted. But the monitoring agents were not informed by the judge or their superiors of this decision. Rather, Mr. Updike, the Assistant United States Attorney who supervised the surveillance, testified that the agents were instructed to intercept all but privileged attorney-client communications:

 Supreme Court of the United States

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were convicted in the United States District Court for the Central District of California of mailing allegedly obscene matter in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1461, and of transporting such matter in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1462. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 431 F.2d 655 (1970). We granted the petition for certiorari and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973). 413 U.S. 913 (1973). On remand, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit again affirmed the convictions. 
 Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, being of the view that any state or federal ban on, or regu-

 For the reasons stated in my dissent from the remand of this case, 413 U.S. 914, and because the present judgment was rendered after Miller, I would grant the petition and reverse.* 
[Footnote *] Although four of us would grant and reverse, the Justices who join this opinion do not insist that the case be decided on the merits.
