||"Craig v. Boren
No. 75-628
Argued October 5, 1976
Decided December 20, 1976
429 U.S. 190

Syllabus 
Appellant Craig, a male then between 18 and 21 years old, and appellant Whitener, a licensed vendor of 3.2% beer, brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that an Oklahoma statutory scheme prohibiting the sale of ""nonintoxicating"" 3.2% beer to males under the age of 21 and to females under the age of 18 constituted a gender-based discrimination that denied to males 18-20 years of age the equal protection of the laws.  Recognizing that Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71, and later cases establish that classification by gender must substantially further important governmental objectives, a three-judge District Court held that appellees' statistical evidence regarding young males' drunk-driving arrests and traffic injuries demonstrated that the gender-based discrimination was substantially related to the achievement of traffic safety on Oklahoma roads.
Held:
1. Since only declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the gender-based differential was sought, the controversy has been mooted as to Craig, who became 21 after this Court had noted probable jurisdiction.  See, e.g., DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312.  P.  429 U. S. 192.
2. Whitener has standing to make the equal protection challenge.  Pp.  429 U. S. 192-197.
(a) No prudential objective thought to be served by limitations of jus tertii standing can be furthered here, where the lower court already has entertained the constitutional challenge and the parties have sought resolution of the constitutional issue.  Pp.  429 U. S. 193-194.
(b) Whitener in any event independently has established third-party standing.  She suffers ""injury in fact,"" since the challenged statutory provisions are addressed to vendors like her, who either must obey the statutory provisions and incur economic injury or disobey the statute and suffer sanctions.  In such circumstances, vendors may resist efforts to restrict their operations by advocating the rights of third parties seeking access to their market.  See, e.g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438.  Pp.  429 U. S. 194-197.
3. Oklahoma's gender-based differential constitutes an invidious discrimination against males 18-20 years of age in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Appellees' statistics (the most relevant of which 
Page 429 U. S. 191
 show only that .18% of females and 2% of males in the 18-20-year-old age group were arrested for driving while under the influence of liquor) do not warrant the conclusion that sex represents an accurate proxy for the regulation of drinking and driving.  Pp.  429 U. S. 199-204.
4. The operation of the Twenty-first Amendment does not alter the application of equal protection standards that otherwise govern this case.  The Court has never recognized that application of that Amendment can defeat an otherwise established claim under the Equal Protection Clause, the principles of which cannot be rendered inapplicable here by reliance upon statistically measured but loose-fitting generalities concerning the drinking tendencies of aggregate groups.  Pp.  429 U. S. 204-210.

Syllabus 
Two days after her discharge by respondent company, petitioner Guy, a Negro, caused a grievance alleging ""unfair action"" to be filed on her behalf pursuant to procedures in a collective bargaining agreement between her union and respondent.  On February 10, 1972, 84 days after the company under those procedures had denied the grievance, but 108 days after the discharge, petitioner Guy filed a charge of racial discrimination relating to her discharge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which, in November, 1973, concluded that race had not figured in the discharge.  Petitioner Guy then brought this suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the District Court, which thereafter dismissed the suit on the ground that Guy had not filed her charge with the EEOC within 90 days ""after the alleged unlawful practice occurred,"" as required by $ 706(d) (a period later extended to 180 days when, effective March 24, 1972, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 amended the limitations provision), and that Guy's resort to the contractual grievance procedure did not extend the time in which to file the Title VII charge.  Section 14 of the 1972 amendments provides that the amendments
""shall be applicable with respect to charges pending with the Commission on the date of the enactment of this Act and all charges filed thereafter.""
The Court of Appeals, which affirmed, also concluded that the extension of 180 days could not ""revive"" a claim that was ""barred and extinguished"" before the extension's effective date.
Held:
1. Petitioners' contention, raised explicitly for the first time in this Court, that the date of the conclusion of the grievance procedures, not the date of the discharge, was the ""final"" date of ""the alleged unlawful practice,"" is without merit as being contrary to the understanding of the parties themselves in the courts below.  Pp.  429 U. S. 234-235. 
Page 429 U. S. 230

2. The existence and utilization of grievance procedures does not toll the running of the limitations period that would otherwise begin on the date of the firing, Title VII remedies being independent of other preexisting remedies available to an aggrieved employee.  Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36; Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U. S. 454.  Pp.  429 U. S. 236-240.
(a) Petitioner Guy, by pursuing the grievance procedures, was asserting an independent claim based on a contract right, and was in no way thereby prevented from filing her charge with the EEOC within 90 days of her discharge.  Application of equitable principles to toll the 90-day period pending completion of the grievance procedures is therefore inappropriate here.  Burnett v. New York Central R. Co., 380 U. S. 424, distinguished.  Pp.  429 U. S. 237-238.
(b) Congress clearly intended to retain other remedies ""against private employment discrimination separate from and independent of the more elaborate and time-consuming procedures of Title VII,"" Johnson v. Railway Express Co., supra at  421 U. S. 465-466.  Pp.  429 U. S. 239-240.
3. The 1972 amendments and their legislative history demonstrate that Congress intended to apply the 180-day period to a charge such as that filed by Guy where the charge was filed with the EEOC before these amendments became effective, was still pending when the amendments became effective, and alleged a discriminatory occurrence within 180 days on the enactment of the amendment.  Pp.  429 U. S. 241-243.
4. Lifting the bar of a statute of limitations so as to restore a remedy lost through mere lapse of time is not per se unconstitutional.  Cf. Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson, 325 U. S. 304,  325 U. S. 311-312.  Pp.  429 U. S. 243-244.

The statutory classification of  202(b)(1) of the Social Security Act whereby a married woman under 62 whose husband retires or becomes disabled is granted monthly benefits under the Act if she has a minor or other dependent child in her care, but a divorced woman under 62 whose ex-husband retires or becomes disabled does not receive such benefits, held not to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

No. 75-946
Argued October 12, 1976
Decided December 8, 1976
429 U.S. 167

Syllabus 
During the course of a regularly scheduled, open meeting of appellant Board of Education, public discussion turned to currently pending labor negotiations between the board and the teachers' union.  One speaker was a nonunion teacher who, over union objection, addressed one topic of the pending negotiations, namely, the union's demand for a ""fair share"" clause, which would require all teachers (whether union members or not) to pay union dues.  He read a petition signed by the teachers in the district, calling for postponement of the issue until it could be given closer examination by an impartial committee.  Subsequently, after a collective bargaining agreement had been signed containing all the union's demands except the ""fair share"" clause, the union filed a complaint with the appellee Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC), claiming that the board had committed a prohibited labor practice in violation of Wisconsin law by permitting the nonunion teacher to speak at its public meeting because that constituted negotiations by the board with a member of the bargaining unit other than the exclusive collective bargaining representative.  The WERC found the board guilty of the prohibited labor practice and ordered that it immediately cease and desist from permitting any employees but union officials to appear and speak at board meetings on matters subject to collective bargaining.  The WERC was upheld on appeal, the Wisconsin Supreme Court concluding that the nonunion teacher's statement before the board constituted ""negotiation"" with the board, and holding that the abridgment of speech by the WERC was justified in order ""to avoid the dangers attendant upon relative chaos in labor-management relations.""
Held:
1. The circumstances do not present such danger to labor-management relations as to justify curtailing speech in the manner ordered by the WERC.  Pp.  429 U. S. 173-176.
(a) Where it does not appear that the nonunion teacher sought to bargain or offered to enter into any bargain with the board or that he was authorized by any other teachers to enter into any agreement on their behalf, there is no basis for concluding that his terse statement during the public meeting constituted negotiation with the board.  Although his views were not consistent with those of the union, communicating 
Page 429 U. S. 168
 such views to the employer could not change the fact that the union alone was authorized to negotiate and enter into a contract with the board.  P.  429 U. S. 174.
(b) Moreover, since the board meeting was open to the public, the nonunion teacher addressed the board not merely as one of its employees but also as a concerned citizen, seeking to express his views on an important decision of his government.  Where the board has so opened a forum for direct citizen involvement, it may not exclude teachers who make up the overwhelming proportion of school employees and are most concerned with the proceedings.  Whatever its duties as an employer, when the board sits in public meetings to conduct public business and hear the views of citizens, under the First Amendment, it may not be required to discriminate between speakers on the basis of their employment, or the content of their speech.  Pp.  429 U. S. 174-176.
2. The WERC's order, being designed to govern speech and conduct in the future, and not merely to punish past conduct, is an improper prior restraint on teachers' expressions to the board on matters involving the operation of schools.  Pp.  429 U. S. 176-177.

Argued January 19-20, 1976
Reargued October 13, 1976
Decided December 7, 1976*
429 U.S. 125

Syllabus 
This class action was brought by respondents challenging as violative of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the disability plan of petitioner.  Under the plan, petitioner provides nonoccupational sickness and accident benefits to all its employees, but disabilities arising from pregnancy are excluded.  The District Court following trial held that the exclusion constituted sex discrimination in violation of Title VII.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the intervening decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484, wherein this Court held that disparity in treatment between pregnancy-related and other disabilities was not sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, was not applicable in a Title VII context.  Under  703(a)(1) of that Title it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to compensation because of that individual's sex.
Held:  Petitioner's disability benefits plan does not violate Title VII because of its failure to cover pregnancy-related disabilities.  Pp.  429 U. S. 133-146.
(a) The plan, which is strikingly similar to the one in Geduldig,

No. 74-1589
Argued January 19-20, 1976
Reargued October 13, 1976
Decided December 7, 1976*
429 U.S. 125

Syllabus 
This class action was brought by respondents challenging as violative of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the disability plan of petitioner.  Under the plan, petitioner provides nonoccupational sickness and accident benefits to all its employees, but disabilities arising from pregnancy are excluded.  The District Court following trial held that the exclusion constituted sex discrimination in violation of Title VII.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the intervening decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484, wherein this Court held that disparity in treatment between pregnancy-related and other disabilities was not sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, was not applicable in a Title VII context.  Under  703(a)(1) of that Title it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to compensation because of that individual's sex.
Held:  Petitioner's disability benefits plan does not violate Title VII because of its failure to cover pregnancy-related disabilities.  Pp.  429 U. S. 133-146.
(a) The plan, which is strikingly similar to the one in Geduldig,
""does not exclude anyone from benefit eligibility because of gender, but merely removes one physical condition -- pregnancy -- from the list of compensable disabilities. . . .  Absent a showing that distinctions involving pregnancy are mere pretexts designed to effect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex or the other, lawmakers are constitutionally free to include or exclude pregnancy from the coverage of legislation such as this on any reasonable basis, just as with respect to any other physical condition.""

No. 75-929

429 U.S. 97

Syllabus 
Respondent state inmate brought this civil rights action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioners, the state corrections department medical director (Gray) and two correctional officials, claiming that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment for inadequate treatment of a back injury assertedly sustained while he was engaged in prison work.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The Court of Appeals held that the alleged insufficiency of the medical treatment required reinstatement of the complaint.
Held:  Deliberate indifference by prison personnel to a prisoner's serious illness or injury constitutes cruel and unusual punishment contravening the Eighth Amendment.  Here, however, respondent's claims against Gray do not suggest such indifference, the allegations revealing that Gray and other medical personnel saw respondent on 17 occasions during a 3-month span and treated his injury and other problems.  The failure to perform an X-ray or to use additional diagnostic techniques does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, but is, at most, medical malpractice cognizable in the state courts.  The question whether respondent has stated a constitutional claim against the other petitioners, the Director of the Department of Corrections and the warden of the prison, was not separately evaluated by the Court of Appeals, and should be considered on remand.  Pp.  429 U. S. 101-108.

Petitioner federal parolee, imprisoned for federal crimes committed while on parole and clearly constituting parole violations, held not to be constitutionally entitled to an immediate parole revocation hearing, where a parole violator warrant was issued and lodged with the institution of his confinement as a ""detainer,"" but was not executed.  Pp.  429 U. S. 85-89.
(a) Petitioner's present confinement and consequent liberty loss do not derive from the parole violator warrant, but from his convictions for the crimes committed while on parole.  Execution of a parole violator warrant and custody thereunder are the operative events triggering any loss of liberty attendant upon parole revocation.  Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471,  408 U. S. 488.  Pp.  429 U. S. 85-87.
(b) Deferral of the parole revocation decision until execution of the parole violator warrant does not deprive petitioner of the opportunity to serve any sentence imposed for parole violation concurrently with the sentences imposed for the crimes committed while on parole, since, if the Parole Commission chooses to revoke parole, it has the power to grant, retroactively, the equivalent of concurrent sentences, and to provide for unconditional or conditional release upon completion of the subsequent sentences.  Pp.  429 U. S. 87-88.
(c) Issuance of the parole violator warrant, without more, did not diminish petitioner's opportunity for parole on his intervening sentences, since the same Commission that will consider such parole will decide whether to revoke parole granted under the earlier conviction, and since the statutory hearing to which petitioner will be entitled upon his application for parole will give him the same opportunity to persuade the Commission that he should be released from custody as would an immediate hearing on the parole violator warrant.  P.  429 U. S. 88.
(d) As a practical matter, in cases such as this, in which the parolee has been convicted of an offense plainly constituting a parole violation, a decision to revoke parole would often be foreordained, so that, given the predictive nature of the parole revocation hearing, it is appropriate that such hearing be held at the time at which prediction as to the parolee's ability to live in society without committing antisocial

Syllabus 
Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, provides that a ""net operating loss"" experienced by a corporate taxpayer in one year may be carried as a deduction to the preceding three years and the succeeding five years to offset taxable income of those years.  The entire loss must be carried back to the earliest possible year and any of the loss not ""absorbed"" by that first year may then be carried to succeeding years, since
""[t]he portion of such loss which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years shall be the excess, if any, of the amount of such loss over the sum of the taxable income for each of the prior taxable years to which such loss may be carried.""
 172(b)(2).  Proceeding under that provision respondent taxpayer carried back a net operating loss of some $42,000, which it had sustained in 1968, to 1966, in which year respondent had ordinary income of about $7,000 and a capital gain of about $167,000.  After applying the ""alternative tax"" method of  1201(a), which permits low capital gains taxation, respondent maintained that after subtracting the $42,000 loss deduction from the 1966 ordinary income, the negative balance of about $35,000 was still available to offset income for 1967, respondent taking the position that its 1968 loss had been ""absorbed"" in 1966 only to the extent of the $7,000 ordinary income.  Respondent accordingly made a refund claim for the taxable year 1967, which the Commissioner disallowed but which the District Court upheld.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  In carrying back a net operating loss under  172 to a year in which the taxpayer had both ordinary income and capital gains and employed the alternative tax computation method of  1201(a), the loss deduction available for carryover to a succeeding year is the amount by which the loss exceeds the taxpayer's ""taxable income"" -- ordinary income plus capital gains for the prior year -- the loss carryover being ""absorbed"" by capital gains as well as ordinary income.

Pp.  429 U. S. 36-41.
(b) The legislative history of the loss offset provisions does not support respondent's contention that they were designed to eliminate all consequences of the timing of the loss.  Pp.  429 U. S. 426.
(c) Had Congress intended substantially to eliminate timing accidents from the calculation of income on an average basis, it would not have tolerated the departure from that purpose in  172(c), under which a taxpayer cannot have a loss for a particular year unless its deductions exceed its ordinary income and its capital gains.

Reargued October 5, 1976
Decided November 2, 1976
429 U.S. 32

Syllabus 
Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, provides that a ""net operating loss"" experienced by a corporate taxpayer in one year may be carried as a deduction to the preceding three years and the succeeding five years to offset taxable income of those years.  The entire loss must be carried back to the earliest possible year and any of the loss not ""absorbed"" by that first year may then be carried to succeeding years, since
""[t]he portion of such loss which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years shall be the excess, if any, of the amount of such loss over the sum of the taxable income for each of the prior taxable years to which such loss may be carried.""
 172(b)(2).  Proceeding under that provision respondent taxpayer carried back a net operating loss of some $42,000, which it had sustained in 1968, to 1966, in which year respondent had ordinary income of about $7,000 and a capital gain of about $167,000.  After applying the ""alternative tax"" method of  1201(a), which permits low capital gains taxation, respondent maintained that after subtracting the $42,000 loss deduction from the 1966 ordinary income, the negative balance of about $35,000 was still available to offset income for 1967, respondent taking the position that its 1968 loss had been ""absorbed"" in 1966 only to the extent of the $7,000 ordinary income.  Respondent accordingly made a refund claim for the taxable year 1967, which the Commissioner disallowed but which the District Court upheld.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  In carrying back a net operating loss under  172 to a year in which the taxpayer had both ordinary income and capital gains and employed the alternative tax computation method of  1201(a), the loss deduction available for carryover to a succeeding year is the amount by which the loss exceeds the taxpayer's ""taxable income"" -- ordinary income plus capital gains for the prior year -- the loss carryover being ""absorbed"" by capital gains as well as ordinary income.

 UNITED STATESv. Estelle JACOBS, aka ""Mrs. Kramer""No. 75-1883 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 1, 1976
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 Summary Disposition of the Court. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is vacated and the case is remanded to that court for further consideration in light of United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564 (1976).
 Mr. Justice STEVENS, concurring. 
 My original reaction to the proposal to vacate and remand in the light of United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564d 212 (1976), was exactly that expressed by Mr. Justice MARSHALL in dissent. For as a Circuit Judge I had the experience of trying to decipher similar delphic orders, and I agree completely that a constitutional holding is not controlling on a question involving nothing more than an exercise of an appellate court's supervisory power. Nevertheless, there is an omission in the Court of Appeals opinion which makes it appropriate for that court to re-examine its holding. 
 As the concurring opinions by Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Stewart in Mandujano demonstrate, the fact that the prosecutor may have erred in failing to give a 
Page 429 U.S. 909 , 910
 grand jury witness adequate warnings does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that the witness cannot be prosecuted for perjury. Cf. United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 82. The Court of Appeals opinion seems to assume that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. Since I think it would be appropriate for that court to address that precise point in the first instance, I acquiesce in the remand. 

 Mr. Justice STEWART, dissenting. 
 As Mr. Justice MARSHALL explains, this order of the Court is little short of irrational. While our heavy caseload necessarily leads us sometimes to dispose of cases summarily, it must never lead us to dispose of any case irresponsibly. Yet I fear precisely that has happened here. 
 The Court of Appeals to which this case is now remanded cannot but find this order totally incomprehensible. 

 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice STEWART join, dissenting. 
 There is no reason to expect the Court of Appeals to reach a different result in light of our decision in United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564 (1976). Our holding that respondent would not have had a constitutional right to have her testimony suppressed simply has no bearing on a lower court [429 U.S. 909 , 911]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 1, 1976
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the District Court of Appeal of Florida for the Third District. 
 Summary Disposition of the Court. 
 The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the District Court of Appeal of Florida is vacated, and the case is remanded for a determination of whether petitioner has waived the protection of the venue provision of the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. 94. See National Bank of North America v. Associates of Obstetrics and Female Surgery, Inc., 425 U.S. 460 (1976).
 Mr. Justice STEVENS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 The Court's action in this case is not supported by the precedent on which it relies. In National Bank of North America, the Utah Supreme Court erroneously held that 94 was ""permissive and not exclusive."" We remanded because that court had not reached the waiver issue in its previous opinion. In the present case, however, the state courts have given no explanation for their rejection of petitioner's venue claim. A remand in this case can only rest on the unwarranted assumption that the state courts relied on some ground other than waiver. The pres- 
Page 429 U.S. 911 , 912
 umption, however, should be that the state courts recognized and relied on the strongest argument in favor of their holding, in this case, the waiver argument.* 
 I am therefore unable to concur in the Court's summary action in this case. Since this case is unworthy of plenary review, I would deny certiorari. 
[Footnote *] The waiver argument is based on the conduct of petitioner's alleged corporate alter ego. Apparently the Court finds some possible merit in this argument; otherwise, it would simply reject the argument summarily as it did the ""local action"" argument in National Bank of America, supra, at n.*.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, Eastern Division. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted after a jury trial in Sullivan County Criminal Court, Tenn., of exhibiting two allegedly obscene motion pictures in violation of Tenn.Code Ann. s 39-3013(A), which provides in pertinent part 
 As used in that section, 
Page 429 U.S. 930 , 931
 scription, or mechanical, chemical or electrical reproduction, or any other article, equipment, machine or material that is obscene as defined by 39-3010 39-3022.
 The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and the Tennessee Supreme Court, which in an earlier case held the motion pictures involved to be obscene within the meaning of the statute, Taylor v. State ex rel. Kirkpatrick, 529 S.W.2d 692, 699 (Tenn.1975), refused review. 
 It is my view that ""at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents. Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, Tenn.Code Ann. 39-3013(A) is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, vacate the judgment, and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with my dissent in Paris Adult Theatre I, supra.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal of California for the Second Appellate District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 At the beginning of his trial for manslaughter, petitioner, who acted as his own counsel throughout the trial, asked the judge to provide him with civilian clothes. He represented that he had been in jail for five years and had no suitable civilian clothing. Although there is some suggestion that petitioner might have been able to obtain suitable clothes, 1 the trial court did not reject his request for that reason. [Footnote 2] Rather, it held that petitioner's appearance before the jury in clothes labeled ""L. A. CO. JAIL"" was ""proper."" Petitioner objected. 
Page 429 U.S. 900 , 901
 Only five months ago, this Court unanimously recognized that an accused's appearance before a jury in identifiable jail clothes could deprive him of his fundamental right to a fair trial by undermining the presumption of innocence: 
 Under Estelle, the trial court's ruling that clean jail clothes are "" proper"" attire for trial is clearly wrong. 
 That petitioner asked that the State supply him with clothes, rather than that he be allowed to wear clothes of his own, cannot justify the trial court's ruling.

 Paul HEBERT v. SOUTHERN PACIFIC TRANSPORTATION CONo. 75-6839 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 18, 1976
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Hebert instituted this suit under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 51-60. He allegedly sustained disabling injuries in a fall while at work in 1969. Respondent-defendant Southern Pacific Transportation Company, a common carrier by rail, filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that Hebert was not ""employed by such carrier,"" within the liability-imposing language of 51. The District Court, relying specifically on Kelley v. Southern Pacific Co., 486 F.2d 1084 (C.A. [Footnote 9] 1973), and despite the then outstanding grant of certiorari in that case by this Court, 416 U.S. 935 (1974), sustained the motion. It held that at the time of his injury petitioner Hebert was an employee of Southern Pacific Transport Company, a trucking company wholly owned by the respondent railroad, and was not an employee of the respondent, and that Kelley ""appears to be on all fours"" with Hebert's case. Kelley, however, as decided by the Ninth Circuit and as so relied on by the District Court, did not survive unscathed. This Court thereafter vacated the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and sent the case back ""with instructions to remand the case to the District Court for further findings in accordance with this opinion."" 419 U.S. 318, 332d 498 (1974). Although I dissented from the Court's opinion, id., at 341, as did Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Brennan, id., at 333, 1 the Court in Kelley appears to have set forth standards for the trier of fact to apply in determining whether an injured plaintiff, although technically employed by the carrier's wholly owned trucking company, is nevertheless en- 
Page 429 U.S. 904 , 905
 titled to coverage under the FELA. The Court concluded that the District Court in Kelley's case had applied erroneous standards and that the Court of Appeals should have remanded and not reversed. As I read the Court's opinion, it determined that what was dispositive in a situation of this kind was whether a master-servant relationship existed between the defendant railroad and the claimant, id., at 323, and that the resolution of this issue ultimately depended on the employer's control or right to control the conduct of the claimant-employee. The Court, in elaboration, set forth three methods by which employment for FELA purposes could be established. [Footnote 2] 

 The interesting and significant fact is that upon the remand to the District Court claimant Kelley prevailed under the subservant theory approved by this Court. The trial court found that the unloading operation "" was the responsibility"" of the railroad; that the carrier ""supplied the necessary ramps and working area""; that its employees were required to check safety aspects daily and ""to make all necessary repairs""; that the railroad ""had the right to control the physical conduct of the (trucking company's) employees""; that the trucking company ""was acting as the servant"" of the carrier ""when performing the unloading operations""; and that Kelley ""was in fact a subservant of a servant"" of the carrier when he was injured.

 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.

 Appellant was convicted by a jury of murder in the second degree in Delaware Superior Court. The Delaware Supreme Court reversed and remanded with instructions to strike the murder conviction but enter a judgment of conviction for manslaughter; the constitutionality of a Delaware statute that requires a criminal defendant raising an insanity defense to prove mental illness or defect by a preponderance of the evidence was sustained.

 ""(2) If the defendant prevails in establishing the affirmative defense provided in subsection (1) of this section, the trier of facts shall return a verdict of 'not guilty by reason of insanity.'
 The Delaware Supreme Court held that Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790 (1952), required its conclusion, because Leland ""has not been overruled by Mullaney (v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 95 S. Ct. 1881 (1975)), . . . either expressly or implicitly."" 351 A.2d 561, 562 (1976).

 Mr. Justice STEVENS would note probable jurisdiction and set the case for oral argument. 
 In Mullaney, we considered a Maine rule that placed upon a criminal defendant charged with murder the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he had acted in the heat of passion on sudden impulse in order to reduce the homicide to manslaughter. We concluded that this rule did not comport with the due process requirement, as defined in In re Winship, 397 U.S., at 361-364, that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged. In reaching this conclusion, my Brother Powell's opinion for the Court pointed out that, in 1895, this Court considered and conclusively rejected the practice, accepted in several jurisdictions, of requiring the defendant to negate the presumption that he acted with malice aforethought. 421 U.S., at 694-696.

We concluded that this rule did not comport with the due process requirement, as defined in In re Winship, 397 U.S., at 361-364, that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged. In reaching this conclusion, my Brother Powell's opinion for the Court pointed out that, in 1895, this Court considered and conclusively rejected the practice, accepted in several jurisdictions, of requiring the defendant to negate the presumption that he acted with malice aforethought. 421 U.S., at 694-696.

Syllabus 
After respondent's car had been impounded for multiple parking violations the police, following standard procedures, inventoried the contents of the car.  In doing so, they discovered marihuana in the glove compartment, for the possession of which respondent was subsequently arrested.  His motion to suppress the evidence yielded by the warrantless inventory search was denied, and respondent was thereafter convicted.  The State Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the evidence had been obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.
Held:  The police procedures followed in this case did not involve an ""unreasonable"" search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The expectation of privacy in one's automobile is significantly less than that relating to one's home or office, Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U. S. 583,  417 U. S. 590.  When vehicles are impounded, police routinely follow caretaking procedures by securing and inventorying the cars' contents.  These procedures have been widely sustained as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

Syllabus 
After petitioner employer's ""office clerical-technical"" (O&T) employees went on strike and picketed petitioner's plants during negotiations for a collective bargaining contract, petitioner's production and maintenance (P&M) employees, who are represented by respondent unions, honored the O&T picket lines and stopped work in support of the sister unions representing the O&T employees.  Petitioner then filed suit against respondents under  301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, claiming that the P&M employees' work stoppage violated the no-strike clause in the collective bargaining contracts between petitioner and respondents, and that the question whether such work stoppage violated the no-strike clause was arbitrable under the grievance and arbitration provisions of the contracts for settling disputes over the interpretation and application of each contract.  Petitioner sought damages, injunctive relief, and an order directing respondents to arbitrate such question.  The District Court, concluding that the work stoppage was the result of P&M employees' engaging in a sympathy strike in support of the striking O&T employees, held that it was prohibited from issuing an injunction by  4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act because the P&M employees' strike was not an ""arbitrable grievance,"" and hence was not within the ""narrow"" exception to the Norris-LaGuardia Act established in Boys Markets v. Retail Clerks Union, 398 U. S. 235.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court was not empowered to enjoin the P&M employees' sympathy strike pending the arbitrator's decision as to whether the strike was forbidden by the no-strike clause.  Pp.  428 U. S. 404-413.
(a) The strike was not over any dispute between respondents and petitioner that was even remotely subject to the arbitration provisions of the collective bargaining contract, but was a sympathy strike in support of sister unions negotiating with petitioner with neither the purpose nor the effect of denying or evading 
Page 428 U. S. 398
 an obligation to arbitrate or of depriving petitioner of its bargain.  Boys Markets, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  428 U. S. 405-408.
(b) Nor was an injunction authorized solely because it was alleged that the sympathy strike violated the' no-strike clause, since, although a  301 suit may be brought against strikes that breach collective bargaining contracts, this does not mean that federal courts may enjoin contract violations despite the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  P.  428 U. S. 409.
(c) While the issue whether the sympathy strike violated the no-strike clause was arbitrable, it does not follow that the District Court was empowered not only to order arbitration but also to enjoin the strike pending the arbitrator's decision, since, if an injunction could so issue, a court could enjoin any alleged breach of a collective bargaining contract pending the exhaustion of the applicable grievance and arbitration procedures, thus cutting deeply into the Norris-LaGuardia Act's policy and making courts potential participants in a wide range of arbitrable disputes under many collective bargaining contracts, not just for the purpose of enforcing promises to arbitrate, but for the purpose of preliminarily dealing with the factual and interpretative issues that are subjects for the arbitrator.

No. 74-958
Argued December 8, 1975
Decided July 6, 1976
428 U.S. 433

Syllabus 
Based upon the affidavit of a police officer, a Los Angeles judge issued a search warrant, pursuant to which the police seized from respondent $4,940 in cash and certain wagering records. The officer advised the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that respondent had been arrested for bookmaking activity.  Using a calculation based upon the seized evidence, the IRS assessed respondent for wagering excise taxes and levied upon the $4,940 in partial satisfaction.  In the subsequent state criminal proceeding against respondent, the trial court found the police officer's affidavit defective, granted a motion to quash the warrant, and ordered the seized items returned to the respondent, except for the $4,940.  Respondent filed a refund claim for the $4,940 and, later, this action.  The Government answered and counterclaimed for the unpaid balance of the assessment.  Respondent moved to suppress the evidence seized and all copies thereof, and to quash the assessment.  The District Court, after a hearing, concluded that respondent was entitled to a refund, because the assessment ""was based in substantial part, if not completely, on illegally procured evidence in violation of [respondent's] Fourth Amendment rights,"" and that, under the circumstances, respondent was not required to prove the extent of the claimed refund.  The assessment was quashed and the counterclaim accordingly was dismissed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judicially created exclusionary rule should not be extended to forbid the use in the civil proceeding of one sovereign (here the Federal Government) of evidence illegally seized by a criminal law enforcement agent of another sovereign (here the state government), since the likelihood of deterring law enforcement conduct through such a rule is not sufficient to outweigh the societal costs imposed by the exclusion.  Pp.  428 U. S. 443-460.
(a) The prime, if not the sole, purpose of the exclusionary rule ""is to deter future unlawful police conduct.""  Pp.  428 U. S. 443-447.
(b) Whether the exclusionary rule is a deterrent has not yet been demonstrated.  Assuming, however, that it is a deterrent, 
Page 428 U. S. 434
 then its use in situations where it is now applied must be deemed to suffice to accomplish its purpose, because the local law enforcement official is already ""punished"" by the exclusion of the evidence in both the state and the federal criminal trials.  The additional marginal deterrence provided by its extension in cases like this one does not outweigh the societal costs of excluding concededly relevant evidence.  Pp. 447-460.

Syllabus 
Respondent in No. 74-1055, was convicted of murder in state court, in part on the basis of testimony concerning a revolver found on his person when he was arrested for violating a vagrancy ordinance.  The trial court rejected respondent's contention that the testimony should have been excluded because the ordinance was unconstitutional and the arrest therefore invalid.  The appellate court affirmed, finding it unnecessary to pass upon the legality of the arrest and search because of the court's conclusion that the error, if any, in admitting the challenged testimony was harmless, beyond a reasonable doubt.  Respondent then applied for habeas corpus relief in the Federal District Court, which concluded that the arresting officer had probable cause, and that, even if the vagrancy ordinance was unconstitutional, the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule did not require that it be applied to bar admission of the fruits of a search incident to an otherwise valid arrest.  The court held, alternatively, that any error in admission of the challenged evidence was harmless.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the ordinance was unconstitutional; that respondent's arrest was therefore illegal; and that, although exclusion of the evidence would serve no deterrent purpose with regard to officers who were enforcing statutes in good faith, exclusion would deter legislators from enacting unconstitutional statutes.  The court also held that admission of the evidence was not harmless error.  In No. 74-1222, respondent was also convicted of murder in a state court, in part on the basis of evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant which respondent on a suppression motion claimed was invalid.  The trial court denied respondent's motion to suppress, and was upheld on appeal.  Respondent then filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court.  The court concluded that the warrant was invalid, and rejected the State's contention that, in any event, probable cause justified the 
Page 428 U. S. 466
 search.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Where the State, as in each of these cases, has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim, a state prisoner may not be granted federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure was introduced at his trial.  In this context, the contribution of the exclusionary rule, if any, to the effectuation of the Fourth Amendment is minimal as compared to the substantial societal costs of applying the rule.  Pp.  428 U. S. 474-495.
(a) Until these cases, this Court has had no occasion fully to examine the validity of the assumption made in Kaufman v. United States, 394 U. S. 217, that the effectuation of the Fourth Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth, requires the granting of habeas corpus relief when a prisoner has been convicted in state court on the basis of evidence obtained in an illegal search or seizure since those Amendments were held in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, to require exclusion of such evidence at trial and reversal of conviction upon direct review.  Pp.  428 U. S. 480-481.
(b) The Mapp majority justified application of the exclusionary rule chiefly upon the belief that exclusion would deter future unlawful police conduct, and though preserving the integrity of the judicial process has been alluded to as also justifying the rule, that concern is minimal where federal habeas corpus relief is sought by a prisoner who has already been given the opportunity for full and fair consideration of his search and seizure claim at trial and on direct review.  Pp.  428 U. S. 484-486.
(c) Despite the broad deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule, it has never been interpreted to proscribe the introduction of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons; in various situations, the Court has found the policies behind the rule outweighed by countervailing considerations.  Pp.  428 U. S. 486-489.
(d) The ultimate question of guilt or innocence should be the central concern in a criminal proceeding.  Application of the exclusionary rule, however, deflects the truthfinding process and often frees the guilty.

Argued April 26, 1976
Decided July 6, 1976*
428 U.S. 543

Syllabus 
1. The Border Patrol's routine stopping of a vehicle at a permanent checkpoint located on a major highway away from the Mexican border for brief questioning of the vehicle's occupants is consistent with the Fourth Amendment, and the stops and questioning may be made at reasonably located checkpoints in the absence of any individualized suspicion that the particular vehicle contains illegal aliens.  Pp.  428 U. S. 556-564.
(a) To require that such stops always be based on reasonable suspicion would be impractical because the flow of traffic tends to be too heavy to allow the particularized study of a given car necessary to identify it as a possible carrier of illegal aliens.  Such a requirement also would largely eliminate any deterrent to the conduct of well disguised smuggling operations, even though smugglers are known to use these highways regularly.  Pp.  428 U. S. 556-557.
(b) While the need to make routine checkpoint stops is great, the consequent intrusion on Fourth Amendment interests is quite limited, the interference with legitimate traffic being minimal and checkpoint operations involving less discretionary enforcement activity than roving patrol stops.  Pp.  428 U. S. 557-560.
(c) Under the circumstances of these checkpoint stops, which do not involve searches, the Government or public interest in making such stops outweighs the constitutionally protected interest of the private citizen.  Pp.  428 U. S. 560-562.
(d) With respect to the checkpoint involved in No 74-1560, it is constitutional to refer motorists selectively to a secondary inspection area for limited inquiry on the basis of criteria that would not sustain a roving patrol stop, since the intrusion is sufficiently minimal that no particularized reason need exist to justify it.  Pp.  428 U. S. 563-564.
2. Operation of a fixed checkpoint need not be authorized in advance by a judicial warrant.  Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 
Page 428 U. S. 544
 U.S. 523, distinguished.  The visible manifestations of the field officers' authority at a checkpoint provide assurances to motorists that the officers are acting lawfully.  Moreover, the purpose of a warrant in preventing hindsight from coloring the evaluation of the reasonableness of a search or seizure is inapplicable here, since the reasonableness of checkpoint stops turns on factors such as the checkpoint's location and method of operation.  These factors are not susceptible of the distortion of hindsight, and will be open to post-stop review notwithstanding the absence of a warrant.  Nor is the purpose of a warrant in substituting a magistrate's judgment for that of the searching or seizing officer applicable, since the need for this is reduced when the decision to ""seize"" is not entirely in the hands of the field officer and deference is to be given to the administrative decisions of higher ranking officials in selecting the checkpoint locations.

428 U.S. 579

Syllabus 
Respondent, a private utility that is the sole supplier of electricity in southeastern Michigan, also furnishes its residential customers, without additional charge, with almost 50% of the most frequently used standard-size light bulbs under a longstanding practice antedating state regulation of electric utilities.  This marketing practice for light bulbs is approved, as part of respondent's rate structure, by the Michigan Public Service Commission, and may not be changed unless and until respondent files, and the Commission approves, a new tariff.  Petitioner, a retail druggist selling light bulbs, brought an action against respondent, claiming that it was using its monopoly power in the distribution of electricity to restrain competition in the sale of light bulbs in violation of the Sherman Act.  The District Court entered a summary judgment against petitioner, holding on the authority of Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, that the Commission's approval of respondent's light bulb marketing practices exempted the practices from the federal antitrust laws, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Neither Michigan's approval of respondent's present tariff nor the fact that the light bulb exchange program may not be terminated until a new tariff is filed, is sufficient basis for implying an exemption from the federal antitrust laws for that program.  Pp.  428 U. S. 592-598.
(a) The State's participation in the decision to have a light bulb exchange program is not so dominant that it is unfair to hold a private party responsible for its conduct in implementing the decision, but rather the respondent's participation in the decision is sufficiently significant to require that its conduct, like comparable conduct by unregulated businesses, conform to applicable federal law.  Pp.  428 U. S. 592-595.
(b) Michigan's regulation of respondent's distribution of electricity poses no necessary conflict with a federal requirement that respondent's activities in competitive markets satisfy antitrust 
Page 428 U. S. 580
 standards.  Merely because certain conduct may be subject to state regulation and to the federal antitrust laws does not necessarily mean that it must satisfy inconsistent standards, but, even assuming inconsistency, this would not mean that the federal interest must inevitably be subordinated to the State's; moreover, even assuming that Congress did not intend the antitrust laws to apply to areas of the economy primarily regulated by a State, the enforcement of the antitrust laws would not be foreclosed in an essentially unregulated area such as the electric light bulb market.

 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 We depreciate the precedential weight of summary dispositions in our decisional process, expressly holding in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 671, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), that such dispositions 'are not of the same precedential value as would be an opinion of this Court treating the question on the merits.' I would not require district courts, courts of appeals, and state courts to ascribe any greater precedential weight to summary dispositions than this Court does. Accordingly, I did not join the holding in Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 344-345, 95 S.Ct. 2281, 45 L.Ed.2d 223 (1975), that 'the lower courts are bound by summary decisions by this Court,' which requires state and lower federal courts to treat our summary dispositions of appeals as conclusive precedents regarding constitutional challenges to like state statutes or ordinances. 
 The Court of Appeals in this cace conscientiously followed the procedure mandated by Hicks. Faced with a claim that three appeals from state courts that had been dismissed by this Court 'for want of a substantial federal question' compelled rejection of petitioners' contentions that the Philadelphia ordinance in question violated the

 Federal Constitution,1 the Court of Appeals compared in detail the constitutional issues presented here and those presented in the jurisdictional statements filed in this Court in the three earlier cases. 524 F.2d, at 576. Hicks makes such analysis obligatory as a condition to reliance on a summary disposition. 422 U.S., at 345 n. 14, 95 S.Ct. 2281.2 Completion of this process satisfied the Court of Appeals that one or more of the earlier jurisdictional statements had presented to this Court constitutional claims addressed to massage parlor ordinances, like those addressed by petitioners to the Philadelphia ordinance, 'based upon equal, but reprehensible, treatment of both sexes; an invidiously discriminatory sexbased classification; an irrational exception in the ordinance for massage treatments given under the direction of a medical practitioner; unreasonable abridgement of the right to pursue a legitimate livelihood; and the irrebuttable presumption doctrine.' 524 F.2d, at 576 (footnotes omitted). Accordingly, the Court of Appeals, without expressing its own views on the merits of the constitutional contentions, but in compliance with the holding of Hicks, decided the constitutional questions adversely to petitioners solely and squarely upon the authority of Smith v.

No. 74-6257
Argued March 31, 1976
Decided July 2, 1976
428 U.S. 153

Syllabus 
Petitioner was charged with committing armed robbery and murder on the basis of evidence that he had killed and robbed two men.  At the trial stage of Georgia's bifurcated procedure, the jury found petitioner guilty of two counts of armed robbery and two counts of murder.  At the penalty stage, the judge instructed the jury that it could recommend either a death sentence or a life prison sentence on each count; that it was free to consider mitigating or aggravating circumstances, if any, as presented by the parties; and that it would not be authorized to consider imposing the death sentence unless it first found beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that the murder was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of other capital felonies, viz., the armed robberies of the victims; (2) that he committed the murder for the purpose of receiving the victims' money and automobile; or (3) that the murder was ""outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman"" in that it ""involved the depravity of [the] mind of the defendant.""  The jury found the first and second of these aggravating circumstances, and returned a sentence of death.  The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the convictions.  After reviewing the trial transcript and record and comparing the evidence and sentence in similar cases, the court upheld the death sentences for the murders, concluding that they had not resulted from prejudice or any other arbitrary factor, and were not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty applied in similar cases, but vacated the armed robbery sentences on the ground, inter alia, that the death penalty had rarely been imposed in Georgia for that offense.  Petitioner challenges imposition of the death sentence under the Georgia statute as ""cruel and unusual"" punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  That statute, as amended following Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (where this Court held to be violative of those Amendments death sentences imposed under statutes that left juries with untrammeled discretion to impose or withhold the death penalty), retains the death penalty for murder and five other crimes.  Guilt or innocence is determined in the first stage 
Page 428 U. S. 154
 of a bifurcated trial, and, if the trial is by jury, the trial judge must charge lesser included offenses when supported by any view of the evidence.  Upon a guilty verdict or plea, a presentence hearing is held where the judge or jury hears additional extenuating or mitigating evidence and evidence in aggravation of punishment if made known to the defendant before trial.  At least one of 10 specified aggravating circumstances must be found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt and designated in writing before a death sentence can be imposed.  In jury cases, the trial judge is bound by the recommended sentence.  In its review of a death sentence (which is automatic), the State Supreme Court must consider whether the sentence was influenced by passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; whether the evidence supports the finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance; and whether the death sentence ""is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.""  If the court affirms the death sentence, it must include in its decision reference to similar cases that it has considered.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  428 U. S. 168-207;  428 U. S. 220-226;  428 U. S. 227.
233 Ga. 117, 210 S.E.2d 659, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that:
(1) The punishment of death for the crime of murder does not, under all circumstances, violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  428 U. S. 168-187.
(a) The Eighth Amendment, which has been interpreted in a flexible and dynamic manner to accord with evolving standards of decency, forbids the use of punishment that is ""excessive"" either because it involves the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain or because it is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime.  Pp.  428 U. S. 169-173.
(b) Though a legislature may not impose excessive punishment, it is not required to select the least severe penalty possible, and a heavy burden rests upon those attacking its judgment.  Pp.  428 U. S. 174-176.
(c) The existence of capital punishment was accepted by the Framers of the Constitution, and, for nearly two centuries, this Court has recognized that capital punishment for the crime of murder is not invalid per se.  Pp.  428 U. S. 176-178. 
Page 428 U. S. 155

(d) Legislative measures adopted by the people's chosen representatives weigh heavily in ascertaining contemporary standards of decency; and the argument that such standards require that the Eighth Amendment be construed as prohibiting the death penalty has been undercut by the fact that, in the four years since Furman, supra, was decided, Congress and at least 35 States have enacted new statutes providing for the death penalty.  Pp.  428 U. S. 179-183.
(e) Retribution and the possibility of deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders are not impermissible considerations for a legislature to weigh in determining whether the death penalty should be imposed, and it cannot be said that Georgia's legislative judgment that such a penalty is necessary in some cases is clearly wrong.  Pp.  428 U. S. 183-187.
(f) Capital punishment for the crime of murder cannot be viewed as invariably disproportionate to the severity of that crime.  P.  428 U. S. 187.
2. The concerns expressed in Furman that the death penalty not be imposed arbitrarily or capriciously can be met by a carefully drafted statute that ensures that the sentencing authority is given adequate information and guidance, concerns best met by a system that provides for a bifurcated proceeding at which the sentencing authority is apprised of the information relevant to the imposition of sentence and provided with standards to guide its use of that information.  Pp.  428 U. S. 188-195.
3. The Georgia statutory system under which petitioner was sentenced to death is constitutional.  The new procedures, on their face, satisfy the concerns of Furman, since, before the death penalty can be imposed, there must be specific jury findings as to the circumstances of the crime or the character of the defendant, and the State Supreme Court thereafter reviews the comparability of each death sentence with the sentences imposed on similarly situated defendants to ensure that the sentence of death in a particular case is not disproportionate.  Petitioner's contentions that the changes in Georgia's sentencing procedures have not removed the elements of arbitrariness and capriciousness condemned by Furman are without merit.  Pp.  428 U. S. 196-207.
(a) The opportunities under the Georgia scheme for affording an individual defendant mercy -- whether through the prosecutor's unfettered authority to select those whom he wishes to prosecute for capital offenses and to plea bargain with them; the jury's option to convict a defendant of a lesser included offense; or the 
Page 428 U. S. 156
 fact that the Governor or pardoning authority may commute a death sentence -- do not render the Georgia statute unconstitutional.  P.  428 U. S. 199.
(b) Petitioner's arguments that certain statutory aggravating circumstances are too broad or vague lack merit, since they need not be given overly broad constructions or have been already narrowed by judicial construction.  One such provision was held impermissibly vague by the Georgia Supreme Court.  Petitioner's argument that the sentencing procedure allows for arbitrary grants of mercy reflects a misinterpretation of Furman, and ignores the reviewing authority of the Georgia Supreme Court to determine whether each death sentence is proportional to other sentences imposed for similar crimes.  Petitioner also urges that the scope of the evidence and argument that can be considered at the presentence hearing is too wide, but it is desirable for a jury to have as much information as possible when it makes the sentencing decision.  Pp.  428 U. S. 200-204.
(c) The Georgia sentencing scheme also provides for automatic sentence review by the Georgia Supreme Court to safeguard against prejudicial or arbitrary factors.  In this very case, the court vacated petitioner's death sentence for armed robbery as an excessive penalty.  Pp.  428 U. S. 204-206.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that:
1. Georgia's new statutory scheme, enacted to overcome the constitutional deficiencies found in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, to exist under the old system, not only guides the jury in its exercise of discretion as to whether or not it will impose the death penalty for first-degree murder, but also gives the Georgia Supreme Court the power and imposes the obligation to decide whether in fact the death penalty was being administered for any given class of crime in a discriminatory, standardless, or rare fashion.  If that court properly performs the task assigned to it under the Georgia statutes, death sentences imposed for discriminatory reasons or wantonly or freakishly for any given category of crime will be set aside.  Petitioner has wholly failed to establish that the Georgia Supreme Court failed properly to perform its task in the instant case, or that it is incapable of performing its task adequately in all cases.  Thus, the death penalty may be carried out under the Georgia legislative scheme consistently with the Furman decision.  Pp.  428 U. S. 220-224. 
Page 428 U. S. 157

2. Petitioner's argument that the prosecutor's decisions in plea bargaining or in declining to charge capital murder are standardless, and will result in the wanton or freakish imposition of the death penalty condemned in Furman, is without merit, for the assumption cannot be made that prosecutors will be motivated in their charging decisions by factors other than the strength of their case and the likelihood that a jury would impose the death penalty if it convicts; the standards by which prosecutors decide whether to charge a capital felony will be the same as those by which the jury will decide the questions of guilt and sentence.  Pp.  428 U. S. 224-225.
3. Petitioner's argument that the death penalty, however imposed and for whatever crime, is cruel and unusual punishment is untenable for the reasons stated in MR. JUSTICE WHITE's dissent in Roberts v. Louisiana, post at  428 U. S. 350-356.  P.  428 U. S. 226.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN concurred in the judgment.  See Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. at  408 U. S. 405-414 (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting), and id. at  408 U. S. 375 (BURGER, C.J., dissenting); id. at  408 U.

No. 74-6257
Argued March 31, 1976
Decided July 2, 1976
428 U.S. 153

Syllabus 
Petitioner was charged with committing armed robbery and murder on the basis of evidence that he had killed and robbed two men.  At the trial stage of Georgia's bifurcated procedure, the jury found petitioner guilty of two counts of armed robbery and two counts of murder.  At the penalty stage, the judge instructed the jury that it could recommend either a death sentence or a life prison sentence on each count; that it was free to consider mitigating or aggravating circumstances, if any, as presented by the parties; and that it would not be authorized to consider imposing the death sentence unless it first found beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that the murder was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of other capital felonies, viz., the armed robberies of the victims; (2) that he committed the murder for the purpose of receiving the victims' money and automobile; or (3) that the murder was ""outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman"" in that it ""involved the depravity of [the] mind of the defendant.""  The jury found the first and second of these aggravating circumstances, and returned a sentence of death.  The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the convictions.  After reviewing the trial transcript and record and comparing the evidence and sentence in similar cases, the court upheld the death sentences for the murders, concluding that they had not resulted from prejudice or any other arbitrary factor, and were not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty applied in similar cases, but vacated the armed robbery sentences on the ground, inter alia, that the death penalty had rarely been imposed in Georgia for that offense.  Petitioner challenges imposition of the death sentence under the Georgia statute as ""cruel and unusual"" punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  That statute, as amended following Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (where this Court held to be violative of those Amendments death sentences imposed under statutes that left juries with untrammeled discretion to impose or withhold the death penalty), retains the death penalty for murder and five other crimes.  Guilt or innocence is determined in the first stage 
Page 428 U. S. 154
 of a bifurcated trial, and, if the trial is by jury, the trial judge must charge lesser included offenses when supported by any view of the evidence.  Upon a guilty verdict or plea, a presentence hearing is held where the judge or jury hears additional extenuating or mitigating evidence and evidence in aggravation of punishment if made known to the defendant before trial.  At least one of 10 specified aggravating circumstances must be found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt and designated in writing before a death sentence can be imposed.  In jury cases, the trial judge is bound by the recommended sentence.  In its review of a death sentence (which is automatic), the State Supreme Court must consider whether the sentence was influenced by passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; whether the evidence supports the finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance; and whether the death sentence ""is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.""  If the court affirms the death sentence, it must include in its decision reference to similar cases that it has considered.

428 U.S. 242

Syllabus 
Petitioner, whose first-degree murder conviction and death sentence were affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court, attacks the constitutionality of the Florida capital sentencing procedure, that was enacted in response to Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238.  Under the new statute, the trial judge (who is the sentencing authority) must weigh eight statutory aggravating factors against seven statutory mitigating factors to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed, thus requiring him to focus on the circumstances of the crime and the character of the individual defendant.  The Florida system resembles the Georgia system upheld in Gregg v. Georgia, ante p.  428 U. S. 153, except for the basic difference that, in Florida, the sentence is determined by the trial judge, rather than by the jury, which has an advisory role with respect to the sentencing phase of the trial.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  428 U. S. 251-260;  428 U. S. 260-261;  428 U. S. 261.
315 So.2d 461, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that:
1. The imposition of the death penalty is not per se cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Gregg, ante at  428 U. S. 168-187.  P.  428 U. S. 247.
2. On its face, the Florida procedures for imposition of the death penalty satisfy the constitutional deficiencies identified in Furman, supra.  Florida trial judges are given specific and detailed guidance to assist them in deciding whether to impose a death penalty or imprisonment for life, and their decisions are reviewed to ensure that they comport with other sentences imposed under similar circumstances.  Petitioner's contentions that the new Florida procedures remain arbitrary and capricious lack merit.  Pp.  428 U. S. 251-259.
(a) The argument that the Florida system is constitutionally invalid because it allows discretion to be exercised at each stage of the criminal proceeding fundamentally misinterprets Furman. Gregg, ante at  428 U. S. 199.  P.  428 U. S. 254. 
Page 428 U. S. 243

(b) The aggravating circumstances authorizing the death penalty if the crime is ""especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,"" or if ""[t]he defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons,"" as construed by the Florida Supreme Court, provide adequate guidance to those involved in the sentencing process, and, as thus construed, are not overly broad.  Pp.  428 U. S. 255-256.
(c) Petitioner's argument that the imprecision of the mitigating circumstances makes them incapable of determination by a judge or jury, and other contentions in a similar vein, raise questions about line-drawing evaluations that do not differ from factors that juries and judges traditionally consider.  The Florida statute gives clear and precise directions to judge and jury to enable them to weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating ones.  Pp.  428 U. S. 257-258.
(d) Contrary to petitioner's contention, the State Supreme Court's review role is neither ineffective nor arbitrary, as evidenced by the careful procedures it has followed in assessing the imposition of death sentences, over a third of which that court has vacated.  Pp.  428 U. S. 258-259.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that, under the Florida law, the sentencing judge is required to impose the death penalty on all first-degree murderers as to whom the statutory aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, and, as to those categories, the penalty will not be freakishly or rarely, but will be regularly, imposed, and, therefore, the Florida scheme does not run afoul of the Court's holding in Furman.  Petitioner's contentions about prosecutorial discretion and his argument that the death penalty may never be imposed under any circumstances consistent with the Eighth Amendment are without substance.  See Gregg v. Georgia, ante at  428 U. S. 224-225 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment) and Roberts v. Louisiana, post at  428 U. S. 348-350;  428 U. S. 350-356 (WHITE, J., dissenting).  Pp.  428 U.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who was convicted of murder and whose death sentence was upheld on appeal, challenges the constitutionality of the Texas procedures enacted after this Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238.  The new Texas Penal Code limits capital homicides to intentional and knowing murders committed in five situations.  Texas also adopted a new capital sentencing procedure, which requires the jury to answer the following three questions in a proceeding that takes place after a verdict finding a person guilty of one of the specified murder categories:  (1) whether the conduct of the defendant causing the death was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death would result; (2) whether it is probable that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence constituting a continuing threat to society; and (3) if raised by the evidence, whether the defendant's conduct was an unreasonable response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased.  If the jury finds that the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to each of the three questions is affirmative, the death sentence is imposed; if it finds that the answer to any question is negative, a sentence of life imprisonment results.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in this case indicated that it will interpret the ""continuing threat to society"" question to mean that the jury could consider various mitigating factors.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  428 U. S. 268-277;  428 U. S. 277;  428 U. S. 278-279;  428 U. S. 279.
522 S.W.2d 934, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that:
1. The imposition of the death penalty is not per se cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Gregg, ante at  428 U. S. 168-187.  P.  428 U. S. 268.
2. The Texas capital sentencing procedures do not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Texas' action in narrowing capital offenses to five categories in essence requires the jury to find the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance before 
Page 428 U. S. 263
 the death penalty may be imposed, thus requiring the sentencing authority to focus on the particularized nature of the crime.  And, though the Texas statute does not explicitly speak of mitigating circumstances, it has been construed to embrace the jury's consideration of such circumstances.  Thus, as in the cases of Gregg v. Georgia, ante p.  428 U. S. 153, and Proffitt v. Florida, ante p.  428 U. S. 242, the Texas capital sentencing procedure guides and focuses the jury's objective consideration of the particularized circumstances of the individual offense and the individual offender before it can impose a sentence of death.  The Texas law has thus eliminated the arbitrariness and caprice of the system invalidated in Furman.  Petitioner's contentions to the contrary are without substance.  Pp.  428 U. S. 268-276.
(a) His assertion that arbitrariness still pervades the entire Texas criminal justice system fundamentally misinterprets Furman. Gregg, ante at  428 U. S. 198-199.  P.  428 U. S. 274.
(b) Petitioner's contention that the second statutory question is unconstitutionally vague because it requires the prediction of human behavior lacks merit.  The jury's task in answering that question is one that must commonly be performed throughout the American criminal justice system, and Texas law clearly satisfies the essential requirement that the jury have all possible relevant information about the individual defendant.  Pp.  428 U. S. 274-276.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE concurred in the judgment.  See Furman v. Georgia, supra at  408 U. S. 375 (BURGER, C.J., dissenting).  P.  428 U. S. 277.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that, under the revised Texas law, the substantive crime of murder is narrowly defined, and when murder occurs in one of the five circumstances detailed in the statute, the death penalty must be imposed if the jury makes the certain additional findings against the defendant.  Petitioner's contentions that unconstitutionally arbitrary or discretionary statutory features nevertheless remain are without substance, Roberts v. Louisiana, post at  428 U. S. 348-350 (WHITE, J., dissenting); Gregg v. Georgia, ante at  428 U. S. 224-225 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment), as is his assertion that the Eighth Amendment forbids the death penalty under any and all circumstances.  Roberts v. Louisiana, post at  428 U. S. 350-356 (WHITE, J., dissenting).  Pp.  428 U. S. 278-279.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN concurred in the judgment.  See Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238,  408 U. S. 405-414 (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting), and id. at  408 U. S. 375,  408 U. S. 414, and  408 U. S. 465.  P.  428 U. S. 279.

Syllabus 
Following this Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, the North Carolina law that previously had provided that in cases of first-degree murder the jury in its unbridled discretion could choose whether the convicted defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment was changed to make the death penalty mandatory for that crime.  Petitioners, whose convictions of first-degree murder and whose death sentences under the new statute were upheld by the Supreme Court of North Carolina, have challenged the statute's constitutionality.
Held:  The judgment is reversed insofar as it upheld the death sentences, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  428 U. S. 285-305;  428 U. S. 305-306;  428 U. S. 306.
287 N.C. 578, 215 S.E.2d 607, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that North Carolina's mandatory death sentence statute violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  428 U. S. 285-305.
(a) The Eighth Amendment serves to assure that the State's power to punish is ""exercised within the limits of civilized standards,"" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86,  356 U. S. 100 (plurality opinion), and central to the application of the Amendment is a determination of contemporary standards regarding the infliction of punishment, Gregg v. Georgia, ante at  428 U. S. 176-182.  P.  428 U. S. 288.
(b) Though, at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted, all the States provided mandatory death sentences for specified offenses, the reaction of jurors and legislators to the harshness of those provisions has led to the replacement of automatic death penalty statutes with discretionary jury sentencing.  The two crucial indicators of evolving standards of decency respecting the imposition of punishment in our society -- jury determinations and legislative enactments -- conclusively point to the repudiation of automatic death sentences.
""The belief no longer prevails that every offense in a like legal category calls for an identical punishment without regard to the past life and habits of a particular offender,""
Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241,  337 U. S. 247.  North Carolina's mandatory death penalty statute for first-degree murder, 
Page 428 U. S. 281
 which resulted from the state legislature's adoption of the State Supreme Court's analysis that Furman required the severance of the discretionary feature of the old law, is a constitutionally impermissible departure from contemporary standards respecting imposition of the unique and irretrievable punishment of death.  Pp.  428 U. S. 289-301.
(c) The North Carolina statute fails to provide a constitutionally tolerable response to Furman's rejection of unbridled jury discretion in the imposition of capital sentences.  Central to the limited holding in that case was the conviction that vesting a jury with standardless sentencing power violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, yet that constitutional deficiency is not eliminated by the mere formal removal of all sentencing power from juries in capital cases.  In view of the historic record, it may reasonably be assumed that many juries under mandatory statutes will continue to consider the grave consequences of a conviction in reaching  verdict.  But the North Carolina statute provides no standards to guide the jury in determining which murderers shall live and which shall die.  Pp.  428 U. S. 302-303.
(d) The respect for human dignity underlying the Eighth Amendment, Trop v. Dulles, supra at  356 U. S. 100 (plurality opinion), requires consideration of aspects of the character of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of imposing the ultimate punishment of death.  The North Carolina statute impermissibly treats all persons convicted of a designated offense not as uniquely individual human beings, but as members of a faceless, undifferentiated mass to be subjected to the blind infliction of the death penalty.  Pp.  428 U. S. 303-305.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to death under amended Louisiana statutes enacted after this Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238.  The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contention that the new procedure for imposing the death penalty is unconstitutional.  The post-Furman legislation mandates imposition of the death penalty whenever, with respect to five categories of homicide (here, killing during the perpetration of an armed robbery), the jury finds the defendant had a specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm.  If a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder is returned, death is mandated regardless of any mercy recommendation.  Every jury is instructed on the crimes of second-degree murder and manslaughter and permitted to consider those verdicts even if no evidence supports the lesser verdicts; and, if a lesser verdict is returned it is treated as an acquittal of all greater charges.

2. Louisiana's mandatory death penalty statute violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  428 U. S. 331-336.
(a) Though Louisiana has adopted a different and somewhat narrower definition of first-degree murder than North Carolina, the difference is not of constitutional significance, and the Louisiana statute imposing a mandatory death sentence is invalid for substantially the same reasons as are detailed in Woodson v. North Carolina, ante at  428 U. S. 289-296.  Pp.  428 U. S. 331-334.
(b) Though respondent State claims that it has adopted satisfactory procedures to comply with Furman's requirement that standardless jury discretion be replaced by procedures that safeguard 
Page 428 U. S. 326
 against the arbitrary and capricious imposition of death sentences, that objective has not been realized, since the responsive verdict procedure not only lacks standards to guide the jury in selecting among first-degree murderers, but it plainly invites the jurors to disregard their oaths and choose a verdict for a lesser offense whenever they feel that the death penalty is inappropriate.

North Carolina, ante at  428 U. S. 289-296.  Pp.  428 U. S. 331-334.
(b) Though respondent State claims that it has adopted satisfactory procedures to comply with Furman's requirement that standardless jury discretion be replaced by procedures that safeguard 
Page 428 U. S. 326
 against the arbitrary and capricious imposition of death sentences, that objective has not been realized, since the responsive verdict procedure not only lacks standards to guide the jury in selecting among first-degree murderers, but it plainly invites the jurors to disregard their oaths and choose a verdict for a lesser offense whenever they feel that the death penalty is inappropriate.  See Woodson, ante, at  428 U. S. 302-303.  Pp.  428 U. S. 334-336.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concurred in the judgment for the reasons stated in his dissenting opinion in Gregg v. Georgia, ante p.  428 U. S. 227.  P.  428 U. S. 336.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, being of the view that death is a cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, concurred in the judgment.  Gregg v. Georgia, ante, p.  428 U. S. 231 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  P.  428 U. S. 336.

428 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Title IV of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as amended by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, provides benefits to coal miners suffering from ""black lung disease"" (pneumoconiosis), and to survivors of miners who have died from, or while totally disabled by, the disease.  Financial responsibility for payment of the benefits is divided into three parts:  (1) Under Part B of Title IV, claims filed between December 30, 1969 (enactment date), and June 30, 1973, are adjudicated by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), and paid by the United States; (2) under  415 of Part B claims filed during the transition period between the Federal Government benefit provision under Part B, supra, and the state plan or operator benefit provision under Part C, infra (July 1 to December 31, 1973), are adjudicated by the Secretary of Labor and paid by the United States.  Federal payments to these claimants terminate on December 31, 1973, and the claimant's coal mine employer assumes responsibility to make continuing payments as if Part C and 
Page 428 U. S. 2
  422 had applied (see (3), infra); and (3) under Part C, claims filed after December 31, 1973, are to be processed under an approved state workmen's compensation law and, absent such an approved plan, claims are to be filed with and adjudicated by the Secretary of Labor, and paid by the mine operators,  422.  Under that provision, an operator, who is entitled to a hearing in connection with these claims, is liable for benefits with respect to death or total disability due to pneumoconiosis arising out of employment in a mine for which the operator is responsible, the operator's liability covering the period from January 1, 1974, to December 30, 1981.  Payments for benefits under Part C are to the same category of persons (a miner or certain survivors) and in the same amounts as under Part B.  A miner is ""totally disabled,"" and thus entitled to compensation
""when pneumoconiosis prevents him from engaging in gainful employment requiring the skills and abilities comparable to those of any employment in a mine or mines in which he previously engaged with some regularity and over a substantial period of time,""
 402(f).  The Act prescribes several ""presumptions"" for use in determining compensable disability:  under  411(c)(3), a miner shown by X-ray or other clinical evidence to be afflicted with complicated pneumoconiosis (the disease's incurable and final stage) is ""irrebuttably presumed"" to be totally disabled due to the disease; if such a miner has died, it is irrebuttably presumed that he was totally disabled by the disease at the time of death, and that his death was due thereto.  There are three rebuttable presumptions (none of which may, under  413(b), be defeated solely by a chest X-ray):  (1) if a miner with 10 or more years' mine employment contracts pneumoconiosis, it is presumed that the disease arose out of such employment,  411(c)(1); (2) if he died from a respiratory disease, it is presumed that death was due to pneumoconiosis,  411(c)(2); (3) if a miner, or the survivor of a miner, with 15 or more years' underground coal mine employment is able, despite the absence of clinical evidence of complicated pneumoconiosis, to demonstrate a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment, it is presumed that the total disability is attributable to the disease, that the miner was totally disabled thereby when he died, and that death was due to the disease,  411(c)(4), and the final sentence of that provision specifics that
""[t]he Secretary may rebut [this latter] presumption only by establishing that (A) such miner does not, or did not, have pneumoconiosis, or that (b) his respiratory or pulmonary impairment 
Page 428 U. S. 3
 did not arise out of, or in connection with, employment in a coal mine.""
A number of operators brought this suit claiming that the Act is unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment insofar as it requires benefit payments with respect to miners who left mine employment before the Act's effective date; that the statutory definitions, presumptions, and limitations on rebuttal evidence unconstitutionally impair the operator's ability to defend against benefit claims; and that certain regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor regarding the apportionment of liability for benefits among operators are inconsistent with the Act, and unconstitutional.  The District Court upheld each challenged provision as constitutional, with two exceptions:  (1) It held  411(c)(3) unconstitutional as an unreasonable and arbitrary legislative finding of total disability ""in terms other than those provided by the Act as standards for total disability.""  (2) Reading the evidence limitation on rebuttal in  411(c)(4) to apply to an operator's defense in a  415 transition period case, the court held the limitation arbitrary and unreasonable in not permitting a rebuttal showing that the case of pneumoconiosis afflicting the miner was not disabling.  And, taking the provision to mean that an operator may defend against liability only on the ground that pneumoconiosis did not arise out of employment in any coal mine (rather than in a coal mine for which the operator was responsible), the District Court found the provision an arbitrary and unreasonable limitation on rebuttal evidence relevant and proper under  422(c).  The court enjoined the Secretary of Labor from seeking to apply the two provisions thus found unconstitutional.
Held:
1. This Court's summary affirmance in National Independent Coal Operators Assn. v. Brennan, 419 U.S. 955, did not foreclose the District Court's rulings regarding  411(c)(3) and (4), which were not before the Court on that appeal.  P.  428 U. S. 14.
2. The challenged provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  428 U. S. 14-38.
(a) The Clause does not bar requiring an operator to provide compensation for a former employee's death or disability due to pneumoconiosis arising out of employment in its mines, even if the former employee terminated his employment in its mines before the Act was passed.  Retrospective application of the Act in this manner can be justified as serving to spread costs in a rational manner -- by allocating to the operator an actual cost of its business, whose avoidance might be thought to have enlarged 
Page 428 U. S. 4
 the operator's profits.  Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S. 330, distinguished.  Pp.  428 U. S. 14-20,  428 U. S. 24-27.
(b) Though the operators contend that the  402(f) definition of total disability is arbitrary because former miners who might be employable in other lines of work are compensated, a miner disabled under  402(f)'s standards has suffered health impairment, and has been rendered unable to perform the work to which he has adapted himself, factors which afford a rational basis for compensation.  P.  428 U. S. 21.
(c) The effect of  411(c)(3)'s ""irrebuttable presumption"" of total disability -- to establish entitlement where a miner is clinically diagnosable as extremely ill with pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment -- is clearly permissible, and the provision, being part of a statute regulating purely economic matters, is not rendered invalid by Congress' choice of statutory language.  Pp.  428 U. S. 22-24.
(d) The presumptions in  411(c)(1) and (2) are valid because there is a ""rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed,"" Mobile, J. & K. C. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, 219 U. S. 35,  219 U. S. 43.  In view of the medical evidence before Congress indicating the noticeable incidence of pneumoconiosis in cases of miners with 10 years' mine employment, it was not ""purely arbitrary"" for Congress to select the 10-year figure as a reference point for the presumptions; nor are the 10-year presumptions arbitrary because they fail to account for varying degrees of exposure.  Pp.  428 U. S. 27-30.
(e) The 15-year durational basis of the presumption in  411(c)(4) is likewise unassailable, particularly in light of medical testimony in the Senate Hearings on the 1969 Act.  Pp.  428 U. S. 30-31.
(f) Congress had evidence showing doubts about the reliability of negative X-ray evidence as indicating the absence of the disease.  That, through its adoption of  413(b), Congress ultimately resolved those doubts in the disabled miner's favor does not render that provision arbitrary.  Pp.  428 U. S. 31-34.
(g) The District Court improperly invalidated the limitation on evidence contained in  411(c)(4) because the limitation is inapplicable to operators, and applies only to the Secretary of HEW.  Thus the Act does not restrict the evidence with which an operator may rebut the  411(c)(4) presumption.  Pp.  428 U. S. 34-37.
385 F.Supp. 424, affirmed in part; reversed in part; vacated and remanded in part.

Syllabus 
Two Missouri-licensed physicians, one of whom performs abortions at hospitals and the other of whom supervises abortions at Planned Parenthood, a not-for-profit corporation, brought suit, along with that organization, for injunctive and declaratory relief challenging the constitutionality of the Missouri abortion statute.  The provisions under attack are:   2(2), defining ""viability"" as
""that stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life supportive systems;""
 3(2), requiring that, before submitting to an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a woman must consent in writing to the procedure and certify that ""her consent is informed and freely given, and is not the result of coercion"";  3(3), requiring, for the same period, the written consent of the spouse of a woman seeking an abortion unless a licensed physician certifies that the abortion is necessary to preserve the mother's life;  3(4), requiring, for the same period, and with the same proviso, the written consent of a parent or person in loco parentis to the abortion of an unmarried woman under age 18;  6(1), requiring the physician to exercise professional care to preserve the fetus' life and health, failing which he is deemed guilty of manslaughter and is liable in an action for damages;  7, declaring an infant who survives an attempted abortion not performed to save the mother's life or health an abandoned ward of the State, and depriving the mother and a consenting father of parental rights;  9, prohibiting, after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the abortion procedure of saline amniocentesis as ""deleterious to maternal health""; and  10 and 11, prescribing reporting and recordkeeping 
Page 428 U. S. 53
 requirements for health facilities and physicians performing abortions.  The District Court ruled that the two physicians had ""obvious standing"" to maintain the suit, and that it was therefore unnecessary to determine if Planned Parenthood also had standing.  On the merits, the court upheld the foregoing provisions with the exception of  6(1)'s professional skill requirement, which was held to be ""unconstitutionally overbroad"" because it failed to exclude the pregnancy stage prior to viability.
Held:
1. The physician appellants have standing to challenge the foregoing provisions of the Act with the exception of  7, the constitutionality of which the Court declines to decide.  Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179.  P.  428 U. S. 62, and n. 2.
2. The definition of viability in  2(2) does not conflict with the definition in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113,  410 U. S. 160,  410 U. S. 163, as the point at which the fetus is ""potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid,"" and is presumably capable of ""meaningful life outside the mother's womb.""  Section 2(2) maintains the flexibility of the term ""viability"" recognized in Roe.  It is not a proper legislative or judicial function to fix viability, which is essentially for the judgment of the responsible attending physician, at a specific point in the gestation period.  Pp.  428 U. S. 63-65.
3. The consent provision in  3(2) is not unconstitutional.  The decision to abort is important and often stressful, and the awareness of the decision and its significance may be constitutionally assured by the State to the extent of requiring the woman's prior written consent.  Pp.  428 U. S. 65-67.
4. The spousal consent provision in  3(3), which does not comport with the standards enunciated in Roe v. Wade, supra, at  410 U. S. 164-165, is unconstitutional, since the State cannot
""'delegate to a spouse a veto power which the [S]tate itself is absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising during the first trimester of pregnancy.'""
Pp.  428 U. S. 67-72.
5. The State may not constitutionally impose a blanket parental consent requirement, such as  3(4), as a condition for an unmarried minor's abortion during the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy for substantially the same reasons as in the case of the spousal consent provision, there being no significant state interests, whether to safeguard the family unit and parental authority or other vise, in conditioning an abortion on the consent of a parent with respect to the under-18-year-old pregnant minor. As stressed in Roe, ""the abortion decision and its effectuation must 
Page 428 U. S. 54
 be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.""  410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 164.  Pp.  428 U. S. 72-75.
6. Through  9, the State would prohibit the most commonly used abortion procedure in the country and one that is safer, with respect to maternal mortality, than even the continuation of pregnancy until normal childbirth, and would force pregnancy terminations by methods more dangerous to the woman's health than the method outlawed.  As so viewed (particularly since another safe technique, prostaglandin, is not yet available) the outright legislative proscription of saline amniocentesis fails as a reasonable protection of maternal health.  As an arbitrary regulation designed to prevent the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks, it is plainly unconstitutional.  Pp.  428 U. S. 75-79.
7. The reporting and recordkeeping requirements, which can be useful to the State's interest in protecting the health of its female citizens and which may be of medical value, are not constitutionally offensive in themselves, particularly in view of reasonable confidentiality and retention provisions.  They thus do not interfere with the abortion decision or the physician-patient relationship.  It is assumed that the provisions will not be administered in an unduly burdensome way, and that patients will not be required to execute spousal or parental consent forms in accordance with invalid provisions of the Act.  Pp.  428 U. S. 79-81.
8. The first sentence of  6(1) impermissibly requires a physician to preserve the fetus' life and health, whatever the stage of pregnancy.  The second sentence, which provides for criminal and civil liability where a physician fails ""to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results,"" does not alter the duty imposed by the first sentence or limit that duty to pregnancies that have reached the stage of viability, and since it is inseparably tied to the first provision, the whole section is invalid.  Pp.  428 U. S. 81-84.
392 F.Supp. 1362, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

 3(2), requiring that, before submitting to an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a woman must consent in writing to the procedure and certify that ""her consent is informed and freely given, and is not the result of coercion"";  3(3), requiring, for the same period, the written consent of the spouse of a woman seeking an abortion unless a licensed physician certifies that the abortion is necessary to preserve the mother's life;  3(4), requiring, for the same period, and with the same proviso, the written consent of a parent or person in loco parentis to the abortion of an unmarried woman under age 18;  6(1), requiring the physician to exercise professional care to preserve the fetus' life and health, failing which he is deemed guilty of manslaughter and is liable in an action for damages;  7, declaring an infant who survives an attempted abortion not performed to save the mother's life or health an abandoned ward of the State, and depriving the mother and a consenting father of parental rights;  9, prohibiting, after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the abortion procedure of saline amniocentesis as ""deleterious to maternal health""; and  10 and 11, prescribing reporting and recordkeeping 
Page 428 U. S. 53
 requirements for health facilities and physicians performing abortions.  The District Court ruled that the two physicians had ""obvious standing"" to maintain the suit, and that it was therefore unnecessary to determine if Planned Parenthood also had standing.  On the merits, the court upheld the foregoing provisions with the exception of  6(1)'s professional skill requirement, which was held to be ""unconstitutionally overbroad"" because it failed to exclude the pregnancy stage prior to viability.
Held:
1. The physician appellants have standing to challenge the foregoing provisions of the Act with the exception of  7, the constitutionality of which the Court declines to decide.  Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179.  P.  428 U. S. 62, and n. 2.
2. The definition of viability in  2(2) does not conflict with the definition in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113,  410 U. S. 160,  410 U. S. 163, as the point at which the fetus is ""potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid,"" and is presumably capable of ""meaningful life outside the mother's womb.""  Section 2(2) maintains the flexibility of the term ""viability"" recognized in Roe.  It is not a proper legislative or judicial function to fix viability, which is essentially for the judgment of the responsible attending physician, at a specific point in the gestation period.  Pp.  428 U. S. 63-65.
3. The consent provision in  3(2) is not unconstitutional.  The decision to abort is important and often stressful, and the awareness of the decision and its significance may be constitutionally assured by the State to the extent of requiring the woman's prior written consent.  Pp.  428 U. S. 65-67.
4. The spousal consent provision in  3(3), which does not comport with the standards enunciated in Roe v. Wade, supra, at  410 U. S. 164-165, is unconstitutional, since the State cannot
""'delegate to a spouse a veto power which the [S]tate itself is absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising during the first trimester of pregnancy.'""
Pp.  428 U. S. 67-72.
5. The State may not constitutionally impose a blanket parental consent requirement, such as  3(4), as a condition for an unmarried minor's abortion during the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy for substantially the same reasons as in the case of the spousal consent provision, there being no significant state interests, whether to safeguard the family unit and parental authority or other vise, in conditioning an abortion on the consent of a parent with respect to the under-18-year-old pregnant minor. As stressed in Roe, ""the abortion decision and its effectuation must 
Page 428 U. S. 54
 be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.""  410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 164.  Pp.  428 U. S. 72-75.
6. Through  9, the State would prohibit the most commonly used abortion procedure in the country and one that is safer, with respect to maternal mortality, than even the continuation of pregnancy until normal childbirth, and would force pregnancy terminations by methods more dangerous to the woman's health than the method outlawed.  As so viewed (particularly since another safe technique, prostaglandin, is not yet available) the outright legislative proscription of saline amniocentesis fails as a reasonable protection of maternal health.  As an arbitrary regulation designed to prevent the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks, it is plainly unconstitutional.  Pp.  428 U. S. 75-79.
7. The reporting and recordkeeping requirements, which can be useful to the State's interest in protecting the health of its female citizens and which may be of medical value, are not constitutionally offensive in themselves, particularly in view of reasonable confidentiality and retention provisions.  They thus do not interfere with the abortion decision or the physician-patient relationship.  It is assumed that the provisions will not be administered in an unduly burdensome way, and that patients will not be required to execute spousal or parental consent forms in accordance with invalid provisions of the Act.  Pp.  428 U. S. 79-81.
8. The first sentence of  6(1) impermissibly requires a physician to preserve the fetus' life and health, whatever the stage of pregnancy.  The second sentence, which provides for criminal and civil liability where a physician fails ""to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results,"" does not alter the duty imposed by the first sentence or limit that duty to pregnancies that have reached the stage of viability, and since it is inseparably tied to the first provision, the whole section is invalid.  Pp.  428 U. S. 81-84.

Respondents, two Missouri-licensed physicians, brought this action for injunctive relief and a declaration of the unconstitutionality of a Missouri statute that excludes abortions that are not ""medically indicated"" from the purposes for which Medicaid benefits are available to needy persons.  In response to petitioner's pre-answer motion to dismiss, each respondent averred that he had provided, and anticipated providing, abortions to needy patients, and that petitioner, the responsible state official, acting in reliance on the challenged statute, had refused all Medicaid applications filed in connection with such abortions.  A three-judge District Court dismissed the relevant count of the complaint for lack of standing, having concluded that no logical nexus existed between the status asserted by respondents and the claim that they sought to have adjudicated.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that respondents had alleged sufficient ""injury in fact"" and also an interest ""arguably within the zone of interests to be protected . . . by the . . . constitutional guarantees in question.""  That court then considered the case on the merits and found that the challenged statute clearly violated the Equal Protection Clause.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  428 U. S. 112-121;  428 U. S. 121-122;  428 U. S. 122.
508 F.2d 1211, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICES BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, and III, finding that:
1. Respondents had standing to maintain this suit.  Respondents alleged ""injury in fact,"" i.e., a sufficiently concrete interest in the outcome of their suit to make it a case or controversy subject to the District Court's Art. III jurisdiction.  If respondent physicians prevail in their suit to remove the statutory limitation on reimbursable abortions, they will benefit by receiving 
Page 428 U. S. 107
 payment for the abortions and the State will be out of pocket by the amount of the payments.  Pp.  428 U. S. 112-113.
2. The Court of Appeals should not have proceeded to resolve the merits of this case, since petitioner, who has not filed an answer or other pleading addressed to the merits, has not had the opportunity to present evidence or legal arguments in defense of the statute.  Pp.  428 U. S. 119-121.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded, in Part II-B, that, as a prudential matter, respondents are proper proponents of the particular rights on which they base their suit.  Though ""[o]rdinarily, one may not claim standing . . . to vindicate the constitutional rights of some third party,"" Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U. S. 249,  346 U. S. 255, here the underlying justification for that rule is absent.  A woman cannot safely secure an abortion without a physician's aid, and an impecunious woman cannot easily secure an abortion without the physician's being paid by the State.  Aside from the woman herself, the physician is uniquely qualified, by virtue of his confidential, professional relationship with her, to litigate the constitutionality of the State's interference with, or discrimination against, the abortion decision.  Moreover, there are obstacles to the woman's assertion of her own rights, in that the desire to protect her privacy may deter her from herself bringing suit, and her claim will soon become at least technically moot if her indigency forces her to forgo the abortion.

Syllabus 
A 1974 Massachusetts statute governs the type of consent, including parental consent, required before an abortion may be performed on an unmarried woman under the age of 18.  Appellees, an abortion counseling organization, its president and its medical director, and several unmarried women who were pregnant at the time, brought a class action against appellant Attorney General and District Attorneys, claiming that the statute violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  A temporary restraining order was entered prior to the effective date of the statute.  Thereafter, a three-judge District Court held the statute unconstitutional as creating a ""parental veto"" over the performance of abortions on minor children in that it applied even to those minors capable of giving informed consent, and permanently enjoined its operation, denying by implication appellants' motion that the court abstain from deciding the issue pending authoritative construction of the statute by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.  In 1975, after the District Court's decision Massachusetts enacted a statute dealing with consent by minors to medical procedures other than abortion and sterilization, and, in this Court, appellees raised an additional claim of impermissible distinction between the consent procedures applicable to minors in the area of abortion under the 1974 statute and the consent required by the 1975 statute in regard to other medical procedures.
Held:  The District Court should have abstained from deciding the constitutional issue, and should have certified to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court appropriate questions concerning the meaning of the 1974 statute and the procedure it imposes.  Pp.  428 U. S. 143-152.
(a) Abstention is appropriate where an unconstrued state statute is susceptible of a construction by the state judiciary that

(b) Here, the 1974 statute is susceptible of appellants' interpretation that, while it prefers parental consultation and consent, it permits a minor capable of giving informed consent to obtain a court order allowing abortion without parental consultation, and further permits even a minor incapable of giving informed consent to obtain an abortion order without parental consultation where it is shown that abortion would be in her best interests, and such an interpretation would avoid or substantially modify the federal constitutional challenge to the statute.  Pp.  428 U. S. 147-148.
(c) In regard to the claim of impermissible discrimination due to the 1975 statute, it would be appropriate for the District Court also to certify a question concerning this statute, and the extent to which its procedures differ from the procedures required under the 1974 statute.

Syllabus 
Respondent Nebraska state trial judge, in anticipation of a trial for a multiple murder which had attracted widespread news coverage, entered an order which, as modified by the Nebraska Supreme Court, restrained petitioner newspapers, broadcasters, journalists, news media associations, and national newswire services from publishing or broadcasting accounts of confessions or admissions made by the accused to law enforcement officers or third parties, except members of the press, and other facts ""strongly implicative"" of the accused.  The modification of the order had occurred in the course of an action by petitioners, which had sought a stay of the trial court's original order and in which the accused and the State of Nebraska intervened.  This Court granted certiorari to determine whether the order violated the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press.  The order expired by its own terms when the jury was impaneled.  Respondent was convicted; his appeal is pending in the Nebraska Supreme Court.
Held:
1. The case is not moot simply because the order has expired, since the controversy between the parties is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review.""  Pp.  427 U. S. 546-547.
2. While the guarantees of freedom of expression are not an absolute prohibition under all circumstances, the barriers to prior restraint remain high and the presumption against its use continues intact.  Although it is unnecessary to establish a priority between First Amendment rights and the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial under all circumstances, as the authors of the Bill of Rights themselves declined to do, the protection against prior restraint should have particular force as applied to reporting of criminal proceedings.  Pp.  427 U. S. 556-562.
3. The heavy burden imposed as a condition to securing a prior restraint was not met in this case.  Pp.  427 U. S. 562-570.
(a) On the pretrial record, the trial judge was justified in concluding that there would be intense and pervasive pretrial publicity concerning the case, and he could also reasonably 
Page 427 U. S. 540
 conclude, based on common human experience, that publicity might impair the accused's right to a fair trial.  His conclusion as to the impact of such publicity on prospective jurors was of necessity speculative, however, dealing as he was with factors unknown and unknowable.  Pp.  427 U. S. 562-563.
(b) There is no finding that measures short of prior restraint on the press and speech would not have protected the accused's rights; the Nebraska Supreme Court no more than implied that alternative measures might not suffice, and the record lacks evidence that would support such a finding.  Pp.  427 U. S. 563-565.
(c) It is not clear that prior restraint on publication would have effectively protected the accused's rights, in view of such practical problems as the limited territorial jurisdiction of the trial court issuing the restraining order, the difficulties inherent in predicting what information will in fact undermine the jurors' impartiality, the problem of drafting an order that will effectively keep prejudicial information from prospective jurors, and the fact that in this case the events occurred in a small community where rumors would travel swiftly by word of mouth.  Pp.  427 U. S. 565-567.
(d) To the extent that the order prohibited the reporting of evidence adduced at the open preliminary hearing held to determine whether the accused should be bound over for trial, it violated the settled principle that ""there is nothing that proscribes the press from reporting events that transpire in the courtroom,"" Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333,  384 U.

No. 75-377
Argued April 28, 1976
Decided June 30, 1976
427 U.S. 618

Syllabus 
Under Massachusetts' two-tier court system, a person accused of certain crimes is tried in the first instance in the lower tier, where no trial by jury is available.  If convicted, he may appeal to the second tier, and, if he was convicted after a proceeding on a not-guilty plea, or by ""admitting sufficient findings of fact,"" he is entitled to a trial de novo by jury in the second tier.  Appellant, after he pleaded not guilty and after his motion for a jury trial was denied, was tried and convicted in a first-tier court.  He then appealed to the second tier, and after unsuccessfully moving to dismiss on grounds that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy jury trial in the first instance and had been subjected to double jeopardy, he waived a jury trial and was again convicted.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed, holding that the denial of appellant's request to be tried by a jury at his first trial did not violate his constitutional right to a speedy trial or to a trial by jury, and that the Massachusetts procedure did not violate the constitutional prohibition against putting a person twice in jeopardy.
Held:
1. The Massachusetts two-tier court system does not deprive an accused of his Fourteenth Amendment right to a jury trial, but absolutely guarantees trial by jury to persons accused of serious crimes, and the manner specified for exercising this right is fair and not unduly burdensome.  Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, distinguished.  Pp.  427 U. S. 624-630.
(a) Within the system, the jury serves its function of protecting an accused from prosecutorial and judicial misconduct.  Pp.  427 U. S. 625-626.
(b) That an accused may undertake the financial cost of an additional trial does not unconstitutionally burden the right to a jury trial because he is not required to pursue a defense at the lower tier.  Moreover, if an accused is indigent, the State is required to furnish him counsel without cost.  Pp.  427 U. S. 626-627.
(c) Nor does the possibility of a harsher sentence at the second tier impermissibly burden the accused's right to a jury 
Page 427 U. S. 619
 trial.  North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711; Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104.  P.  427 U. S. 627.
(d) Where appellant no longer urges that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, and there is no evidence that there is a greater delay in obtaining a jury in Massachusetts than there would be if the two-tier system were abandoned, it cannot properly be contended that the system unconstitutionally burdens the right to a jury trial by imposing the increased psychological and physical hardships of two trials.  Pp.  427 U. S. 628-629.
2. The Massachusetts procedure does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, and appellant's claim that, because he had been placed once in jeopardy and convicted, the State may not retry him when he decides to ""appeal"" and secure a trial de novo, is without merit.  An accused who elects to be tried de novo is in no different position from a convicted defendant who successfully appeals on the basis of the trial record and gains a reversal of his conviction and a remand for a new trial.  Nothing in the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a State from affording a defendant two opportunities to avoid conviction and secure an acquittal.  Pp.  427 U. S. 630-632.

Decided June 29, 1976
427 U.S. 463

Syllabus 
After an investigation by a State's Attorneys' fraud unit of real estate settlement activities in certain Maryland counties indicated that petitioner, while acting as a settlement attorney, had defrauded the purchaser of certain realty (Lot 13T), the investigators obtained warrants to search petitioner's offices.  The warrants listed specified items pertaining to Lot 13T to be seized, ""together with other fruits, instrumentalities and evidence of crime at this [time] unknown.""  In the ensuing search, a number of incriminating documents, including some containing statements made by petitioner, were seized.  Petitioner was then charged, inter alia, with the crime of false pretenses based on a misrepresentation made to the purchaser of Lot 13T that title to the property was clear.  Petitioner's motion to suppress the seized documents was granted as to some documents, but, with respect to others, the trial court ruled that their admission into evidence would not violate the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  At trial, which resulted in petitioner's conviction, a number of the seized items (including documents pertaining to a lot other than Lot 13T but located in the same subdivision and subject to the same liens as Lot 13T) were admitted in evidence, after being authenticated by prosecution witnesses.  The Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed the conviction and rejected petitioner's constitutional claims.
Held:
1. The search of petitioner's offices for business records, their seizure, and subsequent introduction into evidence did not offend the Fifth Amendment's proscription that ""[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.""  Although the records seized contained statements that petitioner voluntarily had committed to writing, he was never required to say anything.  The search for and seizure of these records were conducted by law enforcement personnel, and when the records were introduced at trial, they were authenticated by prosecution witnesses, not by petitioner.  Therefore, any compulsion of petitioner to speak, other than the inherent psychological 
Page 427 U. S. 464
 pressure to respond at trial to unfavorable evidence, was not present.  Pp.  427 U. S. 470-477.
2. The searches and seizures were not ""unreasonable"" in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  427 U. S. 478-484.
(a) The warrants were not rendered fatally ""general"" by the ""together with"" phrase, which appeared in each warrant at the end of a sentence listing the specified items to be seized, all pertaining to Lot 13T.  This phrase must be read as authorizing only the search for and seizure of evidence relating to the crime of false pretenses with respect to Lot 13T.  Pp.  427 U. S. 479-482.
(b) The seizure of the documents pertaining to a lot other than Lot 13T in the same subdivision and subject to the same liens as Lot 13T did not violate the principle that, when police seize

Syllabus 
The Social Security Act provides that a child of an individual who died fully insured under the Act, is entitled to surviving child's benefits if the child is under 18, or a student under 22, and was dependent at the time of the parent's death.  A child is considered dependent if the insured parent was living with him or contributed to the child's support at the time of death.  Certain children, however, need not submit such individualized proof of dependency.  Unless adopted by some other person, a child who is legitimate or would be entitled to inherit from the insured parent under state law is considered dependent at the time of the parent's death, or even lacking this relationship under state intestacy law is entitled to a presumption of dependency if the decedent before death had gone through a marriage ceremony with the other parent, resulting in a purported marriage which, but for a nonobvious defect, would have been valid, or had acknowledged in writing that the child was his, or had been decreed by a court to be the child's father, or had been ordered by a court to support the child because the child was his.  After their father died, appellee illegitimate children were administratively denied surviving children's benefits on the ground that they failed to show dependency by proof that their father lived with them or was contributing to their support at the time of his death, or by any of the statutory presumptions of dependency.  After this ruling was upheld on administrative appeal, appellees filed an action for review against appellant Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, alleging that the denial of benefits violated the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because other children, including all legitimate children, are statutorily entitled, as appellee children are not, to survivors' benefits regardless of actual dependency.  The District Court held that the statutory classifications were constitutionally impermissible, reversing the administrative decision and ordering that benefits be paid to the children.
Held:
1. The judicial scrutiny traditionally devoted to cases involving 
Page 427 U. S. 496
 discrimination along lines of race or national origin is not required because legislation treats legitimate and illegitimate offspring differently.  Pp.  427 U. S. 503-506.
2. The challenged statutory classifications are permissible because they are reasonably related to the likelihood of dependency at death, and in failing to extend any presumption of dependency to appellee children and others like them, the Act does not impermissibly discriminate against them as compared with legitimate children or those illegitimate children who are statutorily deemed dependent.  Pp.  427 U. S. 507-516.
(a) While Congress was unwilling to assume that every child of a deceased insured was dependent at the time of death, by presuming dependency on the basis of relatively readily documented facts, such as legitimate birth, or a support order or paternity decree, which could be relied upon to indicate the likelihood of continued actual dependency, Congress was able to avoid the burden and expense of specific case-by-case determination in the large number of cases where dependency is objectively probable.  Such presumptions in aid of administrative functions, though they may approximate, rather than precisely mirror, the results that case-by-case adjudication would show, are permissible under the Fifth Amendment, so long as that lack of precise equivalence does not exceed the bounds of substantiality tolerated by the applicable level of scrutiny.  Pp.  427 U. S. 509-510.

427 U.S. 524

Syllabus 
The Social Security Act provides child survivor benefits only to a child who was ""dependent"" upon the deceased insured parent at the time of the parent's death.  Appellant illegitimate child, who did not come under any of the statutory presumptions of dependency to which legitimate children and illegitimate children under some circumstances are entitled under the Act, could establish his status as a dependent child only by showing that his father lived with him or was contributing to his support at the time of death.  Appellant was administratively denied benefits because he could not make such a showing, his father having been killed in military service and never having assumed support.  After this denial was upheld on administrative appeal, a class action was brought on appellant's behalf against appellee Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, seeking relief against denial of the benefits and claiming, inter alia, that, by creating a presumption of dependency, and consequent qualification for benefits, for legitimate children generally, and for illegitimate children under certain circumstances, but denying the presumption to appellant and others similarly situated, the Act discriminated against appellant's class in violation of the equal protection guarantee implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Ultimately, a three-judge District Court, convened when classwide injunctive relief was requested against the allegedly unconstitutional operation of the Act's presumptions of dependency, ruled in appellee's favor on the merits of the constitutional claim and granted summary judgment in his favor.
Held:  Since the decision in Mathews v. Lucas, ante p.  427 U. S. 495, renders the merits of the present case a decided issue in favor of appellee and thus one no longer substantial in the jurisdictional sense, it is unnecessary to decide the jurisdictional question presented as to whether a three-judge court was properly convened upon appellant's demand for injunctive relief, and hence

The Social Security Act provides child survivor benefits only to a child who was ""dependent"" upon the deceased insured parent at the time of the parent's death.  Appellant illegitimate child, who did not come under any of the statutory presumptions of dependency to which legitimate children and illegitimate children under some circumstances are entitled under the Act, could establish his status as a dependent child only by showing that his father lived with him or was contributing to his support at the time of death.  Appellant was administratively denied benefits because he could not make such a showing, his father having been killed in military service and never having assumed support.  After this denial was upheld on administrative appeal, a class action was brought on appellant's behalf against appellee Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, seeking relief against denial of the benefits and claiming, inter alia, that, by creating a presumption of dependency, and consequent qualification for benefits, for legitimate children generally, and for illegitimate children under certain circumstances, but denying the presumption to appellant and others similarly situated, the Act discriminated against appellant's class in violation of the equal protection guarantee implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Ultimately, a three-judge District Court, convened when classwide injunctive relief was requested against the allegedly unconstitutional operation of the Act's presumptions of dependency, ruled in appellee's favor on the merits of the constitutional claim and granted summary judgment in his favor.
Held:  Since the decision in Mathews v. Lucas, ante p.  427 U. S. 495, renders the merits of the present case a decided issue in favor of appellee and thus one no longer substantial in the jurisdictional sense, it is unnecessary to decide the jurisdictional question presented as to whether a three-judge court was properly convened upon appellant's demand for injunctive relief, and hence

Syllabus 
Under Kentucky's two-tier court system, police courts (the first tier) have jurisdiction of misdemeanor cases, but an accused has an appeal of right from a police judge's decision to the circuit court (the second tier), where there is a trial de novo.  The State Constitution requires cities in Kentucky to be classified according to population size.  By statute, judges of police courts in cities of less than a certain population need not be lawyers, but, in larger cities, they must be, and all circuit court judges are lawyers.  In this challenge to the constitutionality of the statutory scheme, held:
1. An accused, who is charged with a misdemeanor for which he is subject to possible imprisonment, is not denied due process when tried before a nonlawyer police court judge in one of the smaller cities, when a later trial de novo is available in the circuit court.  Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U. S. 57; Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, distinguished.  Pp.  427 U. S. 333-339.
2. Nor does the State deny such an accused equal protection of the laws by providing law-trained judges for some police courts and lay judges for others, depending upon the State Constitution's classification of cities according to population, since, as long as all people within each classified area are treated equally, the different classifications within the court system are justified.

Syllabus 
Respondents, Republicans who are non-civil service employees of the Cook County, Ill., Sheriff's Office, brought this suit as a class action for declaratory, injunctive, and other relief against petitioners, including the newly elected Sheriff, a Democrat, and county Democratic organizations, alleging that, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and various statutes, including the Civil Rights Act of 1871, respondents were discharged or (in the case of one respondent) threatened with discharge for the sole reason that they were not affiliated with or sponsored by the Democratic Party. Finding that respondents had failed to show irreparable injury, the District Court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction and ultimately dismissed their complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with instructions to enter appropriate preliminary injunctive relief.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  427 U. S. 351-374;  427 U. S. 374-375.
509 F.2d 1133, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL concluded that:
1. Neither the political question doctrine nor the separation of powers doctrine makes this case inappropriate for judicial resolution, since, inter alia, neither doctrine applies to the federal judiciary's relationship to the States.  Pp.  427 U. S. 351-353.
2. The practice of patronage dismissals violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and respondents thus stated a valid claim for relief.  Pp.  427 U. S. 355-373.
(a) Patronage dismissals severely restrict political belief and association, which constitute the core of those activities protected by the First Amendment, and government may not, without seriously inhibiting First Amendment rights, force a public employee to relinquish his right to political association as the price of holding a public job, Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593; Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U. S. 589.  Pp.  427 U. S. 355-360. 
Page 427 U. S. 348

(b) Though First Amendment rights are not absolute, they may be curtailed only by interests of vital importance, the burden of proving the existence of which rests upon the government, Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1,  424 U. S. 94.  If conditioning the retention of public employment on the employee's support of the in-party is to survive constitutional challenge, it must further some vital government end by a means that is least restrictive of freedom of belief and association in achieving that end, and the benefit gained must outweigh the loss of the constitutionally protected rights.  Pp.  427 U. S. 360-363.
(c) The inefficiency resulting from wholesale replacement of public employees on a change of administration belies the argument that employees not of the same political persuasion as the controlling party will not be motivated to work effectively; nor is it clear that patronage appointees are more qualified than those they replace.  Since unproductive employees may always be discharged and merit systems are available, it is clear that less drastic means than patronage dismissals are available to insure the vital need for government efficiency and effectiveness.  Pp.  427 U. S. 364-367.
(d) The need to insure that policies that the electorate has sanctioned are effectively implemented can be fully satisfied by limiting patronage dismissals to policymaking positions.  Pp.  427 U. S. 367-368.
(e) Patronage dismissals cannot be justified by their contribution to the proper functioning of our democratic process through their assistance to partisan politics, since political parties are nurtured by other methods that are less intrusive.  More fundamentally, any contribution of patronage dismissals to the democratic process does not suffice to override their severe encroachment on First Amendment freedoms.  Pp.  427 U. S. 368-373.
3. Since, at the time the preliminary injunction was sought, one of the named respondents was threatened with job loss, as were many of the class that respondents were seeking to have certified (if they had not already been coerced into supporting the Democratic Party to avoid discharge), First Amendment interests were either threatened or being impaired.  Thus, irreparable injury was shown, and since respondents demonstrated a probability of success on the merits, the issuance of the injunction was properly directed by the Court of Appeals.

Syllabus 
Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires that all federal agencies include an environmental impact statement (EIS)
""in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.""
Respondent environmental organizations, alleging a widespread interest in the rich coal reserves of the ""Northern Great Plains region"" (embracing parts of Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota) and a threat from coal-related operations to their members' enjoyment of the region's environment, brought suit against petitioner officials of the Department of the Interior and other federal agencies responsible for issuing coal leases, approving mining plans, and taking other actions to enable private companies and public utilities to develop coal reserves on federally owned or controlled land.  Respondents claimed that petitioners could not allow further development of coal reserves in the region without preparing a comprehensive EIS under  102(2)(C) on the entire region, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court, on the basis of extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law, held that the complaint stated no claim for relief, and granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment.  While accepting the District Court's findings of fact, the Court of Appeals held, on the basis of the soon-forthcoming interim report of the Northern Great Plains Resources Program (NGPRP) (a study of the potential environmental impact from resource development in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska) as well as other such studies of areas either inclusive of or included within the Northern Great Plains region, that petitioners ""contemplated"" a regional plan or program, and reversed and remanded with instructions to petitioners to inform the 
Page 427 U. S. 391
 District Court of their role in the further development of the region within 30 days after the NGPRP interim report issued, and that, if they decided to control that development, an EIS would be required.  The Court of Appeals also enjoined the Department of the Interior's approval of mining plans in one section of the region for which an EIS already had been prepared.
Held:
1. The NEPA does not require petitioners to prepare an EIS on the entire Northern Great Plains region.  Petitioners have proposed no legislation on the region, and there is no evidence in the record of any proposal for major federal action with respect to the region, but rather it appears that all proposals have been for actions of either local or national scope.  Unless there is a proposal for a regional plan of development, it is not practical to prepare a regional EIS, since, absent such a plan, it is impossible to predict the level of coal-related activity that will occur in the region, and thus to analyze the environmental consequences and the resource commitments involved, and alternatives to, such activity.  Pp.  427 U. S. 398-402.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in both its factual assumptions that the several studies undertaken by petitioners represented attempts to control development on a regional scale, and in its interpretation of the NEPA.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that the NGPRP was aimed toward a regional plan or program, but even if the record justified such a finding, the Court of Appeals' legal conclusion cannot be squared with the NEPA, which, in  102(2)(C), clearly states that an EIS is not required until an agency makes a recommendation or report on a proposal for major federal action.  The Court of Appeals had no authority to depart from the statutory language and, by a balancing of court-devised factors, determine a point at which an EIS should be prepared.  Pp.  427 U. S. 403-406.
3. Assuming that the Court of Appeals' theory about ""contemplation"" of regional action would permit a court to require pre-proposal preparation of an EIS, that court's injunction against approval of the mining plans in one part of the region nevertheless would have been error, since, on the court's own terms, there was, in fact, no harm, and thus no ground for the injunction.  Pp.  427 U. S. 407-408.
4. Respondents' contention as to the relationships of all proposed coal-related projects in the Northern Great Plains region does not require that petitioners prepare one comprehensive EIS 
Page 427 U. S. 392
 covering such projects before proceeding to approve specific pending applications.  Absent a showing that petitioners acted arbitrarily in refusing to prepare one comprehensive EIS on the entire region, it must be assumed that the responsible federal agencies have exercised appropriately their discretion to resolve the technical issue involved in determining the region, if any, with respect to which a comprehensive EIS covering several proposals is necessary.

Syllabus 
In 1968, respondents, Pasadena, Cal., high school students and their parents, brought a purported class action against various school officials seeking injunctive relief from allegedly unconstitutional segregation of the public schools in Pasadena.  The United States intervened as a party plaintiff pursuant to  902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which provides that, upon intervention, ""the United States shall be entitled to the same relief as if it had instituted the action.""  Ultimately, in 1970, the District Court, holding that the defendants' educational policies and procedures violated the Fourteenth Amendment, enjoined the defendants from failing to adopt a desegregation plan, ordered them to submit a plan for desegregating the Pasadena schools which would provide that, beginning with the 1970-1971 school year, there would be no school ""with a majority of any minority students,"" and retained jurisdiction so as to see that such a plan was carried out.  The defendants did not appeal from this decree, and subsequently submitted the ""Pasadena Plan,"" which was approved by the District Court.  In 1974, however, petitioner school officials, successors to the original defendants, filed a motion with the District Court seeking to modify the 1970 order by eliminating the ""no majority"" requirement, whose meaning was admittedly unclear to all the parties, dissolving the injunction, and terminating the court's retained jurisdiction, or, in the alternative, to obtain approval of the petitioners' proposed modifications of the ""Pasadena Plan.""  The District Court denied the motion, largely on the grounds that petitioners had failed to comply with the 1970 order, that literal compliance with the ""no majority"" requirement had occurred only in the initial year of the ""Pasadena Plan's"" operation, that subsequently a number of schools had violated that requirement, and that such requirement was an inflexible one to be applied anew each school year even though subsequent changes in the racial mix in the schools were caused by factors for which petitioners might not be considered responsible.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but with reservations, 
Page 427 U. S. 425
 which it felt the District Court would heed, as to that court's view that it had a lifetime commitment to the ""no majority"" requirement and as to the substance of such requirement.
Held:
1. The United States' presence in the case pursuant to  902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1984 ensures that the case is not moot, although it is moot as to respondent students and parents who were the original named plaintiffs because these students have graduated from the school system and thus they and their parents no longer have any stake in the outcome of the litigation, and there has been no certification of a class of unnamed students still attending the Pasadena schools to be represented by the named plaintiffs.  Pp.  427 U. S. 429-431.
2. Having adopted the ""Pasadena Plan"" in 1970 as establishing a racially neutral system of student assignment in the school system, the District Court exceeded its authority in enforcing its order so as to require annual readjustment of attendance zones so that there would not be a majority of any minority in any Pasadena public school.  Pp.  427 U. S. 431-440.
(a) Since the post-1971 shifts in the racial makeup of some of the schools resulted from changes in the demographics of Pasadena's residential pattern due to a normal pattern of people moving into, out of, and around the school system, and were not attributable to any segregative action on the school officials' part, neither the school officials nor the District Court were
""constitutionally required to make year-by-year adjustments of the racial composition of student bodies once the affirmative duty to desegregate has been accomplished and racial discrimination through official action is eliminated from the system.""
Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1,  402 U. S. 32.  Pp.  427 U. S. 435-436.
(b) The fact that even if the ""no majority"" requirement had been unambiguous, it would be contrary to the intervening decision in Swann, supra, and that, being ambiguous, the parties interpreted it in a manner contrary to the District Court's ultimate interpretation, are factors, which, taken together, support modification, of the 1970 decree.  Pp.  427 U. S. 437-438.
(c) The Court of Appeals' disapproval of the District Court's view that it had a lifetime commitment to the ""no majority"" requirement, and of the substance of that requirement, was not sufficient to remove the requirement from the case, since, even though the Court of Appeals assumed that the District Court would heed such disapproval on remand, the fact remains that, despite such disapproval, the Court of Appeals affirmed the

 District Court's denial of the motion to amend the 1970 order, and thus subjected petitioners to contempt for violation of the injunctive decree notwithstanding that they might have reasonable and proper objections to the decree.

Syllabus 
In 1968, respondents, Pasadena, Cal., high school students and their parents, brought a purported class action against various school officials seeking injunctive relief from allegedly unconstitutional segregation of the public schools in Pasadena.  The United States intervened as a party plaintiff pursuant to  902 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which provides that, upon intervention, ""the United States shall be entitled to the same relief as if it had instituted the action.""  Ultimately, in 1970, the District Court, holding that the defendants' educational policies and procedures violated the Fourteenth Amendment, enjoined the defendants from failing to adopt a desegregation plan, ordered them to submit a plan for desegregating the Pasadena schools which would provide that, beginning with the 1970-1971 school year, there would be no school ""with a majority of any minority students,"" and retained jurisdiction so as to see that such a plan was carried out.  The defendants did not appeal from this decree, and subsequently submitted the ""Pasadena Plan,"" which was approved by the District Court.  In 1974, however, petitioner school officials, successors to the original defendants, filed a motion with the District Court seeking to modify the 1970 order by eliminating the ""no majority"" requirement, whose meaning was admittedly unclear to all the parties, dissolving the injunction, and terminating the court's retained jurisdiction, or, in the alternative, to obtain approval of the petitioners' proposed modifications of the ""Pasadena Plan.""  The District Court denied the motion, largely on the grounds that petitioners had failed to comply with the 1970 order, that literal compliance with the ""no majority"" requirement had occurred only in the initial year of the ""Pasadena Plan's"" operation, that subsequently a number of schools had violated that requirement, and that such requirement was an inflexible one to be applied anew each school year even though subsequent changes in the racial mix in the schools were caused by factors for which petitioners might not be considered responsible.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but with reservations, 
Page 427 U. S. 425
 which it felt the District Court would heed, as to that court's view that it had a lifetime commitment to the ""no majority"" requirement and as to the substance of such requirement.

427 U.S. 445

Syllabus 
Present and retired male employees of the State of Connecticut (petitioners in No. 75-251) brought this class action alleging, inter alia, that certain provisions of the State's statutory retirement benefit plan discriminated against them because of their sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, as amended, extends coverage to the States as employers.  The District Court ruled in their favor and entered prospective injunctive relief against respondent state officials.  But the court denied petitioners' request for an award of retroactive retirement benefits as compensation for losses caused by the State's discrimination, as well as ""a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs,"" as provided in Title VII, holding that both would constitute recovery of money damages from the State's treasury, and were thus precluded by the Eleventh Amendment and by this Court's decision in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, where the District Court's award for welfare benefits wrongfully withheld was held to violate that Amendment, there being no authorization in the Social Security Act for a citizen to sue a State.  The Court of Appeals reversed in the matter of attorneys' fees, the award of which was deemed to have only an ""ancillary effect"" on the state treasury of the sort permitted by Edelman, but otherwise affirmed.
Held:
1. The Eleventh Amendment does not bar a backpay award to petitioners in No. 75-251, since that Amendment and the principle of state sovereignty that it embodies are limited by the enforcement provisions of  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants Congress authority to enforce ""by appropriate 
Page 427 U. S. 446
 legislation"" the substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, which themselves embody significant limitations on state authority.  Congress, in determining what legislation is appropriate for enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment, may, as it has done in Title VII, provide for suits against States that are constitutionally impermissible in other contexts.  The ""threshold fact of congressional authorization"" for a citizen to sue his state employer, which was absent in Edelman, supra, is thus present here.  Pp.  427 U. S. 451-456.

Syllabus 
During negotiations for renewal of an expired collective bargaining agreement with respondent employer, petitioner union and its members engaged in a concerted refusal to work overtime.  The employer filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), claiming that such refusal was an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), but the charge was dismissed on the ground that the refusal did not violate the NLRA, and therefore was not conduct cognizable by the NLRB.  The employer also filed an unfair labor practice complaint with respondent Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, which held that such refusal, while neither protected nor prohibited by the NLRA, was an unfair labor practice under state law, and entered a cease and desist order against the union.  The Wisconsin Circuit Court affirmed and entered a judgment enforcing the order, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The union's concerted refusal to work overtime was peaceful conduct constituting activity that must be free of state regulation if the congressional intent in enacting the comprehensive federal law of labor relations is not to be frustrated.  Congress meant that self-help economic activities, whether of employer or employee, were not to be regulable by States any more than by the NLRB, for neither States nor the NLRB is ""afforded flexibility in picking and choosing which economic devices of labor and management shall be branded as unlawful,"" NLRB v.

Title 42 U.S.C.  1981 provides in part that
""[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens. . . .""
After they had been denied admission to petitioner private schools in Virginia for the stated reason that the schools were not integrated, two Negro children (hereafter respondents), by their parents, brought actions against the schools, alleging that they had been prevented from attending the schools because of the schools' admitted policies of denying admission to Negroes, in violation of  1981, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages.  The District Court, finding that respondents had been denied admission on racial grounds, held that  1981 makes illegal the schools' racially discriminatory admissions policies, and accordingly enjoined the schools and the member schools of petitioner private school association (which had intervened as a party defendant) from discriminating against applicants for admission on the basis of race.  The court also awarded compensatory relief to both children and to the parents of one, and assessed attorneys' fees against each school, but held that the damages claim of the parents of the other child was barred by Virginia's two-year statute of limitations for ""personal injury"" actions, ""borrowed"" for  1981 suits filed in that State.  The Court of Appeals, while reversing the award of attorneys' fees, affirmed the grant of equitable and compensatory relief and the ruling as to the applicable statute of limitations, holding that  1981 is a
""limitation upon private discrimination, and its enforcement in the context of this case is not a deprivation of any right of free association or of privacy of the 
Page 427 U. S. 161
 defendants; of the intervenor, or of their pupils or patrons.""
Held:
1. Section 1981 prohibits private, commercially operated, nonsectarian schools from denying admission to prospective students because they are Negroes.  Pp.  427 U. S. 168-175.
(a) Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, from which  1981 is derived, prohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcing of private contracts.  See Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U. S. 454,  421 U. S. 459-460; Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., 410 U. S. 431,  410 U. S. 439-440.  Cf. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409,  392 U. S. 441-443, n. 78.  Pp.  427 U. S. 168-172.
(b) The racial discrimination practiced by petitioner schools amounts to a classic violation of  1981:  Respondents' parents sought to enter into a contractual relationship with petitioner schools, but neither school offered services on an equal basis to white and nonwhite students.  Pp.  427 U. S. 172-173.
2. Section 1981, as applied in this case, does not violate constitutionally protected rights of free association and privacy, or a parent's right to direct the education of his children.  Pp.  427 U. S. 175-179.
(a) While, under the principle that there is a First Amendment right ""to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas,"" NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U. S. 449,  357 U. S. 460, it may be assumed that parents have a right to send their children to schools that promote the belief that racial segregation is desirable, and that the children have a right to attend such schools, it does not follow that the practice of excluding racial minorities from such schools is also protected by the same principle.  The Constitution places no value on discrimination, and while
""[i]nvidious private discrimination may be characterized as a form of exercising freedom of association protected by the First Amendment . . . , it has never been accorded affirmative constitutional protections.""
Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U. S. 455,  413 U. S. 470.  Pp.  427 U. S. 175-176.
(b) The application of  1981 in this case infringed no parental right such as was recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510; Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205; or Norwood v. Harrison, supra, since no challenge is made to petitioner schools' right to operate, to parents' right to send their children to a particular private school rather than a public school, or to the subject matter that is taught at any private school.  Pp.  427 U. S. 176-177.
(c) While parents have a constitutional right to send their 
Page 427 U. S. 162
 children to private schools and to select private schools that offer specialized instruction, they have no constitutional right to provide their children with private school education unfettered by reasonable government regulation.  Section 1981, as applied to the conduct at issue here, constitutes an exercise of federal legislative power under  2 of the Thirteenth Amendment ""to enforce [that Amendment] by appropriate legislation,"" fully consistent with Meyer v. Nebraska, supra; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra, and the cases that followed in their wake, such power including ""the power to enact laws direct and primary, operating upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by State legislation or not.'""  Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., supra, at  392 U. S. 438.  Pp.  427 U. S. 177-179.
3. Absent a federal statute of limitations for 1981 actions or a Virginia statute of limitations specifically governing civil rights actions, the Court of Appeals applied the appropriate statute of limitations to bar the damages claim in question, particularly where it appears that the Court of Appeals, as well as the Federal District Courts in Virginia, had considered the question in previous federal civil rights litigation, and that the phrase ""personal injuries"" in the Virginia two-year statute of limitations can reasonably be construed to apply to the sort of injuries claimed here and not only to ""physical injuries"" as one respondent's parents contend.  Pp.  427 U. S. 179-182.
4. Absent any federal statute expressly providing for attorneys' fees in  1981 cases or any bad faith on petitioner schools' part in contesting the actions, the Court of Appeals properly reversed the award of such fees.  Nor is implied authority for such an award furnished by the generalized command of 42 U. S. C. 1988 ""to furnish suitable remedies"" to vindicate the rights conferred by the various Civil Rights Acts.  Pp.  427 U. S. 182-186.

Railway Express Agency, 421 U. S. 454,  421 U. S. 459-460; Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., 410 U. S. 431,  410 U. S. 439-440.  Cf. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409,  392 U. S. 441-443, n. 78.  Pp.  427 U. S. 168-172.
(b) The racial discrimination practiced by petitioner schools amounts to a classic violation of  1981:  Respondents' parents sought to enter into a contractual relationship with petitioner schools, but neither school offered services on an equal basis to white and nonwhite students.  Pp.  427 U. S. 172-173.
2. Section 1981, as applied in this case, does not violate constitutionally protected rights of free association and privacy, or a parent's right to direct the education of his children.  Pp.  427 U. S. 175-179.
(a) While, under the principle that there is a First Amendment right ""to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas,"" NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U. S. 449,  357 U. S. 460, it may be assumed that parents have a right to send their children to schools that promote the belief that racial segregation is desirable, and that the children have a right to attend such schools, it does not follow that the practice of excluding racial minorities from such schools is also protected by the same principle.  The Constitution places no value on discrimination, and while
""[i]nvidious private discrimination may be characterized as a form of exercising freedom of association protected by the First Amendment . . . , it has never been accorded affirmative constitutional protections.""
Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U. S. 455,  413 U. S. 470.  Pp.  427 U. S. 175-176.
(b) The application of  1981 in this case infringed no parental right such as was recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510; Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205; or Norwood v. Harrison, supra, since no challenge is made to petitioner schools' right to operate, to parents' right to send their children to a particular private school rather than a public school, or to the subject matter that is taught at any private school.  Pp.  427 U. S. 176-177.
(c) While parents have a constitutional right to send their 
Page 427 U. S. 162
 children to private schools and to select private schools that offer specialized instruction, they have no constitutional right to provide their children with private school education unfettered by reasonable government regulation.  Section 1981, as applied to the conduct at issue here, constitutes an exercise of federal legislative power under  2 of the Thirteenth Amendment ""to enforce [that Amendment] by appropriate legislation,"" fully consistent with Meyer v. Nebraska, supra; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra, and the cases that followed in their wake, such power including ""the power to enact laws direct and primary, operating upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by State legislation or not.'""  Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., supra, at  392 U. S. 438.  Pp.  427 U. S. 177-179.
3. Absent a federal statute of limitations for 1981 actions or a Virginia statute of limitations specifically governing civil rights actions, the Court of Appeals applied the appropriate statute of limitations to bar the damages claim in question, particularly where it appears that the Court of Appeals, as well as the Federal District Courts in Virginia, had considered the question in previous federal civil rights litigation, and that the phrase ""personal injuries"" in the Virginia two-year statute of limitations can reasonably be construed to apply to the sort of injuries claimed here and not only to ""physical injuries"" as one respondent's parents contend.  Pp.  427 U. S. 179-182.
4. Absent any federal statute expressly providing for attorneys' fees in  1981 cases or any bad faith on petitioner schools' part in contesting the actions, the Court of Appeals properly reversed the award of such fees.  Nor is implied authority for such an award furnished by the generalized command of 42 U. S. C. 1988 ""to furnish suitable remedies"" to vindicate the rights conferred by the various Civil Rights Acts.  Pp.  427 U. S. 182-186.

No. 74-1542
Argued January 21, 1976

427 U.S. 246

Syllabus 
Section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as added by the 1970 Amendments to the Act, requires that each State formulate, subject to approval by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an implementation plan providing for attainment of national ambient air quality standards, both primary standards (those necessary to protect the public health) and secondary standards (those necessary to protect the public welfare).  Section 110(a)(2) provides that the Administrator ""shall approve"" the proposed plan if it has been adopted after public notice and hearing and meets eight specified criteria, including provisions for attaining the primary standards ""as expeditiously as practicable but . . . in no case later than three years from the date of approval of such plan,"" and of the secondary standards within a ""reasonable time,"" and provisions for such control measures ""as may be necessary"" to attain both the primary and secondary standards.  Section 307(b)(1) of the Act provides that a petition for review of the Administrator's ""action in approving. . . [the] implementation plan"" may be filed in the appropriate United States court of appeals, and must be filed within 30 days from the date of such approval, or after such date if the petition is based on grounds arising after the 30th day.  Petitioner electric utility company, whose coal-fired generating plants are subject to the sulfur dioxide restrictions in the Missouri implementation plan, did not seek review of the Administrator's approval of that plan within the required 30 days, but, rather, applied to the state and county agencies for, and received, one-year variances.  At a time when petitioner was seeking extension of these variances, the Administrator notified it that sulfur dioxide emissions from its plants were violating the Missouri plan.  Thereupon petitioner filed a petition for review of the Administrator's approval of the plan, claiming that various economic and technological difficulties had arisen more than 30 days after the approval, making compliance with the emission limitations impossible.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, holding that only 
Page 427 U. S. 247
 matters which, if known to the Administrator at the time he approved the state plan, would justify setting aside the approval are properly reviewable after the 30-day period, and that, since claims of economic and technological infeasibility, such as petitioner was asserting here, could not properly justify the Administrator's rejection of a plan, such claims could not serve at any time as the basis for a court's overturning a plan.
Held:
1. Since, regardless of when a petition for review is filed under  307(b)(1), the court is limited to reviewing ""the Administrator's action in approving . . . [the] implementation plan,"" if new ""grounds"" are alleged, they must be such that, had they been known at the time the plan was presented to the Administrator for approval, it would have been an abuse of discretion for him to approve the plan.  A contrary holding would shift a substantial responsibility in administering the Act from the Administrator and the state agencies to the federal courts.  Pp.  427 U. S. 255-256.
2. Since both the language of the relevant provisions of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, especially  110(a)(2), and their legislative history make it clear that Congress intended that grounds of economic and technological infeasibility be deemed wholly foreign to the Administrator's consideration of a state implementation plan, a court of appeals reviewing an approved plan under  307(b)(1) cannot set it aside on such grounds, no matter when they are raised.  Pp.  427 U. S. 256-269.
(a) The mandatory ""shall"" in the provision of  110(a)(2) that the Administrator ""shall approve"" an implementation plan if it satisfies the eight specified criteria, clearly indicates that the Administrator is not to be concerned with factors other than those specified, none of which appears to permit consideration of economic or technological infeasibility.  P.  427 U. S. 257.
(b) The criterion of  110(a)(2) that the primary air quality standards be met ""as expeditiously as practicable but . . . in no case later than three years,"" does not require consideration of claims of economic and technological infeasibility, but, as both the language and legislative history of that criterion make clear, it was intended that the Administrator must approve a plan that provides for attainment of the primary standards in three years even if attainment does not appear possible, the three-year deadline being central to the regulatory scheme of technology forcing.  Pp.  427 U. S. 257-260.
(c) The criterion of  110(a)(2) that the state implementation plan contain such control measures ""as may be necessary"" to achieve the primary and secondary standards does not preclude 
Page 427 U. S. 248
 a State from submitting a plan more stringent than federal law demands, but such requirement demands only that the proposed plan meet the minimum requirements of  110(a)(2), and provides no basis for the Administrator ever to reject a sate implementation plan on the ground that it is economically or technologically infeasible.  Pp.  427 U. S. 260-265.
(d) Since the 1970 Amendments to the Act afford ample opportunity for considering claims of economic and technological infeasibility as long as there will not be substantial interference with the primary goal of promptly attaining the national standards, to allow such claims to be raised by appealing the Administrator's approval of an implementation plan would frustrate congressional intent; would permit a proposed plan to be struck down as infeasible before it is given a chance to work, even though Congress clearly contemplated that some plans would be infeasible when proposed; and would also permit the Administrator or a federal court to reject a State's legislative choices in regulating air pollution, even though Congress plainly left with the States, so long as national standards were met, the power to determine which sources would be burdened by regulation and to what extent.

427 U.S. 273

Syllabus 
Petitioners, both white employees of respondent transportation company, were discharged for misappropriating cargo from one of the company's shipments, but a Negro employee, who was also charged with the same offense, was not discharged.  After subsequent grievance proceedings pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between the company and respondent union and complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) secured no relief, petitioners brought an action against respondents, alleging that in discharging petitioners, while retaining the Negro employee, respondent company had discriminated against petitioners on the basis of race, and that respondent union had acquiesced in this discrimination by failing properly to represent one of the petitioners in the grievance proceeding, all in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits the discharge of ""any individual"" because of ""such individual's race,"" and of 42 U.S.C.  1981, which provides that ""[a]ll persons . . . shall have the same right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens. . . .""  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the pleadings, holding, inter alia, that  1981 is inapplicable to racial discrimination against whites, and that the facts alleged by petitioners failed to state a claim under Title VII.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Title VII, whose terms are not limited to discrimination against members of any particular race, prohibits racial discrimination in private employment against white persons upon the same standards as racial discrimination against nonwhites.  Pp.  427 U. S. 278-285.
(a) Title VII has been so interpreted by the EEOC, whose interpretations are entitled to great deference, and its conclusion accords with uncontradicted legislative history.  Pp.  427 U. S. 279-280.
(b) That petitioners' dismissal was based upon the commission of a criminal offense does not preclude them from seeking relief under Title VII.  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. 
Page 427 U. S. 274
 Green, 411 U. S. 792.  While respondent employer may decide that participation in a theft of cargo may warrant not retaining a person in its employment, this criterion must be ""applied alike to members of all races,"" or Title VII is violated.  Crime or other misconduct may be a legitimate basis for discharge, but it is not a basis for racial discrimination.  Pp.  427 U. S. 281-284.
(c) Respondent union, as well as respondent company, is subject to liability under Title VII, since the same reasons that prohibit an employer from discriminating on the basis of race among culpable employees apply equally to the union, regardless of whether the union, under the circumstances, may find it necessary to compromise in securing retention of some of the affected employees.  Whatever factors such a compromise may legitimately take into account in mitigating discipline of some employees, under Title VII race may not be included.  Pp.  427 U. S. 284-285.
2. Section 1981 prohibits racial discrimination in private employment against white persons as well as nonwhites, and this conclusion is supported both by the statute's language, which explicitly applies to ""all persons,"" and by its legislative history.  While the phrase ""as is enjoyed by white persons"" would seem to lend some support to the argument that the statute is limited to the protection of nonwhite persons against racial discrimination, the legislative history is clear that the addition of the phrase to the statute as finally enacted was not intended to eliminate the prohibition of racial discrimination against whites.

After subsequent grievance proceedings pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between the company and respondent union and complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) secured no relief, petitioners brought an action against respondents, alleging that in discharging petitioners, while retaining the Negro employee, respondent company had discriminated against petitioners on the basis of race, and that respondent union had acquiesced in this discrimination by failing properly to represent one of the petitioners in the grievance proceeding, all in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits the discharge of ""any individual"" because of ""such individual's race,"" and of 42 U.S.C.  1981, which provides that ""[a]ll persons . . . shall have the same right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens. . . .""  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the pleadings, holding, inter alia, that  1981 is inapplicable to racial discrimination against whites, and that the facts alleged by petitioners failed to state a claim under Title VII.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Title VII, whose terms are not limited to discrimination against members of any particular race, prohibits racial discrimination in private employment against white persons upon the same standards as racial discrimination against nonwhites.  Pp.  427 U. S. 278-285.
(a) Title VII has been so interpreted by the EEOC, whose interpretations are entitled to great deference, and its conclusion accords with uncontradicted legislative history.  Pp.  427 U. S. 279-280.
(b) That petitioners' dismissal was based upon the commission of a criminal offense does not preclude them from seeking relief under Title VII.  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. 
Page 427 U. S. 274
 Green, 411 U. S. 792.  While respondent employer may decide that participation in a theft of cargo may warrant not retaining a person in its employment, this criterion must be ""applied alike to members of all races,"" or Title VII is violated.  Crime or other misconduct may be a legitimate basis for discharge, but it is not a basis for racial discrimination.  Pp.  427 U. S. 281-284.
(c) Respondent union, as well as respondent company, is subject to liability under Title VII, since the same reasons that prohibit an employer from discriminating on the basis of race among culpable employees apply equally to the union, regardless of whether the union, under the circumstances, may find it necessary to compromise in securing retention of some of the affected employees.  Whatever factors such a compromise may legitimately take into account in mitigating discipline of some employees, under Title VII race may not be included.  Pp.  427 U. S. 284-285.
2. Section 1981 prohibits racial discrimination in private employment against white persons as well as nonwhites, and this conclusion is supported both by the statute's language, which explicitly applies to ""all persons,"" and by its legislative history.  While the phrase ""as is enjoyed by white persons"" would seem to lend some support to the argument that the statute is limited to the protection of nonwhite persons against racial discrimination, the legislative history is clear that the addition of the phrase to the statute as finally enacted was not intended to eliminate the prohibition of racial discrimination against whites.  Pp.  427 U. S. 285-296.

427 U.S. 297

Syllabus 
A New Orleans ordinance prohibits pushcart food sales in the Vieux Carre, or French Quarter, but by a ""grandfather provision"" exempts pushcart vendors who had operated in the Quarter for eight years.  Appellee, who had conducted a pushcart business there for less than that time, brought suit in the District Court challenging the application of the grandfather provision as a denial of equal protection.  The District Court granted appellant city's motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals, finding the grandfather provision a totally arbitrary and irrational method of achieving the city's conceded authority to regulate street business in the Vieux Carre to preserve the Quarter's values as a tourist attraction, and relying mainly on Morey v. Doud, 354 U. S. 457, reversed, and remanded the case for a determination as to the severability of the grandfather provision.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction of the appeal under 28 U.S.C.  1254(2), which authorizes this Court's review of an appeal by a party relying on a state statute (including a municipal ordinance) held unconstitutional by a court of appeals.  Notwithstanding whether the ordinance as a whole or only its grandfather clause will be invalidated, its unconstitutionality has been definitely and finally adjudicated by the Court of Appeals, leaving no federal issue to be resolved below.
2. The grandfather provision does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Morey v. Doud, supra, overruled.
(a) States have wide latitude in regulating their local economies, and when a local economic regulation like the ordinance here, which is aimed solely at enhancing the Vieux Carre's tourist appeal as part of the economy of New Orleans, is challenged as violating equal protection, this Court defers to the legislative determination as to the desirability of particular statutory discriminations, and only such regulations as amount 
Page 427 U. S. 298
 to an invidious discrimination will be held to violate the Equal Protection Clause.
(b) The city could rationally choose initially to eliminate more recent pushcart vendors, rather than absolutely to bar all pushcart vendors, on the ground that the newer businesses were less likely to have built up substantial reliance interests in the Vieux Carre, and that the two vendors that qualified under the grandfather clause themselves have become part of the distinctive charm of the Quarter.

Argued December 10, 1975
Decided June 25, 1976
427 U.S. 307

Syllabus 
A Massachusetts statute making it mandatory for a uniformed state police officer to retire at age 50 held not to deny equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(a) Rationality, rather than strict scrutiny, is the proper standard for determining whether the statute violates equal protection.  Equal protection analysis requires strict scrutiny of a legislative classification only when it impermissibly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right or operates to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class.  Here, mandatory retirement at 50 does not implicate any fundamental right of a uniformed state police officer over that age, since a right of governmental employment per se is not fundamental, and the class of such officers over 50 does not constitute a suspect class, since classifications based on age are not considered suspect.
(b) Since physical ability generally declines with age, mandatory retirement at 50 serves to remove from police service those whose fitness for uniformed police work has presumptively diminished with age and is, therefore, rationally related to the State's announced legitimate objective of protecting the public by assuring the physical preparedness of its uniformed police.  There is no indication that the statute has the effect of excluding from service so few officers who are in fact unqualified as to render age 50 a criterion wholly unrelated to such objective.  While the State perhaps has not chosen the best means to accomplish its purpose, where rationality is the test, a statute ""does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the classifications made by [it] are imperfect.""

Argued March 24, 1976
Decided June 24, 1976
427 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
After petitioner had been discharged without a hearing by respondent county treasurer from her job in his office, she brought suit against the treasurer, the respondent county, and other county officers in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, claiming that her discharge violated her federal constitutional rights and seeking injunctive relief and damages.  Jurisdiction over the federal claim was asserted under 28 U.S.C.  1343(3), which gives federal district courts jurisdiction over ""any civil action authorized by law to be commenced by any person"" to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of federal constitutional rights, and pendent jurisdiction was alleged to lie over a state law claim against the county.  The District Court dismissed the action as to the county on the ground that, since the county was not suable as a ""person"" under  1983, there was no independent basis of jurisdiction over it, and that thus the court had no power to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the claim against the county.  On an appeal from this dismissal, the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  A fair reading of the language used in  1343(3), together with the scope of  1983, under which counties are excluded from the ""person[s] "" answerable to the 
Page 427 U. S. 2
 plaintiff ""in an action at law [or] suit in equity"" to redress the enumerated deprivations, requires a holding that the joinder of a municipal corporation, like the county here, for purposes of asserting a state law claim not within federal jurisdiction, is without the District Court's statutory jurisdiction.  While, with respect to litigation where nonfederal questions or claims were bound up with the federal claim upon which the parties were already in federal court, there is nothing in Art. III's grant of judicial power that prevents adjudication of the nonfederal portions of the parties' dispute, it is quite another thing to permit a nonfederal claim, in turn, to be the basis for joining a party over whom no independent federal jurisdiction exists, simply because that claim derives from the ""common nucleus of operative fact,"" giving rise to the dispute between the parties to the federal claim.  Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715, distinguished.  The addition of a completely new party under such circumstances would run counter to the well established principle that federal courts, as opposed to state trial courts of general jurisdiction, are courts of limited jurisdiction marked out by Congress.

427 U.S. 38

Syllabus 
On the basis of information that respondent Santana had in her possession marked money used to make a heroin ""buy"" arranged by an undercover agent, police officers went to Santana's house where she was standing in the doorway holding a paper bag, but, as the officers approached, she retreated into the vestibule of her house, where they caught her.  When she tried to escape, envelopes containing what was later determined to be heroin fell to the floor from the paper bag, and she was found to have been carrying some of the marked money on her person.  Respondent Alejandro, who had been sitting on the front steps, was caught when he tried to make off with the dropped envelopes of heroin.  After their indictment for possessing heroin with intent to distribute, respondents moved to suppress the heroin and marked money.  The District Court granted the motion on the ground that, although the officers had probable cause to make the arrests, Santana's retreat into the vestibule did not justify a warrantless entry into the house on the ground of ""hot pursuit.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Santana, while standing in the doorway of her house, was in a ""public place"" for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, since she was not in an area where she had any expectation of privacy, and was not merely visible to the public, but was exposed to public view, speech, hearing, and touch as if she had been standing completely outside her house.  Thus, when the police, who concededly had probable cause to do so, sought to arrest her, they merely intended to make a warrantless arrest in a public place upon probable cause, and did not violate the Fourth Amendment.

2. By retreating into a private place, Santana could not defeat an otherwise proper arrest that had been set in motion in a public place.  Since there was a need to act quickly to prevent destruction of evidence, there was a true ""hot pursuit,"" which need not be an extended hue and cry ""in and about [the] public streets,"" and thus a warrantless entry to make the arrest was

427 U.S. 50

Syllabus 
Respondent operators of two adult motion picture theaters brought this action against petitioner city officials for injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment of unconstitutionality regarding two 1972 Detroit zoning ordinances that amended an ""Anti-Skid Row Ordinance"" adopted 10 years earlier.  The 1972 ordinances provide that an adult theater may not (apart from a special waiver) be located within 1,000 feet of any two other ""regulated uses"" or within 500 feet of a residential area.  The term ""regulated uses"" applies to 10 different kinds of establishments in addition to adult theaters, including adult book stores, cabarets, bars, taxi dance halls, and hotels.  If the theater is used to present
""material distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on matter depicting . . . 'specified Sexual Activities' or 'specified Anatomical Areas,'""
it is an ""adult"" establishment.  The District Court upheld the ordinances, and granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the ordinances constituted a prior restraint on constitutionally protected communication and violated equal protection.  Respondents, in addition to asserting the correctness of that court's ruling with respect to those constitutional issues, contend that the ordinances are void for vagueness.  While not attacking the specificity of the definitions of sexual activities or anatomical areas, respondents maintain (1) that they cannot determine how much of the described activity may be permissible before an exhibition is ""characterized by an emphasis"" on such matter, and (2) that the ordinances do not specify adequate procedures or standards for obtaining a waiver of the 1,000-foot restriction.
Held:
1. The ordinances, as applied to these respondents, do not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment on the ground of vagueness.  Pp.  427 U. S. 58-61.
(a) Neither of the asserted elements of vagueness has affected these respondents, both of which propose to offer adult fare on a regular basis and allege no ground for claiming or anticipating any waiver of the 1,000-foot restriction.  Pp.  427 U. S. 58-59. 
Page 427 U. S. 51

(b) The ordinances will have no demonstrably significant effect on the exhibition of films protected by the First Amendment.  To the extent that any area of doubt exists as to the amount of sexually explicit activity that may be portrayed before material can be said to be ""characterized by an emphasis"" on such matter, there is no reason why the ordinances are not ""readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts.""  This would therefore be an inappropriate case to apply the principle urged by respondents that they be permitted to challenge the ordinances not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because of the assumption that the ordinances' very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.  Pp.  427 U. S. 59-61.
2. The ordinances are not invalid under the First Amendment as prior restraints on protected communication because of the licensing or zoning requirements.  Though adult films may be exhibited commercially only in licensed theaters, that is also true of all films.  That the place where films may be exhibited is regulated does not violate free expression, the city's interest in planning and regulating the use of property for commercial purposes being clearly adequate to support the locational restriction.

(a) Neither of the asserted elements of vagueness has affected these respondents, both of which propose to offer adult fare on a regular basis and allege no ground for claiming or anticipating any waiver of the 1,000-foot restriction.  Pp.  427 U. S. 58-59. 
Page 427 U. S. 51

(b) The ordinances will have no demonstrably significant effect on the exhibition of films protected by the First Amendment.  To the extent that any area of doubt exists as to the amount of sexually explicit activity that may be portrayed before material can be said to be ""characterized by an emphasis"" on such matter, there is no reason why the ordinances are not ""readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts.""  This would therefore be an inappropriate case to apply the principle urged by respondents that they be permitted to challenge the ordinances not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because of the assumption that the ordinances' very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.  Pp.  427 U. S. 59-61.
2. The ordinances are not invalid under the First Amendment as prior restraints on protected communication because of the licensing or zoning requirements.  Though adult films may be exhibited commercially only in licensed theaters, that is also true of all films.  That the place where films may be exhibited is regulated does not violate free expression, the city's interest in planning and regulating the use of property for commercial purposes being clearly adequate to support the locational restriction.  Pp.  427 U. S. 62-63.

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of second-degree murder for killing one Sewell with a knife during a fight.  Evidence at the trial disclosed, inter alia, that Sewell, just before the killing, had been carrying two knives, including the one with which respondent stabbed him, that he had been repeatedly stabbed, but that respondent herself was uninjured.  Subsequently, respondent's counsel moved for a new trial, asserting that he had discovered that Sewell had a prior criminal record (including guilty pleas to charges of assault and carrying a deadly weapon, apparently a knife) that would have tended to support the argument that respondent acted in self-defense, and that the prosecutor had failed to disclose this information to the defense.  The District Court denied the motion on the ground that the evidence of Sewell's criminal record was not material, because it shed no light on his character that was not already apparent from the uncontradicted evidence, particularly the fact that he had been carrying two knives, the court stressing the inconsistency between the self-defense claim and the fact that Sewell had been stabbed repeatedly while respondent was unscathed.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the evidence of Sewell's criminal record was material and that its nondisclosure required a new trial because the jury might have returned a different verdict had the evidence been received.
Held:  The prosecutor's failure to tender Sewell's criminal record to the defense did not deprive respondent of a fair trial as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, where it appears that the record was not requested by defense counsel and gave rise to no inference of perjury, that the trial judge remained convinced of respondent's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt after considering the criminal record in the context of the entire record, and that the judge's first-hand appraisal of the entire record was thorough and entirely reasonable.

 disclosure unless his omission is sufficiently significant to result in the denial of the defendant's right to a fair trial.  Pp.  427 U. S. 107-109.
(b) Whether or not procedural rules authorizing discovery of everything that might influence a jury might be desirable, the Constitution does not demand such broad discovery; and the mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have aided the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish ""materiality"" in the constitutional sense.  Pp.  427 U. S. 109-110.
(c) Nor is the prosecutor's constitutional duty of disclosure measured by his moral culpability or willfulness; if the suppression of evidence results in constitutional error, it is because of the character of the evidence, not the character of the prosecutor.  P.  427 U. S. 110.
(d) The proper standard of materiality of undisclosed evidence, and the standard applied by the trial judge in this case, is that, if the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt of guilt that did not otherwise exist, constitutional error has been committed.  Pp.  427 U. S. 112-114.

Syllabus 
Asserting jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, which provides for suits in the Court of Claims upon any express or implied contract with military exchanges, respondent's decedent brought suit against the United States alleging that his discharge from his position as a civilian employee of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) breached an employment contract.  The Government moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, claiming that the Tucker Act was not applicable to employment contracts and alternatively that AAFES employees do not have a contractual relationship with their employer, but serve by ""appointment.""  Denying this motion, the Court of Claims, after determining that AAFES employees could never serve by appointment, held that it had jurisdiction because respondent's decedent's relationship with the AAFES was based upon an implied contract of employment and such contract was covered by the Tucker Act, as amended in 1970.
Held:  Since the Tucker Act applies, by its terms, to ""any express or implied contract,"" it is applicable to employment contracts as well as those for goods or other services, and hence respondent's decedent's allegations that his discharge constituted a breach of an employment contract was sufficient, under the Act as amended in 1970, to withstand the Government's motion to dismiss.  But in determining whether the decedent was employed by virtue of a contract or by appointment, the Court of Claims gave insufficient attention to applicable administrative regulations relating to the status of AAFES employees, and thus erred in its threshold determination that such employees could never serve by appointment.

Syllabus 
The Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act (Disclosure Act), which is designed to prevent false and deceptive practices in the interstate sale of unimproved tracts of land by requiring developers to disclose information needed by potential purchasers, requires a developer to register a subdivision by filing with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) a statement of record containing information concerning title of the land, the terms and conditions for disposing of lots, the conditions of the subdivision, including access, noise, safety, sewage, utilities, proximity to municipalities, the nature of the developer's proposed improvements, various other specified data, and such additional matters as the Secretary of HUD may require as being reasonably necessary or appropriate for the protection of purchasers.  Such statement of record becomes effective automatically on the 30th day after filing unless the Secretary determines that it is, on its face, incomplete or materially inaccurate, in which case, the effective date is suspended until 30 days after the developer files the information necessary to complete or correct the statement.  After the petitioner developer had filed a statement of record with HUD concerning a certain subdivision, but before the statement became effective, respondent environmental organizations requested HUD to prepare an environmental impact statement on the development before allowing the statement of record to go into effect.  Upon HUD's refusal to do so, the organizations brought suit against the Secretary and the Administrator of HUD's Office of Interstate Land Sales Registration, seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction requiring them, prior to registering the developer's statement of record, to conduct an environmental study in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), which requires all federal agencies, ""to the fullest 
Page 426 U. S. 777
 extent possible,"" to include
""in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment""
an environmental impact statement analyzing the consequences of, and alternatives to, the proposed action.  The District Court ruled for the organizations, holding that NEPA's requirements applied to HUD, and ordering it to prepare an environmental impact statement before approving the developer's statement of record.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  NEPA's environmental impact statement requirement is inapplicable to this case.  Even if the Secretary's allowing a disclosure statement to become effective constituted ""major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment"" within the meaning of NEPA so that an environmental impact statement would ordinarily be required, there would be a clear and fundamental conflict of statutory duty, since the Secretary cannot comply with the duty under the Disclosure Act to allow statements of record to go into effect within 30 days of filing, absent inaccurate or incomplete disclosure, and simultaneously prepare impact statements on proposed developments.  Pp.  426 U. S. 785-793.
(a) While NEPA's instruction that all federal agencies comply with the impact statement requirement ""to the fullest extent possible"" is a deliberate command that the duty NEPA imposes upon the agencies to consider environmental factors not be shunted aside in the bureaucratic shuffle, nevertheless NEPA recognizes that, where a clear and unavoidable conflict in statutory authority exists, NEPA must yield.  Pp.  426 U. S. 787-788.
(b) The Disclosure Act does not leave the Secretary discretion to suspend the effective date of the proposed statement of record for such time as is necessary to prepare an impact statement, but rather mandates that the statement of record's effective date shall be the 30th day after filing, with the sole exception that the Secretary is empowered to suspend the effective date for inadequate disclosure.

Syllabus 
As part of a complex plan for ridding the State of abandoned automobiles, a Maryland statute provided that anyone in possession of an inoperable automobile over eight years old (""hulk"") could transfer it to a licensed scrap processor, who then could claim a ""bounty"" from the State for its destruction, without delivery to the processor or subsequent submission to the State of any documentation of title.  In 1974, the statute was amended to require a processor to submit title documentation in order to receive a bounty.  But the documentation requirements differ as between a processor with a plant in Maryland and an out-of-state processor.  The former need only submit an ""indemnity agreement"" in which an unlicensed hulk supplier certifies his own right to the hulk and agrees to indemnify the processor for any third-party claims arising from its destruction; the non-Maryland processor must submit either a certificate of title, a police certificate vesting title, or a bill of sale from a police auction.  Appellee is a Virginia processor participating in the Maryland plan whose supply of bounty-eligible hulks received from Maryland sources declined after enactment of the 1974 amendment.  Appellee brought suit claiming that the amendment violated the Commerce Clause, and denied appellee equal protection of the laws.  A three-judge District Court granted summary judgment for appellee, and enjoined Maryland from giving further effect to the part of the 1974 amendment that restricts the right to obtain bounties based on indemnity agreements to Maryland processors only.
Held:
1. The amendment does not constitute an impermissible burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  426 U. S. 802-810.
(a) Maryland's amendment of its statute was not the kind of action with which the Commerce Clause is concerned.  Maryland has not sought to prohibit the interstate flow of hulks or to regulate the conditions under which the flow may occur, but, 
Page 426 U. S. 795
 rather, has entered into the market itself by offering bounties to bid up the price of hulks; an impact on interstate commerce has occurred only because the amendment made it more lucrative for unlicensed suppliers to dispose of their hulks in Maryland instead of taking them out of the State.  Pp.  426 U. S. 804-806.
(b) Nothing in the purposes of the Commerce Clause forbids a State's entry into the market as purchaser of potential articles of interstate commerce where the State restricts its trade to its own citizens.  Although the practical effect of the 1974 amendment was to channel the benefits of the bounties to domestic processors, no trade barrier of the type forbidden by the Commerce Clause impedes movement of hulks out of the State.  Pp.  426 U. S. 807-810.
2. Nor does the 1974 amendment deny appellee equal protection of the laws.  The amendment's distinction between domestic and foreign scrap processors, complemented by the reasonable assumptions that hulks delivered to Maryland processors are likely to have been abandoned in Maryland, and those delivered to non-Maryland processors are likely to have been abandoned outside Maryland, bears a rational relationship to the basic statutory purpose of using state funds to clear Maryland's landscape of abandoned automobiles.  That is all the Constitution requires in the case of economic legislation.  That Maryland might have furthered its underlying purpose more artfully, more directly, or more completely does not warrant a conclusion that the method it chose is unconstitutional.  Pp.  426 U.

Syllabus 
The Fair Labor Standards Act was amended in 1974 so as to extend the Act's minimum wage and maximum hour provisions to almost all employees of States and their political subdivisions.  Appellants (including a number of cities and States) in these cases brought an action against appellee Secretary of Labor challenging the validity of these 1974 amendments and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  A three-judge District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.
Held:
1. Insofar as the 1974 amendments operate directly to displace the States' abilities to structure employer employee relationships in areas of traditional governmental functions, such as fire prevention, police protection, sanitation, public health, and parks and recreation, they are not within the authority granted Congress by the Commerce Clause.  In attempting to exercise its Commerce Clause power to prescribe minimum wages and maximum hours to be paid by the States in their sovereign capacities, Congress has sought to wield its power in a fashion that would impair the States' ""ability to function effectively in a federal system,"" Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542,  421 U. S. 547 n. 7, and this exercise of congressional authority does not comport with the federal system of government embodied in the Constitution.  Pp.  426 U.

Syllabus 
The Fair Labor Standards Act was amended in 1974 so as to extend the Act's minimum wage and maximum hour provisions to almost all employees of States and their political subdivisions.  Appellants (including a number of cities and States) in these cases brought an action against appellee Secretary of Labor challenging the validity of these 1974 amendments and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  A three-judge District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.
Held:
1. Insofar as the 1974 amendments operate directly to displace the States' abilities to structure employer employee relationships in areas of traditional governmental functions, such as fire prevention, police protection, sanitation, public health, and parks and recreation, they are not within the authority granted Congress by the Commerce Clause.  In attempting to exercise its Commerce Clause power to prescribe minimum wages and maximum hours to be paid by the States in their sovereign capacities, Congress has sought to wield its power in a fashion that would impair the States' ""ability to function effectively in a federal system,"" Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542,  421 U. S. 547 n. 7, and this exercise of congressional authority does not comport with the federal system of government embodied in the Constitution.  Pp.  426 U.

2. Congress may not exercise its power to regulate commerce so as to force directly upon the States its choices as to how essential decisions regarding the conduct of integral governmental functions are to be made.

Syllabus 
The Ohio Constitution reserves to the people of each municipality in the State the power of referendum with respect to all questions that the municipality is authorized to control by legislation.  Respondent real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a high-rise apartment building on land it owned in petitioner Ohio city.  While the application was pending, the city charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the City Council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum.  The City Planning Commission recommended, and the City Council approved, the proposed zoning change, but the Commission rejected respondent's further application for ""parking and yard"" approval for the proposed apartment building on the ground that the Council's rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum.  Respondent then filed suit in state court, seeking a judgment declaring the city charter amendment invalid as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the people.  While the action was pending, the proposed zoning change was defeated in a referendum.  The charter amendment was upheld by the trial court and by the Ohio Court of Appeals, but the Ohio Supreme Court reversed, holding that the amendment constituted a delegation of power violative of federal constitutional due process guarantees because the voters were given no standards to guide their decision.
Held:  The city charter amendment does not violate the due process rights of a landowner who applies for a zoning change.  Pp.  426 U. S. 672-679.
(a) A referendum, which is a means for direct political participation by the people, allowing them what amounts to a veto power over legislative enactments, cannot be characterized as a delegation of power.  In establishing legislative bodies, the people can reserve to themselves power to deal directly with matters that might otherwise be assigned to the legislature, and here the power of referendum was specifically reserved to the people under the Ohio Constitution.  Pp.  426 U. S. 672-674.

(b) The doctrine that legislative delegation of power to regulatory bodies must be accompanied by discernible standards is inapplicable where, as here, rather than power being delegated, the power exercised is one reserved by the people to themselves.  P.  426 U. S. 675.
(c) A referendum result that is arbitrary and capricious, bearing no relation to police power, is open to challenge in state court, where the scope of the available state remedy would be determined as a matter of state law and under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  426 U. S. 676-677.

Syllabus 
During the course of a protracted dispute over the control of the Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese for the United States and Canada, the Holy Assembly of Bishops and the Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church (Mother Church) suspended and ultimately removed and defrocked the Bishop, respondent Dionisije, and appointed petitioner Firmilian as Administrator of the Diocese, which the Mother Church then reorganized into three Dioceses.  The Serbian Orthodox Church is a hierarchical church, and the sole power to appoint and remove its Bishops rests in the Holy Assembly and Holy Synod.  Dionisije filed suit in the Illinois courts seeking to enjoin petitioners from interfering with Diocesan assets of respondent not-for-profit Illinois corporations and to have himself declared the true Diocesan Bishop.  After a lengthy trial, the trial court resolved most of the disputed issues in favor of petitioners.  The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that Dionisije's removal and defrockment had to be set aside as ""arbitrary"" because the proceedings against him had not in its view been conducted in accordance with the Church's constitution and penal code, and that the Diocesan reorganization was invalid because it exceeded the scope of the Mother Church's authority to effectuate such changes without Diocesan approval.
Held:
1. The holding of the Illinois Supreme Court constituted improper judicial interference with the decisions of a hierarchical church and in thus interposing its judgment into matters of ecclesiastical cognizance and polity, the court contravened the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  426 U. S. 708-725.

426 U.S. 736

Syllabus 
In 1971, a Maryland statute was enacted that authorizes the payment of state funds to any private institution of higher learning within the State that meets certain minimum criteria, and refrains from awarding ""only seminarian or theological degrees.""  The aid is in the form of an annual fiscal year subsidy to qualifying colleges and universities, based upon the number of students, excluding those in seminarian or theological academic programs.  The grants are noncategorical, but may not, under a provision added in 1972, ""be utilized by the institutions for sectarian purposes.""  The assistance program is primarily administered by the Maryland Council for Higher Education, which, in order to insure compliance with statutory restrictions, (1) determines whether an applicant institution is eligible at all, or is one ""awarding primarily theological or seminary degrees,"" and (2) requires that eligible institutions not use funds for sectarian purposes.  At the end of the fiscal year, the recipient institution must make a report and separately identify the aided nonsectarian expenditures, subject to the Council's verification if necessary.  This suit was brought by appellants, four individual Maryland citizens and taxpayers, who challenged the statutory scheme as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and claimed that appellees, four colleges affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, were constitutionally ineligible for the state aid.  The District Court, applying the three-part requirement of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (viz., state aid such as this must have a secular purpose, a primary effect other than the advancement of religion, and no tendency to entangle the State excessively in church affairs), upheld the statute and denied appellants relief.  The court found that, despite their formal affiliation with the Roman Catholic Church, appellee colleges are not ""pervasively sectarian.""  The court also found that aid was, in fact, extended only to ""the secular side,"" having taken cognizance of the statutory prohibition against sectarian use, and the Council's administrative 
Page 426 U. S. 737
 enforcement of that prohibition.  The court also found that
""there is no necessity for state officials to investigate the conduct of particular classes of educational programs to determine whether a school is attempting to indoctrinate its students under the guise of secular education,""
and that ""excessive entanglement"" does not necessarily result from the fact that the subsidy is on an annual basis.  Though occasional audits are possible to verify the sectarian purposes of expenditures, the District Court found that they would be ""quick and nonjudgmental.""
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  426 U. S. 745-767;  426 U. S. 767-770.
387 F.Supp. 1282, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that the Maryland Act does not, under the standards set by Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra, at  403 U. S. 612-613, violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  403 U. S. 745-767.
(a) The first part of Lemon's three-pronged test is not at issue here, since appellants do not challenge the District Court's finding that the Maryland aid program is the secular one of supporting private higher education generally, as an economic alternative to a wholly public system.  P.  426 U. S. 754.
(b) The aid provided under the Maryland statute does not have a primary effect of advancing religion under the refinement of the test added by Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734,  413 U. S. 743, that aid has such an effect
""when it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission or when it funds a specifically religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.""
Here, the District Court's finding that appellee colleges are not ""pervasively sectarian"" was supported by a number of subsidiary findings concerning the role of religion on the college campuses.  Such findings are not clearly erroneous, and the general picture that the District Court has painted of the appellee institutions is similar in almost all respects to that of the church-affiliated colleges considered in Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, and Hunt v. McNair, supra.  Pp.  426 U. S. 755-759.
(c) The District Court also correctly concluded that the other aspect of the ""primary effect"" test was satisfied, i.e., that aid, in fact, is extended only to ""the secular side.""  Hunt, supra, requires only that state funds not be used to support ""specifically religious activity,"" and it is clear that the funding program here meets this requirement.  The statute forbids use of funds for ""sectarian 
Page 426 U. S. 738
 purposes,"" and the prohibition appears to be at least as broad as the constitutional prohibition announced in Hunt.  Pp.  426 U. S. 759-761.
(d) When account is taken of the relevant factors considered by the District Court, its conclusion that the Maryland scheme does not foster an excessive entanglement with religion must be upheld.  The colleges, as the court found, perform ""essentially secular educational functions.""  The fact that the subsidy is an annual one does not necessarily implicate ""excessive entanglement,"" the aid program here more closely resembling that found constitutionally acceptable in Tilton v. Richardson, supra, than that found unacceptable in Lemon, supra.  Though occasional audits are possible here, they and other contacts between the Council and the colleges are not likely to be more entangling than inspections and audits involved in the course of normal college accreditations.  And here, unlike the situation in Lemon, the State can identify and subsidize separate secular school functions without on-site inspections.  Finally, with respect to political divisiveness, the District Court correctly found that the Maryland program did not create a substantial danger of political entanglement, the court having properly stressed the facts that the aided institutions are colleges, not elementary or secondary schools; that aid is extended to colleges generally, more than two-thirds of which have no religious affiliation; and that the four colleges are substantially autonomous.  Pp.  426 U. S. 761-767.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that there is no violation of the Establishment Clause where, as in this case, there is a secular legislative purpose and the primary effect of the legislation is neither to advance nor inhibit religion.  There is no reason to pursue the constitutional inquiry further.  See Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra, at  403 U. S. 661 (opinion of WHITE, J.); Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756,  413 U. S. 813 (WHITE, J., dissenting).  Pp.  426 U. S. 767-770.

Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, and Hunt v. McNair, supra.  Pp.  426 U. S. 755-759.
(c) The District Court also correctly concluded that the other aspect of the ""primary effect"" test was satisfied, i.e., that aid, in fact, is extended only to ""the secular side.""  Hunt, supra, requires only that state funds not be used to support ""specifically religious activity,"" and it is clear that the funding program here meets this requirement.  The statute forbids use of funds for ""sectarian 
Page 426 U. S. 738
 purposes,"" and the prohibition appears to be at least as broad as the constitutional prohibition announced in Hunt.  Pp.  426 U. S. 759-761.
(d) When account is taken of the relevant factors considered by the District Court, its conclusion that the Maryland scheme does not foster an excessive entanglement with religion must be upheld.  The colleges, as the court found, perform ""essentially secular educational functions.""  The fact that the subsidy is an annual one does not necessarily implicate ""excessive entanglement,"" the aid program here more closely resembling that found constitutionally acceptable in Tilton v. Richardson, supra, than that found unacceptable in Lemon, supra.  Though occasional audits are possible here, they and other contacts between the Council and the colleges are not likely to be more entangling than inspections and audits involved in the course of normal college accreditations.  And here, unlike the situation in Lemon, the State can identify and subsidize separate secular school functions without on-site inspections.  Finally, with respect to political divisiveness, the District Court correctly found that the Maryland program did not create a substantial danger of political entanglement, the court having properly stressed the facts that the aided institutions are colleges, not elementary or secondary schools; that aid is extended to colleges generally, more than two-thirds of which have no religious affiliation; and that the four colleges are substantially autonomous.  Pp.  426 U. S. 761-767.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that there is no violation of the Establishment Clause where, as in this case, there is a secular legislative purpose and the primary effect of the legislation is neither to advance nor inhibit religion.  There is no reason to pursue the constitutional inquiry further.  See Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra, at  403 U. S. 661 (opinion of WHITE, J.); Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756,  413 U. S. 813 (WHITE, J., dissenting).  Pp.  426 U. S. 767-770.

Syllabus 
After negotiations for renewal of a collective bargaining contract between respondent teachers and petitioner Wisconsin School Board failed to produce agreement, the teachers went on strike in direct violation of Wisconsin law.  The Board thereafter conducted individual disciplinary hearings.  Through counsel, the striking teachers advised that they wished to be treated as a group, and contended that the Board was not sufficiently impartial properly to discipline them.  The Board terminated the striking teachers' employment, whereupon respondent teachers brought this suit, contending, inter alia, that the hearing was inadequate to meet due process requirements.  The state trial court granted the Board's motion for summary judgment.  The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed, holding that the procedure followed by the Board had violated federal due process requirements, since an impartial decisionmaker was required to resolve the controversy, and the Board was not sufficiently impartial.  Since state law afforded no adequate remedy, the court provided that, after the Board's notice to fire a teacher and a hearing, a teacher dissatisfied with the Board's decision could secure a de novo hearing from a county court of record on all issues.
Held:  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not guarantee respondent teachers that the decision to terminate their employment would be made or reviewed by a body other than the School Board.  Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, distinguished.  Pp.  426 U. S. 489-497.
(a) The record does not support respondents' contention that the Board members had a personal or official stake in the dismissal decision sufficient to disqualify them.  Pp.  426 U. S. 491-492.

Syllabus 
In April 1974, virtually all the Nation's railroads, including appellees, the Chessie System, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) a joint petition for a general revenue increase, stating as a reason therefor that ""billions of dollars are needed immediately and in the coming decade for maintenance and improvement of the Nation's rail transportation plant.""  Though the ICC on June 3, 1974, suspended the operation of the new schedules, it authorized the railroads to file new tariffs subject to conditions that would assure that the additional revenue would be expended for ""delayed capital improvements"" and ""deferred maintenance"" of plant and equipment, defining those terms in a subsequent order, which also permitted up to 3% of the revenue derived from the increase to be applied to higher nonfuel material and supply costs.  Thereafter, appellees, alleging that they had no ""deferred maintenance"" or ""delayed capital improvements"" that would qualify under the ICC's definitions; that they were precluded from applying the additional revenues to earlier commitments; and that they were placed at a competitive disadvantage with railroads that could meet the ICC's conditions, sought reconsideration from the ICC.  Dissatisfied with the ICC's response, appellees brought this suit attacking the lawfulness of the conditions imposed and seeking to have the ICC's orders set aside.  The District Court issued an injunction prohibiting the ICC from enforcing against appellees those portions of the challenged orders that required revenues to be spent for specified purposes, concluding that ""Congress has not authorized the [ICC] to control a carrier's expenditure of funds as a condition to withholding the suspension of rates.""
Held:  The ICC may, as a condition for not suspending and subsequently investigating the lawfulness of a proposed tariff, require the railroads to devote the additional revenues for the purposes the carriers invoked in support of the increase.  Pp.  426 U. S. 509-515.
(a) Imposition of the condition precedent to the immediate

 implementation of the rate increase was directly related to the ICC's statutory mandate to assess the reasonableness of the rates and to suspend them if there was a question as to their legality.  Instead of suspending the proposed rates for the seven-month statutory period, as it could have done, the ICC offered an alternative more precisely tailored to the particular circumstances presented.  P.  426 U. S. 514.
(b) Since the District Court held that the ICC did not have the power to impose conditions on the refiling of the tariff, it did not consider appellees' contention that their inability to use the new revenues makes the ICC's action arbitrary and capricious as to them, and that question may, if appellees choose, be raised on remand.

The Wild Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act (Act) was enacted to protect ""all unbranded and unclaimed horses and burros on public lands of the United States"" from ""capture, branding, harassment, or death,"" to accomplish which ""they are to be considered in the area where presently found, as an integral part of the natural system of the public lands.""  The Act provides that all such animals on the public lands administered by the Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or by the Secretary of Agriculture through the Forest Service are committed to the jurisdiction of the respective Secretaries, who are
""directed to protect and manage [the animals] as components of the public lands . . . in a manner that is designed to achieve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance on the public lands,""
and if the animals stray from those lands onto privately owned land, the private landowners may inform federal officials, who shall arrange to have the animals removed.  Appellees, the State of New Mexico, its Livestock Board and director, and the purchaser of three unbranded burros seized by the Board (pursuant to the New Mexico Estray Law) on federal lands and sold at public auction, and whose return to public lands had been demanded by the BLM, brought this suit for injunctive relief and for a declaratory judgment that the Act is unconstitutional.  A three-judge District Court held the Act unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement.
Held:  As applied to this case, the Act is a constitutional exercise of congressional power under the Property Clause of the Constitution, which provides that
""Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.""
Art. IV,  3, cl. 2.  Pp.  426 U. S. 535-547.
(a) The Clause, in broad terms, empowers Congress to determine what are ""needful"" rules ""respecting"" the public lands, and there is no merit to appellees' narrow reading that the provision

(b) In arguing that the Act encroaches upon state sovereignty and that Congress can obtain exclusive legislative jurisdiction over the public lands in a State only by state consent (absent which it may not act contrary to state law), appellees have confused Congress' derivative legislative power from a State pursuant to Art. I,  8, cl. 17, with Congress' powers under the Property Clause.  Federal legislation under that Clause necessarily, under the Supremacy Clause, overrides conflicting state laws.

Section 232(b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended by the Trade Act of 1974, provides that, if the Secretary of the Treasury finds that an
""article is being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security,""
the President is authorized to
""take such action, and for such time, as he deems necessary to adjust the imports of [the] article and its derivatives so that . . . imports [of the article] will not threaten to impair the national security.""
When it appeared that a prior program established under  232(b) for adjusting oil imports was not fulfilling its objectives, the Secretary of the Treasury initiated an investigation.  On the basis of this investigation, the Secretary found that crude oil and its derivatives and related products were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security, and accordingly recommended to the President that appropriate action be taken to reduce the imports.  Following this recommendation, the President promptly issued a Proclamation, inter alia, raising the license fees on imported oil.  Thereafter, respondents -- eight States and their Governors, 10 utility companies, and a Congressman -- brought suits against petitioners challenging the license fees on the ground, inter alia, that they were beyond the President's authority under  232(b).  The District Court denied relief, holding that  232(b) is a valid delegation to the President of the power to impose license fees on imports, and that the procedures followed by the President and the Secretary in imposing the fees fully complied with the statute.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  232(b) does not authorize the President to impose a license fee scheme as a method of adjusting imports, but encompasses only the use of ""direct"" controls such as quotas.
Held:  Section 232(b) authorizes the action taken by the President.  Pp.  426 U. S. 558-571.
(a) Section 232(b) does not constitute an improper delegation 
Page 426 U. S. 549
 of power, since it establishes clear preconditions to Presidential action, including a finding by the Secretary of the Treasury that an article is being imported in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.  Moreover, even if these preconditions are met, the President can act only to the extent he deems necessary to adjust the imports so that they will not threaten to impair the national security, and  32(c) sets forth specific factors for him to consider in exercising his authority.  Pp.  426 U. S. 558-560.
(b) In authorizing the President to ""take such action and for such time, as he deems necessary to adjust the imports of [an] article and its derivatives,""  232(b)'s language clearly grants him a measure of discretion in determining the method used to adjust imports, and there is no support in the statute's language that the authorization to the President to ""adjust"" imports should be read to encompass only quantitative methods, i.e., quotas, as opposed to monetary methods, i.e., license fees, of effecting such adjustments; so to limit the word ""adjust"" would not comport with the range of factors that can trigger the President's authority under  232(b)'s language.  Pp.  426 U. S. 561-562.
(c) Furthermore,  232(b)'s legislative history amply indicates that the President's authority extends to the imposition of monetary exactions, i.e., license fees and duties, and belies any suggestion that Congress, despite its use of broad language in the statute itself, intended to confine the President's authority to the imposition of quotas and to bar him from imposing a license fee system such as the one in question.

On the basis of this investigation, the Secretary found that crude oil and its derivatives and related products were being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security, and accordingly recommended to the President that appropriate action be taken to reduce the imports.  Following this recommendation, the President promptly issued a Proclamation, inter alia, raising the license fees on imported oil.  Thereafter, respondents -- eight States and their Governors, 10 utility companies, and a Congressman -- brought suits against petitioners challenging the license fees on the ground, inter alia, that they were beyond the President's authority under  232(b).  The District Court denied relief, holding that  232(b) is a valid delegation to the President of the power to impose license fees on imports, and that the procedures followed by the President and the Secretary in imposing the fees fully complied with the statute.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  232(b) does not authorize the President to impose a license fee scheme as a method of adjusting imports, but encompasses only the use of ""direct"" controls such as quotas.
Held:  Section 232(b) authorizes the action taken by the President.  Pp.  426 U. S. 558-571.
(a) Section 232(b) does not constitute an improper delegation 
Page 426 U. S. 549
 of power, since it establishes clear preconditions to Presidential action, including a finding by the Secretary of the Treasury that an article is being imported in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.  Moreover, even if these preconditions are met, the President can act only to the extent he deems necessary to adjust the imports so that they will not threaten to impair the national security, and  32(c) sets forth specific factors for him to consider in exercising his authority.  Pp.  426 U. S. 558-560.
(b) In authorizing the President to ""take such action and for such time, as he deems necessary to adjust the imports of [an] article and its derivatives,""  232(b)'s language clearly grants him a measure of discretion in determining the method used to adjust imports, and there is no support in the statute's language that the authorization to the President to ""adjust"" imports should be read to encompass only quantitative methods, i.e., quotas, as opposed to monetary methods, i.e., license fees, of effecting such adjustments; so to limit the word ""adjust"" would not comport with the range of factors that can trigger the President's authority under  232(b)'s language.  Pp.  426 U. S. 561-562.
(c) Furthermore,  232(b)'s legislative history amply indicates that the President's authority extends to the imposition of monetary exactions, i.e., license fees and duties, and belies any suggestion that Congress, despite its use of broad language in the statute itself, intended to confine the President's authority to the imposition of quotas and to bar him from imposing a license fee system such as the one in question.  Pp.  426 U. S. 562-571.

Syllabus 
A Puerto Rico statute permits only United States citizens to practice privately as civil engineers.  Appellees are alien civil engineers residing in Puerto Rico, one of whom (Flores de Otero) was denied a license under the statute, and the other of whom (Perez Nogueiro) was granted only a conditional license to work for the Commonwealth.  Each appellee brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant Examining Board and its members in the United States District Court in Puerto Rico, claiming jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1343(3) and alleging that the statute's citizenship requirement violated 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Section 1343(3) gives district courts jurisdiction of actions ""[to] redress the deprivation, under color of any State law"" of federal constitutional rights, privileges, or immunities, and  1983 provides that ""[e]very person who, under color of any statute . . . of any State or Territory"" deprives another of ""any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws"" shall be liable to the party injured in a proper action.  In the Flores de Otero action, a three-judge court, after determining that it had jurisdiction under  1343 to enforce  1983, and that abstention was unnecessary, held the citizenship requirement unconstitutional and directed that Flores be fully licensed as a civil engineer.  In a separate and subsequent judgment, the same court granted like relief to Perez.
Held:
1. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1343(3) to enforce the provisions of 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Pp.  426 U. S. 580-597.
(a) The federal territorial, as well as the United States district and circuit courts, as confirmed by the legislative history

(b) The history of the legislation specifically respecting Puerto Rico supports the conclusion that the United States District Court in Puerto Rico prior to Puerto Rico's becoming a Commonwealth in 1952 had the same jurisdiction to enforce  1983 as that conferred by  1343(3) and its predecessors on the United States district courts in the several States, and that Congress, by entering into the compact by which Puerto Rico assumed ""Commonwealth"" status, did not intend to leave the protection of federal right.s exclusively to the local Puerto Rico courts and to repeal by implication the jurisdiction of the United States District Court in Puerto Rico to enforce  1983.  Pp.  426 U. S. 586-595.
(c) While Puerto Rico occupies a unique relationship to the United States, it does not follow that Congress intended to relinquish enforcement of  1983 by restricting the jurisdiction of the United States District Court in Puerto Rico, cf. District of Columbia v. Carter, 409 U. S. 418, and whether Puerto Rico is considered a Territory or a State for purposes of the jurisdictional question is of little consequence, because each is included within  1983 and, therefore, within  1343(3).  Pp.  426 U. S. 595-597.

3. Puerto Rico's prohibition of an alien's engaging in the private practice of engineering deprives appellees of ""rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,"" within the meaning of  1983.  Pp.  426 U. S. 599-606.
(a) The question whether it is the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth that protects Puerto Rico residents need not be resolved since, irrespective of which Amendment applies, the statutory restriction on the ability of aliens to engage in the otherwise lawful private practice of civil engineering is plainly unconstitutional.

(b) The validity of the statute must be determined under the principles that state classifications based on alienage are subject to ""strict judicial scrutiny,"" and that laws containing such classifications will be upheld only if the State or Territory imposing them is able to satisfy the burden of demonstrating that

Syllabus 
During the course of their state criminal trials petitioners, who, after arrest, were given warnings in line with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436,  384 U. S. 467-473, took the stand and gave an exculpatory story that they had not previously told to the police or the prosecutor.  Over their counsel's objection, they were cross-examined as to why they had not given the arresting officer the exculpatory explanations.  Petitioners were convicted, and their convictions were upheld on appeal.
Held:  The use for impeachment purposes of petitioners' silence, at the time of arrest and after they received Miranda warnings, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Post-arrest silence following such warnings is insolubly ambiguous; moreover, it would be fundamentally unfair to allow an arrestee's silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently given at trial after he had been impliedly assured, by the Miranda warnings, that silence would carry no penalty.

Syllabus 
Respondent was indicated for first-degree murder, but, by agreement with the prosecution and on counsel's advice, respondent pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced.  Subsequently, after exhausting his state remedies in an unsuccessful attempt to have his conviction vacated on the ground that his guilty plea was involuntary, respondent filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, alleging that his guilty plea was involuntary because, inter alia, he was not aware that intent to cause death was an element of second-degree murder.  The District Court ultimately heard the testimony of several witnesses, including respondent and his defense counsel in the original prosecution; and the transcript of the relevant state court proceedings and certain psychological evaluations of respondent, who was substantially below average intelligence, were made part of the record.  On the basis of the evidence thus developed, the District Court found that respondent had not been advised by counsel or the state court that an intent to cause death was an essential element of second-degree murder, and, based on this finding, held that the guilty plea was involuntary, and had to be set aside.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Since respondent did not receive adequate notice of the offense to which he pleaded guilty, his plea was involuntary, and the judgment of conviction was entered without due process of law.

426 U.S. 660

Syllabus 
Under the New Jersey Transportation Benefits Tax Act, New Jersey does not tax its residents' domestic income, but does tax nonresidents' New Jersey-derived income and imposes an equivalent tax on residents' income earned outside the State except that such income is exempted to the extent it is taxed by the State in which it is earned.  The New Hampshire Commuters Tax was held unconstitutional in Austin v. New Hampshire, 420 U. S. 656, in violation of the Privilege and Immunities Clause because it fell exclusively on nonresidents' income and was not offset by other taxes imposed on residents alone.  Pennsylvania, suing on behalf of itself and as parens patriae on behalf of its citizens, moved to file an original bill of complaint against New Jersey, contending that the New Jersey tax Act violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause as interpreted in Austin, supra, and also the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and an accounting for taxes diverted from its treasury by the New Jersey tax.  Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont on behalf of themselves, moved, in reliance on Austin, supra, to file an original bill of complaint against New Hampshire seeking an accounting for the taxes diverted from their respective treasuries by the New Hampshire Commuters Income Tax.  Pennsylvania, Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont all extend a tax credit to their residents for income taxes paid to other States.
Held:
1. The motions for leave to file bills of complaint based on claims brought by the plaintiff States on their own behalf are denied.  In neither suit has the defendant State directly injured the plaintiff States by imposing the taxes in question, but the injuries to the plaintiffs' fiscs were self-inflicted, resulting from decisions by their respective state legislatures to allow their residents credit for taxes paid to other States.  Moreover, the Privileges and Immunities and Equal Protection Clauses protect people, not States. 
Page 426 U. S. 661

2. Pennsylvania's motion for leave to file suit as parens patriae on behalf of its citizens is also denied, since such a suit represents nothing more than a collectivity of private suits against New Jersey for taxes withheld from private parties, and no  sovereign or quasi-sovereign interests of Pennsylvania are implicated.

|426 u.s. 363|"New Hampshire v. Maine
No. 64, Orig.
Argued April 19, 1976
Decided June 14, 1976
426 U.S. 363

Syllabus 
Following institution of this original action by New Hampshire against Maine to locate the lateral marine boundary separating the States between the mouth of Portsmouth Harbor and the entrance to Gosport Harbor in the Isles of Shoals, a settlement agreement was reached and a joint motion was filed for entry of judgment by consent, together with a proposed decree, based on a stipulated record, which the Special Master concluded should be submitted to the Court, at the same time expressing the view that the decree was impermissible under Vermont v. New York, 417 U. S. 270, but recommending its entry if the Court concluded otherwise.  Thereafter, the Special Master declared the entire case, including the proposed consent decree, to be under submission.  The States had agreed with the Special Master's conclusion that King George II's decree of 1740 fixed the boundary in the Piscataqua (now Portsmouth) Harbor area, but had differed over the location of certain points by the terms of the decree.  The consent decree embodied the States' agreement upon the meaning of those terms.
Held:
1. Entry of the consent decree proposes a wholly permissible final resolution of the controversy both as to the facts and the law, and comports with the Court's Art. III function.  The States' agreement can therefore be effectuated.  The proposed decree in Vermont v. New York, supra, provided that ""no findings shall be made,"" and that ""it shall not constitute an adjudication of any issue of fact or law, or evidence, or any admission by any party with respect to any such issue,"" whereas the proposed consent decree here records the States' agreement as to the meaning and extent of hitherto imprecisely described locations in line with the relevant evidence; nor is anything like the ""arbitral"" function for resolution of future disputes in Vermont v. New York involved in the proposed consent decree here.  Pp.  426 U. S. 367-369.
2. Adoption of the proposed consent decree does not involve a compact under Art. I,  10, cl. 3, requiring the consent of Congress.  The application of that Clause is limited to agreements
""directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach 
Page 426 U. S. 364
 upon. . . . the just supremacy of the United States,""
Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U. S. 503,  148 U. S. 519.  Here, the litigant States are not adjusting the boundary between them, which was fixed by the 1740 decree; the consent decree simply locates precisely the already existing boundary, and neither State is enhancing its power and threatening supremacy of the Federal Government.  Pp.  426 U. S. 369-370.
BRENNAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and STEWART, MARSHALL, POWELL, and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined.  WHITE, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which BLACKMUN and STEVENS, JJ., joined, post, p.  426 U. S. 370.

Argued April 20, 1976

426 U.S. 373

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an enrolled Chippewa Indian, brought this suit in state court seeking a declaratory judgment that the State of Minnesota and respondent county lacked authority to impose a personal property tax on his mobile home located on land held in trust for members of his tribe, and that imposition of such a tax contravened federal law.  The trial court rejected the contention.  The Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the grant of civil jurisdiction to the State in  4(a) of Pub.L. 280 includes taxing authority, and, since  4(b) does not exempt nontrust property from such authority, the county had power to assess the tax.  Section 4(a) gave various States, including Minnesota, with respect to all Indian country within the State except as specifically exempted,
""jurisdiction over civil causes of action between Indians or to which Indians are parties which arise in the areas of Indian country listed . . . to the same extent that such State . . . has jurisdiction over other civil causes of action, and those civil laws of such State . . . that are of general application to private persons or private property shall have the same force and effect within such Indian country as they have elsewhere within the State. . . .""
Though tax laws are not specifically mentioned, the State Supreme Court concluded that they were included, since the exempting provision,  4(b), does not exempt nontrust property, but states that
""[n]othing in this section shall authorize the . . . taxation of any real or personal property . . . belonging to any Indian or any Indian tribe . . . that is held in trust by the United States. . . .""
Held:  Public Law 280 did not grant States the authority to impose taxes on reservation Indians.  Pp.  426 U. S. 379-393.
(a) The central focus of Pub.L. 280, embodied in  2 of the Act, was to confer on the States criminal jurisdiction with respect to crimes involving Indians, and no mention was made of a congressional intent to authorize the States to tax Indians or Indian property on Indian reservations, a significant omission in light of applying the canons of construction to statutes affecting Indian immunities, where some mention would normally be expected had Congress contemplated  sweeping change in the status of reservation Indians.  Pp.  426 U. S. 379-383. 
Page 426 U. S. 374

(b) Section 4(a) seems to have been intended primarily to provide a state forum for resolving private legal disputes involving Indians.  Pp.  426 U. S. 383-386.
(c) When Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 amended Pub.L. 280 to require tribal consent to any new state jurisdiction, Congress in effect characterized the relevant part of Pub.L. 280 as conferring the power to resolve private civil controversies, and the legislative history of Title IV would make it difficult to construe  4 jurisdiction acquired pursuant to that Title as extending general state regulatory power, including taxing power, to govern Indian reservations.  Pp.  426 U. S. 386-387.
(d) Public L. 280 was plainly not meant to effect total assimilation, and nothing in its legislative history suggests otherwise.  The same Congress that enacted Pub.L. 280 also enacted several termination Acts, indicating that Congress well knew how directly to express its intent to confer upon the States general civil regulatory powers, including taxation.  Pp.  426 U. S. 387-390.
(e) Section 4(b), which is ""entirely consistent with, and in effect . . . a reaffirmation of, the law as it stood prior to its enactment,"" Kirkwood v. Arenas, 243 F.2d 863, 866 (CA9), should, as an admittedly ambiguous statute, be construed in favor of the Indians and against abolishing their tax immunities by implication.  Pp.  426 U. S. 390-393.

Decided June 14, 1976
426 U.S. 394

Syllabus 
In a class action by California state prisoners on behalf of themselves and all present or future adult male felons in California state prisons or on parole, plaintiffs alleged constitutional violations in the manner in which the members of the California Adult Authority and other petitioners determine the length of detention and conditions of punishment for convicted offenders, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  In the course of discovery pursuant to Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 34 plaintiffs sought (1) Adult Authority files consisting, inter alia, of personnel files of all members and employees of the Adult Authority; and (2) prisoners' files, consisting of the files of every twentieth inmate in each state correctional institution.  Petitioners, claiming that the Adult Authority files were irrelevant, confidential, and privileged, suggested that they should not be compelled to turn over the files without prior District Court in camera inspection.  That court ordered the production of the documents without such review, but limited the number of people associated with the plaintiffs who might examine the documents.  Petitioners then filed a petition for mandamus to vacate the discovery order, which the Court of Appeals denied.  Though recognizing a qualified governmental ""official or state secrecy privilege,"" the court indicated that, contrary to the situation here, assertion of such a privilege had to be made with specificity by high-level Adult Authority officials.  A somewhat similar course ensued with regard to the prisoners' files, ending with the Court of Appeals' denial of mandamus without opinion.
Held:  In the circumstances of this case -- and particularly since less extreme alternatives for modification of the challenged discovery orders were available -- issuance of the writ of mandamus is inappropriate.  Pp.  426 U. S. 402-406.
(a) As a means of implementing the rule that mandamus will issue only in extraordinary circumstances, the party seeking this largely discretionary writ must show that there are no other adequate means to secure the desired relief.  Pp.  426 U. S. 402-403. 
Page 426 U. S. 395

(b) Here, adequate alternatives to mandamus existed.  The Court of Appeals' opinion did not foreclose in camera review, but apparently left open the opportunity for petitioners through responsible officials to assert the privilege more specifically, and have their request for in camera review reconsidered.  They thus have an avenue far short of mandamus to achieve the relief they seek, and this approach affords an appropriate and useful method for achieving a balance between petitioners' claims of irrelevance and privilege and plaintiffs' asserted need for the documents.  Pp.  426 U. S. 404-406.
(c) There is no reason to believe that, by its order relating to the discovery of the prisoners' files, the Court of Appeals meant to foreclose petitioners from availing themselves of the same opportunity of securing in camera review as is available in the case of the Adult Authority files .

Syllabus 
Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act permits union- or agency shop agreements between employers and unions, but  14(b) authorizes States to exempt themselves from  8(a)(3) and to enact ""right-to-work"" laws prohibiting union or agency shops.  About two years after petitioner unions and respondent employer had entered into an agency shop agreement covering seamen employed on respondent's oil tankers, respondent brought suit claiming that the agreement was invalid and unenforceable because it violated Texas' right-to-work laws.  Since, inter alia, all final decisions for hiring the seamen are made in Texas, the majority of the then employed seamen reside in Texas, and respondent's personnel records are maintained and payroll checks are written there, the District Court held that Texas had an ""intimate concern"" with the agreement, notwithstanding that the seamen spend the vast majority of their working hours away from Texas on the high seas, and that therefore Texas' right-to-work laws were applicable under  14(b) and rendered the agreement void and unenforceable.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, stressing that Texas was the place of hiring.
Held:
1. lt is the employees' predominant job situs, rather than a generalized weighing of factors or the place of hiring, that triggers operation of  14(b), and, under  14(b), right-to-work laws cannot void agreements permitted by  8(a)(3) when the situs at which all the employees covered by the agreement perform most of their work is located outside of a State having such laws.  Pp.  426 U. S. 412-419.
(a) Insofar as  8(a)(3) deals with union and agency shop agreements, it focuses both in effect and purpose on post-hiring conditions, conditions that have a major impact on the job situs.  Pp.  426 U. S. 414-416. 
Page 426 U. S. 408

(b) Similarly,  14(b)'s primary concern is with state regulation of the post-hiring employer employee-union relationship, the center of which is the job situs, i.e., the place where the work that is the very raison d'etre of the relationship is performed; and because of this close relationship between  14(b) and job situs,  14(b) does not allow enforcement of right-to-work laws with regard to an employment relationship whose principal job situs is outside of a State having such laws.  Pp.  426 U. S. 416-418.
(c) Under the job situs test, as opposed to a ""place of hiring"" test, the possibility of patently anomalous extraterritorial applications of any given State's right-to-work laws will be minimized, and parties entering a collective bargaining agreement will easily be able to determine in virtually all situations whether a union or agency shop provision is valid.  Pp.  426 U. S. 418-419.
2. Under the job situs test, Texas' right-to-work laws cannot govern the validity of the agency shop agreement in question, because most of the employees' work is done on the high seas, outside the territorial bounds of Texas.  It is immaterial that Texas may have more contacts than any other State with the employment relationship involved, since there is no reason to conclude under  14(b) that, in every employment situation, some State's law with respect to union security agreements must apply, and it is fully consistent with national labor policy to conclude, if the predominant job situs is outside the boundary of any State, that no State has a sufficient interest in the employment relationship, and that, hence, no State's right-to-work laws can apply.

(b) Similarly,  14(b)'s primary concern is with state regulation of the post-hiring employer employee-union relationship, the center of which is the job situs, i.e., the place where the work that is the very raison d'etre of the relationship is performed; and because of this close relationship between  14(b) and job situs,  14(b) does not allow enforcement of right-to-work laws with regard to an employment relationship whose principal job situs is outside of a State having such laws.  Pp.  426 U. S. 416-418.
(c) Under the job situs test, as opposed to a ""place of hiring"" test, the possibility of patently anomalous extraterritorial applications of any given State's right-to-work laws will be minimized, and parties entering a collective bargaining agreement will easily be able to determine in virtually all situations whether a union or agency shop provision is valid.  Pp.  426 U. S. 418-419.
2. Under the job situs test, Texas' right-to-work laws cannot govern the validity of the agency shop agreement in question, because most of the employees' work is done on the high seas, outside the territorial bounds of Texas.  It is immaterial that Texas may have more contacts than any other State with the employment relationship involved, since there is no reason to conclude under  14(b) that, in every employment situation, some State's law with respect to union security agreements must apply, and it is fully consistent with national labor policy to conclude, if the predominant job situs is outside the boundary of any State, that no State has a sufficient interest in the employment relationship, and that, hence, no State's right-to-work laws can apply.  Pp.  426 U. S. 420-421.

|426 u.s. 438|"TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.
No. 74-1471
Argued March 3, 1976
Decided June 14, 1976
426 U.S. 438

Syllabus 
Rule 14a-9, promulgated under  14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provides that no proxy solicitation shall be made ""which . . . is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading.""  The dispute in this case centers on the acquisition of petitioner TSC Industries (TSC) by petitioner National Industries (National).  National purchased 34% of TSC's voting securities from TSC's founder and principal shareholder and his family.  The founder and his son promptly resigned from TSC's board of directors, and five National nominees were placed on the board, including National's president and executive vice-president, who subsequently became, respectively, chairman of the board and chairman of TSC's executive committee.  Thereafter, the TSC board approved a proposal to liquidate and sell all of TSC's assets to National by exchanging TSC common and preferred stock for National preferred stock and warrants to purchase National common stock.  TSC and National then issued a joint proxy statement to their shareholders recommending approval of the proposal.  The proxy solicitation was successful, TSC was placed in liquidation and dissolution, and the exchange of shares was effected.  Respondent, a TSC shareholder, brought this action for damages, restitution, and other relief against TSC and National, claiming that their joint proxy statement was incomplete and materially misleading in violation of  14(a) and Rule 14a-9 in that it omitted material facts relating to the degree of National's control over TSC (i.e., it failed to disclose the positions in TSC held by National's president and executive vice-president, and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by National and TSC indicating that National ""may be deemed a parent' of TSC"") and the favorability of the proposed acquisition to TSC shareholders (i.e., it failed to disclose certain unfavorable information about the proposal contained in a letter from an investment banking firm whose earlier favorable opinion of the 
Page 426 U. S. 439
 proposal was reported in the proxy statement, and also recent substantial purchases of National's common stock, suggestive of manipulation, by National and a mutual fund).  The District Court denied respondent's motion for summary judgment, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the claimed omissions of fact were material as a matter of law, and defining material facts as ""all facts which a reasonable shareholder might consider important.""
Held:
1. The general standard of materiality best comporting with Rule 14a-9's policies is not the standard applied by the Court of Appeals, but is as follows:  an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.  This standard is fully consistent with the general description of materiality as a requirement that ""the defect have a significant propensity to affect the voting process.""  Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U. S. 375,  396 U. S. 384.  It does not require proof of a substantial likelihood that disclosure of the omitted fact would have caused the reasonable investor to change his vote, but contemplates a showing of a substantial likelihood that, under all the circumstances, the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance in the reasonable shareholder's deliberations.  Pp.  426 U. S. 444-449.
2. The issue of materiality is a mixed question of law and fact, involving as it does the application of a legal standard to a particular set of facts, and only if the established omissions are ""so obviously important to an investor that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of materiality"" is the ultimate issue of materiality appropriately resolved ""as a matter of law"" by summary judgment.  P.  426 U. S. 450.
3. Under the standard set forth in  1, supra, none of the omissions claimed to have been in violation of Rule 14a-9 in this case were, so far as the record reveals, materially misleading as a matter of law, and hence respondent was not entitled to summary judgment.  Pp.  426 U. S. 450-463.
512 F.2d 324, reversed and remanded.
MARSHALL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all Members joined except STEVENS, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

Concluding from the protesting appellant feed manufacturers' evidence that, though appellee railroads' proposed new tariffs would increase through rates on meal and related articles used in making feed, the railroads would lose revenue because of diversion of meal traffic to trucks, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) canceled the proposed tariffs.  The District Court set aside and annulled the ICC's order for want of substantial evidence to support it, viewing the shippers' evidence as mere conjecture and self-serving and finding that, instead of losing revenue from the new tariffs, the railroads would improve their financial position notwithstanding any predicted traffic diversion.
Held:  The District Court exceeded its function in reweighing the testimony, and, on the record before it, erred in differing with the ICC and agreeing with the railroads on the impact of the new tariffs on railroad revenue.

Syllabus 
Nearly two years after his conviction of a federal crime, from which he took no appeal, respondent, pro se, filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, in which he asserted that he intended to seek vacation of his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2255; that he was unable to afford a transcript; that without one he could not frame his arguments for effective review; that a transcript would show that he had not been afforded effective assistance of counsel; and that there was insufficient evidence to support the guilty verdict.  The District Court, after granting respondent leave to proceed in forma pauperis, appointing counsel, and holding a hearing, denied relief.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to a transcript in order to assist him in preparing a motion under  2255.  The court concluded that 28 U.S.C.  753(f), which provides for a free transcript for indigent prisoners asserting a claim under  2255 if the trial judge certifies that the asserted claim is ""not frivolous"" and that the transcript is ""needed to decide the issue,"" does not prohibit courts from requiring the government to supply an indigent prisoner with a free transcript before he files a  2255 motion.  By so ruling the court felt that it was unnecessary to hold  753(f) unconstitutional.

511 F.2d 1116, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded:
1. Section 753(f) does not violate Art. I,  9, cl. 2, by constituting a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  The right to a free transcript is not a necessary concomitant of the writ, which operated until 1944 with no provision at all for free transcripts for indigents.  If Congress thus could have limited the writ directly without ""suspending"" it, Congress may do so indirectly.  Pp.  426 U. S. 322-323. 
Page 426 U. S. 318

2. Nor does  753(f) violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and respondent's right to ""equal protection,"" since respondent, to whom the transcript was available had he chosen to appeal his conviction, and remained available on the conditions set forth in  753, had an adequate opportunity to attack his conviction.  Pp.  426 U. S. 323-328.
(a) The Due Process Clause does not establish a right of appeal, and  753(f)'s conditions are not ""so arbitrary and unreasonable . . . as to require their invalidation,"" Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353,  372 U. S. 365 (Harlan, J., dissenting).  Pp.  426 U. S. 323-324.
(b) Though those statutory conditions place an indigent in a position somewhat less advantageous than that of a person of means, the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause does not guarantee absolute equality, the conditions of  753(f) providing an adequate access to procedures for review of the conviction of an indigent, who, like respondent, chose to forgo his opportunity for a direct appeal with its attendant free transcript.  Pp.  426 U. S. 324-328.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded that  753(f) afforded respondent a fair and adequate opportunity to present his claims effectively in this collateral proceeding, and that it is not necessary to consider the constitutional significance of what respondent might have done at the time he could have directly appealed his conviction.

(b) Though those statutory conditions place an indigent in a position somewhat less advantageous than that of a person of means, the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause does not guarantee absolute equality, the conditions of  753(f) providing an adequate access to procedures for review of the conviction of an indigent, who, like respondent, chose to forgo his opportunity for a direct appeal with its attendant free transcript.

MR.

Syllabus 
On respondent Chief of Police's recommendation, respondent City Manager terminated petitioner's employment as a policeman without a hearing, telling him privately that the dismissal was based on a failure to follow orders, poor attendance at police training classes, causing low morale, and conduct unsuited to an officer.  A city ordinance provides that a permanent city employee (as petitioner was classified) may be discharged if he fails to perform work up to the standard of his classification, or if he is negligent, inefficient, or unfit to perform his duties.  Petitioner brought suit against respondents, claiming that, as a ""permanent employee"" he had a constitutional right to a pre-termination hearing; that the ordinance, even though not expressly so providing, should be read to prohibit discharge for any reason other than those specified, and therefore to confer tenure on all permanent employees; that his period of service, together with his ""permanent"" classification, gave him a sufficient expectation of continued employment to constitute a protected property interest under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and that the false explanation for his discharge deprived him of interest in liberty protected by that Clause.  During pretrial discovery, petitioner was again advised of the reasons for his dismissal.  The District Court granted respondents' motion for a summary judgment, holding, on the basis of its understanding of state law, that petitioner ""held his position at the will and pleasure of the city.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Under the District Court's tenable view of state law, which was upheld by the Court of Appeals and which will be accepted by this Court in the absence of any authoritative state court interpretation of the ordinance involved, petitioner's discharge did not deprive him of a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  426 U. S. 343-347.
2. Assuming that the explanation for petitioner's discharge was false, as this Court must do, since summary judgment was entered against him, such false explanation did not deprive him of an interest in liberty protected by that Clause.  Pp.  426 U. S. 347-349. 
Page 426 U. S. 342

(a) Since the City Manager's private oral communication to petitioner of the reasons for his discharge was never made public, it cannot properly form the basis for a claim that petitioner's interest in his ""good name, reputation, honor, or integrity"" was thereby impaired.  Nor can the communication of such reasons during pretrial discovery provide retroactive support for such claim, since it was made in the course of a judicial proceeding that did not commence until after petitioner had suffered his alleged injury.  Pp.  426 U. S. 348-349.
(b) The truth or falsity of the City Manager's explanation determines whether or not his decision to discharge petitioner was correct or prudent, but neither enhances nor diminishes petitioner's claim that his constitutionally protected interest in liberty was impaired.  P.  426 U. S. 349.

No. 74-1107
Argued January 12, 1976
Decided June 7, 1976*
426 U.S. 128

Syllabus 
Devil's Hole, a deep cavern on federal land in Nevada containing an underground pool inhabited by a unique species of desert fish, was reserved as a national monument by a 1952 Presidential Proclamation issued under the American Antiquities Preservation Act, which authorizes the President to proclaim as national monuments, inter alia, ""objects of historic or scientific interest"" situated on federal land.  In 1968, the Cappaerts, petitioners in No. 74-1107, who own a nearby ranch, began pumping groundwater coming from the same source as the water in Devil's Hole, thereby reducing the water level in Devil's Hole and endangering its fish.  Subsequently, the Cappaerts applied to the Nevada State Engineer for permits to change the use of water from several of their wells.  Although the United States was not made a party to that proceeding, the National Park Service filed a protest, seeking either a denial of the application or a postponement of a decision until it could be determined whether the pumping of the Cappaerts' wells should be limited to prevent lowering of the water in Devil's Hole.  The State Engineer overruled the protest and granted the permits.  The United States then filed suit in the District Court seeking to limit the Cappaerts' pumping of their wells.  The District Court permanently enjoined pumping that would lower the water below a certain level necessary to preserve the fish, holding that, in establishing Devil's Hole as a national monument, the President reserved appurtenant, unappropriated waters necessary to the purpose of the reservation, including preservation of the pool and its fish, that the federal water rights antedated those of the Cappaerts, and that the United States was not estopped from injunctive relief against the use of water under land exchanged with the Cappaerts.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  As of 1952, when the United States reserved Devil's Hole, it acquired by reservation water rights in unappropriated appurtenant water sufficient to maintain the level of the underground pool to preserve its scientific 
Page 426 U. S. 129
 value, and thereby implement the Presidential Proclamation.  Pp.  426 U. S. 138-147.
(a) When the Federal Government reserves land from the public domain, by implication, it reserves water rights sufficient to accomplish the purposes of the reservation, and here, the 1952 Proclamation expressed an intention to reserve unappropriated water.  Pp.  426 U. S. 138-141.
(b) The purpose of reserving Devil's Hole being the preservation of the underground pool, the District Court appropriately tailored its injunction to the minimal need, curtailing pumping only to the extent necessary to preserve a water level adequate to protect the pool's scientific value as the natural habitat of the fish species sought to be preserved.  P.  426 U. S. 141.
(c) The American Antiquities Preservation Act authorized the President to reserve the pool in Devil's Hole, since such pool and its rare inhabitants are ""objects of historic or scientific interest"" within the meaning of that Act.  Pp.  426 U. S. 141-142.
(d) Since the ""implied reservation of water"" doctrine is based on the necessity of water for the purpose of the federal reservation, the United States can protect its water from subsequent diversion, whether the diversion is of surface water or groundwater.  Pp.  426 U. S. 142-143.
(e) Since the Desert Land Act of 1877, which provides that patentees of public land acquire only title to land through the patent, and must acquire water rights in nonnavigable water in accordance with state law, does not apply to water rights of federal reserved land, FPC v. Oregon, 349 U. S. 435, determination of such reserved water rights is not governed by state law, but derives from the federal purpose of the reservation, and, thus, the fact that the water rights here reserved apply to nonnavigable, rather than navigable, water is irrelevant.  Pp.  426 U. S. 143-146.
(f) That the National Park Service filed a protest to the Cappaerts' pumping permit application in the state administrative proceeding, did not bar the United States, by res judicata or collateral estoppel, from litigating its water rights claim in federal court.  The United States was not made a party to the state proceeding, was not in privity with the Cappaerts, and did not assert any federal water rights claims in such proceeding, and thus the issue raised in the District Court was not decided in the state proceedings.

Syllabus 
Respondents Harley and Sellers, both Negroes (hereinafter respondents), whose applications to become police officers in the District of Columbia had been rejected, in an action against District of Columbia officials (petitioners) and others, claimed that the Police Department's recruiting procedures, including a written personnel test (Test 21), were racially discriminatory and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, 42 U.S.C.  1981, and D.C.Code  1-320.  Test 21 is administered generally to prospective Government employees to determine whether applicants have acquired a particular level of verbal skill.  Respondents contended that the test bore no relationship to job performance, and excluded a disproportionately high number of Negro applicants.  Focusing solely on Test 21, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  The District Court, noting the absence of any claim of intentional discrimination, found that respondents' evidence supporting their motion warranted the conclusions that (a) the number of black police officers, while substantial, is not proportionate to the city's population mix; (b) a higher percentage of blacks fail the test than whites; and (c) the test has not been validated to establish its reliability for measuring subsequent job performance.  While that showing sufficed to shift the burden of proof to the defendants in the action, the court concluded that respondents were not entitled to relief, and granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment, in view of the facts that 44% of new police recruits were black, a figure proportionate to the blacks on the total force and equal to the number of 20- to 29-year-old blacks in the recruiting area; that the Police Department had affirmatively sought to recruit blacks, many of whom passed the test but failed to report for duty; and that the test was a useful indicator of training school performance (precluding the need to show validation in terms of job performance), and was not designed to, and did not, discriminate against otherwise qualified blacks.  Respondents on 
Page 426 U. S. 230
 appeal contended that their summary judgment motion (which was based solely on the contention that Test 21 invidiously discriminated against Negroes in violation of the Fifth Amendment) should have been granted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, and directed summary judgment in favor of respondents, having applied to the constitutional issue the statutory standards enunciated in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424, which held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits the use of tests that operate to exclude members of minority groups unless the employer demonstrates that the procedures are substantially related to job performance.  The court held that the lack of discriminatory intent in the enactment and administration of Test 21 was irrelevant; that the critical fact was that four times as many blacks as whites failed the test; and that such disproportionate impact sufficed to establish a constitutional violation, absent any proof by petitioners that the test adequately measured job performance.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in resolving the Fifth Amendment issue by applying standards applicable to Title VII cases.  Pp.  426 U. S. 238-248.
(a) Though the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment contains an equal protection component prohibiting the Government from invidious discrimination, it does not follow that a law or other official act is unconstitutional solely because it has a racially disproportionate impact regardless of whether it reflects a racially discriminatory purpose.  Pp.  426 U. S. 239-245.
(b) The Constitution does not prevent the Government from seeking, through Test 21, modestly to upgrade the communicative abilities of its employees, rather than to be satisfied with some lower level of competence, particularly where the job requires special abilities to communicate orally and in writing; and respondents, as Negroes, could no more ascribe their failure to pass the test to denial of equal protection than could whites who also failed.  Pp.  426 U. S. 245-246.
(c) The disproportionate impact of Test 21, which is neutral on its face, does not warrant the conclusion that the test was a purposely discriminatory device, and, on the facts before it, the District Court properly held that any inference of discrimination was unwarranted.  P.  426 U. S. 246.
(d) The rigorous statutory standard of Title VII involves a more probing judicial review of, and less deference to, the seemingly reasonable acts of administrators and executives than is 
Page 426 U. S. 231
 appropriate under the Constitution where, as in this case, special racial impact, but no discriminatory purpose, is claimed.  Any extension of that statutory standard should await legislative prescription.  Pp.  426 U. S. 246-248.
2. Statutory standards similar to those obtaining under Title VII were also satisfied here.  The District Court's conclusion that Test 21 was directly related to the requirements of the police training program, and that a positive relationship between the test and that program was sufficient to validate the test (wholly aside from its possible relationship to actual performance as a police officer) is fully supported on the record in this case, and no remand to establish further validation is appropriate.  Pp.  426 U. S. 248-252.

Syllabus 
An Arkansas public utility company (hereinafter Company) that makes wholesale interstate electricity sales, as well as retail industrial sales in competition with some of its wholesale customers (including respondents, seven municipally owned electric systems and two cooperatives, operating within Arkansas) filed a wholesale rate increase with the Federal Power Commission (FPC).  Respondents sought to intervene before the FPC, urging that the increase be rejected on the ground that it was
""an attempt to squeeze [respondents] . . . out of competition and make them more susceptible to the persistent efforts of the Company to take over the publicly owned systems in the State.""
The FPC allowed only limited intervention, excluding the alleged anticompetitive activities as outside the FPC's jurisdiction, which does not reach retail sales.  The Court of Appeals, on review, took a contrary position, holding that the Company's retail rates
""in a market in which it is competing with its own customers are part of the factual context in which the proposed wholesale rate will function . . . ,""
and should be considered in determining whether or not the rate increase was just and reasonable.
Held:  The FPC's jurisdiction to review a petition to set aside or reduce a public utility's wholesale electric rate increase permits consideration of the utility's alleged purpose to forestall its customers from competing with it at retail.  Pp.  426 U. S. 276-282.
(a) Though the Federal Power Act confers jurisdiction on the FPC with respect to the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce, and the FPC has no authority to correct an alleged discriminatory relationship between wholesale and retail rates by regulating the nonjurisdictional, retail price,  205(b) of the Act forbids the maintenance of any ""unreasonable difference in rates"" or service ""with respect to any . . . sale"" subject to the FPC's jurisdiction, and a jurisdictional sale is necessarily implicated in respondents' charge that the difference between the Company's wholesale and retail rates is unreasonable 
Page 426 U. S. 272
 and anticompetitive.  To the extent that the alleged discrimination is traceable to the jurisdictional rate  205(b) would apply, and the FPC would have remedial power over the jurisdictional rate under  206.  Pp.  426 U. S. 276-277.
(b) Ratemaking is not an exact science, and there is no single cost-recovering rate:  one rate as related to another may be discriminatory, although each rate, if considered independently, might fall within the zone of reasonableness.  When the intrazonal relationship unduly favors one rate, the discrimination must be removed.  Pp.  426 U. S. 277-279.
(c) While the FPC lacks authority to fix retail rates, it may take those rates into account when it fixes the rates for interstate wholesale sales that are subject to its jurisdiction.  Cf. Panhandle Co. v. FPC, 324 U. S. 635,  324 U. S. 646.  Pp.  426 U. S. 279-282.

Syllabus 
Shortly before his scheduled departure from Washington, D.C. to Connecticut, where he was to fulfill speaking engagements, petitioner, who had reserved a seat on one of respondent's Hartford flights arrived at the check-in area, but was advised that he could not be accommodated because all the seats were occupied.  After refusing the tender of respondent, which concededly overbooked the flight, of denied boarding compensation, petitioner brought a common law action against respondent based on an alleged fraudulent misrepresentation arising from respondent's failure to apprise petitioner of its deliberate overbooking practices, and a statutory action under  404(b) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, arising from respondent's failure to afford petitioner the boarding priority specified in its rules filed with the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB).  The District Court entered judgment and awarded compensatory and punitive damages on both claims.  The Court of Appeals remanded petitioner's statutory claim for further findings and reversed the award of punitive damages on that claim.  The question of punitive damages for the common law claim was remanded for further findings on respondent's good faith.  None of that court's foregoing rulings was presented in the petition for certiorari.  The court also held that the common law fraudulent misrepresentation claim had to be remanded to the District Court, and stayed, under the principles of primary jurisdiction, pending referral to the CAB to determine whether the alleged failure to disclose the practice of deliberate overbooking is a deceptive practice under  411 of the Act, which provides that the CAB may investigate and determine whether any air carrier has been or is engaged in unfair or deceptive practices, and that practices found to violate the section shall be the subject of a cease and desist order.  The court held that a CAB determination that a practice is not deceptive under  411 would preclude a common law tort action for damages for injuries caused by that practice.
Held:  Petitioner's common law tort action based on 
Page 426 U. S. 291
 the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation by respondent air carrier should not be stayed pending reference to the CAB for a determination whether the practice is ""deceptive"" within the meaning of  411 of the Act.  Pp.  426 U. S. 298-308.
(a) There is no irreconcilable conflict between the Act's scheme and the common law remedy; both may coexist as contemplated by the Act's saving clause, which provides that

(b) No power to immunize a carrier from common law liability can be inferred from  411's language; where Congress has sought to confer such power, it has done so expressly, as in  414 of the Act.  Section 411 is both broader and narrower than common law remedies.  A cease and desist order may issue thereunder if the CAB concludes that a carrier is engaged in an unfair or deceptive practice, and no findings that the practice was intentionally deceptive or has caused injury in fact are necessary; on the other hand, a CAB decision that such an order is inappropriate does not manifest the CAB's approval of the practice, but may merely represent the agency's conclusion that a more flexible approach is necessary.

 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur, dissenting. 
 Appellant brought this suit in the Circuit Court for Multnomah County, Ore., seeking a declaration that Oregon Laws 1973, c. 699, 4, and Ore. Rev.Stat. 167.060(10) violate the First and Fifth Amendments as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, and asking that enforcement of those statutes be enjoined. The Circuit Court dismissed appellant's complaint, and the Court of Appeals for the State of Oregon affirmed. Or.App., 539 P.2d 669 (1975). The Supreme Court of Oregon denied review. 
 Oregon Laws 1973, c. 699, 4, provides in pertinent part:

 Section 167.060(10) provides: 
 It is my view that 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure of unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to supporess sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.' Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, Oregon Laws 1973, c. 699, 4, as it incorporates the definition of sexual conduct in Ore.Rev.Stat. 167.060(10), is constitutionally overbroad [426 U.S. 913 , 915]

No. 74-1270
Argued December 9, 1975
Decided June 1, 1976
426 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) makes it unlawful to discharge ""pollutants"" into navigable waters without a permit from the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and defines the term ""pollutant"" to include, inter alia, ""radioactive materials.""  The Atomic Energy Act (AEA) regulates the production, possession, and use of three types of radioactive materials -- source, byproduct, and special nuclear materials -- and, pursuant to its authority under the AEA, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) (now succeeded in this capacity by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission) has issued regulations governing the discharge of such materials into the environment by AEA licensees.  After the EPA Administrator had disclaimed any authority under the FWPCA to regulate the discharge of these three types of radioactive materials covered by the AEA, respondents, who claimed potential harm from the discharge of radioactive effluents from two nuclear plants in Colorado operated in conformity with AEC standards, brought suit against petitioners,

 the EPA and its Administrator, seeking a declaration that the definition of ""pollutant"" under the FWPCA encompasses all radioactive materials, including those regulated under the AEA, and an injunction directing petitioners to regulate the discharge of all such materials.  The District Court held that the AEC had exclusive authority to regulate discharges of radioactive materials covered by the AEA, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding, exclusively by reference to the FWPCA's language and without reference to its legislative history, that the FWPCA requires the EPA to regulate discharges of all radioactive materials, including those covered by the AEA.
Held:
1. To the extent that the Court of Appeals excluded reference to the FWPCA's legislative history in discerning the meaning of the statute, the court was in error, for,
""[w]hen aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in the statute, is available, there certainly can be no 'rule of law' which forbids its use, however clear the words may appear on 'superficial examination.'""

2. The FWPCA's legislative history reflects a congressional intention not to alter the AEC's control over the discharge of source, byproduct, and special nuclear materials.  Therefore, the ""pollutants"" subject to regulation under the FWPCA do not include such materials, and the EPA Administrator acted in accordance with his statutory mandate in declining to regulate the discharge of these materials.

No. 74-1124
Argued December 10, 1975
Decided June 1, 1976*
426 U.S. 26

Syllabus 
Respondents in No. 74-1124 (hereinafter respondents), several low income individuals and organizations representing such individuals, brought this class action in District Court on behalf of all persons unable to afford hospital services, against the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.  They claimed that Revenue Ruling 69-545, which announced an Internal Revenue Service policy of extending favorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code) to hospitals that did not serve indigents to the extent of the hospitals' financial ability, ""encouraged"" hospitals to deny services to indigents, and was invalid because it was an erroneous interpretation of the Code and because it had been issued in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  The complaint described instances in which the individual respondents had been refused treatment, because of their indigency, at hospitals enjoying favorable tax treatment under the policy announced in the challenged Revenue Ruling and alleged to be receiving substantial contributions as a result of that treatment.  The District Court overruled the motion to dismiss of petitioners in No. 74-1124 (hereinafter petitioners), which included a challenge to respondents' standing, and, on cross-motions for summary judgment, held Revenue Ruling 69-545 void as contrary to the Code.  The Court of Appeals also found standing in respondents, but upheld Revenue Ruling 69-545.
Held:  The District Court should have granted petitioners' motion to dismiss because respondents failed to establish their standing to bring this suit.  Pp.  426 U. S. 37-46.
(a) When a plaintiff's standing is challenged the relevant inquiry is whether, assuming justiciability of the claim, the plaintiff 
Page 426 U. S. 27
 has shown an injury to himself that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision, and unless such a showing is made, a federal court cannot exercise its power consistent with the ""case or controversy"" limitation of Art. III of the Constitution.  Pp.  426 U. S. 37-39.
(b) The respondent organizations, which alleged no injury to themselves qua organizations, cannot establish standing simply on the basis that they are dedicated to promoting access of the poor to health services.  An organization's abstract concern with a subject that could be affected by an adjudication does not substitute for the concrete injury required by Art. III.  Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727.  Pp.  426 U. S. 39-40.
(c) Allegations that the individual respondents and members of respondent organizations were denied hospital services because of indigency do not establish a case or controversy in this suit, which is not brought against any hospital, but against Treasury officials.  The Art. III ""case or controversy"" limitation requires that a federal court act only to redress injury that fairly can be traced to the challenged action of a defendant, and not solely to some third party.  Pp.  426 U. S. 40-42.
(d) Though petitioners alleged that the adoption of Revenue Ruling 69-545 ""encouraged"" hospitals to deny services to indigents, it is purely speculative (1) whether the alleged denials of service are ascribable to petitioners' ""encouragement"" or resulted from the hospitals' decisions apart from tax considerations, and (2) whether the exercise of the District Court's remedial powers would make such services available to respondents.  Respondents' allegation that the hospitals that denied them service receive substantial contributions, without more, does not establish that those hospitals are dependent upon such contributions.  It thus appears that respondents relied
""on little more than the remote possibility, unsubstantiated by allegations of fact, that their situation might have been better had [petitioners] acted otherwise, and might improve were the [District Court] to afford relief.""
Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490,  422 U. S. 507.

No. 73-1046
Argued January 13, 1975
Reargued January 12, 1976
Decided June 1, 1976
426 U.S. 67

Syllabus 
Title 42 U.S.C.  1395o(2) qualifies for enrollment in the Medicare supplemental medical insurance program residents of the United States who are 65 or older, but in subsection (b) denies eligibility to aliens unless they have been admitted for permanent residence and also have resided in the United States for at least five years.  Appellee Diaz filed a class action suit in the District Court attacking the constitutionality of  1395o(2)(b), and thereafter the District Court granted leave to add appellees Clara and Espinosa as plaintiffs and to file an amended complaint, which alleged that Clara had been disqualified for the same reasons as Diaz (lack of citizenship, nonadmission for permanent residence, and inability to meet the five-year residence requirement), but explained that Espinosa, though lawfully admitted for permanent residence, had not attempted to enroll because he could not meet the durational residence requirement.  Appellant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that appellees had not exhausted their administrative remedies.  Two days later, Espinosa applied for enrollment, and so advised the court.  Though none of the appellees completely exhausted available avenues for administrative review, appellant acknowledged that the applications of Diaz and Clara raised no disputed factual issues, and that the interlocutory denials of their applications should be treated as final for purposes of this litigation, and conceded that Espinosa's application could not be allowed under the statute.  The District Court overruled appellant's motion and held that the five-year residence requirement violated due process and that, since it could not be severed from the requirement of admission for permanent residence, the alien eligibility provisions of  1395o(2)(B) were entirely unenforceable.
Held:
1. The District Court had jurisdiction over Espinosa's claim, which (unlike the other appellees' claims) squarely raises the question of the constitutionality of the five-year residence requirement.  Pp.  426 U. S. 74-77. 
Page 426 U. S. 68

(a) Espinosa's filing of an application, though not made until he had become a party, met the nonwaivable jurisdictional condition imposed by 42 U.S.C.  405(g) that a claim for benefits under the Social Security Act shall have been presented to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the pleadings may be treated as properly supplemented by appellant's stipulation that Espinosa had filed an application.  P.  426 U. S. 75.
(b) Appellant's stipulation that Espinosa's application would be denied for failure to meet the durational residence requirement was tantamount to a denial of the application, and constituted a waiver of the exhaustion requirements, and thus satisfied the statutory requirement of a hearing and final decision.  Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749. Cf. Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636 n. 6,  420 U. S. 641 n. 8.  Pp.  426 U. S. 75-77.
2. The statutory classification in  1395o(2)(B) does not deprive appellees of liberty or property in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  426 U. S. 77-87.
(a) Congress, which has broad power over immigration and naturalization and regularly makes rules regarding aliens that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens, has no constitutional duty to provide all aliens with the welfare benefits provided to citizens; the real question here is not whether discrimination between aliens and citizens is permissible, as it clearly is, but whether the statutory discrimination within the class of aliens is permissible.  Pp.  426 U. S. 77-80.
(b) The political branches of government have considerable flexibility in responding to changing world conditions, and judicial review of decisions made by the Congress or the President in the area of immigration and naturalization is narrow.  The party challenging the constitutionality of the particular line Congress has drawn has the burden of advancing principled reasoning that will at once invalidate that line and yet tolerate a different line separating some aliens from others.  Pp.  426 U. S. 81-82.
(c) This case essentially involves only a claim that it would have been more reasonable for Congress to select somewhat different requirements of the same kind.  The requirements chosen by Congress render eligible those aliens who may reasonably be assumed to have a greater affinity with the United States, and this Court is especially reluctant to question such a policy choice of degree.  Pp.  426 U. S. 82-84.

			"|"Mathews v. Diaz
No. 73-1046
Argued January 13, 1975
Reargued January 12, 1976
Decided June 1, 1976
426 U.S. 67

Syllabus 
Title 42 U.S.C.  1395o(2) qualifies for enrollment in the Medicare supplemental medical insurance program residents of the United States who are 65 or older, but in subsection (b) denies eligibility to aliens unless they have been admitted for permanent residence and also have resided in the United States for at least five years.  Appellee Diaz filed a class action suit in the District Court attacking the constitutionality of  1395o(2)(b), and thereafter the District Court granted leave to add appellees Clara and Espinosa as plaintiffs and to file an amended complaint, which alleged that Clara had been disqualified for the same reasons as Diaz (lack of citizenship, nonadmission for permanent residence, and inability to meet the five-year residence requirement), but explained that Espinosa, though lawfully admitted for permanent residence, had not attempted to enroll because he could not meet the durational residence requirement.  Appellant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that appellees had not exhausted their administrative remedies.  Two days later, Espinosa applied for enrollment, and so advised the court.  Though none of the appellees completely exhausted available avenues for administrative review, appellant acknowledged that the applications of Diaz and Clara raised no disputed factual issues, and that the interlocutory denials of their applications should be treated as final for purposes of this litigation, and conceded that Espinosa's application could not be allowed under the statute.  The District Court overruled appellant's motion and held that the five-year residence requirement violated due process and that, since it could not be severed from the requirement of admission for permanent residence, the alien eligibility provisions of  1395o(2)(B) were entirely unenforceable.
Held:
1. The District Court had jurisdiction over Espinosa's claim, which (unlike the other appellees' claims) squarely raises the question of the constitutionality of the five-year residence requirement.  Pp.  426 U. S. 74-77. 
Page 426 U. S. 68

(a) Espinosa's filing of an application, though not made until he had become a party, met the nonwaivable jurisdictional condition imposed by 42 U.S.C.  405(g) that a claim for benefits under the Social Security Act shall have been presented to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the pleadings may be treated as properly supplemented by appellant's stipulation that Espinosa had filed an application.  P.  426 U. S. 75.
(b) Appellant's stipulation that Espinosa's application would be denied for failure to meet the durational residence requirement was tantamount to a denial of the application, and constituted a waiver of the exhaustion requirements, and thus satisfied the statutory requirement of a hearing and final decision.  Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749. Cf. Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636 n. 6,  420 U. S. 641 n. 8.  Pp.  426 U. S. 75-77.
2. The statutory classification in  1395o(2)(B) does not deprive appellees of liberty or property in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  426 U. S. 77-87.
(a) Congress, which has broad power over immigration and naturalization and regularly makes rules regarding aliens that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens, has no constitutional duty to provide all aliens with the welfare benefits provided to citizens; the real question here is not whether discrimination between aliens and citizens is permissible, as it clearly is, but whether the statutory discrimination within the class of aliens is permissible.  Pp.  426 U. S. 77-80.
(b) The political branches of government have considerable flexibility in responding to changing world conditions, and judicial review of decisions made by the Congress or the President in the area of immigration and naturalization is narrow.  The party challenging the constitutionality of the particular line Congress has drawn has the burden of advancing principled reasoning that will at once invalidate that line and yet tolerate a different line separating some aliens from others.  Pp.  426 U. S. 81-82.
(c) This case essentially involves only a claim that it would have been more reasonable for Congress to select somewhat different requirements of the same kind.  The requirements chosen by Congress render eligible those aliens who may reasonably be assumed to have a greater affinity with the United States, and this Court is especially reluctant to question such a policy choice of degree.  Pp.  426 U. S. 82-84.

Syllabus 
The Civil Service Commission (CSC) regulation barring noncitizens, including lawfully admitted resident aliens, from employment in the federal competitive civil service held unconstitutional as depriving such resident aliens of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  426 U. S. 99-117.
(a) While overriding national interests may justify a citizenship requirement in the federal service even though an identical requirement may not be enforced by a State, the federal power over aliens is not so plenary that any agent of the Federal Government may arbitrarily subject all resident aliens to different substantive rules from those applied to citizens.  When the Federal Government asserts an overriding national interest to justify a discriminatory rule that would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if adopted by a State, due process requires that there be a legitimate basis for presuming that the rule was actually intended to serve that interest.  Pp.  426 U. S. 99-105.
(b) While the CSC's policy of conditioning eligibility for employment in the federal civil service on citizenship has been considered by Congress in certain Appropriation Acts imposing various limitations on the classes of employees who may receive compensation from the Federal Government and by various Presidents in Executive Orders relating to the CSC's authority to establish standards for federal employment, those Appropriation Acts and Executive Orders cannot fairly be construed to evidence either approval or disapproval of the CSC regulation in question.  Pp.  426 U. S. 105-114.
(c) Assuming without deciding that an explicit determination by Congress or the President to exclude all noncitizens from the federal service would be adequately supported by the national interests of (1) providing the President with an expendable token for treaty negotiation purposes, (2) offering aliens an incentive to 
Page 426 U. S. 89
 become naturalized, and (3) having, for the sake of administrative convenience, one simple rule excluding all noncitizens from employment when citizenship is clearly an appropriate and legitimate requirement for some important and sensitive positions, such interests cannot provide an acceptable rationalization for such a determination by the CSC.  The first two are not matters that properly concern the CSC.  The third interest is likewise unacceptable where it does not appear that the CSC fully evaluated the relative desirability of a simple exclusionary rule, on the one hand, or the value to the service of enlarging the pool of eligible employees, on the other, and where it cannot be reasonably inferred that the administrative burden of establishing the job classifications for which citizenship is an appropriate requirement would be particularly onerous.  More significantly, in view of the quality of the interest at stake, any fair balancing of the public interest in avoiding the wholesale deprivation of employment opportunities caused by the CSC's indiscriminate policy, as opposed to what may be nothing more than a hypothetical justification, requires rejection of administrative convenience as justification for the regulation.  Pp.  426 U. S. 114-116.
(d) Since alien residents are admitted as a result of decisions made by Congress and the President, implemented by the Immigration and Naturalization Service acting under the Attorney General, due process requires that the decision to deprive such residents of an important liberty be made either at a comparable level of government or, if it is to be permitted to be made by the CSC, that it be justified by reasons that are the proper concern of that agency.

Syllabus 
Under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 (EOA) the Federal Government, acting through an agency (at the relevant time herein the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO)), furnishes financial assistance for community action programs undertaken by community action agencies.  Such an agency is defined as a ""State or political subdivision of a State . . . or a public or private nonprofit agency or organization which has been designated by a State or such a political subdivision"" to plan and administer a community action program, consisting of ""services and activities having a measurable and potentially major impact on causes of poverty in the community. . . .""  The Warren-Trumbull Council is a community action agency operating as a nonprofit corporation under Ohio law, and was funded entirely by the OEO, but also received 20% of its support locally from ""in-kind"" services in compliance with EOA funding requirements.  One of the Council's activities was a Neighborhood Opportunity Center, which sponsored recreational outings for children.  While returning from one of the Center's outings in a private car for which the Council had made arrangements, a minor child was injured in a collision.  The child and his father (respondents) brought suit in the District Court against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) alleging negligence on the part of agents of the United States in organizing and supervising the outing.  The Government moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Council and Center were not ""instrumentalities or agencies of the United States"" within the purview of the FTCA.  The District Court granted the motion, holding that the Council was a contractor with the OEO, not a corporation acting as a federal instrumentality, and that the Council's employees were not federal employees.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The Council and the Center are not federal agencies or instrumentalities and their employees are not federal employees within the meaning of the FTCA.  Pp.  425 U. S. 813-819.
(a) The FTCA, which is a limited waiver of sovereign immunity

 applying to injuries caused by the negligent act of any Government employee while acting within the scope of his employment, but excluding from its coverage ""any contractor with the United States,"" was never intended to reach employees or agents of all federally funded programs.  The critical element in distinguishing an agency from a contractor is the Government's power ""to control the detailed physical performance of the contractor,"" Logue v. United States, 412 U. S. 521,  412 U. S. 528.  The question here is not whether the community action agency receives federal money and must comply with federal standards and regulations, but whether its daily operations are supervised by the Federal Government.  Cf. Logue, supra; Maryland v. United States, 381 U. S. 41.  Pp.  425 U. S. 813-815.
(b) Compliance with Government conditions and regulations to meet contract or grant goals does not convert a contractor to an agent of the Government.  Pp.  425 U. S. 815-816.
(e) The EOA emphasizes that a community action agency (which like myriads of other activities is federally funded) is a local enterprise, not a federal enterprise whose ""detailed physical performance"" is subject to Government control.  P.  425 U. S. 816.
(d) The legislative history relating to the community action programs manifests the congressional intent not to create new federal agencies, but to strengthen community capabilities of eliminating poverty at the local level.  P.  425 U. S. 817.
(e) Local officials administer the programs.  Though OEO regulations and guidelines must be observed, the OEO, none of whose employees may serve on a community action board, has no power to supervise the community action agency or its neighborhood program.  Pp.  425 U. S. 817-819.

Section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as added by  11 of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, proscribes federal employment discrimination and establishes an administrative and judicial enforcement system.  The statute provides that personnel actions affecting federal employees or job applicants ""shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,""  717(a); delegates enforcement authority to the Civil Service Commission (CSC),  717(b); and permits an aggrieved employee to file a civil action in a federal district court for review of his claim of employment discrimination.  After first seeking relief from the agency allegedly guilty of discrimination, he may seek further review from the CSC, or, alternatively, within 30 days of receipt of notice of the agency's final decision, file suit in federal district court without appealing to the CSC.  If he appeals to the CSC, he may file suit within 30 days of the CSC's final decision.  In any event, he may file a civil action if, after 180 days from the filing of the charge or appeal, the agency or the CSC has not taken final action.   717(c).  Petitioner, a Negro, who claimed that respondent agency (GSA) had racially discriminated against him by not promoting him to a higher grade, filed a complaint with the GSA.  After an adverse decision, he was accorded a hearing by a CSC complaints examiner, who, in February, 1973, found that there was no discrimination, and, in March, 1973, the GSA rendered its final decision upholding the examiner.  Petitioner was advised of that decision and of the further procedure available to him.  Forty-two days later, he brought suit in the District Court, alleging jurisdiction under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ""with particular reference to""  717.  He also alleged jurisdiction under the general federal question statute, the Declaratory Judgment Act, and 42 U.S.C.  1981.  The District Court granted respondents' motion to dismiss made on the ground that petitioner had not filed the complaint within the 30-day period specified by  717(c), and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 717 provides the exclusive

Syllabus 
Section 717(c) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as added by  11 of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, provides that, within a specified period after notice of final administrative action on a federal employee's discrimination complaint by the employing agency, or by the Civil Service Commission (CSC), upon an appeal from the agency's order, or after a specified period of delay by the agency or the CSC, the employee ""may file a civil action"" as provided in the statute, against the agency head.   Petitioner, a Negro, claiming that her failure to receive a promotion by the Veterans' Administration was sexually and racially discriminatory, after exhausting her administrative remedies, brought suit under  717(c).  She was not allowed to proceed with discovery, the District Court having determined that ""the absence of discrimination is firmly established by the clear weight of the administrative record.""  The court thereupon granted summary judgment in favor of respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The plain meaning of the statute, reinforced by the legislative history of the 1972 amendments, compels the conclusion that federal employees have the same right to a trial de novo as is enjoyed by private sector or state government employees under the amended Civil Rights Act of 1964.

			"|"Chandler v. Roudebush
No. 74-1599
Argued March 2, 1976
Decided June 1, 1976
425 U.S. 840

Syllabus 
Section 717(c) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as added by  11 of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, provides that, within a specified period after notice of final administrative action on a federal employee's discrimination complaint by the employing agency, or by the Civil Service Commission (CSC), upon an appeal from the agency's order, or after a specified period of delay by the agency or the CSC, the employee ""may file a civil action"" as provided in the statute, against the agency head.   Petitioner, a Negro, claiming that her failure to receive a promotion by the Veterans' Administration was sexually and racially discriminatory, after exhausting her administrative remedies, brought suit under  717(c).  She was not allowed to proceed with discovery, the District Court having determined that ""the absence of discrimination is firmly established by the clear weight of the administrative record.""  The court thereupon granted summary judgment in favor of respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The plain meaning of the statute, reinforced by the legislative history of the 1972 amendments, compels the conclusion that federal employees have the same right to a trial de novo as is enjoyed by private sector or state government employees under the amended Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Pp.  425 U. S. 843-864.
515 F.2d 251, reversed and remanded.

425 U.S. 682

Syllabus 
After the ""intervention"" (nationalization) by Cuba in 1960 of the business and assets of five leading cigar manufacturers, the former owners (most of whom had fled to the United States) brought actions against petitioner and two other importers for, inter alia, the purchase price of cigars that had been shipped to the importers from the seized Cuban plants.  Following conclusion of related litigation, the Cuban ""interventors"" (those named to possess and occupy the seized businesses, one of whom, and Cuba, are the respondents herein) were allowed to join in those actions, which were consolidated for trial.  Both the former owners and the interventors asserted their right to sums due from the three importers for post-intervention shipments.  As of the date of intervention, the importers owed various amounts for pre-intervention shipments, which they later paid to the interventors, who the importers mistakenly believed were entitled to collect accounts receivable.  The former owners also claimed title to and demanded payment of these accounts.  The District Court, acknowledging that, under the ""act of state"" doctrine reaffirmed in Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S. 398, it had to give effect to the 1960 confiscation insofar as it purported to take the property of Cubans in Cuba, held that the interventors could collect all due and unpaid amounts for post-intervention shipments, but further held that the former owners were entitled to the pre-intervention accounts receivable, the situs of which was with the importer-debtors; and the former owners, rather than the interventors, were held entitled to collect those accounts from the importers, even though the latter had already mistakenly paid them to the interventors.  The importers then claimed that they were entitled to recover the payments from the interventors by way of setoff or counterclaim.  The interventors countered with the contention that any repayment obligation was a quasi-contractual debt whose situs was in Cuba, and that their refusal to pay was an act of state not subject to question in American courts.  The District 
Page 425 U. S. 683
 Court rejected the interventors' claim on the grounds that the repayment obligation was deemed situated in the United States, and that nothing had occurred qualifying for recognition as an act of state.  The importers accordingly were allowed to set off their mistaken payments for pre-intervention shipments against the amounts they owed for post-intervention purchases.  Since petitioner's claim against the interventors exceeded their claim against it, petitioner was awarded judgment against the interventors for the full amount of its claim, from which the smaller judgment against it would be deducted.  The Court of Appeals, while agreeing with the District Court in other respects, held that the interventors' obligation to repay the importers was situated in Cuba, and that the interventors' counsel's repudiation of the obligation constituted an act of state.  Nevertheless, relying on First Nat City Bank v. Banco Nacional de Cuba, 406 U. S. 759, the court held that enforcement of the importers' counterclaims was not barred up to the limits of the respective claims asserted against them by the interventors, but that the affirmative judgment awarded petitioner was barred by the act of state doctrine to the extent that petitioner's claim exceeded its debt.  In this respect, the District Court's judgment was reversed, giving rise to the petition for certiorari in this case.
Held:  There is nothing in the record of this case revealing an act of state with respect to the interventors' obligation to return the sums mistakenly paid to them.  Pp.  425 U. S. 690-695.
(a) If the interventors, whose contentions, including the claimed act of state, with respect to the pre-intervention accounts, represented by the 1960 confiscation had been properly rejected by the courts below, were to escape repayment upon the basis of a second and later act of state involving the funds mistakenly paid to them, they had the burden of proving that act.  P.  425 U. S. 691.
(b) The interventors' refusal to repay the mistakenly paid funds does not constitute an act of state or indicate that the interventors had governmental, as opposed to merely commercial, authority for the refusal.  The ""Gul Djemal,"" 264 U. S. 90.  Pp.  425 U. S. 691-694.
(c) The interventors' counsel's statement during trial that the Cuban Government and the interventors denied liability and had refused to make repayment is no proof of an act of state, and no statute, decree, order, or resolution of the Cuban Government was offered in evidence indicating Cuban repudiation of its obligations in general or of the obligations herein involved.

No. 74-1452
Argued February 25, 1976
Decided May 24, 1976
425 U.S. 738

Syllabus 
Petitioner corporation, which operates a 49-bed proprietary hospital (Mary Elizabeth) in Raleigh, N.C. brought this antitrust action alleging that respondents, a private, tax-exempt hospital (Rex) in Raleigh, two of its officers, and a health planning officer, had violated the Sherman Act by conspiring along with others to block the relocation and expansion within Raleigh of Mary Elizabeth, for the purpose of enabling Rex to monopolize the business of providing hospital services in Raleigh.  Petitioner alleged that a substantial portion of its medicines and supplies comes from out-of-state sellers; that a large portion of its revenue comes from out-of-state insurance companies or the Federal Government; that it pays a management service fee to its parent company, a Georgia-based Delaware corporation; and that the planned expansion would be largely financed through out-of-state lenders.  Concluding that petitioner's business was strictly local, and that respondents' alleged conduct only incidentally and insubstantially affected interstate commerce, the District Court granted respondents' motion to dismiss the complaint.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Petitioner's complaint states a cause of action upon which relief can be granted under the Sherman Act, the combination of factors involving petitioner in interstate commerce being sufficient to establish a ""substantial effect"" on interstate commerce, within the meaning of the Sherman Act, as a result of respondents' alleged conduct.  Pp.  425 U. S. 743-747.
(a) That respondents may not have had the intentional goal of affecting interstate commerce does not exempt their conduct from Sherman Act coverage.  Burke v. Ford, 389 U. S. 320.  Pp.  425 U. S. 744-745.
(b) The ""substantial effect"" test can be satisfied even if the impact on interstate commerce of the conduct alleged falls short of causing petitioner's out-of-state suppliers to go out of business or the market price to be affected by the conspiracy.  Pp.  425 U. S. 745-746.

Argued November 11, 1975

425 U.S. 748

Syllabus 
Appellees, as consumers of prescription drugs, brought suit against the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy and its individual members, appellants herein, challenging the validity under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of a Virginia statute declaring it unprofessional conduct for a licensed pharmacist to advertise the prices of prescription drugs.  A three-judge District Court declared the statute void and enjoined appellants from enforcing it.
Held:
1. Any First Amendment protection enjoyed by advertisers seeking to disseminate prescription drug price information is also enjoyed, and thus may be asserted, by appellees as recipients of such information.  Pp.  425 U. S. 756-757.
2. ""Commercial speech"" is not wholly outside the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and the Virginia statute is therefore invalid.  Pp.  425 U. S. 761-773.
(a) That the advertiser's interest in a commercial advertisement is purely economic does not disqualify him from protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Both the individual consumer and society in general may have strong interests in the free flow of commercial information.  Pp.  425 U. S. 762-765.
(b) The ban on advertising prescription drug prices cannot be justified on the basis of the State's interest in maintaining the professionalism of its licensed pharmacists; the State is free to require whatever professional standards it wishes of its pharmacists, and may subsidize them or protect them from competition in other ways, but it may not do so by keeping the public in ignorance of the lawful terms that competing pharmacists are offering.  Pp.  425 U. S. 766-770.
(c) Whatever may be the bounds of time, place, and manner restrictions on commercial speech, they are plainly exceeded by 
Page 425 U. S. 749
 the Virginia statute, which singles out speech of a particular content and seeks to prevent its dissemination completely.  Pp.  425 U. S. 770-771.
(d) No claim is made that the prohibited prescription drug advertisements are false, misleading, or propose illegal transactions, and a State may not suppress the dissemination of concededly truthful information about entirely lawful activity, fearful of that information's effect upon its disseminators and its recipients.  Pp.  425 U. S. 771-773.

Syllabus 
Respondent union filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that two highway contractors (South Prairie and Kiewit), the wholly owned subsidiaries of another corporation, had committed an unfair labor practice in violation of  8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to apply to South Prairie's employees the collective bargaining agreement between the union and Kiewit, that South Prairie and Kiewit constituted a single ""employer"" under the Act for purposes of applying the agreement, and that, hence, under  9 of the Act, South Prairie was obligated to recognize the union as the bargaining representative of its employees.  The NLRB held that South Prairie and Kiewit were separate employers, and dismissed the complaint.  But the Court of Appeals held that South Prairie and Kiewit were a ""single employer,"" that their combined employees constituted the appropriate bargaining unit under  9, and that, therefore, they had committed an unfair labor practice as charged, and remanded the case to the NLRB for enforcement of an order.
Held:  The Court of Appeals invaded the NLRB's statutory province when it proceeded to decide the  9 ""unit"" question in the first instance, instead of remanding the case to the NLRB so that it could make the initial determination.  Since the selection of an appropriate bargaining unit lies largely within the discretion of the NLRB, whose decision, if not final, is rarely to be disturbed, the Court of Appeals' function ended when the NLRB's error on the ""single employer"" issue was ""laid bare.""

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 24, 1976
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted after jury trial in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida of mailing obscene advertisements in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1461. That section provides in pertinent part: 
 * * * * * 
Page 425 U.S. 998 , 999
 'Whoever knowingly uses the mails for the mailing . . . of anything declared by this section . . . to be nonmailable . . . shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years . . ..'
 The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 524 F.2d 1244.

425 U.S. 564

Syllabus 
As a result of certain information concerning respondent's participation in an attempted sale of heroin, he was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury investigating narcotics traffic in the area.  The prosecutor warned him that he was not required to answer any questions that might incriminate him, that all other questions had to be answered truthfully or else he would be subject to a charge of perjury, and that, if he desired a lawyer he could have one, but that the lawyer could not be inside the grand jury room.  Subsequently, respondent was charged with perjury for admittedly false statements made to the grand jury about his involvement in the attempted heroin sale.  The District Court granted respondent's motion to suppress his grand jury testimony because he was not given the warnings called for by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, holding that respondent was a ""putative"" or ""virtual"" defendant when called before the grand jury, and therefore entitled to full Miranda warnings.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.  Pp.  425 U. S. 571-584;  425 U. S. 584-609; 609.
496 F.2d 1050, reversed and remanded.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that Miranda warnings need not be given to a grand jury witness who is called to testify about criminal activities in which he may have been personally involved, and that therefore the failure to give such warnings is no basis for having false statements made to the grand jury suppressed in a subsequent prosecution of the witness for perjury based on those statements.  Pp.  425 U. S. 571-584.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded that, even when the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination is implicated, when false answers are given, the witness may consistently with the Fifth Amendment privilege be prosecuted for perjury; that, in the circumstances of this case, respondent's false answers were not induced by governmental tactics so unfair as to constitute prosecution for perjury a violation of the 
Page 425 U. S. 565
 Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; that, in the absence of a knowing waiver of the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, the Fifth Amendment requires that testimony obtained by calling a putative defendant before a grand jury and compelling him to testify regarding the suspected crime be unavailable as evidence in a later prosecution for that crime; and that, given the potential prejudice to a putative defendant's privilege against compulsory self-incrimination when called and compelled to testify before a grand jury and the ability of counsel to help avoid that prejudice, some guidance by counsel is required.  Pp.  425 U. S. 584-609.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, joined by MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination did not require the suppression of the respondent's grand jury testimony, since that testimony was relevant only to his prosecution for perjury, and was not introduced in the prosecution for attempting to distribute heroin, and that this was not a case where it could plausibly be argued that the perjury prosecution must be barred because of prosecutorial conduct amounting to a denial of due process.  P.  425 U. S. 609.

Secondly, the ordinance does not sufficiently specify what those within its reach must do in order to comply.

Syllabus 
Though Texas' general venue statute provides that no inhabitant of the State shall be sued outside the county of his domicile, an exception where a Texas corporation is the defendant provides in pertinent part for suit outside the domiciliary county only if, at a preliminary venue hearing, it is proved by a preponderance of evidence that the plaintiff has a cause of action.  No such proof is required under another exception applicable in a suit against a foreign corporation like appellant, which has qualified to do business in Texas.  On appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of this venue procedure as being invidiously discriminatory in that it does not accord a foreign corporation pretrial advantages that are given a domestic corporation such as, inter alia, previewing its adversary's case in chief and cross-examining the plaintiff's witnesses, held that the Texas statutory venue scheme is not violative of equal protection, since it appears that, as a matter of practice, prima facie proof is regarded as meeting the burden of the plaintiff in a suit against a domestic corporation, with the result that a domestic corporation does not have any appreciable advantage over a foreign corporation.

425 U.S. 649

Syllabus 
Section 3 of the Northern Cheyenne Allotment Act of 1926 (Act) reserves coal and other mineral deposits underlying lands on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation for the Tribe's benefit, but further provides that, 50 years after approval of the Act, such deposits ""shall become the property of the respective allottees or their heirs,"" and that the ""unallotted lands"" shall be ""subject to the control and management thereof as Congress may deem expedient for the benefit of said Indians.""  In 1968, Congress amended the Act to reserve the mineral rights ""in perpetuity for the benefit of the Tribe,"" subject to a prior judicial determination that the allottees had not been granted vested rights to the mineral deposits by the Act.  As authorized by the 1968 amendment, the Tribe brought suit against the allottees to determine whether the allottees, or their heirs or devisees, had received a vested property right in the minerals under the Act.  The District Court held that the Act did not grant the allottees vested rights in the mineral deposits, construing ""unallotted lands"" in  3 as including such deposits.  The Court of Appeals reversed, construing  3 as an unconditional, noncontingent grant of the mineral deposits to the allottees, in the absence of any express statement of Congress' intent to retain power over the deposits.
Held:  The Act did not give the allottees of surface lands vested rights in the mineral deposits underlying those lands.  This reading of the Act is supported by its legislative history, which indicates a congressional intent to sever the surface estate from the interest in the minerals and no intent to grant allottees a vested future interest in the mineral deposits, and thereby relinquish ""control and management thereof as Congress may deem expedient for the benefit of said Indians.""  Such conclusion is also supported by the fact that the agency charged with executing the Act construed it as not granting the allottees any vested rights.  Pp.  425 U. S. 654-660.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and various other organizations petitioned the Federal Power Commission (FPC) to issue a rule ""requiring equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination in the employment practices of its regulatees.""  The FPC refused, holding that it had no jurisdiction to issue such a rule.

""power to take into account, in the performance of its regulatory functions, including licensing and rate review, evidence that the regulatee is a demonstrated discriminatory in its employment relations.""
Held:
1. The FPC is authorized to consider the consequences of discriminatory employment practices on the part of its regulatees only insofar as such consequences are directly related to the FPC's establishment of just and reasonable rates in the public interest.  To the extent that illegal, duplicative, or unnecessary labor costs are demonstrably the product of a regulatee's discriminatory employment practices and can be or have been demonstrably quantified by judicial decree or the final action of an administrative agency, the FPC should disallow them.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Ala., of violating Ala.Code Tit. 14, 374(4) (Supp. 1973). That law provides in pertinent part:

 Under 374(3): 
 The indictment filed against petitioner charged him with three counts of violating 374. The first count charged petitioner with selling a magazine primarily containing photographs of nude women. Genitals were exposed in some of the photographs. Count Two of the indictment charged petitioner with selling an unillustrated short novel containing descriptions of sexual acts. The third count of the indictment charged the sale of another unillustrated short novel also containing descriptions of sexual acts. 
 Upon inquiry to the trial court, petitioner's jury was instructed that it could 'return a verdict as to either one of the counts in the indictment.' Record, at 100. The jury subsequently returned the general verdict 'We the jury find the defendant guilty.' Record, at 102.

No. 74-676
Argued October 7, 1975
Decided May 3, 1976
425 U.S. 501

Syllabus 
Respondent, who was charged with a criminal offense and held in custody awaiting trial, asked a jail officer on the morning of trial for his civilian clothes to wear at trial; no action was taken.  During voir dire, his counsel expressly referred to respondent's jail attire.  At no time before or during the ensuing jury trial was the issue raised to the trial judge concerning the jail attire.  Respondent, whose conviction was upheld on appeal, sought federal habeas corpus.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  Though there was evidence that, in the county where the trial occurred, the majority of nonbailed defendants were tried in jail clothes, there was no evidence that such a practice was followed if timely objection was made to the trial judge; and the practice of the particular trial judge was to permit any accused who so desired to be tried in civilian garb.
Held:  Although the State cannot, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, compel an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed in identifiable prison clothes, the failure to make an objection to the court as to being tried in such clothes negates the presence of the compulsion necessary to establish a constitutional violation.  Nothing in the record here warrants a conclusion that respondent was compelled to stand trial in jail garb or that there was sufficient reason to excuse the failure to raise the issue before trial.  Pp.  425 U. S. 503-513.

Argued December 9-10, 1975
Decided May 3, 1976
425 U.S. 536

Syllabus 
Six years after his conviction for felony murder from which he took no appeal, petitioner sought collateral relief from the state court on the ground, inter alia, that Negroes had been excluded from the grand jury that indicted him.  Relief was denied on the ground that petitioner's failure to raise the claim before trial constituted a waiver of that claim under state law.  Petitioner then sought habeas corpus in the District Court, which granted relief.  The Court of Appeals reversed, relying on Davis v. United States, 411 U. S. 233, which held that a federal prisoner who had failed to timely challenge the allegedly unconstitutional composition of the grand jury that indicted him could not, after his conviction, attack the grand jury's composition in an action for federal collateral relief.
Held:  The Court of Appeals correctly held that the Davis rule, which requires not only a showing of ""cause"" for the defendant's failure to challenge the composition of the grand jury before trial, but also a showing of actual prejudice, applies with equal force when a federal court is asked in a habeas corpus proceeding to overturn a state court conviction because of an allegedly unconstitutional grand jury indictment.  The Louisiana time limitation was designed to serve the same important purposes of sound judicial administration as were stressed in Davis, supra at  411 U. S. 241, and considerations of comity and federalism require that those purposes be accorded no less recognition when a federal court is asked to overturn a state conviction than when it is asked to overturn a federal conviction because of an allegedly unconstitutional grand jury indictment.

No. 74-1656
Argued January 20, 1976
Decided April 27, 1976*
425 U.S. 463

Syllabus 
An Indian tribe and some of its members residing on the tribal reservation in Montana brought actions challenging Montana's cigarette sales taxes and personal property taxes (in particular property taxes on motor vehicles) as applied to reservation Indians, and also the State's vendor licensing statute as applied to tribal members who sell cigarettes at ""smoke shops"" on the reservation, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  After finding that the actions were not barred by 28 U.S.C.  1341, which prohibits district courts from enjoining the assessment, levy, or collection of any state tax where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had in the state courts, the District Court held that Montana was barred from imposing cigarette sales taxes with respect to on-reservation sales by tribal members to Indians residing on the reservation, from imposing the vendor license fee on a tribal member operating a ""smoke shop"" on the reservation, and from imposing a personal property tax as a condition precedent for registration of a motor vehicle, but that the State may require a precollection of the cigarette sales tax imposed by law upon a non-Indian purchaser of cigarettes.
Held:
1. The actions were not barred by  1341.  The legislative history of 28 U.S.C.  1362, which gives district courts original jurisdiction of all civil actions brought by any Indian tribe wherein the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, indicates that, in certain respects, Indian tribes suing under this section were to be accorded treatment similar to that of the United States suing as a tribe's trustee, and therefore, since the United States is not barred by 
Page 425 U. S. 464
  1341 from seeking to enjoin the enforcement of a state tax law, the Tribe is not barred from doing so in these cases.  Pp.  425 U. S. 470-475.
2. The tax on personal property located within the reservation, the vendor license fee, as applied to a reservation Indian conducting a cigarette business for the Tribe on reservation land, and the cigarette sales tax, as applied to on-reservation sales by Indians to Indians, conflict with the federal statutes that provide the basis for decision with respect to such impositions.  McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S. 164; Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145.  Pp.  425 U. S. 475-481.
(a) There is no basis for distinguishing McClanahan, supra, on the ground that the tribal members are now so completely integrated with the non-Indian residents on the reservation that there is no longer any reason to accord them different treatment from other citizens, where it appears that the Tribe has not abandoned its tribal organization, that the Federal Government, not just the State, has made substantial expenditures for various purposes beneficial to the reservation Indians, and that the Tribe's own income contributed to its economic wellbeing.  P.  425 U. S. 476.
(b) Section 6 of the General Allotment Act, which provides that, at the expiration of the Tribe's trust period and when the lands within the reservation have been conveyed to the Indians by patent in fee, then the allottees shall be subject to state laws, does not constitute a basis for permitting Montana to tax reservation Indians.  To apply that statute so as to permit such taxation would result in an impractical pattern of ""checkerboard"" jurisdiction, now discredited by both Congress and this Court, whereby state or federal jurisdiction over the Indians would depend respectively on whether a particular parcel of land was ""fee patented"" or held in trust for the Tribe.  Pp.  425 U. S. 477-479.
(c) The tax immunity for reservation Indians does not constitute invidious racial discrimination against non-Indians, contrary to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, since such immunity meets the test that,
""[a]s long as the special treatment can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress' unique obligation toward the Indians, such legislative judgments will not be disturbed,""
Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535,  417 U. S. 555.  Pp.  425 U. S. 479-480.
3. To the extent that the on-reservation ""smoke shops"" sell to non-Indians upon whom the State has validly imposed a sales tax with respect to the article sold, the State may require the Indian proprietor simply to add the tax to the sales price, and 
Page 425 U. S. 465
 thereby aid the State's collection and enforcement of the tax.  Such a requirement is a minimal burden designed to avoid the likelihood that, in its absence, non-Indians purchasing from the tribal seller will avoid payment of a lawful tax, and it does not frustrate tribal self-government or run afoul of any federal statute dealing with reservation Indians' affairs.  Pp.  425 U. S. 481-483.
392 F.Supp. 1297 and 392 F.Supp. 1325, affirmed.

An Indian tribe and some of its members residing on the tribal reservation in Montana brought actions challenging Montana's cigarette sales taxes and personal property taxes (in particular property taxes on motor vehicles) as applied to reservation Indians, and also the State's vendor licensing statute as applied to tribal members who sell cigarettes at ""smoke shops"" on the reservation, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  After finding that the actions were not barred by 28 U.S.C.  1341, which prohibits district courts from enjoining the assessment, levy, or collection of any state tax where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had in the state courts, the District Court held that Montana was barred from imposing cigarette sales taxes with respect to on-reservation sales by tribal members to Indians residing on the reservation, from imposing the vendor license fee on a tribal member operating a ""smoke shop"" on the reservation, and from imposing a personal property tax as a condition precedent for registration of a motor vehicle, but that the State may require a precollection of the cigarette sales tax imposed by law upon a non-Indian purchaser of cigarettes.
Held:
1. The actions were not barred by  1341.  The legislative history of 28 U.S.C.  1362, which gives district courts original jurisdiction of all civil actions brought by any Indian tribe wherein the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, indicates that, in certain respects, Indian tribes suing under this section were to be accorded treatment similar to that of the United States suing as a tribe's trustee, and therefore, since the United States is not barred by 
Page 425 U. S. 464
  1341 from seeking to enjoin the enforcement of a state tax law, the Tribe is not barred from doing so in these cases.  Pp.  425 U. S. 470-475.
2. The tax on personal property located within the reservation, the vendor license fee, as applied to a reservation Indian conducting a cigarette business for the Tribe on reservation land, and the cigarette sales tax, as applied to on-reservation sales by Indians to Indians, conflict with the federal statutes that provide the basis for decision with respect to such impositions.  McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S. 164; Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145.  Pp.  425 U. S. 475-481.
(a) There is no basis for distinguishing McClanahan, supra, on the ground that the tribal members are now so completely integrated with the non-Indian residents on the reservation that there is no longer any reason to accord them different treatment from other citizens, where it appears that the Tribe has not abandoned its tribal organization, that the Federal Government, not just the State, has made substantial expenditures for various purposes beneficial to the reservation Indians, and that the Tribe's own income contributed to its economic wellbeing.  P.  425 U. S. 476.
(b) Section 6 of the General Allotment Act, which provides that, at the expiration of the Tribe's trust period and when the lands within the reservation have been conveyed to the Indians by patent in fee, then the allottees shall be subject to state laws, does not constitute a basis for permitting Montana to tax reservation Indians.  To apply that statute so as to permit such taxation would result in an impractical pattern of ""checkerboard"" jurisdiction, now discredited by both Congress and this Court, whereby state or federal jurisdiction over the Indians would depend respectively on whether a particular parcel of land was ""fee patented"" or held in trust for the Tribe.  Pp.  425 U. S. 477-479.
(c) The tax immunity for reservation Indians does not constitute invidious racial discrimination against non-Indians, contrary to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, since such immunity meets the test that,
""[a]s long as the special treatment can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress' unique obligation toward the Indians, such legislative judgments will not be disturbed,""
Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535,  417 U. S. 555.  Pp.  425 U. S. 479-480.
3. To the extent that the on-reservation ""smoke shops"" sell to non-Indians upon whom the State has validly imposed a sales tax with respect to the article sold, the State may require the Indian proprietor simply to add the tax to the sales price, and 
Page 425 U. S. 465
 thereby aid the State's collection and enforcement of the tax.  Such a requirement is a minimal burden designed to avoid the likelihood that, in its absence, non-Indians purchasing from the tribal seller will avoid payment of a lawful tax, and it does not frustrate tribal self-government or run afoul of any federal statute dealing with reservation Indians' affairs.  Pp.  425 U. S. 481-483.
392 F.Supp. 1297 and 392 F.Supp. 1325, affirmed.

As a result of selling to Government agents heroin supplied by a Government informant, petitioner was convicted of a federal offense.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's argument that, if the jury believed that the drug was supplied to him by the Government informant he should have been acquitted under the defense of entrapment regardless of his predisposition to commit the crime.  Petitioner contends that, although such predisposition renders unavailable an entrapment defense, the Government's outrageous conduct in supplying him with the contraband denied him due process.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  425 U. S. 488-491;  425 U. S. 491-495.

MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR.

425 U.S. 352

Syllabus 
Under the United States Air Force Academy's Honor Code, which is administered by a cadet committee, cadets pledge that they will not lie, steal, or cheat, or tolerate among their number anyone who does.  If a cadet investigatory team finds that a hearing before an Honor Board concerning a suspected violation is warranted, the accused may call witnesses, and cadet observers attend.  The Board, consisting of eight members, may adjudge guilt only by unanimous vote, but may, if at least six members concur, grant the guilty cadet ""discretion,"" which returns him to his squadron in good standing.  A cadet found guilty without discretion may resign, or request a hearing by a Board of officers or trial by court-martial.  The Honor Board hearing is confidential, but the committee prepares a summary, which is posted on 40 squadron bulletin boards and distributed among Academy faculty and officials.  In not-guilty and discretion cases, names are deleted.  In guilty cases, names are not deleted, but posting is deferred until the cadet has left the Academy.  Ethics Code violations, for less serious breaches, are handled more informally, though on a similarly confidential basis.  Respondents, present or former student law review editors researching for an article, having been denied access to case summaries of honors and ethics hearings (with identifying data deleted), brought this suit to compel disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) against the Department of the Air Force and certain Academy officers (hereinafter collectively the Agency).  The District Court, without in camera inspection, granted the Agency's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the summaries were ""matters . . . related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency,"" and thus exempted from mandatory disclosure under Exemption 2 of the FOIA.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that exemption inapplicable.  The Agency had made the contention, which the District Court rejected, that the case summaries fell within Exemption 6 as constituting
""personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted 
Page 425 U. S. 353
 invasion of personal privacy.""
The Court of Appeals, while disagreeing with the District Court's approach, did not hold that the Agency, without any prior court inspection, had to turn over the summaries to respondents with only the proper names removed, or that Exemption 6 covered all or any part of the summaries, but held that, because the Agency had not maintained its statutory burden in the District Court of sustaining its action by means of affidavits or testimony, further inquiry was required, and that the Agency had to produce the summaries for an in camera inspection, cooperating with the District Court in redacting the records so as to delete personal references and all other identifying information.
Held:
1. The limited statutory exemptions do not obscure the basic policy that disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant legislative objective of the FOIA.  Pp.  425 U. S. 360-362.
2. Exemption 2 does not generally apply to matters, such as the summaries here involved, in which there is a genuine and important public interest.  Pp.  425 U. S. 362-370.
(a) The phrasing of that exemption reflected congressional dissatisfaction with the ""internal management"" exemption of former  3 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and was generally designed, as the Senate Report made clear, to delineate between, on the one hand, trivial matters and, on the other, more substantial matters in which the public might have a legitimate interest.  Pp.  425 U. S. 362-367.
(b) The public has a substantial concern with the Academy's administration of discipline and procedures that affect the training of Air Force officers and their military careers.  Pp.  425 U. S. 367-369.
3. Exemption 6 does not create a blanket exemption for personnel files.  With respect to such files and ""similar files,"" Congress enunciated a policy, to be judicially enforced, involving a balancing of public and private interests.  Regardless of whether the documents whose disclosure is sought are in ""personnel"" or ""similar"" files, nondisclosure is not sanctioned unless there is a showing of a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and redaction of documents to permit disclosure of nonexempt portions is appropriate under Exemption 6.  Pp.  425 U. S. 370-376.
4. Even if ""personnel files"" were to be considered as wholly exempt from disclosure under Exemption 6 without regard to whether disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the case summaries here were not in that category, although they constituted ""similar files,"" relating as they 
Page 425 U. S. 354
 do to the discipline of cadets, and their disclosure implication similar privacy values.  Pp.  425 U. S. 376-377.
5. The Court of Appeals did not err in ordering the Agency to produce the case summaries for the District Court's in camera examination, a procedure that represents ""a workable compromise between individual rights and the preservation of public rights to [G]overnment information,'"" which is the statutory goal of Exemption 6.  Pp.  425 U. S. 378-381.
(a) The limitation in Exemption 6 to cases of ""clearly unwarranted"" invasions of privacy indicates that Congress did not intend a matter to be exempted from disclosure merely because it could not be guaranteed that disclosure would not trigger recollection of identity in any person whatever, and Congress vested the courts with the responsibility of determining de novo whether the exemption was properly invoked.  Pp.  425 U. S. 378-380.
(b) Respondents' request for access to summaries ""with personal references or other identifying information deleted"" respected the confidentiality interests embodied in Exemption 6 and comported with the Academy's tradition of confidentiality.  Pp.  425 U. S. 380-381.

No. 74-18

Decided April 21, 1976*
425 U.S. 391

Syllabus 
In each of these cases taxpayers, who were under investigation for possible civil or criminal liability under the federal income tax laws, after having obtained from their respective accountants certain documents relating to the accountants' preparation of their tax returns, transferred the documents to their respective attorneys to assist the taxpayers in connection with the investigations.  Subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service served summonses on the attorneys directing them to produce the documents, but the attorneys refused to comply.  The Government then brought enforcement actions, and, in each case, the District Court ordered the summons enforced.  In No. 74-18 the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the taxpayers had never acquired a possessory interest in the documents and that the documents were not immune from production in the attorney's hands.  But in No. 74-611, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, by virtue of the Fifth Amendment, the documents would have been privileged from production pursuant to a summons directed to the taxpayer if he had retained possession, and that, in light of the attorney-client relationship, the taxpayer retained such privilege after transferring the documents to his attorney.
Held:

			"|"Fisher v. United States
No. 74-18
Argued November 3, 1975
Decided April 21, 1976*
425 U.S. 391

Syllabus 
In each of these cases taxpayers, who were under investigation for possible civil or criminal liability under the federal income tax laws, after having obtained from their respective accountants certain documents relating to the accountants' preparation of their tax returns, transferred the documents to their respective attorneys to assist the taxpayers in connection with the investigations.  Subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service served summonses on the attorneys directing them to produce the documents, but the attorneys refused to comply.  The Government then brought enforcement actions, and, in each case, the District Court ordered the summons enforced.  In No. 74-18 the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the taxpayers had never acquired a possessory interest in the documents and that the documents were not immune from production in the attorney's hands.  But in No. 74-611, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, by virtue of the Fifth Amendment, the documents would have been privileged from production pursuant to a summons directed to the taxpayer if he had retained possession, and that, in light of the attorney-client relationship, the taxpayer retained such privilege after transferring the documents to his attorney.

Syllabus 
Respondent, who had been charged with various federal offenses, made a pretrial motion to suppress microfilms of checks, deposit slips, and other records relating to his accounts at two banks, which maintained the records pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (Act).  He contended that the subpoenas duces tecum pursuant to which the material had been produced by the banks were defective, and that the records had thus been illegally seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Following denial of his motion, respondent was tried and convicted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, having concluded that the subpoenaed documents fell within a constitutionally protected zone of privacy.
Held:  Respondent possessed no Fourth Amendment interest in the bank records that could be vindicated by a challenge to the subpoenas, and the District Court therefore did not err in denying the motion to suppress.  Pp.  425 U. S. 440-446.
(a) The subpoenaed materials were business records of the banks, not respondent's private papers.  Pp.  425 U. S. 440-441.
(b) There is no legitimate ""expectation of privacy"" in the contents of the original checks and deposit slips, since the checks are not confidential communications, but negotiable instruments to be used in commercial transactions, and all the documents obtained contain only information voluntarily conveyed to the banks and exposed to their employees in the ordinary course of business.  The Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities.  The Act's recordkeeping requirements do not alter . these considerations so as to create a protectable Fourth Amendment interest of a bank depositor in the bank's records of his account.  Pp. 441-443.
(c) Issuance of a subpoena to a third party does not violate a defendant's rights, even if a criminal prosecution is contemplated at the time the subpoena is issued.  California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz, 416 U. S. 21,  416 U. S. 53.  Pp.  425 U. S. 444-445. 
Page 425 U. S. 436

(d) Access to bank records under the Act is to be controlled by ""existing legal process.""  That does not mean that greater judicial scrutiny, equivalent to that required for a search warrant, is necessary when a subpoena is used to obtain a depositor's bank records.  Pp.  425 U. S. 445-446.

Syllabus 
Respondents, Negro tenants in or applicants for public housing in Chicago, brought separate class actions against the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), alleging that CHA had deliberately selected family public housing sites in Chicago to ""avoid the placement of Negro families in white neighborhoods"" in violation of federal statutes and the Fourteenth Amendment, and that HUD had assisted in that policy by providing financial assistance and other support for CHA's discriminatory housing projects.  The District Court on the basis of the evidence entered summary judgment against CHA, which was ordered to take remedial action.  The court then granted a motion to dismiss the HUD action, which meanwhile had been held in abeyance.  The Court of Appeals reversed, having found that HUD had committed constitutional and statutory violations by sanctioning and assisting CHA's discriminatory program.  The District Court thereafter consolidated the CHA and HUD cases and, having rejected respondents' motion to consider metropolitan area relief, adopted petitioner's proposed order for corrective action in Chicago.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case ""for additional evidence and for further consideration of the issue of metropolitan area relief.""
Held:  A metropolitan area remedy in this case is not impermissible as a matter of law.  Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717, distinguished.  Pp.  425 U. S. 296-306.
(a) A remedial order against HUD affecting its conduct in the area beyond Chicago's geographic boundaries but within the housing market relevant to the respondents' housing options is warranted here because HUD, in contrast to the suburban school districts in Milliken, committed violations of the Constitution and federal statutes.  Milliken imposes no per se rule that federal courts lack authority to order corrective action beyond the municipal boundaries where the violations occurred.  Pp.  425 U. S. 297-300. 
Page 425 U. S. 285

(b) The order affecting HUD's conduct beyond Chicago's boundaries would not impermissibly interfere with local governments and suburban housing authorities that were not implicated in HUD's unconstitutional conduct.  Under the  8 Lower-Income Housing Assistance program of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, HUD may contract directly with private owners and developers to make leased housing units available to eligible lower income persons, with local governmental units retaining the right to comment on specific proposals, to reject certain programs that are inconsistent with their approved housing assistance plans, and to require that zoning and other land use restrictions be observed by builders.

425 U.S. 308

Syllabus 
Respondent state prison inmates in No. 74-1194 filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief alleging that procedures used in prison disciplinary proceedings violated their rights to due process and equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court granted relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that minimum notice and a right to respond are due an inmate faced even with a temporary suspension of privileges, that an inmate at a disciplinary hearing who is denied the privilege of confronting and cross-examining witnesses must receive written reasons or the denial will be deemed prima facie evidence of abuse of discretion, and that an inmate facing prison discipline for a violation that might also be punishable in state criminal proceedings has a right to counsel (not just counsel substitute) at the prison hearing.  Respondent state prison inmate in No. 74-1187, upon being charged with inciting a prison disturbance, was summoned before prison authorities and informed that he might be prosecuted for a violation of state law, that he should consult an attorney (although the attorney would not be permitted to be present during the disciplinary hearing), and that he had a right to remain silent during the hearing, but that, if he did so, his silence would be held against him.  On the basis of the hearing, at which respondent remained silent, he was placed in ""punitive segregation"" for 30 days.  He then filed an action for damages and injunctive relief, claiming that the disciplinary hearing violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that an inmate at a prison disciplinary proceeding must be advised of his right to remain silent, that he must not be questioned further once he exercises that right, that such silence may not be used against him at that time or in future proceedings, and that, where criminal charges 
Page 425 U. S. 309
 are a realistic possibility, prison authorities should consider whether defense counsel, if requested, should be permitted at the proceeding.
Held:  The procedures required by the respective Courts of Appeals are either inconsistent with the ""reasonable accommodation"" reached in Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, between institutional needs and objectives and the constitutional provisions of general application, or are premature on the basis of the case records.  Pp.  425 U. S. 314-324.
(a) Prison inmates do not ""have a right to either retained or appointed counsel in disciplinary hearings.""  Wolff, supra, at  418 U. S. 570.  Pp.  425 U. S. 314-315.
(b) Permitting an adverse inference to be drawn from an inmate's silence at his disciplinary proceedings is not, on its face, an invalid practice, and there is no basis in the record for invalidating it as applied to respondent in No. 74-1187.  Pp.  425 U. S. 316-320.
(c) Mandating that inmates should have the privilege of confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses at prison disciplinary proceedings, except where prison officials can justify their denial of such privilege on grounds that would satisfy a court of law, effectively preempts the area that Wolff, supra, left to the sound discretion of prison officials, and there is no evidence of abuse of such discretion by the prison officials in No. 74-1194.  Pp.  425 U. S. 320-323.
(d) Where there was no evidence that any of the respondents in No. 74-1194 were subject to the ""lesser penalty"" of loss of privileges, but rather it appeared that all were charged with ""serious misconduct,"" the Court of Appeals acted prematurely to the extent it required procedures such as notice and an opportunity to respond even when an inmate is faced with a temporary suspension of privileges.

Pp.  425 U. S. 320-323.
(d) Where there was no evidence that any of the respondents in No. 74-1194 were subject to the ""lesser penalty"" of loss of privileges, but rather it appeared that all were charged with ""serious misconduct,"" the Court of Appeals acted prematurely to the extent it required procedures such as notice and an opportunity to respond even when an inmate is faced with a temporary suspension of privileges.  Pp.  425 U. S. 323-324.

No. 75-623
Decided April 19, 1976
425 U.S. 262

Syllabus 
This Court has no jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1253 over an appeal from a three-judge District Court's order enjoining appellants from prosecuting appellee theater operator on the felony charge that his motion picture projector used to exhibit an allegedly obscene film was a ""criminal instrument"" under  16.01 of the Texas Penal Code.  The ground for the injunction was not that  16.01 was unconstitutional, but that the local officials had acted in bad faith and unconstitutionally in using that statute (which the District Court found could ""by no stretch of the imagination"" be read as applying) as a pretext for forcing appellee to stop exhibiting the film, without any design to convict him on the felony charge.  Since a three-judge court was therefore not required, the appeal should have been taken to the Court of Appeals.
404 F.Supp. 33, vacated and remanded.

Syllabus 
A county regulation limiting the length of county policemen's hair held not to violate any right guaranteed respondent policeman by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  425 U. S. 244-249.
(a) Respondent sought the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment, not as an ordinary citizen, but as a law enforcement employee of the county, a subdivision of the State, and this distinction is one of considerable significance, since a State has wider latitude and notably different interests in imposing restrictive regulations on its employees than it does in regulating the citizenry at large.  P.  425 U. S. 245.
(b) Choice of organization, dress, and equipment for law enforcement personnel is entitled to the same sort of presumption of legislative validity as are state choices to promote other aims within the cognizance of the State's police power.  Thus, the question is not whether the State can ""establish"" a ""genuine public need"" for the specific regulation, but whether respondent can demonstrate that there is no rational connection between the regulation, based as it is on the county's method of organizing its police force, and the promotion of safety of persons and property.  P.  425 U. S. 245-247.
(c) Whether a state or local government's choice to have its police uniformed reflects a desire to make police officers readily recognizable to the public or to foster the esprit de corps that similarity of garb and appearance may inculcate within the police force itself, the justification for the hair style regulation is sufficiently rational to defeat respondent's claim based on the liberty guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 5, 1976
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL concurs, dissenting. 
 The Court today again refuses to grant certiorari to consider the proper implementation of the 'minimization' requirement of 18 U.S.C. 2518(5) (1970), one of the core provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. See, e.g., Bynum v. United States, 423 U.S. 952 (1975) (Brennan, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). The 'minimization' provision, which requires that every order and extension thereof authorizing electronic surveillance shall 'contain a provision, that the authorization to intercept shall be . . . conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter,' 
Page 425 U.S. 917 , 918
 the 'minimization' and companion safeguards [e.g., 2518(3)(a)(b)(c)( d)] were designed to assure that 'the order will link up specific person, specific offense, and specific place. Together [the provisions of Title III] are intended to meet the test of the Constitution that electronic surveillance techniques by used only under the most precise and discriminate circumstances, which fully comply with the requirement of particularity.'

 When the Court denied certiorari in Bynum, I indicated my reasons for believing that 'we plainly fail in our judicial responsibility when we do not review these cases to give content to the congressional mandate of 'minimization,"" particularly since guidance for judges authorizing electronic surveillance 'is absolutely essential if the congressional mandate to confine execution of authorized surveillance within constitutional and statutory bounds is to be carried out.'

Indeed, it is even more urgent in light of the proliferation of opinions- exemplified by these cases from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit-sanctioning round-the-clock surveillance in which every conversation, whether innocuous or incriminating, is intercepted. 
 The facts of this case are relatively simple. The government sought and obtained authorization to intercept wire communications over a certain specified telephone on the ground that there was probable cause to believe that certain named individuals were using that telephone in connection with the commission of narcotics offenses, and that information concerning the offenses would be obtained through the interception of the communications over the telephone.

No. 74-5968

Decided March 30, 1976
425 U.S. 80

Syllabus 
The trial court's order preventing petitioner, the defendant in a federal criminal prosecution, from consulting his counsel ""about anything"" during a 17-hour overnight recess in the trial between his direct- and cross-examination held to deprive petitioner of his right to the assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.  Pp.  425 U. S. 86-91.
(a) A federal trial judge has broad power to sequester nonparty witnesses before, during, and after their testimony to restrain them from ""tailoring"" their testimony, to aid in detecting less-than-candid testimony, and (in the case of a recess called before testimony is completed) to prevent improper attempts to influence the testimony in light of the testimony already given.  But a sequestration order applied to a criminal defendant affects the defendant quite differently from a nonparty witness, who presumably has no stake in the trial's outcome and little, other than his own testimony, to discuss with trial counsel.  The defendant has the right to be present for all testimony, and may discuss his testimony with his attorney up to the time he takes the witness stand, so sequestration accomplishes less when applied to a defendant during a recess.  A defendant is ordinarily ill-equipped to comprehend the trial process without a lawyer's guidance; he often must consult with counsel during the trial, and during overnight recesses often discusses the events of the day's trial and their significance.  Pp.  425 U. S. 87-89.
(b) The problem of possible improper influence on testimony or ""coaching"" can be dealt with in other ways, such as by a prosecutor's skillful cross-examination to discover whether ""coaching"" occurred during a recess, or by the trial judge's directing that the examination of witnesses continue without interruption until completed, or otherwise arranging the sequence of testimony so that direct- and cross-examination of a witness will be completed without interruption.  Pp.  425 U. S. 89-91. 
Page 425 U. S. 81

(c) To the extent that conflict remains between the defendant' right to consult with his attorney during an overnight recess in the trial, and the prosecutor's desire to cross-examine the defendant without the intervention of counsel, with the risk of improper ""coaching,"" the conflict must, under the Sixth Amendment, be resolved in favor of the right to the assistance and guidance of counsel.

Syllabus 
During the course of petitioner's criminal trial, the chief prosecution witness (Newman) indicated on cross-examination that, on certain dates, he was interviewed by Government lawyers who took notes relating to Newman's forthcoming trial testimony, and that Newman verified the accuracy of the notes.  Petitioner thereupon moved for production of the notes pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C.  3500, which provides that, in a federal criminal prosecution after a witness called by the Government has testified on direct examination, the court, on the defendant's motion, shall order the Government to produce any ""statement"" in its possession that relates to the subject matter of the witness' testimony.  In relevant part, a ""statement"" is defined as ""a written statement made by said witness and signed or other vise adopted or approved by him.""   3500(e)(1).  The trial judge denied petitioner's motion on the ground that the material was ""the work product of counsel"" and declined to inspect the material in camera.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that the notes were not statements of the witness within the meaning of  3500(e).
Held:
1. Any writing prepared by a Government lawyer relating to the subject matter of the testimony of a Government witness that has been ""signed or otherwise adopted or approved"" by that witness is producible under the Jencks Act, and the writing is not rendered nonproducible because a Government lawyer interviewed the witness and wrote the statement.  Pp.  425 U. S. 101-108.
(a) Nothing in the language or legislative history of the Jencks Act excepts as a lawyer's ""work product"" a statement within the definition of a producible statement.  Pp.  425 U. S. 101-102.
(b) Nor is the Act limited to statements made to an investigative agency, as distinguished from prosecutors preparing for trial.  Though the Government's argument to the contrary is based on the asserted unfairness of allowing defense counsel to impeach a witness by a statement that is the product of the attorney's selections, rather than his own, the writings are producible only if they meet the terms of the statutory definition; 
Page 425 U. S. 95
 the Act itself protects witnesses from this unfairness; and it also safeguards the primary policy of the work product doctrine by protecting the privacy of an attorney's mental processes.  Pp.  425 U. S. 102-106.
(c) Production of statements within  3500(e)(1) and written by Government lawyers will not force such lawyers to testify at trial.  Moreover, there is a clearly legitimate purpose for the statutory disclosure, i.e., furtherance of ""the fair and just administration of criminal justice,"" Campbell v. United States, 365 U. S. 85,  365 U. S. 92 (Campbell I); lawyers will not become witnesses, since statements are producible only where they can fairly be said to be the witness' own; and defense counsel will have no right to call Government lawyers to authenticate their notes.  Pp.  425 U. S. 106-107.
2. In the circumstances of this case, the Court of Appeals erred in making the initial determination that the writings in question were not producible statements.  Campbell v. United States, 373 U. S. 487,  373 U. S. 493 (Campbell II).  Pp.  425 U. S. 108-111.
(a) Newman's testimony was sufficient to call upon the trial judge to conduct an inquiry into the producibility of the material.  Such an inquiry is now required to determine whether petitioner's Jencks Act motion should have been granted.  Campbell I, supra, at  365 U. S. 98-99.  Pp.  425 U. S. 108-110.
(b) It is not necessary for this Court to vacate petitioner's conviction and order a new trial, since petitioner's rights can be fully protected by a remand to the trial court for an inquiry into the producibility of the material, the supplementing of the record with findings, and the availability of appellate review should the trial court decide that a new trial is not required.  Pp.  425 U. S. 110-111.  Vacated and remanded.

Syllabus 
The 1954 New Orleans City Charter provides for a seven-member city council, with one member being elected from each of five councilmanic districts, and two being elected by the voters of the city at large.  In 1961 the council, as it was required to do after each decennial census, redistricted the city based on the 1960 census so that, in one councilmanic district, Negroes constituted a majority of the population, but only about half of the registered voters, and, in the other four districts, white voters outnumbered Negroes.  No Negro was elected to the council from 1960 to 1970.  After the 1970 census, the council devised a reapportionment plan, under which there would be Negro population majorities in two councilmanic districts and a Negro voter majority in one.  Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits a State or political subdivision subject to  4 of the Act (as New Orleans is) from enforcing a proposed change in voting procedures unless it has obtained a declaratory judgment from the District Court of the District of Columbia that such change ""does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color"" or has submitted the change to the Attorney General and he has not objected to it.  After the proposed plan had been objected to by the Attorney General, New Orleans sought a declaratory judgment in the District Court.  That court refused to allow the plan to go into effect, holding that it would have the effect of abridging Negro voting rights, and that, moreover, the plan's failure to alter the city charter provision for two at-large seats in itself had such effect.
Held:
1. Since  5's language clearly provides that it applies only to proposed changes in voting procedures, and since the at-large seats existed without change since 1954, those seats were not subject to review under  5.  The District Court consequently erred in holding that the plan could be rejected under  5 solely because it did not eliminate the two at-large seats.  Pp.  425 U. S. 138-139.
2. A legislative reapportionment that enhances the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the 
Page 425 U. S. 131
 electoral franchise cannot violate  5 unless the new apportionment itself so discriminates racially as to violate the Constitution.  Applying this standard here, where, in contrast to the 1961 apportionment under which none of the five councilmanic districts had a clear Negro voting majority and no Negro had been elected to the council, Negroes under the plan in question will constitute a population majority in two of the five districts and a clear voting majority in one, it is predictable that, by bloc voting, one and perhaps two Negroes will be elected to the council.  The District Court therefore erred in concluding that the plan would have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color within the meaning of  5.  Pp.  425 U.

Prior to 1960, the Suits in Admiralty Act authorized suit against the United States in cases involving vessels owned by, possessed by, or operated by or for the United States, if such suit could have been maintained had the vessel been a private one, and provided further that such vessel was employed as a merchant vessel.  In 1960, Congress amended the Act by deleting.the latter proviso.  The Public Vessels Act authorizes suit against the United States in cases involving ""a public vessel of the United States,"" but bars such a suit by a foreign national unless it appears that his government allows a United States national to sue in its courts under similar circumstances.  Respondent, a Philippine corporation, alleging jurisdiction under both Acts, sued the United States to recover damages resulting from the sinking of its fishing vessel after a collision with a United States naval destroyer.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that, since the destroyer was a ""public vessel of the United States,"" the suit was governed by the Public Vessels Act, that therefore respondent was subject to that Act's reciprocity provision, and that, since there was no such reciprocity, the suit was barred.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the suit, although involving a public vessel, was maintainable under the Suits in Admiralty Act, as amended in 1960 to delete the ""employed as a merchant vessel"" proviso, free from the restrictions, including the reciprocity requirement, imposed by the Public Vessels Act.
Held:  Claims within the scope of the Public Vessels Act remain subject to its terms after the 1960 amendment to the Suits in Admiralty Act, and, since respondent's claim falls within the Public Vessels Act, the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that that Act's reciprocity provision did not apply.  Pp.  425 U. S. 166-182.
(a) The Court of Appeals' interpretation of the 1960 amendment to the Suits in Admiralty Act would render the Public Vessels Act's restrictions ineffectual, and would effectively nullify

(b) The legislative histories of the Public Vessels Act, the Suits in Admiralty Act, and, in particular, the 1960 amendment to the latter, indicate clearly that Congress did not intend to authorize the wholesale evasion of the restrictions specifically imposed by the Public Vessels Act on suits for damages caused by public vessels, but deleted the ""employed as a merchant vessel"" proviso merely to remove uncertainty a to the proper forum in which to bring a maritime claim against the United States, especially a contract claim, where it had been uncertain whether it should be brought on the admiralty side of a district court under the Suits in Admiralty Act or Public Vessels Act or in the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act.

Syllabus 
Petitioner accounting firm was retained to audit periodically a brokerage firm's books and records.  Respondents, who were customers of the brokerage firm, invested in a securities scheme ultimately revealed as fraudulent and perpetrated by the firm's president and principal stockholder.  After the fraud came to light, respondents filed an action for damages against petitioner under  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), which makes it unlawful to use or employ ""any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance"" in contravention of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.  It was alleged that the brokerage firm president's scheme violated  10(b) and SEC Rule 10b-5, and that petitioner had ""aided and abetted"" the violations by its ""failure"" to conduct proper audits of the firm, thereby failing to discover internal practices that prevented an effective audit.  The District Court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action, holding that whether or not a cause of action could be based merely on allegations of negligence, there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether petitioner had conducted its audits in accordance with generally accepted standards.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that one who breaches a duty of inquiry and disclosure owed another is liable in damages for aiding and abetting a third party's violation of Rule 10b-5 if the fraud would have been discovered or prevented but for the breach, and that there were genuine issues of fact as to whether petitioner committed such a breach and whether inquiry and disclosure would have led to discovery or prevention of the president's fraud.
Held:
1. A private cause of action for damages will not lie under  10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in the absence of any allegation of ""scienter,"" i.e., intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud on the defendant's part.  Pp.  425 U. S. 194-214.
(a) The use of the words ""manipulative,"" ""device,"" and ""contrivance"" in  10(b) clearly shows that it was intended to 
Page 425 U. S. 186
 proscribe a type of conduct quite different from negligence, and, more particularly, the use of the word ""manipulative,"" virtually a term of art used in connection with securities markets, connotes intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities.  Pp.  425 U. S. 197-201.
(b) The 1934 Act's legislative history also indicates that  10(b) was addressed to practices involving some element of scienter, and cannot be read to impose liability for negligent conduct alone.  Pp.  425 U. S. 201-206.
(c) The structure of the 1934 Act and the interrelated Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) does not support the contention that, since  10(b), in contrast to certain other sections of these Acts, is not, by its terms, explicitly restricted to willful, knowing, or purposeful conduct, it should not be construed to require more than negligent action or inaction as a precondition for civil liability.  In each instance that Congress in these Acts created express civil liability in favor of purchasers or sellers of securities, it clearly specified whether recovery was to be premised on knowing or intentional conduct, negligence, or entirely innocent mistake.  The express recognition of a cause of action premised on negligent behavior in  11, for example, stands in sharp contrast to the language of  10(b).  Moreover, each of the express civil remedies in the 1933 Act allowing recovery for negligent conduct is subject to significant procedural restrictions indicating that the judicially created private damages remedy under  10(b) -- which has no comparable restrictions -- cannot be extended, consistently with Congress' intent, to actions premised on negligence, since to do so would allow causes of action under these express 1933 Act remedies to be brought instead under  10(b), thereby nullifying the effectiveness of such restrictions on those remedies.  Pp.  425 U. S. 206-211.
(d) While there is language in Rule 10b-5 that could arguably be read as proscribing any type of material misstatement or omission and any course of conduct that has the effect of defrauding investors, whether the wrongdoing was intentional or not, such a reading does not comport with the Rule's administrative history which makes it clear that it was intended to apply only to activities involving scienter.  More importantly, the scope of Rule 10b-5 cannot exceed the power granted the SEC under  10(b), whose language and history compel interpreting the Rule to apply only to intentional wrongdoing.  Pp.  425 U. S. 212-214. 
Page 425 U. S. 187

2. The case will not be remanded for further proceedings to require proof of more than negligent misfeasance by petitioner, since, throughout the history of the case, respondents have proceeded on a theory of liability premised on negligence, in fact, specifically disclaiming that petitioner had engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct.  P.  425 U. S. 215.

It was alleged that the brokerage firm president's scheme violated  10(b) and SEC Rule 10b-5, and that petitioner had ""aided and abetted"" the violations by its ""failure"" to conduct proper audits of the firm, thereby failing to discover internal practices that prevented an effective audit.  The District Court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action, holding that whether or not a cause of action could be based merely on allegations of negligence, there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether petitioner had conducted its audits in accordance with generally accepted standards.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that one who breaches a duty of inquiry and disclosure owed another is liable in damages for aiding and abetting a third party's violation of Rule 10b-5 if the fraud would have been discovered or prevented but for the breach, and that there were genuine issues of fact as to whether petitioner committed such a breach and whether inquiry and disclosure would have led to discovery or prevention of the president's fraud.
Held:
1. A private cause of action for damages will not lie under  10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in the absence of any allegation of ""scienter,"" i.e., intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud on the defendant's part.  Pp.  425 U. S. 194-214.
(a) The use of the words ""manipulative,"" ""device,"" and ""contrivance"" in  10(b) clearly shows that it was intended to 
Page 425 U. S. 186
 proscribe a type of conduct quite different from negligence, and, more particularly, the use of the word ""manipulative,"" virtually a term of art used in connection with securities markets, connotes intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities.  Pp.  425 U. S. 197-201.
(b) The 1934 Act's legislative history also indicates that  10(b) was addressed to practices involving some element of scienter, and cannot be read to impose liability for negligent conduct alone.  Pp.  425 U. S. 201-206.
(c) The structure of the 1934 Act and the interrelated Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) does not support the contention that, since  10(b), in contrast to certain other sections of these Acts, is not, by its terms, explicitly restricted to willful, knowing, or purposeful conduct, it should not be construed to require more than negligent action or inaction as a precondition for civil liability.  In each instance that Congress in these Acts created express civil liability in favor of purchasers or sellers of securities, it clearly specified whether recovery was to be premised on knowing or intentional conduct, negligence, or entirely innocent mistake.  The express recognition of a cause of action premised on negligent behavior in  11, for example, stands in sharp contrast to the language of  10(b).  Moreover, each of the express civil remedies in the 1933 Act allowing recovery for negligent conduct is subject to significant procedural restrictions indicating that the judicially created private damages remedy under  10(b) -- which has no comparable restrictions -- cannot be extended, consistently with Congress' intent, to actions premised on negligence, since to do so would allow causes of action under these express 1933 Act remedies to be brought instead under  10(b), thereby nullifying the effectiveness of such restrictions on those remedies.  Pp.  425 U. S. 206-211.
(d) While there is language in Rule 10b-5 that could arguably be read as proscribing any type of material misstatement or omission and any course of conduct that has the effect of defrauding investors, whether the wrongdoing was intentional or not, such a reading does not comport with the Rule's administrative history which makes it clear that it was intended to apply only to activities involving scienter.  More importantly, the scope of Rule 10b-5 cannot exceed the power granted the SEC under  10(b), whose language and history compel interpreting the Rule to apply only to intentional wrongdoing.  Pp.  425 U. S. 212-214. 
Page 425 U. S. 187

2. The case will not be remanded for further proceedings to require proof of more than negligent misfeasance by petitioner, since, throughout the history of the case, respondents have proceeded on a theory of liability premised on negligence, in fact, specifically disclaiming that petitioner had engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct.  P.  425 U. S. 215.

Respondent, as assignee of more than 60 commercial pharmacies, brought this antitrust action against petitioner manufacturers, charging that, by selling drugs to certain hospitals, each of which has a pharmacy, at prices lower than those charged to respondent's assignors, petitioners violated the Robinson-Patman Act, which makes it unlawful for one engaged in commerce to discriminate in price between different purchasers of like commodities where ""the effect . . . may be substantially to lessen competition.""  15 U.S.C.  13(a).  Petitioners claimed that the challenged sales were exempt under the Nonprofit Institutions Act, which, inter alia, excludes from the application of the Robinson-Patman Act nonprofit hospitals' ""purchases of their supplies for their own use.""   13c.  The District Court ruled on the basis of the evidence adduced that the hospitals involved were nonprofit, and that their drug purchases were ""for their own use"" within the meaning of  13c, and granted summary judgment in favor of petitioners.  The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded.  While agreeing that the designated hospitals were nonprofit, that court concluded that a hospital's drugs are purchased for its ""own use"" only where the hospital can be said to be the consumer, i.e., 
Page 425 U. S. 2
 where dispensations are to inpatients and emergency facility patients.
Held:
1. Section 13c does not exempt all of a nonprofit hospital's drug purchases from the Robinson-Patman Act, but the exempting language must be construed as applying to what reasonably may be regarded as use by the hospital in the sense that such use is part of and promotes the hospital's intended institutional operation in the care of its patients.  Pp.  425 U. S. 8-14.
2. Applying the foregoing rule, drug purchases by a nonprofit hospital are exempt a being for the hospital's ""own use"" if the drugs are dispensed:
(a) To the inpatient for use in his treatment at the hospital; to the patient admitted to the hospital's emergency facility for use in his treatment there; or to the outpatient for personal use on the hospital premises.  Such dispensations are part of the hospital's basic function.  P.  425 U. S. 14.
(b) To the inpatient, or to the emergency facility patient, upon his discharge, and to the outpatient, all for off-premises personal use, provided these take-home dispensations are for a limited and reasonable time, as a continuation of, or supplement to, hospital treatment.  Pp.  425 U. S. 14-15.
(c) To the hospital employee or student for personal use, or for the use of his dependent.  Each is a member of the hospital family and dispensation to him furthers the hospital's functions.  P.  425 U. S. 16.
(d) To the physician staff member for his personal use or the use of his dependent.  Here the considerations are similar to those in (c), supra.  Pp.  425 U. S. 16-17.
3. Purchases for the following types of dispensation are not exempt, since they are not for the hospital's ""own use"":
(a) To the former patient, by way of a renewal of a prescription given when he was an inpatient, an emergency facility patient, or an outpatient.  The purpose of the exemption has been exceeded where the connection with the hospital has reached the refill stage.  Pp.  425 U. S. 15-16.
(b) To nondependents of those covered in  2(c) and (d), supra.  These relationships are too attenuated for the statutory benefit.  Pp.  425 U. S. 16,  425 U. S. 17.
(c) To the walk-in customer, who has no present connection with the hospital or its pharmacy (except in the occasional emergency situation, which can be viewed as de minimis).  Pp.  425 U. S. 17-18. 
Page 425 U. S. 3

4. Under these standards, the hospital can either put all the drugs it purchases to its ""own use"" exclusively, or can keep separate records for the drugs put to its ""own use"" and for those otherwise dispensed, making accounting submissions to the supplier for price adjustments.  The supplier is protected from antitrust liability if he reasonably and noncollusively relies upon the hospital's certification as to its dispensation of drugs purchased from the supplier.

Syllabus 
The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) provides four methods of disposing of cases involving servicemen's offenses:  general, special, and summary courts-martial, and disciplinary punishment pursuant to Art. 15 of the UCMJ.  General courts-martial and special courts-martial, which may impose substantial penalties, resemble judicial proceedings, nearly always presided over by lawyer judges, with lawyer counsel for both sides.  Article 15 punishment, conducted personally by the accused's commanding officer, is an administrative method of dealing with most minor offenses.  A summary court-martial, lying in between the informal Art. 15 procedure and the judicial procedures of general and special courts-martial, is designed ""to exercise justice promptly for relatively minor offenses"" in an informal proceeding conducted by a single commissioned officer, acting as judge, factfinder, prosecutor, and defense counsel (with jurisdiction only over noncommissioned officers and other enlisted personnel), who can impose as maximum sentences:  30 days' confinement at hard labor or 45 days' hard labor without confinement; two months' restriction to specified limits; reduction to the lowest enlisted pay grade; and forfeiture of two-thirds pay for one month. If the accused does not consent to trial by summary court-martial, the case will either be referred to a special or general court-martial, or be dismissed.  Various enlisted members of the Marine Corps (hereinafter plaintiffs) charged for the most part with ""unauthorized absences"" brought this class action in District Court challenging the authority of the military to try them at summary courts-martial without providing them with counsel.  All the plaintiffs had consented 
Page 425 U. S. 26
 in writing to be tried by summary court-martial, without counsel, after having been advised that they could be tried by special court-martial with counsel provided and having been apprised of the maximum sentences imposable under the two procedures.  The District Court entered a judgment for the plaintiffs.  The Court of Appeals vacated the judgment and remanded the ease for reconsideration in the light of its opinion in Daigle v. Warner, 490 F.2d 358, wherein it had held that there is no right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment in summary courts-martial and no absolute Fifth Amendment due process right in every case in which a military defendant might be imprisoned, but that, in line with Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778, counsel is required where the accused makes a request based on a timely and colorable claim (1) that he has a defense and (2) that there are mitigating circumstances, and the assistance of counsel is necessary in order adequately to present his defense.
Held:
1. There is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in a summary court-martial, since that proceeding is not a ""criminal prosecution"" as that term is used in the Amendment.  Pp.  425 U. S. 33-42.
(a) Even in a civilian context, the fact that a proceeding will result in the loss of liberty does not ipso facto mean that the proceeding is a ""criminal prosecution"" for Sixth Amendment purposes, Gagnon v. Scarpelli, supra, at  411 U. S. 788-789; In re Gault, 387 U. S. 1,  387 U. S. 30; and when it is taken into account that a summary court-martial occurs in the military, rather than a civilian, community, the considerations supporting the conclusion that it is not a ""criminal prosecution"" are at least as strong as the factors that were held dispositive in those cases.  The charges against most of the plaintiffs here have no common law counterpart and carry little popular opprobrium; nor are the penalties comparable to civilian sanctions.  Pp.  425 U. S. 34-40.
(b) A summary court-martial, unlike a criminal trial; is not an adversary proceeding.  Pp.  425 U. S. 40-42.
2. Nor does the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment require that counsel be provided the accused in a summary court-martial proceeding.  Pp.  425 U. S. 42-48.
(a) Though the loss of liberty which may result from a summary court-martial implicates due process, the question whether that embodies a right to counsel depends upon an analysis of the interests of the accused and those of the regime to which he is subject, and in making that analysis deference must be 
Page 425 U. S. 27
 given to Congress' determination under Art. I,  8, of the Constitution, that counsel should not be provided in that type of proceeding.  P.  425 U. S. 43.
(b) Supporting Congress' decision is the fact that the presence of counsel would convert a brief, informal hearing, which may be readily convened and concluded, into an attenuated proceeding, preempting the time of military personnel and thus consuming military resources to an unwarranted degree.  See United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11,  350 U. S. 17.  Pp.  425 U. S. 45-46.
(c) The accused who feels that counsel is essential in the situation envisaged by the Court of Appeals in reliance on Daigle v. Warner, supra, may elect trial, with counsel provided, in a special court-martial proceeding, and though he would thus expose himself to the possibility of greater penalties, a decision involving that kind of choice, which often occurs in civilian criminal cases, is not constitutionally decisive.

Syllabus 
In a class action against respondent employer and certain labor unions (of which respondent union is the successor) petitioners alleged various racially discriminatory employment practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Act), especially with respect to employment of over-the-road (OTR) truck drivers.  After certifying the action as a class action and, inter alia, designating one of the classes represented by petitioner Lee as consisting of black nonemployee applicants who applied for and were denied OTR positions prior to January 1, 1972, the District Court permanently enjoined the respondents from perpetuating the discriminatory practices found to exist, and, in regard to the black appliants for OTR positions, ordered the employer to notify the members of the designated class of their right to priority consideration for such jobs.  But the court declined to grant the unnamed members of the class any specific relief sought, which included an award of backpay and seniority status retroactive to the date of individual application for an OTR position.  While vacating the District Court's judgment insofar as it failed to award backpay to unnamed members of the class and reversing on other grounds, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial of any form of seniority relief, holding that such relief was barred, as a matter of law, by  703(h) of Title VII, which provides that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer, inter alia, to apply different conditions of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority system.
Held:
1. That petitioner Lee, the named plaintiff representing the class in question, no longer has a personal stake in the outcome of the action because he had been hired by respondent employer and later was properly discharged for cause does not moot the case.  An adverse relationship sufficient to meet the requirement that a ""live controversy"" remain before this Court not only obtained as to unnamed members of the class with respect to the 
Page 424 U. S. 748
 underlying cause of action, but also continues with respect to their assertion that the relief they have received in entitlement to consideration for hiring and backpay is inadequate without further award of entitlement to seniority benefits.  Pp.  424 U. S. 752-757.
2. Section 703(h) does not bar seniority relief to unnamed members of the class in question, who are not seeking modification or elimination of the existing seniority system but only an award of the seniority status they would have individually enjoyed under the present system but for the illegal discriminatory refusal to hire.  The thrust of  703(h) is directed toward defining what is and what is not an illegal discriminatory employment practice in instances in which the post-Act operation of a seniority system is challenged as perpetuating the effects of discrimination occurring prior to the Act's effective date, and there is no indication in the legislative materials concerning it that  703(h) was intended to modify or restrict relief otherwise appropriate under the Act once an illegal discriminatory practice occurring after the Act's effective date is proved, such as a discriminatory refusal to hire as in this case.  Pp.  424 U. S. 757-762.
3. An award of seniority retroactive to the date of the individual job application is appropriate under  706(g) of Title VII, which, to effectuate Title VII's objective of making persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination, vests broad equitable discretion in the federal courts to
""order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay . . . or any other relief as the court deems appropriate.""
Merely to require respondent employer to hire the class victim of discrimination falls far short of a ""make whole"" remedy, and a concomitant award of the seniority credit he presumptively would have earned but for the wrongful treatment would also seem necessary absent justification for denying that relief.  Without a seniority award dating from the time when he was discriminatorily refused employment, an individual who applies for and obtains employment as an OTR driver pursuant to the District Court's order will never obtain his rightful place in the hierarchy of seniority according to which various employment benefits are distributed.  Pp.  424 U. S. 762-770.
4. Denial of seniority relief for the unnamed class members cannot be justified as within the District Court's discretion on 
Page 424 U. S. 749
 the grounds given by that court that such individuals had not filed administrative charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Title VII, and that there was no evidence of a ""vacancy, qualification, and performance"" for every individual member of the class.  Nor can the denial of such relief be justified as within the District Court's discretion on the ground that all award of retroactive seniority to the class of discriminatees will conflict with the economic interests of other employees of respondent employer.  The District Court made no mention of such considerations in denying relief, and to deny relief on such a ground would, if applied generally, frustrate the ""make whole"" objective of Title VII.  Pp.  424 U. S. 770-779.

			"|"Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., Inc.
No. 74-728
Argued November 3, 1975
Decided March 24, 1976
424 U.S. 747

Syllabus 
In a class action against respondent employer and certain labor unions (of which respondent union is the successor) petitioners alleged various racially discriminatory employment practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Act), especially with respect to employment of over-the-road (OTR) truck drivers.  After certifying the action as a class action and, inter alia, designating one of the classes represented by petitioner Lee as consisting of black nonemployee applicants who applied for and were denied OTR positions prior to January 1, 1972, the District Court permanently enjoined the respondents from perpetuating the discriminatory practices found to exist, and, in regard to the black appliants for OTR positions, ordered the employer to notify the members of the designated class of their right to priority consideration for such jobs.  But the court declined to grant the unnamed members of the class any specific relief sought, which included an award of backpay and seniority status retroactive to the date of individual application for an OTR position.  While vacating the District Court's judgment insofar as it failed to award backpay to unnamed members of the class and reversing on other grounds, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial of any form of seniority relief, holding that such relief was barred, as a matter of law, by  703(h) of Title VII, which provides that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer, inter alia, to apply different conditions of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority system.
Held:
1. That petitioner Lee, the named plaintiff representing the class in question, no longer has a personal stake in the outcome of the action because he had been hired by respondent employer and later was properly discharged for cause does not moot the case.  An adverse relationship sufficient to meet the requirement that a ""live controversy"" remain before this Court not only obtained as to unnamed members of the class with respect to the

No. 74-940
Argued January 14, 1976
Decided March 24, 1976*
424 U.S. 800

Syllabus 
In order to manage the allocation of water and to resolve conflicting claims thereto, Colorado enacted legislation under which the State is divided into seven Water Divisions, in each of which a procedure is established for the settlement of water claims on a continuous basis.  A State Engineer is charged with responsibility for administering the distribution of state waters. Seeking adjudication of reserved rights claimed on behalf of itself and certain Indian tribes, as well as rights based on state law, in waters in certain rivers in Division 7, the United States, which had previously asserted non-Indian reserved water rights in three other State Water Divisions, brought this suit against some l,000 water users in the District Court.  The Government invoked District Court jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1345. Shortly thereafter, one of the federal suit defendants sought in the state court for Division 7 to make the Government a party to proceedings in that Division for the purpose of there adjudicating all the Government's claims, both state and federal, pursuant to the McCarran Amendment, 43 U.S.C.  666.  That law provides for consent to join the United States in any suit (1) for the adjudication of water rights, or (2) the administration of such rights, where it appears that the United States owns or is acquiring such rights by appropriation under state law or otherwise.  The District Court, on abstention grounds, granted a motion to dismiss the Government's suit.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that jurisdiction for that suit existed under 28 U.S.C.  1345, and that abstention was inappropriate.
Held:
l. The McCarran Amendment, as is clear from its language and legislative history, did not divest the District Court of jurisdiction over this litigation under  1345.  The effect of the Amendment is to give consent to state jurisdiction concurrent with federal jurisdiction over controversies involving federal water rights.  Pp.  424 U. S. 806-809. 
Page 424 U. S. 801

2. That Amendment includes consent to determine in state court reserved water rights held on behalf of Indians, see United States v. District Court for Eagle County, 401 U. S. 520, and United States v. District Court for Water Div. 5, 401 U. S. 527, and the exercise of state jurisdiction does not imperil those rights or breach the Government's special obligation to protect the Indians.  Pp.  424 U. S. 809-813.
3. The abstention doctrine is confined to three categories of cases, none of which applies to the litigation at bar; hence the District Court's dismissal on the basis of abstention was inappropriate.  Pp.  424 U. S. 813-817.
4. Several factors, however, are present in this litigation that counsel against exercise of concurrent federal jurisdiction, clearly supporting dismissal of the Government's action and resolution of its water right claims in the state court proceedings.  Pp.  424 U. S. 817-820.
(a) Most significantly, such dismissal furthers the policy of the McCarran Amendment recognizing the desirability of unified adjudication of water rights and the availability of state systems like the one in Colorado for such adjudication and management of rights to use the State's waters.  The Colorado legislation established a continuous proceeding for adjudicating water rights that antedated the Government's suit and reached ""all claims, perhaps month by month, but inclusively in the totality,"" United States v. District Court for Water Div. 5, supra, at  401 U. S. 529.  Pp.  424 U. S. 819-820.
(b) Other significant factors include (1) the apparent absence before dismissal of any District Court proceedings other than the filing of the complaint; (2) the extensive involvement of state water rights occasioned by this suit against 1,000 defendants; (3) the distance between the federal court and Division 7; and (4) the Government's existing participation in proceedings in three other Divisions.  P.  424 U. S. 820.

424 U.S. 828

Syllabus 
Fort Dix, a federal military reservation devoted primarily to basic training for newly inducted Army personnel, and over which the Government exercises exclusive jurisdiction, permits free civilian access to certain unrestricted areas.  However, post regulations ban speeches and demonstrations of a partisan political nature and also prohibit the distribution of literature without prior approval of post headquarters.  Pursuant to these regulations, the commanding officer of Fort Dix rejected the request of respondent candidates for President and Vice President to distribute campaign literature and hold a political meeting on the post and the other respondents, who had been evicted on several occasions for distributing literature not previously approved, were barred from reentering the post.  Respondents brought suit to enjoin enforcement of these regulations on the ground that they violated the First and Fifth Amendments.  The District Court issued an injunction prohibiting the military authorities from interfering with the making of political speeches or the distribution of leaflets in areas of Fort Dix open to the general public, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The regulations are not constitutionally invalid on their face.  Since under the Constitution it is the basic function of a military installation like Fort Dix to train soldiers, not to provide a public forum, and since, as a necessary concomitant to this basic function, a commanding officer has the historically unquestioned power to exclude civilians from the area of his command, any notion that federal military installations, like municipal streets and parks, have traditionally served as a place for free public assembly and communication of thoughts by private citizens is false, and therefore respondents had no generalized constitutional right to make political speeches or distribute leaflets at Fort Dix.  Flower v. United States, 407 U. S. 197, distinguished.  Pp.  424 U. S. 834-838.
2. Nor were the regulations unconstitutionally applied under the circumstances of this case.  Pp.  424 U. S. 838-840. 
Page 424 U. S. 829

(a) As to the regulation banning political speeches and demonstrations, there is no claim that the military authorities discriminated in any way among candidates based upon the candidates' supposed political views; on the contrary, it appears that Fort Dix has a policy, objectively and evenhandedly applied, of keeping official military activities there wholly free of entanglement with any partisan political campaigns, a policy that the post was constitutionally free to pursue.  Pp.  424 U. S. 838-839.
(b) As to the regulation governing the distribution of literature, a military commander may disapprove only those publications that he perceives clearly endanger the loyalty, discipline, or morale of troops on the base under his command, and, while this regulation might in the future be applied irrationally, invidiously, or arbitrarily, none of the respondents even submitted any material for review, and the noncandidate respondents had been excluded from the post because they had previously distributed literature there without attempting to obtain approval.

Petitioner's income tax returns, in which he revealed himself to be a gambler, were introduced in evidence, over his Fifth Amendment objection, as proof of the federal gambling conspiracy offense with which he was charged.

Since petitioner made incriminating disclosures on his tax returns instead of claiming the privilege, as he had the right to do, his disclosures were not compelled incriminations.  Here, where there is no factor depriving petitioner of the free choice to refuse to answer, the general rule applies that, if a witness does not claim the privilege, his disclosures will not be considered as having been ""compelled"" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.

Pursuant to an Alabama statutory procedure, a prosecuting attorney brought an in rem equity action in state court against four magazines named as ""respondents,"" and two other parties, seeking an adjudication of the magazines' obscenity, which resulted in the court's decree that the magazines were ""judicially declared to be obscene.""  Petitioner, a bookstall operator who had not been given notice of or made a party to the equity proceeding, was officially advised of the decree concerning the specific magazines.  After officers later bought one of the magazines (New Directions) from petitioner's bookstall, he was charged with violating a criminal statute by selling ""mailable matter known . . . to have been judicially found to be obscene.""  At petitioner's trial, which resulted in his conviction, later upheld on appeal, petitioner was not allowed to have the issue of New Direction's obscenity presented to the jurors, who were instructed that they were not to be concerned with determining obscenity, but only with whether or not petitioner had sold material judicially declared to be obscene.
Held:  The Alabama procedures, insofar as they precluded petitioner from litigating the obscenity vel non of New Directions as a defense to his criminal prosecution, violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51; Heller v. New York, 413 U. S. 483.  The constitutional infirmity of those procedures cannot be avoided on the ground urged by the State that the equity action constituted an ""adversary judicial proceeding,"" since the respondents in that action were not in privity with the petitioner, and cannot be presumed to have had interests sufficiently identical to petitioner's as adequately to protect his First Amendment rights, which he had a right to assert in his own behalf in a proceeding to which he was a party.

Syllabus 
A photograph of respondent bearing his name was included in a ""flyer"" of ""active shoplifters,"" after he had been arrested on a shoplifting charge in Louisville, Ky.  After that charge had been dismissed, respondent brought this action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioner police chiefs, who had distributed the flyer to area merchants, alleging that petitioners' action under color of law deprived him of his constitutional rights.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss.  The Court of Appeals reversed, relying on Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U. S. 433. Held:
1. Petitioners' action in distributing the flyer did not deprive respondent of any ""liberty"" or ""property"" rights secured against state deprivation by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  424 U. S. 699-710.
(a) The Due Process Clause does not ex proprio vigore extend to a person a right to be free of injury wherever the State may be characterized as the tortfeasor.  Pp.  424 U. S. 699-701.
(b) Reputation alone, apart from some more tangible interests such as employment, does not implicate any ""liberty"" or ""property"" interests sufficient to invoke the procedural protection of the Due Process Clause; hence, to establish a claim under  1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment, more must be involved than simply defamation by a state official.  Wisconsin v. Constantineau, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  424 U. S. 701-710.
(c) Kentucky law does not extend to respondent any legal guarantee of present enjoyment of reputation that has been altered by petitioners' actions, and the interest in reputation alone is thus quite different from the ""liberty"" or ""property"" recognized in such decisions as Bell v. Burson, 402 U. S. 535, and Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, where the guarantee of due process required certain procedural safeguards before the State could alter the status of the complainants.

2. Respondent's contention that petitioners' defamatory flyer deprived him of his constitutional right to privacy is without

Syllabus 
Respondents filed a complaint alleging that petitioner's employee insurance benefits and maternity leave regulations discriminated against its women employees in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and seeking injunctive relief, damages, costs, and attorneys' fees.  After ruling in respondents' favor on their motion for a partial summary judgment on the issue of petitioner's liability under the Act, the District Court, upon denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration, issued an amended order stating that injunctive relief would be withheld because petitioner had filed an appeal and had asked for a stay of any injunction, and directing that, pursuant to Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 54(b), final judgment be entered for respondents, there being no just reason for delay.  The Court of Appeals, holding that it had jurisdiction of petitioner's appeal under 28 U.S.C.  1291, affirmed on the merits.
Held:
1. The District Court's order was not appealable as a final decision under  1291.  Pp.  424 U. S. 742-744.
(a) Even assuming that the order was a declaratory judgment on the issue of liability, it nevertheless left unresolved and did not finally dispose of any of the respondents' prayers for relief.  P.  424 U. S. 742.
(b) The order did not become appealable as a final decision pursuant to  1291 merely because it made the recital required by Rule 54(b), since that Rule applies only to multiple claim actions in which one or more but less than all of the claims have been finally decided and are found otherwise ready for appeal, and does not apply to a single-claim action such as this one, where the complaint advanced a single legal theory that was applied to only one set of facts.  Pp.  424 U. S. 742-744.
(c) The order, apart from its reference to Rule 54(b), constitutes a grant of partial summary judgment limited to the issue of petitioner's liability, is by its terms interlocutory, and, where 
Page 424 U. S. 738
 damages or other relief remain to be resolved, cannot be considered ""final"" within the meaning of  1291.  P.  424 U. S. 744.
2. Nor was the order appealable pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1292's provisions for interlocutory appeals.  Pp.  424 U. S. 744-745.
(a) Even if the order, insofar as it failed to include the requested injunctive relief, could be considered an interlocutory order refusing an injunction within the meaning of  1292(a)(1), and thus would have allowed respondents then to obtain review in the Court of Appeals, there was no denial of any injunction sought by petitioner, and it could not avail itself of that grant of jurisdiction.  Pp.  424 U. S. 744-745.
(b) Even if the order could be considered as an order that the District Court certified for immediate appeal pursuant to  1292(b) as involving a controlling question of law as to which there was substantial ground for difference of opinion, it does not appear that petitioner applied to the Court of Appeals for permission to appeal within 10 days as required by  1292(b); moreover, there can be no assurance, had the other requirements of  1292(b) been met, that the Court of Appeals would have exercised its discretion to entertain the interlocutory appeal.

Syllabus 
For repeated misconduct by respondent's counsel (Wagner) during the opening statement period in respondent's criminal trial, the trial judge expelled Wagner and asked respondent's co-counsel (Meldon) if he was prepared to proceed with the trial.  Upon being advised that Meldon had not discussed the case with witnesses, the judge gave him until the next morning to prepare.  At that time, Meldon advised the judge that respondent wanted Wagner to try the case.  After the judge had set forth the alternatives of (1) a delay pending appellate review of the propriety of Wagner's expulsion, (2) continuation of the trial with Meldon as respondent's main counsel, or (3) declaring a mistrial to permit respondent to obtain other counsel, Meldon made a motion for a mistrial, which the judge granted.  Before his second trial, respondent filed a motion on double jeopardy grounds to dismiss the indictment, which the judge denied.  Respondent represented himself at the second trial, which resulted in his conviction.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the exclusion of Wagner and the judge's questioning of Meldon left respondent with ""no choice"" but to request a mistrial; that, under the circumstances, respondent could not be said to have voluntarily relinquished his right to proceed before the first jury; and that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the second trial because there had been no manifest necessity for Wagner's expulsion.
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar respondent's retrial.  Pp.  424 U. S. 606-612.
(a) Though this Court has held that whether there can be a new trial after a mistrial has been declared without the defendant's request depends on whether ""there is a manifest necessity for the [mistrial], or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated,"" United States v.

No. 74-744
Argued November 5, 1975
Decided March 8, 1976
424 U.S. 614

Syllabus 
Finding that the imminent departure of respondent taxpayer Samuel Shapiro (hereinafter respondent) for Israel under an extradition order to stand trial there on criminal charges jeopardized the collection of income taxes claimed owed by respondent for 1970 and 1971, petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue made a jeopardy assessment, filed liens against respondent, and served notices of levy on various banks in which respondent had accounts or safe deposit boxes.  Respondent then brought suit, claiming that he owed no taxes, that he could not litigate the issue while jailed in Israel, and that he would be in jail there unless he could use the levied bank accounts as bail money, and seeking an order enjoining his extradition until he could litigate whether he owed taxes or directing the Internal Revenue Service to lift the levy notices.  After the Commissioner, in response to interrogatories, furnished deficiency notices disclosing that the claimed bases for the assessments were for 1970 unexplained cash bank deposits and for 1971 income derived from alleged narcotics sales, the District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground, inter alia, that the Anti-Injunction Act (Act),  7421(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, which prohibits suits for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of taxes, withdrew its jurisdiction to order levies lifted.  The Court of Appeals disagreed, and remanded for further proceedings, holding that an unresolved fact issue existed as to whether the case fell within the exception to the Act formulated in Enochs v. Williams Packing Co., 370 U. S. 1,  370 U. S. 7, whereby an injunction may be obtained against the collection of any tax if (1) it is ""clear that, under no circumstances could the Government ultimately prevail"" and (2) ""equity jurisdiction"" otherwise exists in that the taxpayer shows that he would otherwise suffer irreparable injury.

Pp.  424 U. S. 624-628.
(b) The Act's primary purpose is not interfered with by not requiring the taxpayer to plead specific facts which, if true, would establish that the Commissioner cannot ultimately prevail, since the collection of taxes will not be restrained unless the District Court is persuaded from the evidence eventually adduced that the Commissioner will under no circumstances prevail.  Moreover, the Act's ""collateral objective"" to protect the collector from tax litigation outside the statutory scheme is not undercut, since the taxpayer himself must still plead and prove facts establishing that his remedy in the Tax Court or in a refund suit is inadequate to repair any injury caused by an erroneous assessment or collection, in which case, the Commissioner is required simply to litigate the question whether his assessment has a basis in fact.  Pp.  424 U. S. 628-629.
(c) While to permit the Commissioner to seize and hold property on the mere good faith allegation of an unpaid tax would raise serious due process problems in cases like this one, where it is asserted that seizure of assets pursuant to a jeopardy assessment is causing irreparable injury, the case may be resolved, under the Williams Packing exception, solely by reference to the Act, whose required standard as to affording the taxpayer an opportunity for a hearing and as to the evidence necessary to show that an assessment has a basis, in fact, is at least as favorable to the taxpayer as that required by the Constitution.

			"|"Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Shapiro
No. 74-744
Argued November 5, 1975
Decided March 8, 1976
424 U.S. 614

Syllabus 
Finding that the imminent departure of respondent taxpayer Samuel Shapiro (hereinafter respondent) for Israel under an extradition order to stand trial there on criminal charges jeopardized the collection of income taxes claimed owed by respondent for 1970 and 1971, petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue made a jeopardy assessment, filed liens against respondent, and served notices of levy on various banks in which respondent had accounts or safe deposit boxes.  Respondent then brought suit, claiming that he owed no taxes, that he could not litigate the issue while jailed in Israel, and that he would be in jail there unless he could use the levied bank accounts as bail money, and seeking an order enjoining his extradition until he could litigate whether he owed taxes or directing the Internal Revenue Service to lift the levy notices.  After the Commissioner, in response to interrogatories, furnished deficiency notices disclosing that the claimed bases for the assessments were for 1970 unexplained cash bank deposits and for 1971 income derived from alleged narcotics sales, the District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground, inter alia, that the Anti-Injunction Act (Act),  7421(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, which prohibits suits for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of taxes, withdrew its jurisdiction to order levies lifted.  The Court of Appeals disagreed, and remanded for further proceedings, holding that an unresolved fact issue existed as to whether the case fell within the exception to the Act formulated in Enochs v. Williams Packing Co., 370 U. S. 1,  370 U. S. 7, whereby an injunction may be obtained against the collection of any tax if (1) it is ""clear that, under no circumstances could the Government ultimately prevail"" and (2) ""equity jurisdiction"" otherwise exists in that the taxpayer shows that he would otherwise suffer irreparable injury.  The court found that respondent had satisfied the second test because he would be incarcerated until his bank accounts could be used for bail money, and that, as to the first test, the District Court should not have dismissed the

No. 74-883
Argued December 3, 1975
Decided March 3, 1976
424 U.S. 494

Syllabus 
The Federal Power Commission (FPC), for the purpose of ""stimulat[ing] and accelerat[ing] domestic exploration and development of natural gas reserves,"" by order established an ""optional procedure for certificating new producer sales of natural gas.""  Under the order, producers may tender for FPC approval contracts for the sale of new natural gas at rates exceeding the maximum authorized by the applicable rate order; the FPC will determine in a single proceeding whether the ""public convenience and necessity"" under  7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (Act) warrants the issuance of a certificate authorizing the sale and whether the contract rates are ""just and reasonable"" under  4(a); and a permanent certificate issued by the FPC and accepted by the producer is not subject to change in later proceedings under  4, and the rates may be collected without risk of refund obligations.  At the time it issues the certificate, the FPC may also authorize the producer to abandon the sale at the end of the contract term if such abandonment is warranted by the ""public convenience or necessity"" under  7(b), and the producer, when the contract expires, is then free to discontinue deliveries to the original purchaser without having to demonstrate again that abandonment comports with the public convenience or necessity.  Petitions for review were filed attacking the entire optional procedure, but the Court of Appeals upheld the order except for the pre-granted abandonment authority, which the court held contravened  7(b) of the Act.  Under that provision, no natural gas company shall abandon its facilities or service subject to the FPC's jurisdiction without FPC approval, based upon a finding by the FPC that ""the present or future public convenience or necessity permit such abandonment.""
Held:  An optional procedure encompassing pre-granted abandonment authority intended to draw new gas supplies to the interstate market is clearly within the FPC's authority under  7(b) to permit abandonments justified by present or future public convenience or necessity, the timing of the abandonment approval being within the FPC's discretion.  
Page 424 U. S. 495
 The order, which does not authorize specific abandonments, merely establishes an optional procedure under which pre-granted abandonments, subject to judicial review, may be granted in appropriate cases, and the question whether particular abandonment authorizations are beyond the FPC's expertise should await resolution in concrete cases.  In both the case of the limited-time certificate (which the Court of Appeals, by an erroneous construction of Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Co. v. FPC, 364 U. S. 137, thought was barred by the Act) and the case of the permanent certificate with pre-granted abandonment, the FPC properly can determine at the time of certification that he present or future public convenience or necessity justifies the issuance of the certificate allowing discontinuance of service at a future date without need for further proceedings.

No. 74-773
Argued October 14, 1975
Decided March 3, 1976
424 U.S. 507

Syllabus 
When striking members of respondent union picketed in front of their employer's leased store located in petitioner's shopping center, the shopping center's general manager threatened them with arrest for criminal trespass if they did not depart, and they left.  The union then filed unfair labor practice charges against petitioner, alleging that the threat constituted interference with rights protected by  7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), concluding that the NLRA had been violated, issued a cease and desist order against petitioner, and the Court of Appeals enforced the order.  Petitioner and respondent union contend that the respective rights and liabilities of the parties are to be decided under the criteria of the NLRA alone, whereas the NLRB contends that such rights and liabilities must be measured under a First Amendment standard.
Held:
1. Under the present state of the law, the constitutional guarantee of free expression has no part to play in a case such as this, and the pickets here did not have a First Amendment right to enter the shopping center for the purpose of advertising their strike against their employer.  Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551.  Pp.  424 U. S. 512-521.
2. The rights and liabilities of the parties are dependent exclusively upon the NLRA, under which it is the NLRB's task, subject to judicial review, to resolve conflicts between  7 rights and private property rights and to seek accommodation of such rights ""with as little destruction of one as is consistent with the maintenance of the other,"" NLRB v.

No. 74-1025
Argued November 12, 1975
Decided March 3, 1976
424 U.S. 554

Syllabus 
Petitioner employees were discharged by respondent employer for alleged dishonesty.  Respondent union, claiming that petitioners were innocent, opposed the discharges and, pursuant to the collective bargaining contract, the matter was submitted to an arbitration committee, which upheld the discharges.  The collective bargaining contract provided that a decision by the arbitration committee would be final and binding on all parties, including the employees affected.  However, when subsequent information indicated that the charges of dishonesty might have been false, petitioners brought a wrongful discharge suit against the employer and union under  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, alleging that the falsity of the charges could have been discovered with a minimum of investigation, and that the union had made no effort to ascertain the truth, and thereby had violated its duty of fair representation by arbitrarily and in bad faith depriving petitioners of their employment and permitting their discharge without sufficient proof.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents on the ground that the arbitration committee's decision was final and binding absent a showing of bad faith, arbitrariness, or perfunctoriness on the union's part.  Concluding that there were sufficient facts from which to infer bad faith or arbitrary conduct on the union's part, and that petitioners should have been afforded an opportunity to prove their charges, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court to that extent, but affirmed the judgment in the employer's favor on the ground that the finality provision of the collective bargaining contract had to be observed unless evidence showed misconduct by the employer or a conspiracy between it and the union.

No. 74-1025
Argued November 12, 1975
Decided March 3, 1976
424 U.S. 554

Syllabus 
Petitioner employees were discharged by respondent employer for alleged dishonesty.  Respondent union, claiming that petitioners were innocent, opposed the discharges and, pursuant to the collective bargaining contract, the matter was submitted to an arbitration committee, which upheld the discharges.  The collective bargaining contract provided that a decision by the arbitration committee would be final and binding on all parties, including the employees affected.  However, when subsequent information indicated that the charges of dishonesty might have been false, petitioners brought a wrongful discharge suit against the employer and union under  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, alleging that the falsity of the charges could have been discovered with a minimum of investigation, and that the union had made no effort to ascertain the truth, and thereby had violated its duty of fair representation by arbitrarily and in bad faith depriving petitioners of their employment and permitting their discharge without sufficient proof.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents on the ground that the arbitration committee's decision was final and binding absent a showing of bad faith, arbitrariness, or perfunctoriness on the union's part.  Concluding that there were sufficient facts from which to infer bad faith or arbitrary conduct on the union's part, and that petitioners should have been afforded an opportunity to prove their charges, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court to that extent, but affirmed the judgment in the employer's favor on the ground that the finality provision of the collective bargaining contract had to be observed unless evidence showed misconduct by the employer or a conspiracy between it and the union.

No. 74-1137
Argued December 2, 1975
Decided March 3, 1976
424 U.S. 577

Syllabus 
A New York welfare statute disqualifies from the receipt of Home Relief benefits for 75 days anyone who voluntarily terminates his employment or reduces his earning capacity for the purpose of qualifying for benefits, and further provides, by way of a ""rebuttable presumption,"" that a person who applies for assistance within 75 days after so voluntarily terminating his employment or reducing his earning capacity shall be ""deemed"" to have done so ""for the purpose of qualifying for such assistance or a larger amount thereof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary supplied by such person.""  In this action challenging the constitutionality of the latter provision, a three-judge District Court held the provision to be violative of due process.
Held:  The ""rebuttable presumption"" provision does not deny due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  424 U. S. 582-587.
(a) The provision's sole purpose is to indicate that, as with other eligibility requirements, the applicant, rather than the State, must establish that he did not leave employment for the purpose of qualifying for benefits, and the only ""rebuttable presumption,"" if it can be so called, is the normal assumption that an applicant is not entitled to benefits unless and until he proves his eligibility.  Pp.  424 U. S. 583-585.
(b) The fact that, under the prescribed procedure, a decision, even one favorable to an applicant, ensuing from a hearing at which the applicant may appeal an adverse decision by the local welfare official need not be handed down until 90 days from the date the hearing was requested, thus extending beyond the 75-day waiting period, does not render such hearing procedure meaningless.  The procedure for ascertaining the applicant's purpose in quitting his job is no different from the procedure for determining any of the other substantive requirements for welfare eligibility, and nothing in the Constitution requires that benefits be initiated prior to the determination of an applicant's qualifications 
Page 424 U. S. 578
 at an adjudicatory hearing.  Even if an inordinately large number of applicants are initially denied benefits incorrectly because of a false evaluation of their motives in resigning jobs, the constitutionality of the procedure is not placed in doubt, since the Fourteenth Amendment does not guarantee that all state officials' decisions will be correct, and New York would seem to have no incentive to deny benefits wrongfully.  Pp.  424 U. S. 586-587.
(c) Even if the benefits are so small no one would be tempted to leave a job to receive them, and the practical difficulty of proving one's state of mind may frequently lead to incorrect denial of benefits, and even assuming, arguendo, that the burden of the ""rebuttable presumption"" provision on the industrious indigent far outweighs any conceivable gain to the State from screening out the indolent few, New York nevertheless prefers its chosen course, and it is not for this Court to assay the wisdom of that determination.

Syllabus 
Respondent Government trial attorneys with civil service grade GS-13 classifications requested their employing agency to reclassify their positions to grade GS-14, contending that their duties and responsibilities met the requirements for the higher grade and were identical to those of other trial attorneys classified as GS-14 in another agency, and that, under the principle of ""equal pay for substantially equal work"" prescribed in the Classification Act, they were entitled to the higher classification.  But their agency, and the Civil Service Commission (CSC) on appeal, denied reclassification.  Respondents then sued the Government in the Court of Claims, seeking reclassification as of the date of the first administrative denial of their request, and each seeking backpay, computed at the difference between his GS-13 salary and his claimed GS-14 salary, from that date.  The trial judge denied backpay, but held that the CSC's refusal to reclassify respondents to GS-14 was arbitrary, and that respondents were entitled to an order remanding the case to the CSC with directions so to reclassify respondents.  The court en banc, while disapproving the trial judge's recommendation that the court was empowered to direct reclassification, held that, if the CSC were to determine that it had made an erroneous classification, the court was authorized to award money damages for backpay lost, that the CSC's refusal to compare respondents' positions with those of the other trial attorneys was arbitrary and capricious, and that the court had power to order the CSC to reconsider its classification decision.  Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the CSC to make the comparison and to report the result to the court.

Held:  A state prosecuting attorney who, as here, acted within the scope of his duties in initiating and pursuing a criminal prosecution and in presenting the State's case, is absolutely immune from a civil suit for damages under  1983 for alleged deprivations of the accused's constitutional rights.

424 U.S. 448

Syllabus 
After respondent had sought separate maintenance, her husband, the scion of a wealthy industrial family, filed a counterclaim for divorce on grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery.  The court granted the counterclaim, stating that ""neither party is domesticated, within the meaning of that term as used by the Supreme Court of Florida,"" and that ""the marriage should be dissolved.""  On the basis of newspaper and wire service reports and information from a bureau chief and a ""stringer,"" petitioner published in its magazine an item reporting that the divorce was granted ""on grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery.""  After petitioner had declined to retract, respondent brought this libel action in the state court.  A jury verdict for damages against petitioner was ultimately affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court.  Petitioner claims that the judgment violates its rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held:
1. The standard enunciated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, as later extended, which bars media liability for defamation of a public figure absent proof that the defamatory statements were published with knowledge of their falsity or in reckless disregard of the truth, is inapplicable to the facts of this case.  Pp.  424 U. S. 452-457.
(a) Respondent was not a ""public figure,"" since she did not occupy ""[a role] of especial prominence in the affairs of society,"" and had not been ""thrust . . . to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.""  Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323,  418 U. S. 345.  Pp.  424 U. S. 453-455.
(b) The New York Times rule does not automatically extend to all reports of judicial proceedings regardless of whether the party plaintiff in such proceedings is a public figure who might be assumed to ""have voluntarily exposed [himself] to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehood.""  Gertz, supra at  418 U. S. 345.  There is no substantial reason why one involved in litigation should forfeit that degree of protection afforded by the law of defamation imply by virtue of being drawn into a courtroom.  Pp.  424 U. S. 455-457. 
Page 424 U. S. 449

2. No finding was ever made by the divorce court that respondent was guilty of adultery as petitioner had reported, and though petitioner contends that it faithfully reproduced the precise meaning of the divorce judgment, the jury's verdict, upheld on appeal, rejected petitioner's contention that the report was accurate.  Pp.  424 U. S. 457-459.
3. In a case such as this, Gertz, supra, imposes the constitutional limitations that (1) compensatory awards ""be supported by competent evidence concerning the injury"" and (2) liability cannot be imposed without fault.  Since Florida permits damages awards in defamation actions based on elements other than injury to reputation, and there was competent evidence here to permit the jury to assess the amount of such injury, the first of these conditions was satisfied.  Pp.  424 U. S. 459-461.
4. Since, however, there was no finding of fault on the part of the petitioner in its publication of the defamatory material, the second constitutional limitation imposed by Gertz was not met.  Though the trial court's failure to submit the question of fault to the jury does not, of itself, establish noncompliance with the constitutional requirement, none of the Florida courts that considered this case determined that petitioner was at fault.  Pp.  424 U. S. 461-464.

			"|"Time, Inc. v. Firestone
No. 74-944
Argued October 14, 1975
Decided March 2, 1976
424 U.S. 448

Syllabus 
After respondent had sought separate maintenance, her husband, the scion of a wealthy industrial family, filed a counterclaim for divorce on grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery.  The court granted the counterclaim, stating that ""neither party is domesticated, within the meaning of that term as used by the Supreme Court of Florida,"" and that ""the marriage should be dissolved.""  On the basis of newspaper and wire service reports and information from a bureau chief and a ""stringer,"" petitioner published in its magazine an item reporting that the divorce was granted ""on grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery.""  After petitioner had declined to retract, respondent brought this libel action in the state court.  A jury verdict for damages against petitioner was ultimately affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court.  Petitioner claims that the judgment violates its rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held:
1. The standard enunciated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, as later extended, which bars media liability for defamation of a public figure absent proof that the defamatory statements were published with knowledge of their falsity or in reckless disregard of the truth, is inapplicable to the facts of this case.  Pp.  424 U. S. 452-457.
(a) Respondent was not a ""public figure,"" since she did not occupy ""[a role] of especial prominence in the affairs of society,"" and had not been ""thrust . . . to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.""  Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323,  418 U. S. 345.  Pp.  424 U. S. 453-455.
(b) The New York Times rule does not automatically extend to all reports of judicial proceedings regardless of whether the party plaintiff in such proceedings is a public figure who might be assumed to ""have voluntarily exposed [himself] to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehood.""  Gertz, supra at  418 U. S. 345.  There is no substantial reason why one involved in litigation should forfeit that degree of protection afforded by the law of defamation imply by virtue of being drawn into a courtroom.  Pp.  424 U. S. 455-457. 
Page 424 U. S. 449

2. No finding was ever made by the divorce court that respondent was guilty of adultery as petitioner had reported, and though petitioner contends that it faithfully reproduced the precise meaning of the divorce judgment, the jury's verdict, upheld on appeal, rejected petitioner's contention that the report was accurate.  Pp.  424 U. S. 457-459.
3. In a case such as this, Gertz, supra, imposes the constitutional limitations that (1) compensatory awards ""be supported by competent evidence concerning the injury"" and (2) liability cannot be imposed without fault.  Since Florida permits damages awards in defamation actions based on elements other than injury to reputation, and there was competent evidence here to permit the jury to assess the amount of such injury, the first of these conditions was satisfied.  Pp.  424 U. S. 459-461.
4. Since, however, there was no finding of fault on the part of the petitioner in its publication of the defamatory material, the second constitutional limitation imposed by Gertz was not met.  Though the trial court's failure to submit the question of fault to the jury does not, of itself, establish noncompliance with the constitutional requirement, none of the Florida courts that considered this case determined that petitioner was at fault.  Pp.  424 U. S. 461-464.
305 So.2d 172, vacated and remanded.

424 U.S. 382

Syllabus 
Tribal Court of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe held to have exclusive jurisdiction over an adoption proceeding arising on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in which all parties are members of the Tribe residing on the reservation.
(a) Montana state court jurisdiction over such a proceeding would interfere with the powers of self-government conferred upon the Tribe by federal law and exercised through the Tribal Court; would subject a dispute arising on the reservation among reservation Indians to a forum other than the one they have established for themselves; and, as the record in this case indicates, would risk conflicting adjudications affecting the custody of the child sought to be adopted, and would correspondingly diminish the tribal court's authority.
(b) No federal statute sanctions such interference with tribal self-government.  Title 25 U.S.C.  372a, which is concerned solely with the documentation necessary to prove adoption by an Indian in proceedings before the Secretary of the Interior, and which recognizes adoption ""by a judgment or decree of a State court"" as one means of documentation, nowhere addresses the jurisdiction of state courts to render such judgments or decrees.
(c) Even assuming that the Montana courts properly exercised jurisdiction over Indian adoptions prior to the organization of the Tribe, that jurisdiction has now been preempted by creation of a Tribal Court with jurisdiction over adoptions pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.
(d) Denying tribal member plaintiffs access to Montana courts in adoption proceedings does not constitute impermissible racial discrimination, since (1) the Tribal Court's exclusive jurisdiction derives not from the plaintiffs' race, but from the Tribe's quasi-sovereign status under federal law, and (2) even if a jurisdictional holding occasionally denies an Indian plaintiff a forum to which a non-Indian has access, such disparate treatment of the Indian

 is justified as a benefit to the class of which he is a member by furthering the congressional policy of Indian self-government.

Section 2805(a) of the California Labor Code, which prohibits an employer from knowingly employing an alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the United States if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers, held not to be unconstitutional as a regulation of immigration or as being preempted under the Supremacy Clause by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  Pp.  424 U. S. 354-365.
(a) Standing alone, the fact that aliens are the subject of a state statute does not render it a regulation of immigration.  Even if such local regulation has some purely speculative and indirect impact on immigration, it does not thereby become a constitutionally proscribed regulation of immigration that Congress itself would be powerless to authorize or approve.  Pp.  424 U. S. 354-356.
(b) Preemption on the basis of congressional intent to ""occupy the field,"" and thereby invalidate even harmonious state regulation, is not required in this case either because ""the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion"" or because ""Congress has unmistakably so ordained"" that result.  Florida Lime & Avocado Growers v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132,  373 U. S. 142.  Section 2805(a) is clearly within a State's police power to regulate the employment relationship so as to protect workers within the State, and it will not be presumed that Congress, in enacting the INA, intended to oust state authority to regulate the employment relationship covered by  2805(a) in a manner consistent with pertinent federal laws, absent any showing of such intent either in the INA's wording or legislative history or in its comprehensive scheme for regulating immigration and naturalization.  Rather than there being evidence that Congress ""has unmistakably . . . ordained"" exclusivity of federal regulation in the field of employment of illegal aliens, the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act, whose provisions prohibiting farm labor contractors from employing illegal aliens, were enacted to supplement state action, is persuasive evidence that the INA should not be taken as legislation expressing Congress' judgment to have uniform federal regulations

A Mississippi regulation provides that milk and milk products from another State may be sold in Mississippi only if the other State accepts milk or milk products produced and processed in Mississippi on a reciprocal basis.  Appellant's application for a permit to distribute for sale at its retail outlets in Mississippi milk and milk products from its Louisiana processing plant was denied solely on the ground that Louisiana had not signed a reciprocity agreement with Mississippi as required by the regulation.  Appellant then brought suit claiming that the regulation violated the Commerce Clause, but a three-judge District Court upheld the regulation as a valid exercise of state police powers, even though it incidentally burdened interstate commerce.
Held:  The mandatory character of the regulation's reciprocity requirement unduly burdens the free flow of interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, and cannot be justified as a permissible exercise of any state power.  Pp.  424 U. S. 370-381.

(b) The reciprocity requirement cannot be justified as serving Mississippi's vital interests in maintaining the State's health standards, for even if Louisiana's standards were lower than Mississippi's, such requirement, if met, permits Louisiana milk to be admitted to Mississippi if Louisiana enters into a reciprocity agreement.  And even if the requirement enables Mississippi to assure itself that the reciprocating State's health standards are the ""substantial equivalent"" of its own, Mississippi has available for accomplishing that objective the alternative, substantially less burdensome on commerce, of applying its own inspection

424 U.S. 295

Syllabus 
In 1962 Arizona, as lessor, and petitioner, as lessee, executed a 10-year grazing lease of certain tracts of land which had been granted to Arizona to be held in trust under the New Mexico-Arizona Enabling Act.  In 1966, the United States filed a condemnation complaint in connection with a flood control dam and reservoir which included the leased tracts.  In allocating the stipulated compensation payable by the United States for the tracts, the District Court awarded Arizona a certain amount for its fee interest and petitioner one amount for the improvements and another amount for ""its leasehold interest at the time of taking and its reasonable prospective leasehold interest.""  The Court of Appeals, while recognizing that petitioner was entitled to compensation for the improvements, and finding it unnecessary to determine petitioner's rights based upon the provisions of the lease or upon state law, held that, under the Enabling Act, Arizona, as trustee, had no power to grant a compensable leasehold interest, and that petitioner therefore never acquired a property right for which it is entitled to compensation.
Held:
1. Nothing in the Enabling Act, apart, possibly, from the extent it may incorporate Arizona law by reference, prevents the usual application of Fifth Amendment protection of the outstanding leasehold interest whereby the holder of such an interest is entitled to just compensation for the value of that interest when it is taken upon condemnation by the United States.  Pp.  424 U. S. 300-308.
2. To be determined on remand are (1) whether, under state law and the provisions of the lease, petitioner could not possess a compensable leasehold interest upon the federal condemnation; (2) if petitioner did possess such an interest, how it is properly to be evaluated and calculated (with the subsidiary questions of the relevance of possible lease renewals and of possible value additions by reason of petitioner's development of adjoining properties); and (3) if that interest proves to be substantial, whether it is permissible to find from that fact a violation of the 
Page 424 U. S. 296
 Enabling Act's requirement that a lease, when offered, shall be appraised at its ""true value"" and be given at not less than that value.  Pp.  424 U. S. 308-311.

			"|"Alamo Land & Cattle Co., Inc. v. Arizona
No. 74-125
Argued October 14-15, 1975
Decided February 24, 1976
424 U.S. 295

Syllabus 
In 1962 Arizona, as lessor, and petitioner, as lessee, executed a 10-year grazing lease of certain tracts of land which had been granted to Arizona to be held in trust under the New Mexico-Arizona Enabling Act.  In 1966, the United States filed a condemnation complaint in connection with a flood control dam and reservoir which included the leased tracts.  In allocating the stipulated compensation payable by the United States for the tracts, the District Court awarded Arizona a certain amount for its fee interest and petitioner one amount for the improvements and another amount for ""its leasehold interest at the time of taking and its reasonable prospective leasehold interest.""  The Court of Appeals, while recognizing that petitioner was entitled to compensation for the improvements, and finding it unnecessary to determine petitioner's rights based upon the provisions of the lease or upon state law, held that, under the Enabling Act, Arizona, as trustee, had no power to grant a compensable leasehold interest, and that petitioner therefore never acquired a property right for which it is entitled to compensation.
Held:
1. Nothing in the Enabling Act, apart, possibly, from the extent it may incorporate Arizona law by reference, prevents the usual application of Fifth Amendment protection of the outstanding leasehold interest whereby the holder of such an interest is entitled to just compensation for the value of that interest when it is taken upon condemnation by the United States.  Pp.  424 U. S. 300-308.
2. To be determined on remand are (1) whether, under state law and the provisions of the lease, petitioner could not possess a compensable leasehold interest upon the federal condemnation; (2) if petitioner did possess such an interest, how it is properly to be evaluated and calculated (with the subsidiary questions of the relevance of possible lease renewals and of possible value additions by reason of petitioner's development of adjoining properties); and (3) if that interest proves to be substantial, whether it is permissible to find from that fact a violation of the 
Page 424 U. S. 296
 Enabling Act's requirement that a lease, when offered, shall be appraised at its ""true value"" and be given at not less than that value.  Pp.  424 U. S. 308-311.

Syllabus 
In order to establish initial and continued entitlement to disability benefits under the Social Security Act (Act), a worker must demonstrate that, inter alia, he is unable ""to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment. . . .""  The worker bears the continuing burden of showing, by means of ""medically acceptable . . . techniques"" that his impairment is of such severity that he cannot perform his previous work or any other kind of gainful work.  A state agency makes the continuing assessment of the worker's eligibility for benefits, obtaining information from the worker and his sources of medical treatment.  The agency may arrange for an independent medical examination to resolve conflicting information.  If the agency's tentative assessment of the beneficiary's condition differs from his own, the beneficiary is informed that his benefits may be terminated, is provided a summary of the evidence, and afforded an opportunity to review the agency's evidence.  The state agency then makes a final determination, which is reviewed by the Social Security Administration (SSA).  If the SSA accepts the agency determination, it gives written notification to the beneficiary of the reasons for the decision and of his right to de novo state agency reconsideration.  Upon acceptance by the SSA, benefits are terminated effective two months after the month in which recovery is found to have occurred.  If, after reconsideration by the state agency and SSA review, the decision remains adverse to the recipient, he is notified of his right to an evidentiary hearing before an SSA administrative law judge.  If an adverse decision results, the recipient may request discretionary review by the SSA Appeals Council, and finally may obtain judicial review.  If it is determined after benefits are terminated that the claimant's disability extended beyond the date of cessation initially established, he is entitled to retroactive payments.  Retroactive adjustments are also made for overpayments.  A few years after respondent was first awarded disability benefits, he received and completed a questionnaire 
Page 424 U. S. 320
 from the monitoring state agency.  After considering the information contained therein and obtaining reports from his doctor and an independent medical consultant, the agency wrote respondent that it had tentatively determined that his disability had ceased in May, 1972, and advised him that he might request a reasonable time to furnish additional information.  In a reply letter, respondent disputed one characterization of his medical condition and indicated that the agency had enough evidence to establish his disability.  The agency then made its final determination reaffirming its tentative decision.  This determination was accepted by the SSA, which notified respondent in July that his benefits would end after that month and that he had a right to state agency reconsideration within six months.  Instead of requesting such reconsideration, respondent brought this action challenging the constitutionality of the procedures for terminating disability benefits and seeking reinstatement of benefits pending a hearing.  The District Court, relying in part on Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254, held that the termination procedures violated procedural due process and concluded that prior to termination of benefits respondent was entitled to an evidentiary hearing of the type provided welfare beneficiaries under Title IV of the Act.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Petitioner contends, inter alia, that the District Court is barred from considering respondent's action by Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, which held that district courts are precluded from exercising jurisdiction over an action seeking a review of a decision of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare regarding benefits under the Act except as provided in 42 U.S.C.  405(g), which grants jurisdiction only to review a ""final"" decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party.
Held:
1. The District Court had jurisdiction over respondent's constitutional claim, since the denial of his request for benefits was a final decision with respect to that claim for purposes of  405(g) jurisdiction.  Pp.  424 U. S. 326-332.
(a) The  405(g) finality requirement consists of the waivable requirement that the administrative remedies prescribed by the Secretary be exhausted and the nonwaivable requirement that a claim for benefits shall have been presented to the Secretary.  Respondent's answers to the questionnaire and his letter to the state agency specifically presented the claim that his benefits should not be terminated because he was still disabled, and thus satisfied the nonwaivable requirement.  Pp.  424 U. S. 328-330. 
Page 424 U. S. 321

(b) Although respondent concededly did not exhaust the Secretary's internal review procedures, and ordinarily only the Secretary has the power to waive exhaustion, this is a case where the claimant's interest in having a particular issue promptly resolved is so great that deference to the Secretary's judgment is inappropriate.  The facts that respondent's constitutional challenge was collateral to his substantive claim of entitlement, and that (contrary to the situation in Salfi) he colorably claimed that an erroneous termination would damage him in a way not compensable through retroactive payments warrant the conclusion that the denial of his claim to continued benefits was a sufficiently ""final decision"" with respect to his constitutional claim to satisfy the statutory exhaustion requirement.  Pp.  424 U. S. 330-332.
2. An evidentiary hearing is not required prior to the termination of Social Security disability payments, and the administrative procedures prescribed under the Act fully comport with due process.  Pp.  424 U. S. 332-349.
(a) ""[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands,"" Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471,  408 U. S. 481.  Resolution of the issue here involving the constitutional sufficiency of administrative procedures prior to the initial termination of benefits and pending review, requires consideration of three factors:  (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and probable value, if any, of additional procedural safeguards; and (3) the Government's interest, including the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedures would entail.  Pp.  424 U. S. 332-335.
(b) The private interest that will be adversely affected by an erroneous termination of benefits is likely to be less in the case of a disabled worker than in the case of a welfare recipient, like the claimants in Goldberg, supra.  Eligibility for disability payments is not based on financial need, and, although hardship may be imposed upon the erroneously terminated disability recipient, his need is likely less than the welfare recipient.  In view of other forms of government assistance available to the terminated disability recipient, there is less reason than in Goldberg to depart from the ordinary principle that something less than an evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action.  Pp.  424 U. S. 339-343.
(c) The medical assessment of the worker's condition implicates 
Page 424 U. S. 322
 a more sharply focused and easily documented decision than the typical determination of welfare entitlement.  The decision whether to discontinue disability benefits will normally turn upon ""routine, standard, and unbiased medical repots by physician specialists,"" Richardson v. Perales, 402 U. S. 389,  402 U. S. 40.  In a disability situation, the potential value of an evidentiary hearing is thus substantially less than in the welfare context. Pp.  424 U. S. 343-345.
(d) Written submissions provide the disability recipient with an effective means of communicating his case to the decisionmaker.  The detailed questionnaire identifies with particularity the information relevant to the entitlement decision.  Information critical to the decision is derived directly from medical sources.  Finally, prior to termination of benefits, the disability recipient or his representative is afforded full access to the information relied on by the state agency, is provided the reasons underlying its tentative assessment, and is given an opportunity to submit additional arguments and evidence.  Pp.  424 U. S. 345-346.
(e) Requiring an evidentiary hearing upon demand in all cases prior to the termination of disability benefits would entail fiscal and administrative burdens out of proportion to any countervailing benefits.  The judicial model of an evidentiary hearing is neither a required, nor even the most effective, method of decisionmaking in all circumstances, and here, where the prescribed procedures not only provide the claimant with an effective process for asserting his claim prior to any administrative action, but also assure a right to an evidentiary hearing, as well as subsequent judicial review before the denial of his claim becomes final, there is no deprivation of procedural due process.  Pp.  424 U. S. 347-349.

 See 425 U.S. 945. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted in the Criminal Court of Fulton County, Ga., on two counts of exhibiting obscene materials in violation of Ga.Code Ann . 26-2101. The convictions were based upon two exhibitions of a motion picture film entitled 'Deep Throat.' Section 26-2101(a) provides: 
Page 424 U.S. 931 , 932
 wise disseminates to any person any obscene material of any description, knowing the obscene nature thereof . . ..
 Under 26-2101(b), material is obscene if: 
 The judgment of conviction was ultimately affirmed by the Georgia Supreme Court, 234 Ga. 586, 216 S.E.2d 838. 
 It is my view that 'at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents.'

It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 26-2101(a), as it incorporates the definition of obscene material in 26- 2101(b), is constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari and, since the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court was rendered after Miller, reverse.

424 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (Act), as amended in 1974, (a) limits political contributions to candidates for federal elective office by an individual or a group to $1,000 and by a political committee to $5,000 to any single candidate per election, with an over-all annual limitation of $25,000 by an individual contributor; (b) limits expenditures by individuals or groups ""relative to a clearly identified candidate"" to $1,000 per candidate per election, and by a candidate from his personal or family funds to various specified annual amounts depending upon the federal office sought, and restricts over-all general election and primary campaign expenditures by candidates to various specified amounts, again depending upon the federal office sought; (c) requires political committees to keep detailed records of contributions and expenditures, including the name and address of each individual contributing in excess of $10, and his occupation and 
Page 424 U. S. 2
 principal place of business if his contribution exceeds $100, and to file quarterly reports with the Federal Election Commission disclosing the source of every contribution exceeding $100 and the recipient and purpose of every expenditure over $100, and also requires every individual or group, other than a candidate or political committee, making contributions or expenditures exceeding $100 ""other than by contribution to a political committee or candidate"" to file a statement with the Commission; and (d) creates the eight-member Commission as the administering agency with recordkeeping, disclosure, and investigatory functions and extensive rulemaking, adjudicatory, and enforcement powers, and consisting of two members appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate, two by the Speaker of the House, and two by the President (all subject to confirmation by both Houses of Congress), and the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House as ex officio nonvoting members.  Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC), as amended in 1974, provides for public financing of Presidential nominating conventions and general election and primary campaigns from general revenues and allocates such funding to conventions and general election campaigns by establishing three categories:  (1) ""major"" parties (those whose candidate received 25% or more of the vote in the most recent election), which receive full funding; (2) ""minor"" parties (those whose candidate received at least 5% but less than 25% of the votes at the last election), which receive only a percentage of the funds to which the major parties are entitled; and (3) ""new"" parties (all other parties), which are limited to receipt of post-election funds or are not entitled to any funds if their candidate receives less than 5% of the vote.  A primary candidate for the Presidential nomination by a political party who receives more than $5,000 from private sources (counting only the first $250 of each contribution) in each of at least 20 States is eligible for matching public funds.  Appellants (various federal officeholders and candidates, supporting political organizations, and others) brought suit against appellees (the Secretary of the Senate, Clerk of the House, Comptroller General, Attorney General, and the Commission) seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the above statutory provisions on various constitutional grounds.  The Court of Appeals, on certified questions from the District Court, upheld all but one of the statutory provisions.  A three-judge District Court upheld the constitutionality of Subtitle H.
Held: 
Page 424 U. S. 3

1. This litigation presents an Art. III ""case or controversy,"" since the complaint discloses that at least some of the appellants have a sufficient ""personal stake"" in a determination of the constitutional validity of each of the challenged provisions to present
""a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.""
Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227,  300 U. S. 241.  Pp.  424 U. S. 11-12
2. The Act's contribution provisions are constitutional, but the expenditure provisions violate the First Amendment.  Pp.  424 U. S. 12-59.
(a) The contribution provisions, along with those covering disclosure, are appropriate legislative weapons against the reality or appearance of improper influence stemming from the dependence of candidates on large campaign contributions, and the ceilings imposed accordingly serve the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion.  Pp.  424 U. S. 23-38.
(b) The First Amendment requires the invalidation of the Act's independent expenditure ceiling, its limitation on a candidate's expenditures from his own personal funds, and its ceilings on over-all campaign expenditures, since those provisions place substantial and direct restrictions on the ability of candidates, citizens, and associations to engage in protected political expression, restrictions that the First Amendment cannot tolerate.  Pp.  424 U. S. 39-59.
3. The Act's disclosure and recordkeeping provisions are constitutional.  Pp.  424 U. S. 60-84.
(a) The general disclosure provisions, which serve substantial governmental interests in informing the electorate and preventing the corruption of the political process, are not overbroad insofar as they apply to contributions to minor parties and independent candidates.  No blanket exemption for minor parties is warranted, since such parties, in order to prove injury as a result of application to them of the disclosure provisions, need show only a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of a party's contributors' names will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals in violation of their First Amendment associational rights.  Pp.  424 U. S. 64-74.
(b) The provision for disclosure by those who make independent 
Page 424 U. S. 4
 contributions and expenditures, as narrowly construed to apply only (1) when they make contributions earmarked for political purposes or authorized or requested by a candidate or his agent to some person other than a candidate or political committee and (2) when they make an expenditure for a communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate is not unconstitutionally vague and does not constitute a prior restraint, but is a reasonable and minimally restrictive method of furthering First Amendment values by public exposure of the federal election system.  Pp.  424 U. S. 74-82.
(c) The extension of the recordkeeping provisions to contributions as small as those just above $10 and the disclosure provisions to contributions above $100 is not, on this record, overbroad, since it cannot be said to be unrelated to the informational and enforcement goals of the legislation.  Pp.  424 U. S. 82-84.
4. Subtitle H of the IRC is constitutional.  Pp.  424 U. S. 85-109.
(a) Subtitle H is not invalid under the General Welfare Clause but, as a means to reform the electoral process, was clearly a choice within the power granted to Congress by the Clause to decide which expenditures will promote the general welfare.  Pp.  424 U. S. 90-92.
(b) Nor does Subtitle H violate the First Amendment.  Rather than abridging, restricting, or censoring speech, it represents an effort to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public discussion and participation in the electoral process.  Pp.  424 U. S. 92-93.
(c) Subtitle H, being less burdensome than ballot access regulations and having been enacted in furtherance of vital governmental interests in relieving major party candidates from the rigors of soliciting private contributions, in not funding candidates who lack significant public support, and in eliminating reliance on large private contributions for funding of conventions and campaigns, does not invidiously discriminate against minor and new parties in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  424 U. S. 93-108.
(d) Invalidation of the spending limit provisions of the Act does not render Subtitle H unconstitutional, but the Subtitle is severable from such provisions, and is not dependent upon the existence of a generally applicable expenditure limit.  Pp.  424 U. S. 108-109.
5. The Commission's composition as to all but its investigative and informative powers violates Art. II,  2, cl. 2.  With respect to the Commission's powers, all of which are ripe for review, 
Page 424 U. S. 5
 to enforce the Act, including primary responsibility for bringing civil actions against violators, to make rules for carrying out the Act, to temporarily disqualify federal candidates for failing to file required reports, and to authorize convention expenditures in excess of the specified limits, the provisions of the Act vesting such powers in the Commission and the prescribed method of appointment of members of the Commission to the extent that a majority of the voting members are appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, violate the Appointments Clause, which provides, in pertinent part, that the President shall nominate, and, with the Senate's advice and consent, appoint, all ""Officers of the United States,"" whose appointments are not otherwise provided for, but that Congress may vest the appointment of such inferior officers as it deems proper in the President alone, in the courts, or in the heads of departments.  Hence (though the Commission's past acts are accorded de facto validity and a stay is granted permitting it to function under the Act for not more than 30 days), the Commission, as presently constituted, may not, because of that Clause, exercise such powers, which can be exercised only by ""Officers of the United States"" appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause, although it may exercise such investigative and informative powers as are in the same category as those powers that Congress might delegate to one of its own committees.  Pp.  424 U. S. 109-143.

Argued October 6, 1975
Decided January 26, 1976
423 U.S. 388

Syllabus 
Section 109(a)(1) of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 requires the Secretary of the Interior to assess a civil monetary penalty against a coal mine operator for each violation of the mandatory health and safety standards prescribed by the Act and other provisions.  But under  109(a)(3) a penalty may be assessed only after the operator
""has been given an opportunity for a public hearing and the Secretary has determined, by decision incorporating his findings of fact therein, that a violation did occur, and the amount of the penalty which is warranted. . . .""
Implementing regulations provide that assessment officers assess a penalty based on a notice of violation issued by mine inspectors and a penalty schedule graduated according to the seriousness of the violation, and further provide that, if the mine operator fails to make a timely protest against the proposed assessment and to request adjudication, he is deemed to waive his right to protest, including his right to formal adjudication and opportunity for hearing, and the proposed assessment becomes the Secretary's ""final assessment.""  An unpaid penalty is enforceable under the Act only by way of subsequent judicial hearing in a district court in which the operator is entitled to a trial de novo as to the amount of the penalty.  Petitioners sought injunctive and declaratory relief on the ground that the summary civil penalty assessment procedures permitted by the regulations violated the Act's procedural requirements.  The District Court upheld this contention, ruling that the Secretary must make express findings of fact, whether or not the operator requests a hearing.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The language of  109(a)(3), especially when read in light of its legislative history, requires the Secretary to make formal findings of fact as a predicate for a penalty assessment order only when the mine operator exercises his 
Page 423 U. S. 389
 statutory right to request an administrative hearing on the factual issues relating to the penalty.  Pp.  423 U. S. 397-402.
(a) The word ""opportunity,"" as used in  109(a)(3), would be meaningless if the statute contemplated formal adjudicated findings whether or not a requested evidentiary hearing is held, and, absent a request for a hearing, the Secretary has a sufficient factual predicate for a penalty assessment based on the reports of the qualified inspectors who find violations; when the assessment officers fix penalties, as the Secretary's ""authorized representatives,"" the operator may still have the penalty reviewed in the district court. P.  423 U. S. 398.
(b) The requirement for a formal hearing under  109(a)(3) is keyed to a request, and the requirement for formal findings is keyed to the same request.  P.  423 U. S. 398.
(c) Such a reading of the statute comports with the Act's purpose of imposing stricter coal mine regulation to prevent accidents and disasters; the deterrent provided by monetary sanctions is essential to that purpose, and effective enforcement of the Act would be weakened were the Secretary required to make findings of fact for every penalty assessment including those cases in which the mine operator did not request a hearing, thus indicating no disagreement with the Secretary's proposed determination.

P.  423 U. S. 398.
(b) The requirement for a formal hearing under  109(a)(3) is keyed to a request, and the requirement for formal findings is keyed to the same request.  P.  423 U. S. 398.
(c) Such a reading of the statute comports with the Act's purpose of imposing stricter coal mine regulation to prevent accidents and disasters; the deterrent provided by monetary sanctions is essential to that purpose, and effective enforcement of the Act would be weakened were the Secretary required to make findings of fact for every penalty assessment including those cases in which the mine operator did not request a hearing, thus indicating no disagreement with the Secretary's proposed determination.  Pp.  423 U. S. 398-399.

No. 74-521
Argued October 6, 1975
Decided January 26, 1976
423 U.S. 403

Syllabus 
Section 109(a)(1) of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 requires the Secretary of the Interior, in determining the amount of the civil penalty against a coal mine operator for violations of the Act, to consider the history of previous violations, the appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the business, whether the operator was negligent, the effect on his ability to continue in business, the gravity of the violation, and the operator's good faith in attempting to comply after notification of a violation.  Section 109(a)(3) requires that the penalty be assessed only after the operator
""has been given an opportunity for a public hearing and the Secretary has determined, by decision incorporating his findings of fact therein, that a violation did occur, and the amount of the penalty which is warranted.""
Respondent mine operators protested assessed penalties but did not request formal adjudication, and after they refused to pay the assessments, the Secretary brought suits against them in the District Court seeking enforcement of the assessments.  The District Court entered judgments in favor of respondents on the ground that the assessments were not supported by adequate findings of fact, and was upheld by the Court of Appeals.
Held:  Section 109(a)(3) does not compel the Secretary to support each penalty assessment order with express findings of fact concerning the violation and the amount of the penalty, absent a request by the mine operator for an administrative hearing.  National Independent Coal Operators' Assn. v. Kleppe, ante p.  423 U. S. 388.  Pp.  423 U. S. 407-411.
(a) A protest against a penalty assessment, as opposed to a request for a hearing, does not necessarily trigger an administrative review, but the amount of the penalty is subject to de novo review in the district court whether or not a hearing was held.  Pp.  423 U. S. 407-408.
(b) It is not significant that the proposed assessment orders contained merely pro forma recitations that the six factors specified 
Page 423 U. S. 404
 in  109(a)(1) had been considered, or that the Secretary's final orders did not mention such factors, but merely set forth his finding that a violation did, in fact, occur.  Although express findings are generally required for judicial review of an administrative determination based on a substantial evidence test, here the operators can contest the amount of the penalty without a hearing by refusing to pay it, thus, invoking the right to a de novo trial in the district court; moreover, when an operator is informed as to the details of a violation,  105's administrative procedures come into play, and appellate review is available.

Syllabus 
A postal inspector received from an informant of known reliability a stolen credit card that respondent had given the informant to be used for their mutual advantage, and the inspector was told by the informant that respondent had agreed to furnish additional cards.  At the inspector's suggestion, a meeting was arranged between the informant and respondent for a few days later, which took place at a restaurant.  Upon a prearranged signal from the informant that respondent had the additional cards, postal officers made a warrantless arrest of respondent, removed him from the restaurant, and gave him Miranda warnings.  When a search of respondent's person revealed no cards, a consented search of his nearby car (after respondent had been cautioned that the results could be used against him) revealed two additional cards in the names of other persons.  Following an unsuccessful motion to suppress, these cards were used as evidence in respondent's trial, which resulted in his conviction of possessing stolen mail.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the Fourth Amendment prohibited use of that evidence because (1) notwithstanding probable cause for respondent's arrest, the arrest was unconstitutional because the postal inspector had failed to secure an arrest warrant though he had time to do so, and (2) based on the totality of the circumstances (including the illegality of the arrest), respondent's consent to the car search was coerced and thus, invalid.

423 U.S. 362

Syllabus 
Two suits, permitted to proceed as class actions, were brought in District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 by respondents, individuals and organizations, against petitioners, the Mayor of Philadelphia, the Police Commissioner, and others, alleging a pervasive pattern of illegal and unconstitutional police mistreatment of minority citizens in particular, and Philadelphia residents in general.  The petitioners were charged with misconduct ranging from express authorization or encouragement of the mistreatment to failure to act in such a way as to avoid recurrence.  The principal antagonists involved in one case were two police officers, not named as parties, who were found to have violated complainants' constitutional rights in three of eight incidents as to which the District Court made detailed factual findings and as to which a five-day suspension had resulted in one incident and no disciplinary action in another.  In the other case, in only two of 28 incidents did the District Court conclude that the police conduct amounted to a deprivation of a federally secured right; it found no police misconduct in four incidents; in another, departmental policy was subsequently changed; and, though the court made no comment on the degree of misconduct occurring in the remainder, there were arguably 16 police violations of citizens' constitutional rights in the year involved.  The District Court found, inter alia, that the evidence did not establish the existence of any policy on the part of petitioners to violate the constitutional rights of respondent classes, but found evidence of departmental discouragement of complaints and a tendency to minimize the consequences of police misconduct.  The court found that only a small percentage of policemen commit violations of the rights of Philadelphia residents generally, but that such violations could not be dismissed as rare or isolated.  Petitioners were directed to draft for the court's approval ""a comprehensive program for dealing adequately with civilian complaints"" to be formulated in accordance with the court's ""guidelines"" containing detailed suggestions for 
Page 423 U. S. 363
 revising the police manuals and procedural rules for dealing with citizens and for changing procedures for handling complaints.  On petitioners' appeal the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The requisite Art. III case or controversy between the individually named respondents and petitioners was lacking, since those respondents' claim to ""real and immediate"" injury rests not upon what the named petitioners might do to them in the future, but upon what one of a small, unnamed minority of policemen might do to them, and thus those respondents lacked the requisite personal stake in the outcome, i.e., the order overhauling police disciplinary procedures.  Cf. O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488.  Pp.  423 U. S. 371-373.
2. The judgment of the District Court constitutes an unwarranted federal judicial intrusion into the discretionary authority of petitioners to perform their official functions as prescribed by state and local law, and, by validating the type of litigation and granting the type of relief involved here, the lower courts have exceeded their authority under 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Pp.  423 U. S. 373-381.
(a) The District Court's theory of liability under  1983 was erroneous, being based on a showing of an ""unacceptably high"" number of incidents of constitutional dimension when, in fact, there were only 20 in a city of three million inhabitants with 7,500 policemen, and on the untenable conclusion that, even without a showing of direct responsibility for the actions of a small percentage of the police force, petitioners' failure to act in the face of a statistical pattern was just as enjoinable under  1983 as was the active conduct enjoined in Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496, and Allee v. Medrano, 416 U. S. 802.  Pp.  423 U. S. 373-376.
(b) Nor can the remedy granted here be upheld on the basis that such equitable relief was sanctioned in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1, for here, unlike the situation in that case, where the state authorities had implemented the unconstitutional deprivation, the responsible authorities were not found to have played an affirmative part in any unconstitutional deprivations.  Pp.  423 U. S. 376-377.
(c) Important principles of federalism militate against the proposition, advanced by respondents, that federal equity power should fashion prophylactic procedures designed to minimize misconduct by a handful of state employees, and the District Court's injunctive order, which sharply limited the police department's

Title 28 U.S.C.  1441(a) provides that ""any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction"" may be removed by the defendant to the federal district court, and  1446 provides the removal procedure.  Section 1447(c) provides for remand to the state court on the ground that the case was removed ""improvidently and without jurisdiction,"" and  1447(d) imposes a general bar against appellate review of a remand order.  After two citizens of Kentucky had brought a damages action against petitioners, an Indiana corporation and its employee, a citizen of Indiana, petitioners removed the action to the Federal District Court under  1441(a) and 1446.  Thereafter respondent, the District Judge, though conceding that petitioners had the statutory right to remove the action to federal court, ordered the case remanded to the state court for trial, solely on the ground that his heavy docket would unjustly delay the plaintiffs from going to trial on the merits.  Petitioners then filed in the Court of Appeals an alternative petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition on the ground that the action had been properly removed, and that respondent lacked authority to remand the case on the ground that he had asserted.  The Court of Appeals denied the petition after concluding that (1) the District Court had jurisdiction to enter the remand order and (2) the Court of Appeals because of  1447(d) had no jurisdiction to review that order.  Petitioners concede that  1447(d) prohibits appellate review of all remand orders issued pursuant to  1447(c), whether erroneous or not, but maintain that the bar does not apply to remand on a ground not authorized by  1447(c).

|423 u.s. 326|"Federal Power Commission v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp.
No. 75-584
Decided January 19, 1976
423 U.S. 326

Syllabus 
Because of a claimed natural gas shortage, respondent pipeline company submitted to the Federal Power Commission (FPC) for approval an interim curtailment plan which resulted from a settlement agreement between respondent company and its customers providing for allocation of natural gas supplies among the customers during shortage periods and a monetary compensation scheme whereby customers receiving more gas than the systemwide average would compensate customers receiving less.  The FPC rejected the plan on the ground that the compensation scheme would violate various provisions of the Natural Gas Act.  Thereafter, respondent company and several of its customers sought review of the FPC's order.  The Court of Appeals entered an interlocutory order directing the FPC to investigate the company's claims of reduced gas reserves and to report the result of the investigation directly to the court.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals' order, although interlocutory, is properly reviewable by this Court on certiorari pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1254(1), since its effect is immediate and irreparable and any review by the Court of its propriety must be immediate to be meaningful.
2. An actual gas shortage is a necessary predicate to the FPC's assertion of authority under its transportation jurisdiction to approve curtailment of gas already contracted for, and the Court of Appeals could properly conclude that the FPC would have abused its discretion had it approved curtailment plans absent evidence whereby it ""could have reasonably believed"" the shortage to exist, and that ""substantial evidence"" in the record is necessary to support any such finding.
3. The Court of Appeals, however, exceeded its reviewing authority in ordering the gas shortage investigation, since  19(b) of the Natural Gas Act providing for judicial review of FPC 
Page 423 U. S. 327
 decisions contemplates a mode of review that considers only the agency's decision and the evidence on which it is based, and not some new record initially made by the reviewing court.  If new evidence is needed, the case must be remanded so that the agency can decide in its discretion how best to develop the needed data and how its prior decision should be modified in the light thereof.
4. Since it cannot be determined from the record whether evidence regarding respondent company's actual gas shortage is absolutely essential for the Court of Appeals' review, that court is free on remand either to consider the merits of the issues presented by the compensation scheme, and only thereafter to deal with the adequacy of the record evidence as to the shortage, or immediately to remand the case to the FPC for the required inquiry.
5. In light of the immediacy of the gas shortage problem, the protracted nature of the review proceedings, and the potential importance of a resolution on the merits of the compensation scheme issues, the Court of Appeals should give priority consideration to the case on remand.
Certiorari granted; 171 U.S.App.D.C. 66, 518 F.2d 459, vacated and remanded.

It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 311.2, as it incorporates the definition of 'obscene matter' in 311(a), is constitutionally overbroad and therefore [ Pendleton v.

 Moreover, on the basis of the Court's own holding in Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153 (1974), its dismissal is improper. As permitted by Supreme Court Rule 12(1), which provides that the record in a case need not be certified to this Court, the appellant did not certify the allegedly obscene materials involved in this case.

No. 74-850
Argued November 4, 1975
Decided January 14, 1976
423 U.S. 261

Syllabus 
In addition to authorizing United States magistrates to perform certain specified statutory functions, the Federal Magistrates Act (Act) authorizes district courts to assign to magistrates ""such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.""  28 U.S.C.  636(b).  Pursuant to that provision, the District Court adopted General Order No. 104-D, which, inter alia, requires initial reference to a magistrate of actions to review administrative determinations regarding entitlement to Social Security benefits, including Medicare.  Respondent challenged the final determination of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare that respondent was not entitled to claimed Medicare benefits.  Under 42 U.S.C.  405(g) a district court can review such a determination only on the basis of the pleadings and administrative record, and the court is bound by the Secretary's factual findings if supported by substantial evidence.  The case was assigned to a District Judge and, at the same time, referred to a Magistrate to
""prepare a proposed written order or decision, together with proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law where necessary or appropriate""
for consideration by the District Judge after the Magistrate had reviewed the record and heard the parties' arguments.  Contending that the reference to the Magistrate under the District Court's general order violated Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 53(b), and was not authorized by the Act, the Secretary moved to vacate the order of reference.  The District Court refused to vacate the reference order.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  In the context of this case, the preliminary review function assigned to the Magistrate was one of the ""additional duties"" that the Act contemplates magistrates are to perform.  Pp.  423 U. S. 266-275.
(a) Section 636(b) was enacted to permit district courts to increase the scope of responsibilities that magistrates can undertake upon reference, as part of its plan ""to establish a system 
Page 423 U. S. 262
 capable of increasing the overall efficiency of the Federal judiciary.""  But Congress also intended that, in such references, the district judge retain ultimate responsibility for decisionmaking.  Pp.  423 U. S. 266-270.
(b) In this type of case, the magistrate helps the court focus on the relevant portions of what might be a voluminous record and move directly to any substantial legal arguments by putting before the court a preliminary evaluation of the evidence in the record.  Although substantially assisting the court, the magistrate performs only a preliminary review of a closed administrative record, and any recommendation to the court is confined to whether or not substantial evidence supports the Secretary's decision.  The final determination remains with the judge, who has discretion to review the record anew.  Pp.  423 U. S. 270-272.
(c) The order of reference here does not constitute the magistrate a special master, and there is no conflict with the requirement of Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 53(b) that ""reference to a master shall be the exception and not the rule,"" made in nonjury cases ""only upon a showing that some exceptional condition requires it.""  The magistrate here acts in an advisory role as a magistrate, not as a master; the judge is free to accept or reject the magistrate's recommendation in whole or in part, whereas, under Rule 53(e), the court must accept a special master's finding of fact if it is not clearly erroneous.

423 U.S. 276

Syllabus 
Georgia's assessment of a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax against petitioner's inventory of imported tires maintained at its wholesale distribution warehouse in the State held not to be within the Import-Export Clause's prohibition against States laying ""any Imposts or Duties on Imports.""  Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29, overruled.  Pp.  423 U. S. 281-302.
(a) In the history of the Import-Export Clause, whose purposes were to commit to the Federal Government the exclusive power to regulate foreign commerce and the exclusive right to all revenues from imposts and duties on imports, and to assure the free flow of imported goods among the States by prohibiting the taxing of goods merely flowing through seaboard States to other States, there is nothing to suggest that a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax imposed on imported goods that are no longer in import transit was the type of exaction that was regarded as objectionable by the Framers of the Constitution.  Pp.  423 U. S. 283-286.
(b) Such nondiscriminatory property taxation cannot affect the Federal Government's exclusive regulation of foreign commerce, since such a tax does not fall on imports as such because of their place of origin, and it cannot be used to create special protective tariffs or particular preferences for certain domestic goods or be applied selectively to encourage or discourage any importation in a manner inconsistent with federal regulation.  P.  423 U. S. 286.
(c) Nor will such taxation deprive the Federal Government of its exclusive right to all revenues from imposts and duties on imports, since that right, by definition, only extends to revenues from exactions of a particular category.  Unlike imposts and duties, which are essentially taxes on the commercial privilege of bringing goods into a country, such property taxes are taxes by which a State apportions the cost of such services as police and fire protection among the beneficiaries according to their respective wealth, and there is no reason why an importer should not share 
Page 423 U. S. 277
 these costs with his competitors handling domestic goods.  Pp.  423 U. S. 286-288.
(d) Nor does such nondiscriminatory property taxation interfere with the free flow of imported goods among the States.  Importers of goods destined for inland States can easily avoid such taxes by using modern transportation methods, and to the extent such taxation may increase the cost of goods purchased by ""inland"" consumers, the cost, which is the quid pro quo for benefits actually conferred by the taxing State, is one that ultimate consumers should pay for.  The prevention of exactions that are no more than transit fees that could otherwise be imposed due to the peculiar geographical situation of certain States may be secured by prohibiting the assessment of even nondiscriminatory property taxes on goods that are still in import transit.  Pp.  423 U. S. 288-290.
(e) The Import-Export Clause, while not in terms excepting nondiscriminatory taxes with some impact on imports or exports, is not couched in terms of a broad prohibition of every ""tax,"" but only prohibits States from laying ""Imposts or Duties,"" which historically connoted exactions directed only at imports or commercial activity as such.  Pp.  423 U. S. 290-293.
(f) Since prohibition of nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxation would not further the objectives of the Import-Export Clause, only the clearest constitutional mandate should lead to a condemnation of such taxation, and the Clause's terminology -- ""Imposts or Duties"" -- is sufficiently ambiguous as not to warrant a presumption that it was intended to embrace taxation that does not create the evils the Clause was specifically intended to eliminate.

Syllabus 
A prime contractor (Model) had a contract with the Government to provide radio kits containing electron tubes meeting certain specifications.  A subcontractor (United), which was to supply the tubes, sent to Model in three separately invoiced shipments tubes that were not of the required quality but were falsely marked to indicate that they were.  The radio kits that Model in turn shipped to the Government contained 397 of these falsely marked tubes.  Model then sent 35 invoices to the Government for the kits, each invoice including claims for payment for the falsely marked tubes.  After the Government discovered the fraud, it recovered in settlement from Model $40.72 per tube or a total of $16,165.84.  Subsequently the Government sued United and two of its owner-officers (respondents) under the False Claims Act (Act), which provides that the Government may recover from a person who presents a false claim or causes a false claim to be presented to it a forfeiture of $2,000 plus an amount equal to double the amount of damages that it sustains by reason of the false claim.  The Government alleged that United was liable for 35 $2,000 forfeitures, one for each invoice that it ""caused"" Model to submit, and also claimed damages of $16,205.54, consisting of a replacement cost of $40.82 per tube for 397 tubes.  The District Court agreed that there had been 35 forfeitures, but ruled that before the Government's damages could be doubled, they had to be reduced by the amount of Model's payment to the Government, and accordingly computed double damages at only $79.40 (double the 10-cent difference per tube between its replacement cost and the payment already received from Model).  On cross-appeals, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court on the double damages issue, but held that, since there had been only one subcontract involved, there should be only one forfeiture.
Held:
1. A correct application of the Act's language requires that the focus in each case be upon the specific conduct of the person from whom the Government seeks to collect the forfeiture.  Thus, 
Page 423 U. S. 304
 here United committed three acts that caused Model to submit false claims to the Government -- the three separately invoiced shipments of falsely branded tubes to Model -- and hence is liable for three $2,000 forfeitures representing those three shipments.  Pp.  423 U. S. 308-313.
(a) The number of $2,000 forfeitures is not to be measured by the number of contracts involved, since such an automatic measurement, which would almost always result in only a single forfeiture no matter how many fraudulent acts the subcontractor might have committed, would not only contravene the Act's plain language, which focuses on false claims, not on contracts, but would defeat the statutory purpose of punishing and preventing frauds.  Pp.  423 U. S. 310-311.
(b) Nor is the number of forfeitures to be measured by the 35 false claims presented by Model to the Government, since this method fails to distinguish between the acts committed by Model and those committed by United, a critical distinction, since the Act imposes liability only for the conduct that causes false claims to be presented.  Thus, here, the statute does not penalize United for what Model did, but penalizes United for what it did.  Pp.  423 U. S. 311-313.
2. In computing the double damages authorized by the Act, the Government's actual damages are to be doubled before any subtractions are made for compensatory payments previously received from any source.  This computation method best conforms to the Act's language, and reflects the congressional judgment that double damages are necessary to compensate the Government completely for the costs, delays, and inconveniences occasioned by fraudulent claims; fixes the defrauder's liability without reference to the adventitious actions of other persons (such as the prime contractor here); and forecloses the subcontractor from avoiding the double damages provision by tendering the amount of the undoubled damages at any time before judgment.  Pp.  423 U. S. 313-317.

Syllabus 
A prime contractor (Model) had a contract with the Government to provide radio kits containing electron tubes meeting certain specifications.  A subcontractor (United), which was to supply the tubes, sent to Model in three separately invoiced shipments tubes that were not of the required quality but were falsely marked to indicate that they were.  The radio kits that Model in turn shipped to the Government contained 397 of these falsely marked tubes.  Model then sent 35 invoices to the Government for the kits, each invoice including claims for payment for the falsely marked tubes.  After the Government discovered the fraud, it recovered in settlement from Model $40.72 per tube or a total of $16,165.84.  Subsequently the Government sued United and two of its owner-officers (respondents) under the False Claims Act (Act), which provides that the Government may recover from a person who presents a false claim or causes a false claim to be presented to it a forfeiture of $2,000 plus an amount equal to double the amount of damages that it sustains by reason of the false claim.

These cases involve two income tax payers whose taxable years were terminated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) prior to their normal expiration dates pursuant to the jeopardy termination provisions of  6851(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code), which allow the IRS immediately to terminate a taxpayer's taxable period when it finds that the taxpayer intends to commit any act tending to prejudice or render ineffectual the collection of his income tax for the current or. preceding taxable year.  Under  6851, the tax is due immediately upon termination, and, upon such termination, the taxpayer's taxable year comes to a close.  In each case, after the taxpayer failed to file a return or pay the tax assessed as demanded, the IRS levied upon and seized property of the taxpayer without having sent a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer, a jurisdictional prerequisite to a taxpayer's suit in the Tax Court for redetermination of his tax liability, and without having followed the other procedures mandated by  6861 et seq. of the Code for the assessment and collection of a deficiency whose collection is in jeopardy.  The Government contends that such procedures are inapplicable to a tax liability arising after a  6851 termination because such liability is not a ""deficiency"" within the meaning of  6211(a) of the Code, where the term is defined as the amount of the tax imposed less any amount that may have been reported by the taxpayer on his return.  In No. 73-1808 the District Court held that a deficiency notice is not required when a taxable period is terminated pursuant to  6851(a)(1), and dismissed the taxpayer's suit for injunctive and declaratory relief on the ground, inter alia, that it was prohibited by the Anti-Injunction Act,  7421(a) of the Code, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  In No. 74-75, the District Court granted the taxpayer injunctive relief, holding that the Anti-Injunction Act was inapplicable because of the IRS's failure to follow the procedures 
Page 423 U. S. 162
 of  6861 et seq., and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Based on the plain language of the statutory provisions at issue, their place in the legislative scheme, and their legislative history, the tax owing, but not reported, at the time of a  6851 termination is a deficiency whose assessment and collection is subject to the procedures of  6861 et seq., and hence, because the District Director in each case failed to comply with these requirements, the taxpayers' suits were not barred by the Anti-Injunction Act.  Pp.  423 U. S. 169-185.
(a) Under the statutory definition of  6211(a), the tax owing and unreported after a jeopardy termination, which in these cases, as in most  6851 terminations, is the full tax due, is clearly a deficiency, there being nothing in the definition to suggest that a deficiency can arise only at the conclusion of a 12-month taxable year and it being sufficient that the taxable period in question has come to an end and the tax in question is due and unreported.  Pp.  423 U. S. 173-175.
(b) To deny a taxpayer subjected to a jeopardy termination the opportunity to litigate his tax liability in the Tax Court, as would be the case under the Government's view that the unreported tax due after a jeopardy termination is not a deficiency and that, hence, a deficiency notice is not required, would be out of keeping with the thrust of the Code, which generally allows income tax payers access to that court.  Pp.  423 U. S. 176-177.
(c) The jeopardy assessment and jeopardy termination provisions have long been treated in a closely parallel fashion, and there is nothing in the early codification of such provisions to suggest the contrary.  Pp.  423 U. S. 177-183.

Respondent, a personal holding company contemplating liquidation, sold assets to petitioner corporation.  Respondent received from petitioner as part of the purchase price convertible debentures which, if converted into petitioner's common stock, would make respondent a holder of more than 10% of petitioner's outstanding common stock.

Under  16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Act) a corporation may recover for itself the profits realized by an officer, director, or beneficial owner of more than 10% of its shares from a purchase and sale of its stock within a six-month period.  An exemptive provision specifies, however, that  16(b) shall not be construed to cover any transaction where the beneficial owner was not such both ""at the time of"" the purchase and sale of the securities involved.  Since the amount of petitioner's debentures received by respondent was large enough to make respondent a beneficial owner of petitioner within the meaning of  16, and its disposal of the securities within the six-month period exposed respondent to a suit by petitioner to recover profits realized by respondent on the sale to the underwriters, respondent sought a declaratory judgment of its nonliability under  16(b).  The District Court granted summary judgment to respondent, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, though for different reasons.
Held:  By virtue of the exemptive provision, a beneficial owner is accountable under  16(b) in a purchase-sale sequence such as was involved here only if he was such an owner ""before the purchase.""

 CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, DIVISION OF INDUSTRIAL WELFARE, et al.v. HOMEMAKERS, INC., OF LOS ANGELES.No. 74-1213. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 12, 1976
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting. 
 This petition presents the questions whether a California statute1 that requires covered employers to pay premium overtime wages to female employees, with no such requirement as to male employees, conflicts with and is pre-empted by 703(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a), and, if so, whether the federal courts should remedy its invalidity by declaring that an employer may disregard the California statute and need not pay premium overtime wages to female employees. The Court of Appeals answered both questions in the affirmative, 509 F.2d 20 (C.A. [Footnote 9] 1974), and approved the District Court's refusal, 356 F. Supp. 1111, 1112 (N.D.Cal.1973), to follow a decision of another court of appeals that is in square conflict in both questions. Hays v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 465 F.2d 1081 (C.A. [Footnote 8] 1972), aff'g, 318 F.Supp. 1368 (E.D. Ark.1970). These are substantial questions, and it is the Court's duty to resolve this disagreement which 
Page 423 U.S. 1063 , 1064
 now impedes the important process of reconciling the federal statutes outlawing sex-based discrimination in employment with numerous 'protective' state employment laws applicable only to female employees. 
 Respondent Homemakers, which employs men and women, filed suit in District Court asking that Cal.Labor Code 1350.5(a) (West 1971) be declared in conflict with Title VII and unenforceable. It argued that to pay the overtime premium to female employees in compliance with state law would violate Title VII because there was no statutory requirement to pay such wages to male employees. Without discussion the District Court concluded that requiring payment of premium overtime wages only to female employees did conflict with Title VII. '[A]ware that the only authority directly on this issue is contrary,' the District Court declined the State's invitation to follow Hays v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., supra, and to require Homemakers to pay the same overtime premium to men as to women. To do so 'would constitute usurpation of the legislative power that has been vested exclusively in the state Legislature.' 356 F.Supp., at 1112. The District Court also rejected the State's argument that both federal2 and state3 'equal pay' laws required Homemakers to equalize wages by paying premium overtime wages to male employees, not by forbidding payment of such wages to female employees. It reasoned that the State's position conflicted with the purpose of the 'equal pay' statutes which was 'to protect only working women, not men, by supplementing women's income in an attempt to narrow the gap between the income of working women and that [423 U.S. 1063 , 1065]

 CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, DIVISION OF INDUSTRIAL WELFARE, et al.v. HOMEMAKERS, INC., OF LOS ANGELES.No. 74-1213. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 12, 1976
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting. 
 This petition presents the questions whether a California statute1 that requires covered employers to pay premium overtime wages to female employees, with no such requirement as to male employees, conflicts with and is pre-empted by 703(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a), and, if so, whether the federal courts should remedy its invalidity by declaring that an employer may disregard the California statute and need not pay premium overtime wages to female employees. The Court of Appeals answered both questions in the affirmative, 509 F.2d 20 (C.A. [Footnote 9] 1974), and approved the District Court's refusal, 356 F. Supp. 1111, 1112 (N.D.Cal.1973), to follow a decision of another court of appeals that is in square conflict in both questions. Hays v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., 465 F.2d 1081 (C.A. [Footnote 8] 1972), aff'g, 318 F.Supp. 1368 (E.D. Ark.1970). These are substantial questions, and it is the Court's duty to resolve this disagreement which

 now impedes the important process of reconciling the federal statutes outlawing sex-based discrimination in employment with numerous 'protective' state employment laws applicable only to female employees. 
 Respondent Homemakers, which employs men and women, filed suit in District Court asking that Cal.Labor Code 1350.5(a) (West 1971) be declared in conflict with Title VII and unenforceable. It argued that to pay the overtime premium to female employees in compliance with state law would violate Title VII because there was no statutory requirement to pay such wages to male employees. Without discussion the District Court concluded that requiring payment of premium overtime wages only to female employees did conflict with Title VII. '[A]ware that the only authority directly on this issue is contrary,' the District Court declined the State's invitation to follow Hays v. Potlatch Forests, Inc., supra, and to require Homemakers to pay the same overtime premium to men as to women. To do so 'would constitute usurpation of the legislative power that has been vested exclusively in the state Legislature.' 356 F.Supp., at 1112. The District Court also rejected the State's argument that both federal2 and state3 'equal pay' laws required Homemakers to equalize wages by paying premium overtime wages to male employees, not by forbidding payment of such wages to female employees.
