Decided December 12, 1977
434 U.S. 192

Syllabus 
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which applies to persons between the ages of 40 and 65, makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against him with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of such individual's age.  The Act specifies, however, in  4(f)(2) that it shall not be unlawful for an employer to observe the terms of a bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan that is not a ""subterfuge"" to evade the Act's purposes.  Petitioner inaugurated a retirement income plan in 1941, which respondent employee voluntarily joined in 1964 after he had signed an application form that showed the normal retirement age for participants in his category as 60 years.  After respondent was retired upon reaching that age, he brought this suit under the Act, contending that his retirement was solely because of his age, and violated the Act.  The District Court granted a motion for summary judgment filed by petitioner, which had contended that respondent was retired in compliance with a bona fide retirement plan that he had voluntarily joined.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Though it had been conceded that petitioner's plan was bona fide ""in the sense that it exists and pays benefits,"" the court ruled that a pre-age-65 retirement is a ""subterfuge"" within the meaning of  4(f)(2) unless the employer can show that the ""early retirement provision . . . has some economic or business purpose other than arbitrary age discrimination.""
Held:  Petitioner's retirement plan comes within the  4(f)(2) exception, in the context of which ""subterfuge"" must be given its ordinary meaning as a scheme or stratagem to avoid the application of the Act.  There is nothing to suggest that Congress intended to invalidate plans that were instituted in good faith before the Act's passage or that it intended to require employers to show a business or economic purpose to justify bona fide plans that antedated enactment of the statute.  Pp.  434 U. S. 195-203.

No. 76-5344
Argued October 3, 1977
Decided December 12, 1977
434 U.S. 220

Syllabus 
After petitioner had been arrested for rape and related offenses, he was identified by the complaining witness as her assailant at the ensuing preliminary hearing, during which petitioner was not represented by counsel nor offered appointed counsel.  The victim had been asked to make identification after being told that she was going to view a suspect, after being told his name and having heard it called as he was led before the bench, and after having heard the prosecutor recite the evidence believed to implicate petitioner.  Subsequently, petitioner was indicted, and counsel was appointed, who moved to suppress the victim's identification of petitioner.  The Illinois trial court denied the motion on the ground that the prosecution had shown an independent basis for the victim's identification.  At trial, the victim testified on direct examination by the prosecution that she had identified petitioner as her assailant at the preliminary hearing, and there was certain other evidence linking petitioner to the crimes.  He was convicted, and the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed.  He then sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court on the ground that the admission of the identification testimony at trial violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, but the court denied relief again on the ground that the prosecution had shown an independent basis for the identification, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated by a corporeal identification conducted after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings and in the absence of counsel.  United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218; Gilbert v. California, 388 U. S. 263.  It is difficult to imagine a more suggestive manner in which to present a suspect to a witness for their critical first confrontation than was employed in this case at the preliminary hearing, and if petitioner had been represented by counsel, some or all of this suggestiveness could have been avoided.  And the prosecution could not properly buttress its case-in-chief by introducing evidence of a pretrial identification made in violation of petitioner's Sixth Amendment rights, even if it could prove that the pretrial identification had an independent source.  Pp.  434 U. S. 224-232.
2. The case will be remanded, however, for a determination of whether

 In 1929 this Court held that Connecticut's guest statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, because it could not be said that ""no grounds exist[ed] for the distinction"" between gratuitous passengers in automobiles and those in other classes of vehicles. Silver v. Silver, 280 U.S. 117, 123 (1929). While that decision for a while foreclosed federal equal protection challenges to the guest statutes of the various States, in recent years the issue of the constitutional validity of these statutes has been frequently litigated in state courts with conflicting results.

No. 76-835
Argued October 3, 1977
Decided December 7, 177
434 U.S. 159

Syllabus 
On the basis of an FBI affidavit stating that certain individuals were conducting an illegal gambling enterprise at a specified New York City address and that there was probable cause to believe that two telephones with different numbers were being used there to further the illegal activity, the District Court authorized the FBI to install and use pen registers with respect to the two telephones, and directed respondent telephone company to furnish the FBI ""all information, facilities and technical assistance"" necessary to employ the devices, which (without overhearing oral communications or indicating whether calls are completed) record the numbers dialed.  The FBI was ordered to compensate respondent at prevailing rates.  Respondent, though providing certain information, refused to lease to the FBI lines that were needed for unobtrusive installation of the pen registers, and thereafter filed a motion in the District Court to vacate that portion of the pen register order directing respondent to furnish facilities and technical assistance to the FBI, on the ground that such a directive could be issued only in connection with a wiretap order meeting the requirements of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.  The District Court ruled adversely to respondent, holding that pen registers are not governed by Title III; that the court had jurisdiction to authorize installation of the devices upon a showing of probable cause; and that it had authority to direct respondent to assist in the installation both under the court's inherent powers and under the All Writs Act, which gives federal courts authority to issue ""all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.""  Though agreeing with the District Court's Title III rationale, and concluding that district courts have power either inherently or as a logical derivative of Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 41, to authorize pen register surveillance upon a probable cause showing, the Court of Appeals, affirming in part and reversing in part, held that the District Court abused its discretion in ordering respondent to assist in installing and operating the pen registers, and expressed concern that such a requirement could establish an undesirable precedent for the authority of federal courts to impress unwilling aid on private third parties.
Held: 
Page 434 U. S. 160

1. Title III, which is concerned only with orders ""authorizing or approving the interception of a wire or oral communication,"" does not govern the authorization of the use of pen registers, which do not ""intercept,"" because they do not acquire the ""contents"" of communications as those terms are defined in the statute.  Moreover, the legislative history of Title III shows that the definition of ""intercept"" was designed to exclude pen registers.  Pp.  434 U. S. 165-168.
2. The District Court under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 41 had power to authorize the installation of the pen registers, that Rule being sufficiently flexible to include within its scope electronic intrusions authorized upon a finding of probable cause.  Pp.  434 U. S. 168-170.
3. The order compelling respondent to provide assistance was clearly authorized by the All Writs Act, and comported with the intent of Congress.  Pp.  434 U. S. 171-178.
(a) The power conferred by the Act extends, under appropriate circumstances, to persons who (though not parties to the original action or engaged in wrongdoing) are in a position to frustrate the implementation of a court order or the proper administration of justice.  Here respondent, which is a highly regulated public utility with a duty to serve the public, was not so far removed as a third party from the underlying controversy that its assistance could not permissibly be compelled by the order of the court based on a probable cause showing that respondent's facilities were being illegally used on a continuing basis.  Moreover, respondent concededly uses the devices for its billing operations, detecting fraud, and preventing law violations.  And, as the Court of Appeals recognized, provision of a leased line by respondent was essential to fulfillment of the purpose for which the pen register order had been issued.  Pp.  434 U. S. 171-175.
(	b) The District Court's order was consistent with a 1970 amendment to Title III providing that
""[a]n order authorizing the interception of a wire or oral communication shall, upon request of the applicant, direct that a communication common carrier . . . furnish the applicant forthwith all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the interception unobtrusively. . . .""

|434 u.s. 125|"New York v. Cathedral Academy
No. 76-616
Argued October 3, 1977
Decided December 6, 1977
434 U.S. 125

Syllabus 
A three-judge District Court issued a judgment (later affirmed by this Court) declaring unconstitutional a New York statute (1970 N.Y. Laws, ch. 138) that authorized reimbursement to nonpublic schools for state-mandated recordkeeping and testing services, and permanently enjoining any payments under the Act, including reimbursement for expenses that such schools had already incurred in the last half of the 1971-1972 school year.  Thereafter, the New York State Legislature enacted 1972 N.Y. Laws, ch. 996, authorizing reimbursement to sectarian schools for their expenses of performing the state-required services through the 1971-1972 school year.  Appellee sectarian school brought this reimbursement action under ch. 996 in the New York Court of Claims, which held that the statute violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The New York Court of Appeals, being of the view that ch. 996 comported with this Court's decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 411 U. S. 192 (Lemon II), ultimately reversed, and remanded the case for a determination of the amount of appellee's claim.  In that case, after a state statute authorizing payments to sectarian schools for specified secular services had been struck down (in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (Lemon I)) and the trial court on remand had enjoined payments under the statute for any services performed after that decision, but had not prohibited payments for services provided before that date, the Court approved such disposition on the ground that equitable flexibility permitted weighing the ""remote possibility of constitutional harm from allowing the State to keep its bargain"" against the substantial reliance of the schools that had incurred expenses at the State's express invitation.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction of this appeal as the Court of Appeals' decision was a final determination of the federal constitutional issue and is ripe for appellate review under 28 U.S.C.  1257(2).  P.  434 U. S. 128.
2. Chapter 996 violates the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth because it will necessarily have the primary effect of aiding religion, or will result in excessive state involvement in religious affairs.  Lemon II distinguished.  Pp.  434 U. S. 128-133.
(a) Here (contrary to the situation in Lemon II) the District Court had expressly enjoined payments for amounts ""heretofore or hereafter expended.""  To approve enactment of ch. 996, which thus 
Page 434 U. S. 126
 was inconsistent with the District Court's order, would expand the reasoning of Lemon II to hold that a state legislature may effectively modify a federal court's injunction whenever a balancing of constitutional equities might conceivably have justified the court's granting similar relief in the first place.  Pp.  434 U. S. 128-130.
(b) If ch. 996 authorizes payments for the identical services that were to be reimbursed under ch. 138, it is for the identical reasons invalid.  Pp.  434 U. S. 130-131.
(c) Even if, as appellee contends, the Court of Claims was authorized to make an audit on the basis of which it would authorize reimbursement of sectarian schools only for clearly secular purposes, such a detailed inquiry would itself encroach upon the First and Fourteenth Amendments by making that court the arbiter of an essentially religious dispute.  Pp.  434 U. S. 131-133.
3. Contrary to Lemon II, the equities do not support what the state legislature has done in ch. 996, which constitutes a new and independently significant infringement of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Moreover, appellee could have relied on ch. 138 only by spending its own funds for nonmandated, and perhaps sectarian, activities that it might otherwise not have been able to afford.  Pp.  434 U. S. 133-134.

Thereafter, the New York State Legislature enacted 1972 N.Y. Laws, ch. 996, authorizing reimbursement to sectarian schools for their expenses of performing the state-required services through the 1971-1972 school year.  Appellee sectarian school brought this reimbursement action under ch. 996 in the New York Court of Claims, which held that the statute violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The New York Court of Appeals, being of the view that ch. 996 comported with this Court's decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 411 U. S. 192 (Lemon II), ultimately reversed, and remanded the case for a determination of the amount of appellee's claim.  In that case, after a state statute authorizing payments to sectarian schools for specified secular services had been struck down (in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (Lemon I)) and the trial court on remand had enjoined payments under the statute for any services performed after that decision, but had not prohibited payments for services provided before that date, the Court approved such disposition on the ground that equitable flexibility permitted weighing the ""remote possibility of constitutional harm from allowing the State to keep its bargain"" against the substantial reliance of the schools that had incurred expenses at the State's express invitation.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction of this appeal as the Court of Appeals' decision was a final determination of the federal constitutional issue and is ripe for appellate review under 28 U.S.C.  1257(2).  P.  434 U. S. 128.
2. Chapter 996 violates the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth because it will necessarily have the primary effect of aiding religion, or will result in excessive state involvement in religious affairs.  Lemon II distinguished.  Pp.  434 U. S. 128-133.
(a) Here (contrary to the situation in Lemon II) the District Court had expressly enjoined payments for amounts ""heretofore or hereafter expended.""  To approve enactment of ch. 996, which thus 
Page 434 U. S. 126
 was inconsistent with the District Court's order, would expand the reasoning of Lemon II to hold that a state legislature may effectively modify a federal court's injunction whenever a balancing of constitutional equities might conceivably have justified the court's granting similar relief in the first place.  Pp.  434 U. S. 128-130.
(b) If ch. 996 authorizes payments for the identical services that were to be reimbursed under ch. 138, it is for the identical reasons invalid.  Pp.  434 U. S. 130-131.
(c) Even if, as appellee contends, the Court of Claims was authorized to make an audit on the basis of which it would authorize reimbursement of sectarian schools only for clearly secular purposes, such a detailed inquiry would itself encroach upon the First and Fourteenth Amendments by making that court the arbiter of an essentially religious dispute.  Pp.  434 U. S. 131-133.
3. Contrary to Lemon II, the equities do not support what the state legislature has done in ch. 996, which constitutes a new and independently significant infringement of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Moreover, appellee could have relied on ch. 138 only by spending its own funds for nonmandated, and perhaps sectarian, activities that it might otherwise not have been able to afford.  Pp.  434 U. S. 133-134.

Syllabus 
Petitioner employer requires a pregnant employee to take leave of absence.  While on such leave, the employee receives no sick pay, such as is paid for nonoccupational disabilities other than pregnancy.  She also loses all accumulated job seniority, such as is retained on leaves for other nonoccupational disabilities, with the result that although petitioner will attempt to provide her with temporary work on her return, she will be employed in a permanent position only if no currently employed employee also applies for the position.  In respondent employee's action challenging those policies, the District Court held that they violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Petitioner's policy of denying employees returning from pregnancy leave their accumulated seniority acts both to deprive them ""of employment opportunities"" and to ""adversely affect [their] status as an employee"" because of their sex in violation of  703(a)(2) of Title VII.  Pp.  434 U. S. 139-143.
(a) While petitioner's seniority policy is facially neutral in that both male and female employees retain accumulated seniority while on leave for nonoccupational disabilities other than pregnancy, whereas seniority is divested if the employee takes a leave for any other reason, including pregnancy, its discriminatory effect causes it to run afoul of  703(a)(2).  Pp.  434 U. S. 140-141.
(b) Petitioner has not merely refused to extend to women a benefit that men cannot and do not receive, but has imposed on women a substantial burden that men need not suffer.  While Title VII does not require that greater economic benefits be paid to one sex or the other because of their different roles, this does not allow  703(a)(2) to be read so as to permit an employer to burden female employees in such a way as to deprive them of employment opportunities because of their different roles.  General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125, distinguished.  Pp.  434 U. S. 141-142.
(c) There is no proof of any business necessity justifying the adoption of the seniority policy with respect to pregnancy leave in this case.  P.  434 U. S. 143. 
Page 434 U. S. 137

2. Petitioner's policy of not awarding sick leave pay to pregnant employees is not a per se violation of Title VII, but the facial neutrality of the policy does not end the analysis if it can be shown that exclusion of pregnancy from the compensation conditions is a mere ""pretex[t] designed to effect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex or the other.""

Syllabus 
After police officers had stopped respondent's automobile for being operated with an expired license plate, one of the officers asked respondent to step out of the car and produce his license and registration.  As respondent alighted, a large bulge under his jacket was noticed by the officer, who thereupon frisked him and found a loaded revolver.  Respondent was then arrested and subsequently indicted for carrying a concealed weapon and unlicensed firearm.  His motion to suppress the revolver was denied and after a trial, at which the revolver was introduced in evidence, he was convicted.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed on the ground that the revolver was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
Held:
1. The order to get out of the car, issued after the respondent was lawfully detained, was reasonable, and thus permissible under the Fourth Amendment.  The State's proffered justification for such order -- the officer's safety -- is both legitimate and weighty, and the intrusion into respondent's personal liberty occasioned by the order, being, at most, a mere inconvenience, cannot prevail when balanced against legitimate concerns for the officer's safety.
2. Under the standard announced in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1,  392 U. S. 21-22 -- whether

No. 76-1095
Argued October 12, 1977
Decided November 29, 1977
434 U.S. 77

Syllabus 
New Jersey provides a cash meal allowance for its state police troopers, which is paid biweekly in advance in an amount varying with the trooper's rank and is included, although separately stated, with his salary and in his gross pay for purposes of calculating pension benefits.  Although troopers are required to remain on call in their assigned patrol areas during their midshift break, they are not required to eat lunch at any particular location, and indeed may eat at home, nor are they required to spend the meal allowance on food.  No reduction in the allowance is made for periods when a trooper is not on patrol.  Respondents, a trooper and his wife, included only a part of the meal allowances received by the trooper in their 1970 federal income tax return, and the Commissioner assessed a deficiency with respect to the remainder.  The respondents argued in the Tax Court that the allowance was not income within  61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which defines gross income as ""all income from whatever source derived, including (but not limited to) . . . (1) Compensation for services, including fees, commissions, and similar items.""  In the alternative, they argued that the allowances were excludable from  61 income because of  119 of the Code, which creates an exclusion for
""the value of any meals . . . furnished to [an employee] by his employer for the convenience of the employer, but only if . . . the meals are furnished on the business premises of the employer,""
and further provides that,
""[in] determining whether meals are furnished . . . for the convenience of the employer, the provisions of an employment contract or of a State statute fixing terms of employment shall not be determinative of whether the meals . . . are intended as compensation.""
The Tax Court rejected both contentions, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. In the absence of a specific exemption, the cash meal allowance payments are included in gross income under  61(a), since they are ""undeniabl[y] accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the [trooper has] complete dominion.""  Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U. S. 426,  348 U. S. 431.  Pp.  434 U. S. 82-84.
2. The payments are not subject to exclusion from gross income under 
Page 434 U. S. 78
  119, since  119, by its terms, covers meals furnished by the employer, and not cash reimbursements for meals.  P.  434 U. S. 84.
3. No specific exemption for the payments can be claimed on the basis of the once-recognized doctrine that benefits conferred by an employer on an employee ""for the convenience of the employer"" are not income within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, since it appears from the legislative history of  119 that it was intended comprehensively to modify the prior law, both expanding and contracting the exclusion for meals previously provided, and therefore it must be construed as a replacement for the prior law, designed to end the confusion that had developed respecting the ""convenience of the employer"" doctrine as a determinant of the tax status of meals.  Pp.  434 U. S. 84-95.

New Jersey provides a cash meal allowance for its state police troopers, which is paid biweekly in advance in an amount varying with the trooper's rank and is included, although separately stated, with his salary and in his gross pay for purposes of calculating pension benefits.  Although troopers are required to remain on call in their assigned patrol areas during their midshift break, they are not required to eat lunch at any particular location, and indeed may eat at home, nor are they required to spend the meal allowance on food.  No reduction in the allowance is made for periods when a trooper is not on patrol.  Respondents, a trooper and his wife, included only a part of the meal allowances received by the trooper in their 1970 federal income tax return, and the Commissioner assessed a deficiency with respect to the remainder.  The respondents argued in the Tax Court that the allowance was not income within  61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which defines gross income as ""all income from whatever source derived, including (but not limited to) . . . (1) Compensation for services, including fees, commissions, and similar items.""  In the alternative, they argued that the allowances were excludable from  61 income because of  119 of the Code, which creates an exclusion for
""the value of any meals . . . furnished to [an employee] by his employer for the convenience of the employer, but only if . . . the meals are furnished on the business premises of the employer,""
and further provides that,
""[in] determining whether meals are furnished . . . for the convenience of the employer, the provisions of an employment contract or of a State statute fixing terms of employment shall not be determinative of whether the meals . . . are intended as compensation.""
The Tax Court rejected both contentions, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. In the absence of a specific exemption, the cash meal allowance payments are included in gross income under  61(a), since they are ""undeniabl[y] accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the [trooper has] complete dominion.""  Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U. S. 426,  348 U. S. 431.  Pp.  434 U. S. 82-84.
2. The payments are not subject to exclusion from gross income under 
Page 434 U. S. 78
  119, since  119, by its terms, covers meals furnished by the employer, and not cash reimbursements for meals.  P.  434 U. S. 84.
3. No specific exemption for the payments can be claimed on the basis of the once-recognized doctrine that benefits conferred by an employer on an employee ""for the convenience of the employer"" are not income within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, since it appears from the legislative history of  119 that it was intended comprehensively to modify the prior law, both expanding and contracting the exclusion for meals previously provided, and therefore it must be construed as a replacement for the prior law, designed to end the confusion that had developed respecting the ""convenience of the employer"" doctrine as a determinant of the tax status of meals.  Pp.  434 U. S. 84-95.

 OREGON STATE PENITENTIARY et al. v. Jerry HAMMERNo. 76-1377 Supreme Court of the United States November 14, 1977
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Oregon. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted; the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Oregon is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court for reconsideration in the light of Dixon v. Love, 431 U.S. 105 (1977).
 Mr. Justice STEVENS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN, Mr. Justice STEWART, and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Since Dixon v. Love, 431 U.S. 105, sheds no light on the issues decided by the Oregon Supreme Court, the Court's disposition of this petition can only be characterized as cavalier. 
 The respondent, a tenured corrections officer, was discharged without a pretermination hearing; at a post-termination hearing the Public Employee Relations Board decided that the dismissal was proper as a matter of state law. On appeal, the Oregon Supreme Court reversed. Relying on its decision in Tupper v. Fairview Hospital & Training Center, 276 Or. 657, 556 P.2d 1340 (1976), the court concluded that procedural due process required that a tenured employee receive notice of the charges against him and the proposed sanction, as well as an opportunity to respond, before being discharged. It further held that respondent was entitled to backpay and other benefits from the time of his discharge until such time as a proper termination hearing is held, even though the discharge had been upheld at the post-termination hearing. [Footnote 1] 

 No decision of this Court is controlling on either the due process issue or the remedy issue decided by the Oregon Supreme Court. In Dixon v. Love, supra, this Court held that 
Page 434 U.S. 945 , 946
 the Illinois regulation providing for the automatic suspension of the license of a driver who had been convicted repeatedly for traffic offenses was constitutionally valid. In so holding, the Court relied on the fact that the driver ""had the opportunity for a full judicial hearing in connection with each of the traffic convictions on which the Secretary's decision was based,"" 431 U.S., at 113; on the fact that the suspension and revocation decisions were ""largely automatic"" under the Illinois regulations, ibid.; and on ""the important public interest in safety on the roads and highways, and in the prompt removal of a safety hazard."" Id., at 114. None of those factors, decisive in Dixon, has any relevance to the issues decided by the Oregon Supreme Court in this case. 
 Indeed, in Dixon the premise for the Court's legal analysis was "" 'that something less than an evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action.' "" Id., at 113, quoting Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 343. Precisely the same premise provided the basis for the legal analysis of the Oregon Supreme Court. The court held that a pretermination evidentiary hearing was not required, but that ""something less"" was necessary-in this case, fair notice and an opportunity to respond. Whether or not that holding is correct, it is not even arguably inconsistent with either the holding or anything said by this Court in Dixon. Nor is there anything in Dixon which remotely relates to the question whether the remedy directed by the Oregon Supreme Court was proper. 
 In my judgment, even assuming that the Oregon Supreme Court has extended greater procedural protection to Oregon residents than the Federal Constitution requires, there is no need for this Court to address those issues until a conflict with the Oregon holding has developed on a national level. But if my judgment in this respect is incorrect, and enlightenment on a nationwide basis is indeed appropriate, surely the Court should provide something more edifying than a cryptic reference to a case as wide of the mark as Dixon v. Love. This [434 U.S. 945 , 947]

Decided November 7, 1977
434 U.S. 22

Syllabus 
After petitioner was convicted of state offenses arising out of a robbery, he was tried and convicted of a federal offense arising out of the same robbery, in violation of the Government's policy against multiple prosecutions for the same act (the so-called Petite policy based on Petite v. United States, 361 U. S. 529).  Government trial counsel had represented to the District Court that the Government had decided vigorously to prosecute the federal charges in spite of the prior state prosecution, when in fact the federal prosecution had not been authorized as required by the Petite policy.  Thereafter, notwithstanding the Government's subsequent acknowledgement that the Petite policy had been violated, the District Court denied the Government's motion to dismiss the indictment pursuant to Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 48(a) (which provides that the Government may ""by leave of court"" file a dismissal of an indictment), on the ground, inter alia, that the prosecutor had acted in bad faith by representing to the court that he had been properly instructed to maintain the prosecution despite the prior state convictions.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court abused its discretion in denying the Government's motion to dismiss on the ground that the violation of the Petite policy resulted from prosecutorial misconduct, rather than inadvertence.  The salient issue is not whether the decision to prosecute was made in bad faith, but rather whether the Government's later efforts to terminate the prosecution were similarly tainted with impropriety.  It does not appear that there was any bad faith on the Government's part at the time it sought leave to dismiss the indictment, but rather that the decision to terminate the prosecution, based as it was on the Petite policy, was motivated by considerations which cannot fairly be characterized as ""clearly contrary to manifest public interest.""  The overriding purpose of that policy is to protect the individual from any unfairness associated with needless multiple prosecutions, and accordingly the defendant should receive the benefit of the policy whenever its application is urged by the Government.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 31, 1977
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I dissent from the denial of the petition for certiorari. 
 Petitioners sought relief under 42 U.S.C. 1983 on behalf of a class of persons who travel on the public highways and toll roads of New Jersey and who, it was alleged, have been subjected to a ""pattern and practice"" of unreasonable stops and searches by the New Jersey State Police. Petitioners' complaint further defined a subclass of ""long-haired highway travelers,"" who allegedly have been subjected to illegal stops and searches solely because of their ""highly individualized personal appearance."" The Court of Appeals found the complaint sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, Lewis v. Kugler, 446 F.2d 1343 (C.A. [Footnote 3] 1971), and petitioners then had an opportunity to prove their case against respondents, the Attorney General of New Jersey, the Superintendent of State Police, 14 named state police troopers, and a class of unnamed troopers. 
 At trial, according to the Court of Appeals, petitioners "" substantiated (and, indeed, augmented) their initial allegations."" 554 F.2d 93, 94 (C.A. 3 1977). The court summarized ""[t]he district court's extensive findings of fact"" as ""reveal[ing] what can only be described as callous indifference by the New Jersey State Police for the rights of citizens using New Jersey roads."" Ibid.

 Court's ruling in Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362 (1976). 554 F.2d, at 95. 
 Any lower court decision that reads a single opinion of this Court as effectuating a sharp change in the law deserves careful scrutiny before certiorari is denied, at least when the opinion does not claim to be making any such change. When the lower court's reading of our opinion results in the denial of relief to a large class of persons whose federal constitutional rights were repeatedly violated-as established by substantial evidence credited by the finder of fact, following the expenditure of many hours of judges' and litigants' time-a strong case is established for the granting of certiorari. When the opinion of this Court that is the sole cause of the denial of relief is grounded in particular facts and contains alternative rationales, the case for granting certiorari becomes compelling. 
 I joined my Brother BLACKMUN's dissenting opinion in Rizzo v. Goode, supra, and continue to believe that the case was wrongly decided. One can accept Rizzo, however, and yet view it as only one step in, rather than the end of, this Court's continuing effort to define the contours of 1983 suits against public officials who, with varying degrees of personal participation, have allowed the violation of citizens' rights by subordinate employees. Certainly the lower courts have not found in Rizzo any unambiguous signal; to the contrary, they have given the opinion varying interpretations that suggest the need for guidance from this Court. 1 [434 U.S. 931 , 933]

 George W. LEWIS et al.v. William F. HYLAND et alNo. 77-301 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 31, 1977
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I dissent from the denial of the petition for certiorari. 
 Petitioners sought relief under 42 U.S.C. 1983 on behalf of a class of persons who travel on the public highways and toll roads of New Jersey and who, it was alleged, have been subjected to a ""pattern and practice"" of unreasonable stops and searches by the New Jersey State Police. Petitioners' complaint further defined a subclass of ""long-haired highway travelers,"" who allegedly have been subjected to illegal stops and searches solely because of their ""highly individualized personal appearance."" The Court of Appeals found the complaint sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, Lewis v. Kugler, 446 F.2d 1343 (C.A. [Footnote 3] 1971), and petitioners then had an opportunity to prove their case against respondents, the Attorney General of New Jersey, the Superintendent of State Police, 14 named state police troopers, and a class of unnamed troopers. 
 At trial, according to the Court of Appeals, petitioners "" substantiated (and, indeed, augmented) their initial allegations."" 554 F.2d 93, 94 (C.A. 3 1977). The court summarized ""[t]he district court's extensive findings of fact"" as ""reveal[ing] what can only be described as callous indifference by the New Jersey State Police for the rights of citizens using New Jersey roads."" Ibid. In the view of the Court of Appeals, petitioners would clearly have been entitled to injunctive relief , ""in light of [their] demonstration of numerous violations of their constitutional rights,"" were it not for this

 Clarence O. DUPUY, Jr.v. Milton E. DUPUYNo. 77-128 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 17, 1977
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 This case concerns the standard of care required of plaintiffs seeking to recover damages for violations of 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5. In the wake of this Court's decision in Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 47 L. Ed.2d 668 (1976), the courts of appeals have reached differing conclusions as to the degree of diligence appropriately required. The court below held that because Ernst & Ernst had imposed on defendants a standard not stricter than nonrecklessness, a plaintiff would not be barred from recovery unless he had been reckless. 551 F.2d 1005. Similarly, the Tenth and Seventh Circuits have held that, after Ernst & Ernst, the contributory fault of the plaintiff would bar recovery only if it constituted ""gross conduct somewhat comparable to that of defendant."" Holdsworth v. Strong, 545 F.2d 687, 693 (C.A. [Footnote 10] 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 955 (1977); Sundstrand Corp. v. Sun Chemical Corp., 553 F.2d 1033, 1048 (C.A.7), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 875 (1977). Also, the Third Circuit now ""require[ s] only that the plaintiff act reasonably"" and has shifted to the defendant the burden of proving the plaintiff's 
Page 434 U.S. 911 , 912
 unreasonable conduct. Straub v. Vaisman & Co., 540 F.2d 591, 598 (1976). The Second Circuit, however, appears to adhere to the view that the plaintiff must demonstrate due diligence in discovering important information. Hirsch v. Du Pont, 553 F.2d 750, 762-763 (1977); accord, NBI Mortgage Investment Corp. v. Chemical Bank, 75 Civ. 3411 (S.D.N.Y. May 24, 1977) (""the standard of due diligence is still viable and accepted in this circuit""). 
 The Court should take this opportunity to clarify the standard of care expected of plaintiffs in litigation under Rule 10b-5. Business can be transacted more freely and efficiently if the responsibility for verifying underlying facts is clearly allocated. Because securities litigation can be complex and expensive, it should be avoided to the maximum extent by early clarification of the ground rules. This Court should thus promptly resolve the existing uncertainty as to the proper standard of care required of plaintiffs after Ernst & Ernst. Accordingly, I dissent from the denial of certiorari in this case.

||"Coker v. Georgia
No. 75-5444
Argued March 28, 1977
Decided June 29, 1977
433 U.S. 584

Syllabus 
While serving various sentences for murder, rape, kidnaping, and aggravated assault, petitioner escaped from a Georgia prison and, in the course of committing an armed robbery and other offenses, raped an adult woman.  He was convicted of rape, armed robbery, and the other offenses and sentenced to death on the rape charge, when the jury found two of the aggravating circumstances present for imposing such a sentence, viz., that the rape was committed (1) by a person with prior capital felony convictions and (2) in the course of committing another capital felony, armed robbery.  The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed both the conviction and sentence.
Held:  The judgment upholding the death sentence is reversed, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  433 U. S. 591-600;  433 U. S. 600;  433 U. S. 600-601;  433 U. S. 601.
234 Ga. 555, 216 S.E.2d 782, reversed and remanded.
MR JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that the sentence of death for the crime of rape is grossly disproportionate and excessive punishment, and is therefore forbidden by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.  Pp.  433 U. S. 591-600.
(a) The Eighth Amendment bars not only those punishments that are ""barbaric,"" but also those that are ""excessive"" in relation to the crime committed, and a punishment is ""excessive"" and unconstitutional if it (1) makes no measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment, and hence is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering; or (2) is grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.  Pp.  433 U. S. 591-592.
(b) That death is a disproportionate penalty for rape is strongly indicated by the objective evidence of present public judgment, as represented by the attitude of state legislatures and sentencing juries, concerning the acceptability of such a penalty, it appearing that Georgia is currently the only State authorizing the death sentence for rape of an adult woman, that it is authorized for rape in only two other States, but only when the victim is a child, and that, in the vast majority (9 out of 10) of rape convictions in Georgia since 1973, juries have not imposed the death sentence.  Pp.  433 U. S. 593-597. 
Page 433 U. S. 585

(c) Although rape deserves serious punishment, the death penalty, which is unique in its severity and irrevocability, is an excessive penalty for the rapist who, as such and as opposed to the murderer, does not unjustifiably take human life.  Pp.  433 U. S. 597-598.
(d) The conclusion that the death sentence imposed on petitioner is disproportionate punishment for rape is not affected by the fact that the jury found the aggravating circumstances of prior capital felony convictions and occurrence of the rape while committing armed robbery, a felony for which the death sentence is also authorized, since the prior convictions do not change the fact that the rape did not involve the taking of life, and since the jury did not deem the robbery itself deserving of the death penalty, even though accompanied by the aggravating circumstances of prior capital felony convictions.  Pp.  433 U. S. 598-599.
(e) That, under Georgia law, a deliberate killer cannot be sentenced to death, absent aggravating circumstances, argues strongly against the notion that, with or without such circumstances, a rapist who does not take the life of his victim should be punished more severely than the deliberate killer.  P.  433 U. S. 600.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concluded that the death penalty is, in all circumstances, cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  P.  433 U. S. 600.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL concluded that the death penalty is a cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  433 U. S. 600-601.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL concluded that death is disproportionate punishment for the crime of raping an adult woman where, as here, the crime was not committed with excessive brutality and the victim did not sustain serious or lasting injury.  P.  433 U. S. 601.
WHITE, J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered an opinion, in which STEWART, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.  BRENNAN, J., post, p.  433 U. S. 600, and MARSHALL, J., post, p.  433 U.

No. 76-156
Argued January 19, 1977
Decided June 29, 1977
433 U.S. 623

Syllabus 
Petitioner vending machine manufacturer acquired most of the assets of another vending machine manufacturing company controlled by respondent Stoner and his family.  As part of the acquisition agreement, the latter company undertook to refrain from owning or managing any business engaged in the manufacture or sale of vending machines, and respondent Stoner, who was employed by petitioner as a consultant under a 5-year contract, agreed not to compete with petitioner in the manufacture of such machines during the term of his contract and for five years thereafter.  Subsequently, petitioner sued respondents (Stoner, the company which he and his family controlled, and another corporation with which he had a relationship) in an Illinois state court for breach of the noncompetition covenants.  Shortly thereafter, respondents sued petitioner in Federal District Court, alleging that it had violated  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act in that the covenant against competition was an unreasonable restraint of trade.  After protracted litigation in the state court action, the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed a judgment in petitioner's favor in an amount exceeding $7 million.  Then in the antitrust action, which, in the meantime, had lain ""dormant,"" the District Court granted respondents' motion for a preliminary injunction against collection of the Illinois judgment, holding that  16 of the Clayton Act (which authorizes any person to seek injunctive relief against violations of the antitrust laws) constituted an ""expressly authorized"" exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C.  2283 (which prohibits a federal court from enjoining state court proceedings ""except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments""), and further found that an injunction was necessary to protect the court's jurisdiction within the meaning of that exception in  283 by preserving a case or controversy, since the state collection efforts would eliminate the two corporate respondents (which would then be controlled by petitioner) as plaintiffs in the federal suit.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, also finding that  16 of the Clayton Act was an express 
Page 433 U. S. 624
 exception to  2283, but not reaching the issue of whether an injunction was necessary to protect the District Court's jurisdiction.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  433 U. S. 630-643;  433 U. S. 643-645.
545 F.2d 1050, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that the District Court's preliminary injunction violated the Anti-Injunction Act.  Pp.  433 U. S. 630-643.
(a) Having been enacted long after the Anti-Injunction Act,  16 of the Clayton Act, on its face, is far from an express exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, and may be fairly read as virtually incorporating the prohibitions of that Act.  Pp.  433 U. S. 631-632.
(b) The test as to whether an Act of Congress qualifies as an ""expressly authorized"" exception to the Anti-Injunction Act is whether the
""Act of Congress, clearly creating a federal right or remedy enforceable in a federal court of equity, could be given its intended scope only by the stay of a state court proceeding.""
Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225,  407 U. S. 238.  Here, while the private action conferred by  16 of the Clayton Act meets the first part of the test in that such an action may be brought only in a federal court, it does not meet the second part of the test, since, as is demonstrated by  16's legislative history suggesting that  16 was merely intended to extend to private citizens the right to enjoin antitrust violations,  16 is not an ""Act of Congress [which] could be given its intended scope only by the stay of a state court proceeding.""  Mitchum, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  433 U. S. 632-635.
(c) To hold that  16 could be given its ""intended scope"" only by allowing an injunction against a pending state court action would completely eviscerate the Anti-Injunction Act, because this would mean that virtually all federal statutes authorizing injunctive relief would be exceptions to that Act.  While  16 embodies an important congressional policy favoring private enforcement of the antitrust laws, the importance of the policy to be ""protected"" by an injunction under  16 does not control for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, since the prohibitions of that Act exist separate and apart from the traditional principles of equity and comity that determine whether or not the state proceeding can be enjoined.  Pp.  433 U. S. 635-639.
(d) For an Act countenancing a federal injunction to come within the ""expressly authorized"" exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, it must necessarily interact with, or focus upon, a state judicial proceeding, and  16 of the Clayton Act is not such an Act.  Pp.  433 U. S. 640 641. 
Page 433 U. S. 625

(e) The District Court's finding that the injunction was ""necessary in aid of its jurisdiction"" within the meaning of that exception to the Anti-Injunction Act is supported neither by precedent nor by the factual premises upon which such finding was based.  Although such exception may be fairly read as incorporating cases where the federal court has obtained jurisdiction over a res prior to the state court action, here both the federal and state actions are in personam actions, which traditionally may proceed concurrently, without interference from either court, and an injunction to ""preserve"" a case or controversy does not fit within the ""necessary in aid of its jurisdiction"" exception.  It does not appear that, even if the two corporate respondents ceased to litigate the federal action, respondent Stoner would lose his standing to vindicate his rights, or that the two corporate defendants would necessarily be removed from the action.  Pp.  433 U. S. 641-643.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, concluded that, although  16 of the Clayton Act may be an ""expressly authorized"" exception to the Anti-Injunction Act in limited circumstances where the state proceedings are part of a ""pattern of baseless, repetitive claims"" being used as an anticompetitive device, all the traditional prerequisites for equitable relief are satisfied, and the only way to give the antitrust laws their intended scope is by staying the state proceedings, California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508, the District Court failed properly to apply the California Motor Transport rule, because it did not and could not find the state litigation to be part of a ""pattern of baseless, repetitive claims"" being used, in and of itself, as an anticompetitive device, and that therefore  16 did not itself authorize the District Court's injunction.

||"Nixon v. Administrator of General Services
No. 75-1605
Argued April 20, 1977
Decided June 28, 1977
433 U.S. 425

Syllabus 
After appellant had resigned as President of the United States, he executed a depository agreement with the Administrator of General Services that provided for the storage near appellant's California home of Presidential materials (an estimated 42 million pages of documents and 880 tape recordings) accumulated during appellant's terms of office.  Under this agreement, neither appellant nor the General Services Administration (GSA) could gain access to the materials without the other's consent.  Appellant was not to withdraw any original writing for three years, although he could make and withdraw copies.  After the initial three-year period, he could withdraw any of the materials except tape recordings.  With respect to the tape recordings, appellant agreed not to withdraw the originals for five years, and to make reproductions only by mutual agreement.  Following this five-year period, the Administrator would destroy such tapes as appellant directed, and all of the tapes were to be destroyed at appellant's death or after the expiration of 10 years, whichever occurred first.  Shortly after the public announcement of this agreement, a bill was introduced in Congress designed to abrogate it, and, about three months later, this bill was enacted as the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (Act), and was signed into law by President Ford.  The Act directs the Administrator of GSA to take custody of appellant's Presidential materials and have them screened by Government archivists in order to return to appellant those personal and private in nature and to preserve those having historical value and to make the materials available for use in judicial proceedings subject to ""any rights, defenses or privileges which the Federal Government or any person may invoke.""  The Administrator is also directed to promulgate regulations to govern eventual public access to some of the materials.  These regulations must take into account seven guidelines specified by  104(a) of the Act, including, inter alia, the need to protect any person's opportunity to assert any legally or constitutionally based right or privilege and the need to return to appellant or his family materials that are personal and private in nature.  No such public access regulations have yet become effective.  The day after the 
Page 433 U. S. 426
 Act was signed into law, appellant filed an action in District Court challenging the Act's constitutionality on the grounds, inter alia, that, on its face, it violates (1) the principle of separation of powers; (2) the Presidential privilege; (3) appellant's privacy interests; (4) his First Amendment associational rights; and (5) the Bill of Attainder Clause, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the Act. Concluding that, since no public access regulations had yet taken effect, it could consider only the injury to appellant's constitutionally protected interests allegedly caused by the taking of the Presidential materials into custody and their screening by Government archivists, the District Court held that appellant's constitutional challenges were without merit, and dismissed the complaint.
Held:
1. The Act does not, on its face, violate the principle of separation of powers.  Pp.  433 U. S. 441-446.
(a) The Act's regulation of the Executive Branch's function in the control of the disposition of Presidential materials does not, in itself, violate such principle, since the Executive Branch became a party to the Act's regulation when President Ford signed the Act into law and President Carter's administration, acting through the Solicitor General, urged affirmance of the District Court's judgment.  Moreover, the function remains in the Executive Branch in the person of the GSA Administrator and the Government archivists, employees of that branch.  P.  433 U. S. 441.
(b) The separate powers were not intended to operate with absolute independence, but, in determining whether the Act violates the separation of powers principle, the proper inquiry requires analysis of the extent to which the Act prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions, and only where the potential for disruption is present must it then be determined whether that impact is justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within Congress' constitutional authority.  Pp.  433 U. S. 441-443.
(c) There is nothing in the Act rendering it unduly disruptive of the Executive Branch, since that branch remains in full control of the Presidential materials, the Act being facially designed to ensure that the materials can be released only when release is not barred by privileges inhering in that branch.  Pp.  433 U. S. 443-446.
2. Neither does the Act, on its face, violate the Presidential privilege of confidentiality.  Pp.  433 U. S. 446-455.
(a) In view of the specific directions to the GSA Administrator in  104(a) of the Act to take into account, in determining public access to the materials, ""the need to protect any party's opportunity to assert any constitutionally based right or privilege,"" and the need to return to 
Page 433 U. S. 427
 appellant his purely private materials, there is no reason to believe that the restrictions on public access ultimately established by regulation will not be adequate to preserve executive confidentiality.  Pp.  433 U. S. 449-451.
(b) The mere screening of the materials by Government archivists, who have previously performed the identical task for other former Presidents without any suggestion that such activity in any way interfered with executive confidentiality, will not impermissibly interfere with candid communication of views by Presidential advisers, and will be no more of an intrusion into Presidential confidentiality than the in camera inspection by the District Court approved in United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683.  Pp.  433 U. S. 451-452.
(c) Given the safeguards built into the Act to prevent disclosure of materials that implicate Presidential confidentiality, the requirement that appellant's personal and private materials be returned to him, and the minimal nature of the intrusion into the confidentiality of the Presidency resulting from the archivists' viewing such materials in the course of their screening process, the claims of Presidential privilege must yield to the important congressional purposes of preserving appellant's Presidential materials and maintaining access to them for lawful governmental and historical purposes.  Pp.  433 U. S. 452-454.
3. The Act does not unconstitutionally invade appellant's right of privacy.  While he has a legitimate expectation of privacy in his personal communications, the constitutionality of the Act must be viewed in the context of the limited intrusion of the screening process, of appellant's status as a public figure, his lack of expectation of privacy in the overwhelming majority of the materials (he having conceded that he saw no more than 200,000 items), and the virtual impossibility of segregating the apparently small quantity of private materials without comprehensive screening.  When this is combined with the Act's sensitivity to appellant's legitimate privacy interests, the unblemished record of the archivists for discretion, and the likelihood that the public access regulations to be promulgated will further moot appellant's fears that his materials will be reviewed by ""a host of persons,"" it is apparent that appellant's privacy claim has no merit.  Pp.  433 U. S. 455-465.
4. The Act does not significantly interfere with or chill appellant's First Amendment associational rights.  His First Amendment claim is clearly outweighed by the compelling governmental interests promoted by the Act in preserving the materials.  Since archival screening is the least restrictive means of identifying the materials to be returned to appellant, the burden of that screening is the measure of the First Amendment claim, and any such burden is speculative in light of the Act's provisions protecting appellant from improper public disclosures 
Page 433 U. S. 428
 and guaranteeing him full judicial review before any public access is permitted.  Pp.  433 U. S. 465-468.
5. The Act does not violate the Bill of Attainder Clause.  Pp.  433 U. S. 468-484.
(a) However expansive is the prohibition against bills of attainder, it was not intended to serve as a variant of the Equal Protection Clause, invalidating every Act by Congress or the States that burdens some persons or groups but not all other plausible individuals.  While the Bill of Attainder Clause serves as an important bulwark against tyranny, it does not do so by limiting Congress to the choice of legislating for the universe, or legislating only benefits, or not legislating at all.  Pp.  433 U. S. 468-471.
(b) The Act's specificity in referring to appellant by name does not automatically offend the Bill of Attainder Clause.  Since, at the time of the Act's passage, Congress was only concerned with the preservation of appellant's materials, the papers of former Presidents already being housed in libraries, appellant constituted a legitimate class of one, and this alone can justify Congress' decision to proceed with dispatch with respect to his materials while accepting the status of his predecessors' papers and ordering in the Public Documents Act the further consideration of generalized standards to govern his successors.  Pp.  433 U. S. 471-472.
(c) Congress, by lodging appellant's materials in the GSA's custody pending their screening by Government archivists and the promulgation of further regulations, did not ""inflict punishment"" within the historical meaning of bills of attainder.  Pp.  433 U. S. 473-475.
(d) Evaluated in terms of Congress' asserted proper purposes of the Act to preserve the availability of judicial evidence and historically relevant materials, the Act is one of nonpunitive legislative policymaking, and there is no evidence in the legislative history or in the provisions of the Act showing a congressional intent to punish appellant.  Pp.  433 U. S. 475-484.
408 F.Supp. 321, affirmed.

No. 76-577
Argued April 25, 1977
Decided June 28, 1977
433 U.S. 562

Syllabus 
Petitioner's 15-second ""human cannonball"" act, in which he is shot from a cannon into a net some 200 feet away, was, without his consent, videotaped in its entirety at a county fair in Ohio by a reporter for respondent broadcasting company and shown on a television news program later the same day.  Petitioner then brought a damages action in state court against respondent, alleging an ""unlawful appropriation"" of his ""professional property.""  The trial court's summary judgment for respondent was reversed by the Ohio Court of Appeals on the ground that the complaint stated a cause of action. The Ohio Supreme Court, while recognizing that petitioner had a cause of action under state law on his ""right to the publicity value of his performance,"" nevertheless, relying on Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, rendered judgment for respondent on the ground that it is constitutionally privileged to include in its newscasts matters of public interest that would otherwise be protected by the right of publicity, absent an intent to injure or to appropriate for some nonprivileged purpose.
Held:
1. It appears from the Ohio Supreme Court's opinion syllabus (which is to be looked to for the rule of law in the case), as clarified by the opinion itself, that the judgment below did not rest on an adequate and independent state ground, but rested solely on federal grounds, in that the court considered the source of respondent's privilege to be the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and therefore this Court has jurisdiction to decide the federal issue.  Pp.  433 U. S. 566-568.
2. The First and Fourteenth Amendments do not immunize the news media when they broadcast a performer's entire act without his consent, and the Constitution no more prevents a State from requiring respondent to compensate petitioner for broadcasting his act on television than it would privilege respondent to film and broadcast a copyrighted dramatic work without liability to the copyright owner, or to film or broadcast a prize fight or a baseball game, where the promoters or participants had other plans for publicizing the event.  Time, Inc. v. Hill, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  433 U. S. 569-579.
(a) The broadcast of a film of petitioner's entire act poses a substantial threat to the economic value of that performance, since (1) if the public can see the act free on television it will be less willing

			"|"Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.
No. 76-577
Argued April 25, 1977
Decided June 28, 1977
433 U.S. 562

Syllabus 
Petitioner's 15-second ""human cannonball"" act, in which he is shot from a cannon into a net some 200 feet away, was, without his consent, videotaped in its entirety at a county fair in Ohio by a reporter for respondent broadcasting company and shown on a television news program later the same day.  Petitioner then brought a damages action in state court against respondent, alleging an ""unlawful appropriation"" of his ""professional property.""  The trial court's summary judgment for respondent was reversed by the Ohio Court of Appeals on the ground that the complaint stated a cause of action. The Ohio Supreme Court, while recognizing that petitioner had a cause of action under state law on his ""right to the publicity value of his performance,"" nevertheless, relying on Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, rendered judgment for respondent on the ground that it is constitutionally privileged to include in its newscasts matters of public interest that would otherwise be protected by the right of publicity, absent an intent to injure or to appropriate for some nonprivileged purpose.
Held:
1. It appears from the Ohio Supreme Court's opinion syllabus (which is to be looked to for the rule of law in the case), as clarified by the opinion itself, that the judgment below did not rest on an adequate and independent state ground, but rested solely on federal grounds, in that the court considered the source of respondent's privilege to be the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and therefore this Court has jurisdiction to decide the federal issue.  Pp.  433 U. S. 566-568.
2. The First and Fourteenth Amendments do not immunize the news media when they broadcast a performer's entire act without his consent, and the Constitution no more prevents a State from requiring respondent to compensate petitioner for broadcasting his act on television than it would privilege respondent to film and broadcast a copyrighted dramatic work without liability to the copyright owner, or to film or broadcast a prize fight or a baseball game, where the promoters or participants had other plans for publicizing the event.  Time, Inc. v. Hill, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  433 U. S. 569-579.
(a) The broadcast of a film of petitioner's entire act poses a substantial threat to the economic value of that performance, since (1) if the public can see the act free on television it will be less willing 
Page 433 U. S. 563
 to pay to see it at the fair, and (2) the broadcast goes to the heart of petitioner's ability to earn a living as an entertainer.  Pp.  433 U. S. 575-576.
(b) The protection of petitioner's right of publicity provides an economic incentive for him to make the investment required to produce a performance of interest to the public.  Pp.  433 U. S. 576-577.
(c) While entertainment, as well as news, enjoys First Amendment protection, and entertainment itself can be important news, neither the public nor respondent will be deprived of the benefit of petitioner's performance as long as his commercial stake in his act is appropriately recognized.  P.  433 U. S. 578.
(d) Although the State may, as a matter of its own law, privilege the press in the circumstances of this case, the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not require it to do so.  Pp.  433 U. S. 578-579.

Decided June 27, 1977
433 U.S. 267

Syllabus 
After this Court, in Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717 (Milliken I), determined that an inter-district remedy for de jure segregation in the Detroit school system exceeded the constitutional violation, and remanded the case for formulation of a decree, the District Court promptly ordered submission of desegregation plans limited to the Detroit school system.  After extensive hearings the court, in addition to a plan for student assignment, included in its decree educational components, proposed by the Detroit School Board, in the areas of reading, in-service teacher training, testing, and counseling.  The court determined that these components were necessary to carry out desegregation, and directed that the costs were to be borne by the Detroit School Board and the State.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order concerning the implementation of and cost sharing for the four educational components.
Held:
1. As part of a desegregation decree, a district court can, if the record warrants, order compensatory or remedial educational programs for schoolchildren who have been subjected to past acts of de jure segregation.  Here the District Court, acting on substantial evidence in the record, did not abuse its discretion in approving a remedial plan going beyond pupil assignments and adopting specific programs that had been proposed by local school authorities.  Pp.  433 U. S. 279-288.
(a) ""In fashioning and effectuating [desegregation] decrees, the courts will be guided by equitable principles,"" Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294,  349 U. S. 300, and, in applying such principles, federal courts are to focus on the nature and scope of the violation, the fact that the decree must be remedial, and the interests of state and local authorities in managing their own affairs.  Pp.  433 U. S. 280-281.
(b) Where, as here, a constitutional violation has been found, the remedy does not ""exceed"" the violation if the remedy is tailored to cure the ""condition that offends the Constitution,"" Milliken I, supra at  418 U. S. 738, i.e., Detroit's de jure segregated school system.  Matters other than pupil assignment must on occasion be addressed by federal courts to eliminate the effects of prior segregation, United State v. Montgomery

 County Board of Education, 395 U. S. 225, and federal courts have, over the years, required inclusion of remedial programs in desegregation plans, when the record warrants, to remedy the direct consequences of dual school systems.  Pp.  433 U. S. 281-288.
2. The requirement that the state defendants pay one-half the additional costs attributable to the four educational components does not violate the Eleventh Amendment, since the District Court was authorized to provide prospective equitable relief, even though such relief requires the expenditure of money by the State.

|433 u.s. 299|"Hazelwood School District v. United States,
No. 76-255
Argued April 27, 1977
Decided June 27, 1977
433 U.S. 299

Syllabus 
The United States brought this action against petitioners, the Hazelwood, Mo., School District, located in St. Louis County, and various officials, alleging that they were engaged in a ""pattern or practice"" of teacher employment discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, which became applicable to petitioners as public employers on March 24, 1972.  The District Court, following trial, ruled that the Government had failed to establish a pattern or practice of discrimination.  The Court of Appeals reversed, in part on the ground that the trial court's analysis of statistical data rested on an irrelevant comparison of Negro teachers to Negro pupils in Hazelwood, instead of a comparison of Negro teachers in Hazelwood to Negro teachers in the relevant labor market area, which it found to consist of St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis, where 15.4% of the teachers are Negro.  In the 1972-1973 and 1973-1974 school years, only 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively, of Hazelwood's teachers were Negroes, and this statistical disparity, particularly when viewed against the background of Hazelwood's teacher hiring procedures, was held to constitute a prima facie case of a pattern or practice of racial discrimination.  Petitioners contend that the statistical data on which the Court of Appeals relied cannot sustain a finding of a violation of Title VII.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in disregarding the statistical data in the record dealing with Hazelwood's hiring after it became subject to Title VII, and the court should have remanded the case to the District Court for further findings as to the relevant labor market area and for an ultimate determination whether Hazelwood has engaged in a pattern or practice of employment discrimination since March 24, 1972.  Though the Court of Appeals was correct in the view that a proper comparison was between the racial composition of Hazelwood's teaching staff and the racial composition of the qualified public school teacher population in the relevant labor market, it erred in disregarding the possibility that the prima facie statistical proof in the record might, at the trial court level, be rebutted by statistics dealing with Hazelwood's post-Act hiring practices such as with respect to the number of Negroes hired compared 
Page 433 U. S. 300
 to the total number of Negro applicants.  For, once a prima facie case has been established by statistical work-force disparities, the employer must be given an opportunity to show that ""the claimed discriminatory pattern is a product of pre-Act hiring, rather than unlawful post-Act discrimination,"" Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324,  431 U. S. 360.  The record showed, but the Court of Appeals, in its conclusions, ignored, that, for the two-year period 1972-1974, 3.7% of the new teachers hired in Hazelwood were Negroes.  The court accepted the Government's argument that the relevant labor market was St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis without considering petitioners' contention that St. Louis County alone (where the figure was 5.7%) was the proper area because the city of St. Louis attempts to maintain a 50% Negro teaching staff.  The difference between the figures may well be significant, since the disparity between 3.7% and 5.7% may be sufficiently small to weaken the Government's other proof, while the disparity between 3.7% and 15.4% may be sufficiently large to reinforce it.  In determining what figures provide the most accurate basis for comparison to the hiring figures at Hazelwood, numerous other factors, moreover, must also be evaluated by the trial court.

No. 76-422
Argued April 19, 1977
Decided June 27, 1977
433 U.S. 321

Syllabus 
After her application for employment as a ""correctional counselor"" (prison guard) in Alabama was rejected because she failed to meet the minimum 120-pound weight requirement of an Alabama statute, which also establishes a height minimum of 5 feet 2 inches, appellee Rawlinson (hereafter appellee) filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and ultimately brought a class action against appellant corrections officials challenging the statutory height and weight requirements and a regulation establishing gender criteria for assigning correctional counselors to ""contact"" positions (positions requiring close physical proximity to inmates) as violative of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, inter alia.  A three-judge District Court decided in appellee's favor.  On the basis of national statistics as to the comparative height and weight of men and women indicating that Alabama's statutory standards would exclude over 4% of the female population but less than 1% of the male population, the court found that, with respect to such standards, appellee had made out a prima facie case of unlawful sex discrimination, which appellants had failed to rebut.  The court also found the challenged regulation impermissible under Title VII as being based on stereotyped characterizations of the sexes, and, rejecting appellants' ""bona fide occupational qualification"" defense under  703(e) of Title VII, ruled that being male was not such a qualification for the job of correctional counselor in a ""contact"" position in an Alabama male maximum security penitentiary.
Held:
1. The District Court did not err in holding that Title VII prohibited application of the statutory height and weight requirements to appellee and the class she represents.  Pp.  433 U. S. 328-332.
(a) To establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination, a plaintiff need only show that the facially neutral standards in question, such as Alabama's height and weight standards, select applicants for hire in a significantly discriminatory pattern, and here the showing of the disproportionate impact of the height and weight standards on women based on national statistics, rather than on comparative statistics 
Page 433 U. S. 332
 of actual applicants, sufficed to make out a prima facie case.  Pp.  433 U. S. 328-331.
(b) Appellants failed to rebut the prima facie case of discrimination on the basis that the height and weight requirements are job-related in that they have a relationship to the strength essential to efficient job performance as a correctional counselor, where appellants produced no evidence correlating such requirements with the requisite amount of strength thought essential to good job performance, and in fact failed to offer evidence of any kind in specific justification of the statutory standards.  P.  433 U. S. 331.
2. In the particular circumstances of this case, the District Court erred in rejecting appellants' contention that the regulation in question falls within the narrow ambit of the ""bona fide occupational qualification"" exception of  703(e), it appearing from the evidence that Alabama maintains a prison system where violence is the order of the day, inmate access to guards is facilitated by dormitory living arrangements, every correctional institution is understaffed, and a substantial portion of the inmate population is composed of sex offenders mixed at random with other prisoners, and that therefore the use of women guards in ""contact"" positions in the maximum security male penitentiaries would pose a substantial security problem, directly linked to the sex of the prison guard.

 HAZELWOOD SCHOOL DISTRICT et al., Petitioners,v. UNITED STATES. 
 Nos. 76-422 and 76-255. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 27, 1977
 
 Mr. Justice WHITE, concurring in No. 76-255 and dissenting in 76-422. 
 I join the Court's opinion in Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, No. 76-255, 433 U.S. 299, but with reservations with respect to the relative neglect of applicant pool data in finding a prima facie case of employment discrimination and heavy reliance on the disparity between the areawide percentage of black public school teachers and the percentage of blacks on Hazelwood's teaching staff. Since the issue is whether Hazelwood discriminated against blacks in hiring after Title VII became applicable to it in 1972, perhaps the Government should have looked initially to Hazelwood's hiring practices in the 1972-1973 and 1973-1974 academic years with respect to the available applicant pool, rather than to history and to comparative work-force statistics from other school districts. Indeed, there is evidence in the record suggesting that Hazelwood, with a black enrollment of only 2%, hired a higher percentage of black applicants than of white applicants for these two years. The Court's opinion, of course, permits Hazelwood to introduce applicant pool data on remand in order to rebut the prima facie case of a discriminatory pattern or practice. This may be the only fair and realistic allocation of the evidence burden, but arguably the United States should have been required to adduce evidence as to the applicant pool 
Page 433 U.S. 347 , 348
 before it was entitled to its prima facie presumption. At least it might have been required to present some defensible ground for believing that the racial composition of Hazelwood's applicant pool was roughly the same as that for the school districts in the general area, before relying on comparative work-force data to establish its prima facie case. 
 In Dothard v. Rawlinson, No. 76-422, 433 U.S. 321, I have more trouble agreeing that a prima facie case of sex discrimination was made out by statistics showing that the Alabama height and weight requirements would exclude a larger percentage of women in the United States than of men. As in Hazelwood, the issue is whether there was discrimination in dealing with actual or potential applicants; but in Hazelwood there was at least a colorable argument that the racial composition of the areawide teacher work force was a reasonable proxy for the composition of the relevant applicant pool and hence that a large divergence between the percentage of blacks on the teaching staff and the percentage in the teacher work force raised a fair inference of racial discrimination in dealing with the applicant pool. In Dothard, however, I am unwilling to believe that the percentage of women applying or interested in applying for jobs as prison guards in Alabama approximates the percentage of women either in the national or state population. A plaintiff could, of course, show that the composition of the applicant pool was distorted by the exclusion of nonapplicants who did not apply because of the allegedly discriminatory job requirement. But no such showing was made or even attempted here; and although I do not know what the actual fact is, I am not now convinced that a large percentage of the actual women applicants, or of those who are seriously interested in applying, for prison guard positions would fail to satisfy the height and weight requirements. Without a more satisfactory record on this issue, I cannot conclude that appellee Rawlinson has either made out a prima facie case for the invalidity of the restrictions or otherwise proved that she was [433 U.S. 347 , 349]

No. 76-316
Argued January 18, 1977
Decided June 27, 1977
433 U.S. 350

Syllabus 
Appellants, who are licensed attorneys and members of the Arizona State Bar, were charged in a complaint filed by the State Bar's president with violating the State Supreme Court's disciplinary rule, which prohibits attorneys from advertising in newspapers or other media.  The complaint was based upon a newspaper advertisement placed by appellants for their ""legal clinic,"" stating that they were offering ""legal services at very reasonable fees,"" and listing their fees for certain services, namely, uncontested divorces, uncontested adoptions, simple personal bankruptcies, and changes of name.  The Arizona Supreme Court upheld the conclusion of a bar committee that appellants had violated the rule, having rejected appellants' claims that the rule violated  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act because of its tendency to limit competition, and that it infringed appellants' First Amendment rights.
Held:
1. The restraint upon attorney advertising imposed by the Supreme Court of Arizona wielding the power of the State over the practice of law is not subject to attack under the Sherman Act.  Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, followed; Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773; Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U. S. 579, distinguished.  Pp.  433 U. S. 359-363.
2. Commercial speech, which serves individual and societal interests in assuring informed and reliable decisionmaking, is entitled to some First Amendment protection, Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Consumer Council, 425 U. S. 748, and the justifications advanced by appellee are inadequate to support the suppression of all advertising by attorneys.  Pp.  433 U. S. 363-384.
(a) This case does not involve any question concerning in-person solicitation or advertising as to the quality of legal services, but only the question whether lawyers may constitutionally advertise the prices at which certain routine services will be performed.  Pp.  433 U. S. 366-367.
(b) The belief that lawyers are somehow above ""trade"" is an anachronism, and for a lawyer to advertise his fees will not undermine true professionalism.  Pp.  433 U. S. 368-372.
(c) Advertising legal services is not inherently misleading.  Only routine services lend themselves to advertising, and, for such services, fixed rates can be meaningfully established, as the Arizona State Bar's own Legal Services Program demonstrates.  Although a client may not 
Page 433 U. S. 351
 know the detail involved in a given task, he can identify the service at the level of generality to which advertising lends itself.  Though advertising does not provide a complete foundation on which to select an attorney, it would be peculiar to deny the consumer at least some of the relevant information needed for an informed decision on the ground that the information was not complete.  Pp.  433 U. S. 372-375.
(d) Advertising, the traditional mechanism in a free market economy for a supplier to inform a potential purchaser of the availability and terms of exchange, may well benefit the administration of justice.  Pp.  433 U. S. 375-377.
(e) It is entirely possible that advertising will serve to reduce, not advance, the cost of legal services to the consumer, and may well aid new attorneys in entering the market.  Pp.  433 U. S. 377-378.
(f) An attorney who is inclined to cut quality will do so regardless of the rule on advertising, the restraints on which are an ineffective deterrent to shoddy work.  Pp.  433 U. S. 378-379.
(g) Undue enforcement problems need not be anticipated, and it is at least incongruous for the opponents of advertising to extol the virtues of the legal profession while also asserting that, through advertising, lawyers will mislead their clients.  P.  433 U. S. 379.
3. The First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, which represents a departure from the traditional rule that a person may not challenge a statute on the ground that it might be applied unconstitutionally in circumstances other than those before the court, is inapplicable to professional advertising, a context where it is not necessary to further its intended objective, cf. Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809,  421 U. S. 817-818, and appellants must therefore demonstrate that their specific conduct was constitutionally protected.  Pp.  433 U. S. 379-381.
4. On this record, appellants' advertisement (contrary to appellee's contention) is not misleading, and falls within the scope of First Amendment protection.  Pp.  433 U. S. 381-382.
(a) The term ""legal clinic"" would be understood to refer to an operation like appellants' that is geared to provide standardized and multiple services.  Pp.  433 U. S. 381-382.
(b) The advertisement's claim that appellants offer services at ""very reasonable"" prices is not misleading.  Appellants' advertised fee for an uncontested divorce, which was specifically cited by appellee, is in line with customary charges in the area.  P.  433 U. S. 382.
(c) Appellants' failure to disclose that a name change might be accomplished by the client without an attorney's aid was not misleading, since the difficulty of performing the task is not revealed, and since most 
Page 433 U. S. 352
 legal services may be performed legally by the citizen for himself.  See Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806.  P.  433 U. S. 382.

No. 76-539
Argued April 26, 1977
Decided June 27, 1977
433 U.S. 406

Syllabus 
In this school desegregation case, the District Court, after an evidentiary hearing, held that petitioner Dayton, Ohio, School Board had engaged in racial discrimination in the operation of the city's schools.  On the basis of a ""cumulative violation"" of the Equal Protection Clause that the court found, which was composed of three elements, viz., (1) substantial racial imbalance in student enrollment patterns throughout the school system; (2) the use of optional attendance zones allowing some white students to avoid attending predominantly black schools; and (3) the School Board's rescission in 1972 of resolutions passed by the previous Board that had acknowledged responsibility in the creation of segregative racial patterns and had called for various types of remedial measures, the District Court, following reversals by the Court of Appeals of more limited remedies, ultimately formulated and the Court of Appeals approved, a systemwide remedy.  The plan required, beginning with the 1976-1977 school year, that the racial composition of each school in the district be brought within 15% of Dayton's 48%-52% black-white population ratio, to be accomplished by a variety of desegregation techniques, including the ""pairing"" of schools, the redefinition of attendance zones, and a variety of centralized special programs and ""magnet schools.""
Held:
1. Judged most favorably to respondent parents of black children, the District Court's findings of constitutional violations did not suffice to justify the systemwide remedy.  The finding that pupil population in the various Dayton schools is not homogeneous, standing by itself, is not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment absent a showing that this condition resulted from intentionally segregative actions on the part of the Board.  Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229,  426 U. S. 239.  The court's finding as to the optional attendance zones applied to three high schools, and, assuming that, under Washington standards, a violation was involved, only high school districting was implicated.  And the conclusion that the Board's rescission action constituted a constitutional violation is of dubious soundness.  It was thus not demonstrated that the systemwide 
Page 433 U. S. 407
 remedy, in effect imposed by the Court of Appeals, was necessary to ""eliminate all vestiges of the state-imposed school segregation.""  Pp.  433 U. S. 413-418.
2. In view of the confusion at various stages in this case as to the applicable principles and appropriate relief, the case must be remanded to the District Court.  The ambiguous phrase ""cumulative violation,"" used by both courts below, does not overcome the disparity between the evidence of constitutional violations and the sweeping remedy finally decreed.  More specific findings must be made, and, if necessary, the record must be supplemented.  Conclusions as to violations must be made in light of this Court's opinions here and in Washington v. Davis, supra, and Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U. S. 252, and a remedy must be fashioned in light of the rule laid down in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1, and elaborated on in Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U. S. 284.  In a case like this, where mandatory racial segregation has long since ceased, it must first be determined if the school board intended to, and did in fact, discriminate, and all appropriate additional evidence should be adduced; and only if systemwide discrimination is shown may there be a systemwide remedy.  Meanwhile, the present plan should remain in effect for the coming school year, subject to further District Court orders as additional evidence might warrant.  Pp.  433 U. S. 418-421.

Appellee, a nonresident of Delaware, filed a shareholder's derivative suit in a Delaware Chancery Court, naming as defendants a corporation and its subsidiary, as well as 28 present or former corporate officers or directors, alleging that the individual defendants had violated their duties to the corporation by causing it and its subsidiary to engage in actions (which occurred in Oregon) that resulted in corporate liability for substantial damages in a private antitrust suit and a large fine in a criminal contempt action.  Simultaneously, appellee, pursuant to Del.Code Ann., Tit. 10,  366 (1975), filed a motion for sequestration of the Delaware property of the individual defendants, all nonresidents of Delaware, accompanied by an affidavit identifying the property to be sequestered as stock, options, warrants, and various corporate rights of the defendants.  A sequestration order was issued pursuant to which shares and options belonging to 21 defendants (appellants) were ""seized"" and ""stop transfer"" orders were placed on the corporate books.  Appellants entered a special appearance to quash service of process and to vacate the sequestration order, contending that the ex parte sequestration procedure did not accord them due process; that the property seized was not capable of attachment in Delaware; and that they did not have sufficient contacts with Delaware to sustain jurisdiction of that State's courts under the rule of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310.  In that case, the Court (after noting that the historical basis of in personam jurisdiction was a court's power over the defendant's person, making his presence within the court's territorial jurisdiction a prerequisite to its rendition of a personally binding judgment against him, Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714) held that that power was no longer the central concern, and that
""due process requires only that, in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice'""
(and thus the focus shifted to the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation, rather than the mutually exclusive sovereignty of the States on which the rules of Pennoyer had rested).  The Court of Chancery, rejecting appellants' arguments, upheld the  366 procedure of compelling the 
Page 433 U. S. 187
 personal appearance of a nonresident defendant to answer and defend a suit brought against him in a court of equity, which is accomplished by the appointment of a sequestrator to seize and hold the property of the nonresident located in Delaware subject to court order, with release of the property being made upon the defendant's entry of a general appearance.  The court held that the limitation on the purpose and length of time for which sequestered property is held comported with due process, and that the statutory situs of the stock (under a provision making Delaware the situs of ownership of the capital stock of all corporations existing under the laws of that State) provided a sufficient basis for the exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction by a Delaware court.  The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that International Shoe raised no constitutional barrier to the sequestration procedure because
""jurisdiction under  366 remains . . . quasi in rem founded on the presence of capital stock [in Delaware], not on prior contact by defendants with this forum.""
Held:
1. Whether or not a State can assert jurisdiction over a nonresident must be evaluated according to the minimum contacts standard of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, supra.  Pp.  433 U. S. 207-212.
(a) In order to justify an exercise of jurisdiction in rem, the basis for jurisdiction must be sufficient to justify exercising ""jurisdiction over the interests of persons in the thing.""  The presence of property in a State may bear upon the existence of jurisdiction by providing contacts among the forum State, the defendant, and the litigation, as for example, when claims to the property itself are the source of the underlying controversy between the plaintiff and defendant, where it would be unusual for the State where the property is located not to have jurisdiction.  Pp.  433 U. S. 207-208.
(b) But where, as in the instant quasi in rem action, the property now serving as the basis for state court jurisdiction is completely unrelated to the plaintiff's cause of action, the presence of the property alone, i.e., absent other ties among the defendant, the State, and the litigation, would not support the State's jurisdiction.  Pp.  433 U. S. 208-209.
(c) Though the primary rationale for treating the presence of property alone as a basis for jurisdiction is to prevent a wrongdoer from avoiding payment of his obligations by removal of his assets to a place where he is not subject to an in personam suit, that is an insufficient justification for recognizing jurisdiction without regard to whether the property is in the State for that purpose.  Moreover, the availability of attachment procedures and the protection of the Full Faith and Credit Clause also militate against that rationale.  Pp.  433 U. S. 209-210. 
Page 433 U. S. 188

(d) The fairness standard of International Shoe can be easily applied in the vast majority of cases.  P.  433 U. S. 211.
(e) Though jurisdiction based solely on the presence of property in a State has had a long history, ""traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice"" can be as readily offended by the perpetuation of ancient forms that are no longer justified as by the adoption of new procedures that do not comport with the basic values of our constitutional heritage.  Cf. Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp, 395 U. S. 337,  395 U. S. 340; Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25,  338 U. S. 27.  Pp.  433 U. S. 211-212.
2. Delaware's assertion of jurisdiction over appellants, based solely as it is on the statutory presence of appellants' property in Delaware, violates the Due Process Clause, which
""does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment . . . against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties, or relations.""
International Shoe, supra at  433 U. S. 319.  Pp.  433 U. S. 213-217.
(a) Appellants' holdings in the corporation, which are not the subject matter of this litigation and are unrelated to the underlying cause of action, do not provide contacts with Delaware sufficient to support jurisdiction of that State's courts over appellants.   P.  433 U. S. 213.
(b) Nor is Delaware state court jurisdiction supported by that State's interest in supervising the management of a Delaware corporation and defining the obligations of its officers and directors, since Delaware bases jurisdiction not on appellants' status as corporate fiduciaries, but on the presence of their property in the State.  Moreover, sequestration has been available in any suit against a nonresident, whether against corporate fiduciaries or not.  Pp.  433 U. S. 213-215.
(c) Though it may be appropriate for Delaware law to govern the obligations of appellants to the corporation and stockholders, this does not mean that appellants have ""purposefully avail[ed themselves] of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State,"" Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235,  357 U. S. 253.  Appellants, who were not required to acquire interests in the corporation in order to hold their positions, did not, by acquiring those interests, surrender their right to be brought to judgment in the States in which they had ""minimum contacts.""  Pp.  433 U. S. 215-216.
361 A.2d 225, reversed.

Syllabus 
Appellants, citizens and taxpayers of Ohio, brought this action against appellees, certain state officials and others, challenging the constitutionality of all but one of the provisions of Ohio Rev.Code Ann.  3317.06 (Supp. 1976) authorizing various forms of aid to nonpublic schools, most of which are sectarian.  The Ohio scheme authorizes funding for use of nonpublic schoolchildren within the district where the nonpublic school is located for the following purposes:  (1) purchasing secular textbooks approved by the superintendent of public instruction for use in public schools for loan to the children or their parents, on the request of either, made to the nonpublic school ( 3317.06(A)); (2) supplying such standardized tests and scoring services as are used in the public schools, with nonpublic school personnel not being involved in the test drafting or scoring, and no financial aid being involved ( 3317.06 (J)); (3) providing speech and hearing diagnostic services and diagnostic psychological services in the nonpublic schools, with the personnel (except for physicians) performing the services being local board of education employees, physicians being hired on a contract basis, and treatment to be administered on nonpublic school premises ( 3317.06(D), (F)); (4) supplying to students needing specialized attention therapeutic, guidance, and remedial services by employees of the local board of education or the State Department of Health, the services to be performed only in public schools, public centers, or in mobile units located off nonpublic school premises ( 3317.06 (G), (H), (I), (K)); (5) purchasing and loaning to pupils or their parents upon individual request instructional materials and instructional equipment of the kind used in the public schools and that is ""incapable of diversion to religious use"" ( 3317.06(B), (C)); and (6) providing field trip transportation and services such as are provided to public school students, special contract transportation being permissible if school district buses are unavailable ( 3317.06(L)).  A three-judge District Court held the statute constitutional in all respects.
Held:  Those portions of  3317.06 authorizing the State to provide nonpublic school pupils with books, standardized testing and scoring, diagnostic services, and therapeutic and remedial services are constitutional.  Those portions 
Page 433 U. S. 230
 relating to instructional materials and equipment and field trip services are unconstitutional.  Pp.  433 U. S. 235-255;  433 U. S. 255.
417 F.Supp. 1113, affirmed in part, reversed in part.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, V, VI, VII, and VIII, finding that:
1. Providing diagnostic services on the nonpublic school premises will not create an impermissible risk of fostering ideological views; hence, there is no need for excessive surveillance, and there will not be impermissible church-state entanglement.  The provision of health services to nonpublic as well as public school children does not have the primary effect of aiding religion, Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602,  403 U. S. 616-617; see also Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349,  421 U. S. 364,  421 U. S. 368 n. 17.  Appellants do not challenge that part of the statute authorizing physician, nursing, dental, and optometric services for nonpublic schools ( 3317.06 (E)), and there is no basis for drawing a different conclusion with respect to diagnostic speech and hearing services and diagnostic psychological services.  Diagnostic services, unlike teaching and counseling, have little or no educational content, and the limited contact that the diagnostician has with the child does not provide the same opportunity for transmitting sectarian views as does the teacher/counsel-student relationship. Sections 3317.06(D) and (F) are constitutional.  Pp.  433 U. S. 241-244.
2. The therapeutic, guidance, and remedial services, which (including those rendered in mobile units) are to be offered only on sites that are not physically or educationally identified with the nonpublic school, will not have the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  Since those services will be administered by public employees, no excessive entanglement is created.  Sections 3317.06 (G), (U), (I), and (K) are constitutional.  Pp.  433 U. S. 244-248.
3. Even though the loan for instructional material and equipment is ostensibly limited to neutral and secular instructional material and equipment, it inescapably has the primary effect of providing a direct and substantial advancement of sectarian education, Meek v. Pittenger, supra at  421 U. S. 366.  It is impossible to separate the secular education function from the sectarian, and hence the state aid in part inevitably supports the religious role of the schools.  Sections 3317.06(B) and (C) are unconstitutional.  Pp.  433 U. S. 248-251
4. The nonpublic schools, which can control the timing and frequency of the field trips, are the recipients of the service, rather than the children, and the funding of such trips (like the impermissible funding 
Page 433 U. S. 231
 of maps and charts in Meek v. Pittenger) is an impermissible direct aid to sectarian education, and the close supervision of nonpublic school teachers necessary to ensure secular use of field trip funds would involve excessive entanglement.  Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra at  403 U. S. 619.  Section 3317.06(L) is unconstitutional.  Pp.  433 U. S. 252-255.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded:
1. In order to pass constitutional muster under the Establishment Clause, a statute (1) must have a secular legislative purpose; (2) must have a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion; and (3) must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.  See Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Bd., 426 U. S. 736,  426 U. S. 748; Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, supra at  413 U. S. 772-773; Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra at  403 U. S. 612,  403 U. S. 613.  Pp.  433 U. S. 235-236.
2. The textbook loan system is strikingly similar to the systems approved in Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, and Meek v. Pittenger, supra, which are followed.  Section 3317.06(A) is constitutional.  Pp.  433 U. S. 236-238.
3. The testing and scoring program, in which the State has a substantial interest to ensure that state educational standards are met, is not controlled by the nonpublic school, and thus there is no direct aid to religion or need for supervision.  Levitt v. Committee for Public Education, 413 U. S. 472, distinguished.  Section 3317.06(J) is constitutional.  Pp.  433 U. S. 238-241.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE and ME. JUSTICE REHNQUIST concurred in the judgment with respect to textbooks and testing and scoring (as well as diagnostic and therapeutic services) for the reasons stated in Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349,  421 U. S. 387 (REHNQUIST, J., concurring in judgment in part, dissenting in part), and Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756,  413 U. S. 813 (WHITE, J., dissenting).  P.  433 U. S. 255.
BLACKMUN, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, V, VI, VII, and VIII, in which STEWART and STEVENS, JJ., joined; in which, as to Part I, BURGER, C.J., and BRENNAN, MARSHALL, and POWELL, JJ., also joined; in which, as to Part V, BURGER, C.J., and MARSHALL and POWELL JJ., also joined; in which, as to Part VI, BURGER, C.J., and POWELL, J., also joined; in which, as to Parts VII and VIII, BRENNAN and MARSHALL, JJ., also joined; and an opinion with respect to Parts II, III, and IV, in which BURGER, C.J., and STEWART and POWELL, JJ., joined.

Pittenger) is an impermissible direct aid to sectarian education, and the close supervision of nonpublic school teachers necessary to ensure secular use of field trip funds would involve excessive entanglement.  Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra at  403 U. S. 619.  Section 3317.06(L) is unconstitutional.  Pp.  433 U. S. 252-255.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded:
1. In order to pass constitutional muster under the Establishment Clause, a statute (1) must have a secular legislative purpose; (2) must have a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion; and (3) must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.  See Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Bd., 426 U. S. 736,  426 U. S. 748; Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, supra at  413 U. S. 772-773; Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra at  403 U. S. 612,  403 U. S. 613.  Pp.  433 U. S. 235-236.
2. The textbook loan system is strikingly similar to the systems approved in Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, and Meek v. Pittenger, supra, which are followed.  Section 3317.06(A) is constitutional.  Pp.  433 U. S. 236-238.
3. The testing and scoring program, in which the State has a substantial interest to ensure that state educational standards are met, is not controlled by the nonpublic school, and thus there is no direct aid to religion or need for supervision.  Levitt v. Committee for Public Education, 413 U. S. 472, distinguished.  Section 3317.06(J) is constitutional.  Pp.  433 U. S. 238-241.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE and ME. JUSTICE REHNQUIST concurred in the judgment with respect to textbooks and testing and scoring (as well as diagnostic and therapeutic services) for the reasons stated in Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349,  421 U. S. 387 (REHNQUIST, J., concurring in judgment in part, dissenting in part), and Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756,  413 U. S. 813 (WHITE, J., dissenting).

Syllabus 
In an attempt to improve its market position by attracting more aggressive and competent retailers, respondent manufacturer of television sets limited the number of retail franchises granted for any given area and required each franchisee to sell respondent's products only from the location or locations at which it was franchised.  Petitioner Continental, one of respondent's franchised retailers, claimed that respondent had violated  1 of the Sherman Act by entering into and enforcing franchise agreements that prohibited the sale of respondent's products other than from specified locations.  The District Court rejected respondent's requested jury instruction that the location restriction was illegal only if it unreasonably restrained or suppressed competition.  Instead, relying on United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U. S. 365, the District Court instructed the jury that it was a per se violation of  1 if respondent entered into a contract, combination, or conspiracy with one or more of its retailers, pursuant to which it attempted to restrict the locations from which the retailers resold the merchandise they had purchased from respondent.  The jury found that the location restriction violated  1, and treble damages were assessed against respondent.  Concluding that Schwinn was distinguishable, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's location restriction had less potential for competitive harm than the restrictions invalidated in Schwinn, and thus should be judged under the ""rule of reason.""
Held:
1. The statement of the per se rule in Schwinn is broad enough to cover the location restriction used by respondent.  And the retail customer restriction in Schwinn is functionally indistinguishable from the location restriction here, the restrictions in both cases limiting the retailer's freedom to dispose of the purchased products and reducing, but not eliminating, intrabrand competition.  Pp.  433 U. S. 42-47.
2. The justification and standard for the creation of per se rules was stated in Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U. S. 1,  356 U. S. 5:
""There are certain agreements or practices which, because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue, are conclusively 
Page 433 U. S. 37
 presumed to be unreasonable, and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use.""
Under this standard, there is no justification for the distinction drawn in Schwinn between restrictions imposed in sale and nonsale transactions.  Similarly, the facts of this case do not present a situation justifying a per se rule.  Accordingly, the per se rule stated in Schwinn is overruled, and the location restriction used by respondent should be judged under the traditional rule of reason standard.  Pp.  433 U. S. 47-59.

Syllabus 
During respondent's trial for murder, inculpatory statements made by him to police officers were admitted into evidence.  No challenge was made on the ground that respondent had not understood warnings read to him pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, nor did the trial judge sua sponte question their admissibility or hold a factfinding hearing.  Respondent, who was convicted, did not challenge the admissibility of the statements on appeal, though later he did so, unavailingly, in a motion to vacate the conviction and in state habeas corpus petitions.  He then brought this federal habeas corpus action under 28 U.S.C.  2254, asserting the inadmissibility of his statements by reason of his lack of understanding of the Miranda warnings.  The District Court ruled that, under Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368, respondent had a right to a hearing in the state court on the voluntariness of the statements, and that he had not lost that right by failing to assert his claim at trial or on appeal.  The Court of Appeals agreed that respondent was entitled to a Jackson v. Denno hearing, and ruled that respondent's failure to comply with Florida's procedural ""contemporaneous objection rule"" (which, except as specified, requires a defendant to make a motion to suppress evidence prior to trial) would not bar review of the suppression claim unless the right to object was deliberately bypassed for tactical reasons.
Held:  Respondent's failure to make timely objection under the Florida contemporaneous objection rule to the admission of his inculpatory statements, absent a showing of cause for the noncompliance and some showing of actual prejudice, bars federal habeas corpus review of his Miranda claim.  Davis v. United States, 411 U. S. 233; Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536.  Pp.  433 U. S. 77-91.
(a) Florida's rule, in unmistakable terms and with specified exceptions, requires that motions to suppress be raised before trial.  P.  433 U. S. 85.
(b) There is no constitutional requirement in Jackson v. Denno, supra, or later cases that there be a voluntariness hearing absent some contemporaneous challenge to the use of a confession.  P.  433 U. S. 86.
(c) The sweeping language set forth in Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 
Page 433 U. S. 73
 which would render a State's contemporaneous objection rule ineffective to bar review of underlying federal claims in federal habeas corpus proceedings -- absent a ""knowing waiver"" or a ""deliberate bypass"" of the right to so object -- is rejected as according too little respect to the state contemporaneous objection rule.  Such a rule enables the record to be made with respect to a constitutional claim when witnesses' recollections are freshest; enables the trial judge who observed the demeanor of witnesses to make the factual determinations necessary for properly deciding the federal question; and may, by forcing a trial court decision on the merits of federal constitutional contentions, contribute to the finality of criminal litigation.  Conversely, the rule of Fay v. Noia may encourage defense lawyers to take their chances on a verdict of not guilty in a state trial court, intending to raise their constitutional claims in a federal habeas corpus court if their initial gamble fails, and detracts from the perception of the trial of a criminal case as a decisive and portentous event.  Pp.  433 U. S. 87-90.
(d) Adoption of the ""cause"" and ""prejudice"" test of Francis, while giving greater respect than did Fay to the operation of state contemporaneous objection rules, affords an adequate guarantee that federal habeas corpus courts will not be barred from hearing claims involving an actual miscarriage of justice.  The procedural history of this case and the evidence as presented at trial indicate that there exist here neither ""cause"" nor ""prejudice"" as are necessary to support federal habeas corpus review of the underlying constitutional contention.

Syllabus 
Appellee prisoners' labor union brought this action under 42 U.S.C.  1983, claiming that its First Amendment and equal protection rights were violated by regulations promulgated by the North Carolina Department of Correction that prohibited prisoners from soliciting other inmates to join the Union and barred Union meetings and bulk mailings concerning the Union from outside sources.  A three-judge District Court, which noted that appellants had ""permitted"" inmates to join the Union, granted substantial injunctive relief, having concluded that prohibiting inmate-to-inmate solicitation ""border[ed] on the irrational,"" and that, since bulk mailings to and meetings with inmates by the Jaycees, Alcoholics Anonymous, and, in one institution, the Boy Scouts (hereafter collectively ""service organizations"") had been permitted, appellants, absent a showing of detriment to penological objectives, ""may not pick and choose depending on [their] approval or disapproval of the message or purpose of the group.""
Held:
1. The challenged regulations do not violate the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.  Pp.  433 U. S. 125-133.
(a) The fact of confinement and the needs of the penal institution impose limitations on constitutional rights, including those derived from the First Amendment, Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817,  417 U. S. 822, perhaps the most obvious of which is associational rights that the First Amendment protects outside of prison walls.  Pp.  433 U. S. 125-126.
(b) The District Court overstated what appellants' concession as to true membership entailed -- appellants permitted membership in the Union (which involved no dues or obligations) because of the reasonable assumption that the individual could believe what he chose to believe, but appellants never acquiesced in, or permitted, group activity by the Union, and the ban on inmate solicitation and group meetings was rationally related to the reasonable objectives of prison administration.  Pp.  433 U. S. 126-129.
(c) First Amendment speech rights are barely implicated here, mail

 rights themselves not being involved, but only the cost savings through bulk mailings.  Pp.  433 U. S. 130-131.
(d) The prohibition on inmate-to-inmate solicitation does not unduly abridge inmates' free speech rights.  If the prison officials are otherwise entitled to control organized union activity within the confines of a prison, the solicitation ban is not impermissible under the First Amendment, for such a prohibition is both reasonable and necessary.  Pell v. Procunier, supra at  417 U. S. 822.  Pp.  433 U. S. 131-132.
(e) First Amendment associational rights are also not unduly abridged here.  Appellants' conclusion that the presence of a prisoners' union would be detrimental to prison order and security has not been conclusively shown to be wrong, and the regulations drafted were no broader than necessary to meet the perceived threat of group meetings and organizational activity to such order and security.

2. Appellants' prohibition against the receipt by and distribution to the inmates of bulk mail from the Union as well as the prohibition of Union meetings among inmates whereas the service organizations were given bulk mailing and meeting rights, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.

The ""net valuation"" portion of unpaid life insurance premiums (the portion state law requires a life insurance company to add to its reserve), but not the ""loading"" portion (the portion to be used to pay salesmen's commissions, other expenses such as state taxes and overhead, and profits), held required to be included in a life insurance company's assets and gross premium income, as well as in its reserves, for purposes of computing its federal income tax liability, notwithstanding such computation necessitates making a fictional assumption that the ""net valuation"" portion has been paid but that the ""loading"" portion has not.  This treatment of unpaid premiums is in accordance with  818(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (as added by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959), which requires computations of a life insurance company's income taxes to be made
""in a manner consistent with the manner required for purposes of the annual statement approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners,""

Decided June 23, 1977
433 U.S. 148

Syllabus 
The ""net valuation"" portion of unpaid life insurance premiums (the portion state law requires a life insurance company to add to its reserve), but not the ""loading"" portion (the portion to be used to pay salesmen's commissions, other expenses such as state taxes and overhead, and profits), held required to be included in a life insurance company's assets and gross premium income, as well as in its reserves, for purposes of computing its federal income tax liability, notwithstanding such computation necessitates making a fictional assumption that the ""net valuation"" portion has been paid but that the ""loading"" portion has not.  This treatment of unpaid premiums is in accordance with  818(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (as added by the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959), which requires computations of a life insurance company's income taxes to be made
""in a manner consistent with the manner required for purposes of the annual statement approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners,""
unless the NAIC procedures are inconsistent with accrual accounting rules, and to the extent that the Treasury Regulations require different treatment of unpaid premiums they are inconsistent with  818(a), and therefore invalid.  Pp.  433 U. S. 152-163.

|433 u.s. 165|"Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Washington
No. 76-423
Argued April 18, 1977
Decided June 23, 1977
433 U.S. 165

Syllabus 
After protracted litigation, the Washington Superior Court entered a judgment against petitioner Puyallup Tribe reciting that the court possessed jurisdiction to regulate the Tribe's fishing activities both off and on its reservation, and limiting the number of steelhead trout that tribal members might net in the Puyallup River each year, and the Tribe was directed to file a list of members authorized to exercise treaty fishing rights, and to report to respondent Washington Department of Game and to the court the number of steelhead caught by the treaty fishermen each week.  The Washington Supreme Court affirmed, with a slight modification.  The Tribe contends that the doctrine of sovereign immunity requires that the judgment be vacated; that the state courts have no jurisdiction to regulate fishing activities on the reservation; and that, in any event, the limitation on the steelhead catch is not a necessary conservation measure.
Held:
1. Absent an effective waiver or consent, a state court may not exercise jurisdiction over a recognized Indian tribe, but tribal sovereign immunity here does not impair the Superior Court's authority to adjudicate the rights of individual tribal members over whom it properly obtained personal jurisdiction, Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 391 U. S. 392 (Puyallup I), and hence only those portions of the judgment that involve relief against the Tribe itself must be vacated in order to honor the Tribe's valid claim of immunity.  Pp.  433 U. S. 168-173.
2. Neither the Tribe nor its members have an exclusive right, under the Treaty of Medicine Creek, to take steelhead passing through the reservation.  It not only appears that the Tribe, pursuant to Acts of Congress passed after the treaty was entered into, alienated in fee simple absolute all areas of the reservation abutting on the Puyallup River, but, moreover, the Tribe's treaty right to fish ""at all usual and accustomed places"" is to be exercised ""in common with all citizens of the Territory,"" Puyallup I, supra, at  391 U. S. 398, and is subject to reasonable regulation by the State pursuant to its power to conserve an important natural resource.  The fair apportionment of the steelhead catch between Indian net fishing and non-Indian sport fishing directed by Washington Game Dept. v. Puyallup Tribe, 414 U. S. 44 (Puyallup II), 
Page 433 U. S. 166
 could not be effective if the Indians retained the power to take an unlimited number of steelhead within the reservation.  Pp.  433 U. S. 173-177.
3. It appears that the state court complied with the mandate of Puyallup II, supra, at  414 U. S. 48-49, and used a proper standard of conservation necessity in limiting the steelhead catch, where such limitation was based primarily on expert testimony for both parties.  P.  433 U. S. 177.
4. Although the Tribe properly resists the state courts' authority to order it to provide information with respect to the status of tribal members and the size of their catch, it may find that its members' interests are best served by voluntarily providing such information, but the state courts on remand must continue to respect the Tribe's right to participate in the proceedings without treating such participation as qualifying the Tribe's right to claim sovereign immunity.

No. 75-1721
Argued April 26, 1977
Decided June 21, 1977
433 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
When respondents arrived by train in Boston from San Diego, they were arrested at their waiting automobile by federal narcotics agents, who had been alerted that respondents were possible drug traffickers.  A double-locked footlocker, which respondents had transported on the train and which the agents had probable cause to believe contained narcotics, had been loaded in the trunk of the automobile.  Respondents, together with the automobile and footlocker, which was admittedly under the agents' exclusive control, were then taken to the Federal Building in Boston.  An hour and a half after the arrests, the agents opened the footlocker without respondents' consent or a search warrant, and found large amounts of marihuana in it.  Respondents were subsequently indicted for possession of marihuana with intent to distribute it.  The District Court granted their pretrial motion to suppress the marihuana obtained from the footlocker, holding that warrantless searches are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment unless they fall within some established exception to the warrant requirement, and that the footlocker search was not justified under either the ""automobile exception"" or as a search incident to a lawful arrest; the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Respondents were entitled to the protection of the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment, with the evaluation 
Page 433 U. S. 2
 of a neutral magistrate, before their privacy interests in the contents of the footlocker were invaded.  Pp.  433 U. S. 6-16.
(a) A fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to safeguard individuals from unreasonable government invasions of legitimate privacy interests, and not simply those interests inside the four walls of the home.  Pp.  433 U. S. 6-11.
(b) By placing personal effects inside a double-locked footlocker, respondents manifested an expectation that the contents would remain free from public examination, and, no less than one who locks the doors of his home against intruders, one who safeguards his personal possessions in this manner is due the protection of the Fourth Amendment's Warrant Clause; since there was no exigency calling for an immediate search, it was unreasonable for the Government to conduct the search without the safeguards a judicial warrant provides.  P.  433 U. S. 11.
(c) The footlocker search was not justified under the ""automobile exception,"" since a person's expectations of privacy in personal luggage are substantially greater than in an automobile.  In this connection, the footlocker's mobility did not justify dispensing with a search warrant, because, once the federal agents had seized the footlocker at the railroad station and safely transferred it to the Federal Building under their exclusive control, there was not the slightest danger that it or its contents could have been removed before a valid search warrant could be obtained.  Pp.  433 U. S. 11-13.
(d) Nor was the footlocker search justified as a search incident to a lawful arrest, where the search was remote in time or place from the arrest and no exigency existed, the search having been conducted more than an hour after the federal agents had gained exclusive control of the footlocker and long after respondents were securely in custody.

1.

No. 76-63
Argued February 22, 1977
Decided June 20, 1977
432 U.S. 333

Syllabus 
Appellee, a statutory agency for the promotion and protection of the Washington State apple industry and composed of 13 state growers and dealers chosen from electoral districts by their fellow growers and dealers, all of whom by mandatory assessments finance appellee's operations, brought this suit challenging the constitutionality of a North Carolina statute requiring that all apples sold or shipped into North Carolina in closed containers be identified by no grade on the containers other than the applicable federal grade or a designation that the apples are not graded.  A three-judge District Court granted the requested injunctive and declaratory relief, holding that appellee had standing to challenge the statute, that the $10,000 jurisdictional amount of 28 U.S.C.  1331 was satisfied, and that the challenged statute unconstitutionally discriminated against commerce insofar as it affected the interstate shipment of Washington apples.
Held:
1. Appellee has standing to bring this action in a representational capacity. Pp. 341-345.
(a) An association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when (1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (2) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose; and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation in the lawsuit of each of the individual members.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490.  Pp.  432 U. S. 342-343.
(b) The prerequisites to associational standing described in Warth are clearly present here:  (1) At the risk of otherwise losing North Carolina accounts, some Washington apple growers and dealers had (at a per-container cost of 5 to 15) obliterated Washington State grades from the large volume of North Carolina-bound containers; and they had stopped using preprinted containers, thus diminishing the efficiency of their marketing operations; (2) appellee's attempt to remedy these injuries is central to its purpose of protecting and enhancing the Washington apple market; and (3) neither appellee's constitutional claim nor the relief requested requires individualized proof.  Pp.  432 U. S. 343-344. 
Page 432 U. S. 334

(c) Though appellee is a state agency, it is not, on that account, precluded from asserting the claims of the State's apple growers and dealers, since, for all practical purposes, appellee performs the functions of a traditional trade association.  While the apple growers are not ""members"" of appellee in the traditional trade association sense, they possess all the indicia of organization membership (viz., electing the members, being the only ones to serve on the Commission, and financing its activities), and it is of no consequence that membership assessments are mandatory.  Pp.  432 U. S. 344-345.
(d) Appellee's own interests may be adversely affected by the outcome of this litigation, since the annual assessments that are used to support its activities and which are tied to the production of Washington apples could be reduced if the market for those apples declines as a result of the North Carolina statute.  P.  432 U. S. 345.
2. The requirements of  1331 are satisfied.  Since appellee has standing to litigate its constituents' claims, it may rely on them to meet the requisite amount of $10,000 in controversy.  And it does not appear ""to a legal certainty"" that the claims of at least some of the individual growers and dealers will not come to that amount in view of the substantial annual sales volume of Washington apples in North Carolina (over $2 million) and the continuing nature of the statute's interference with the Washington apple industry, coupled with the evidence in the record that growers and dealers have suffered and will continue to suffer losses of various types from the operation of the challenged statute.  St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U. S. 283.  Pp.  432 U. S. 346-348.
3. The North Carolina statute violates the Commerce Clause by burdening and discriminating against the interstate sale of Washington apples.  Pp.  432 U. S. 348-354.
(a) The statute raises the costs of doing business in the North Carolina market for Washington growers and dealers while leaving unaffected their North Carolina counterparts, who were still free to market apples under the federal grade or none at all.  Pp.  432 U. S. 350-351.
(b) The statute strips the Washington apple industry of the competitive and economic advantages it has earned for itself by an expensive, stringent mandatory state inspection and grading system that exceeds federal requirements.  By requiring Washington apples to be sold under the inferior grades of their federal counterparts, the North Carolina statute offers the North Carolina apple industry the very sort of protection against out-of-state competition that the Commerce Clause was designed to prohibit.  Pp.  432 U. S. 351-352. 
Page 432 U. S. 335

(c) Even if the statute was not intended to be discriminatory and was enacted for the declared purpose of protecting consumers from deception and fraud because of the multiplicity of state grades, the statute does remarkably little to further that goal, at least with respect to Washington apples and grades, for it permits marketing of apples in closed containers under no grades at all, and does nothing to purify the flow of information at the retail level.  Moreover, Washington grades could not have led to the type of deception at which the statute was assertedly aimed, since those grades equal or surpass the comparable federal standards.  Pp.  432 U. S. 352-354.
(d) Nondiscriminatory alternatives to the outright ban of Washington State grades are readily available.  P.  432 U. S. 354.
408 F.Supp. 857, affirmed.
BURGER, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all Members joined except REHNQUIST, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

(c) Though appellee is a state agency, it is not, on that account, precluded from asserting the claims of the State's apple growers and dealers, since, for all practical purposes, appellee performs the functions of a traditional trade association.  While the apple growers are not ""members"" of appellee in the traditional trade association sense, they possess all the indicia of organization membership (viz., electing the members, being the only ones to serve on the Commission, and financing its activities), and it is of no consequence that membership assessments are mandatory.  Pp.  432 U. S. 344-345.
(d) Appellee's own interests may be adversely affected by the outcome of this litigation, since the annual assessments that are used to support its activities and which are tied to the production of Washington apples could be reduced if the market for those apples declines as a result of the North Carolina statute.  P.  432 U. S. 345.
2. The requirements of  1331 are satisfied.  Since appellee has standing to litigate its constituents' claims, it may rely on them to meet the requisite amount of $10,000 in controversy.  And it does not appear ""to a legal certainty"" that the claims of at least some of the individual growers and dealers will not come to that amount in view of the substantial annual sales volume of Washington apples in North Carolina (over $2 million) and the continuing nature of the statute's interference with the Washington apple industry, coupled with the evidence in the record that growers and dealers have suffered and will continue to suffer losses of various types from the operation of the challenged statute.  St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U. S. 283.  Pp.  432 U. S. 346-348.
3. The North Carolina statute violates the Commerce Clause by burdening and discriminating against the interstate sale of Washington apples.  Pp.  432 U. S. 348-354.
(a) The statute raises the costs of doing business in the North Carolina market for Washington growers and dealers while leaving unaffected their North Carolina counterparts, who were still free to market apples under the federal grade or none at all.  Pp.  432 U. S. 350-351.
(b) The statute strips the Washington apple industry of the competitive and economic advantages it has earned for itself by an expensive, stringent mandatory state inspection and grading system that exceeds federal requirements.  By requiring Washington apples to be sold under the inferior grades of their federal counterparts, the North Carolina statute offers the North Carolina apple industry the very sort of protection against out-of-state competition that the Commerce Clause was designed to prohibit.  Pp.  432 U. S. 351-352. 
Page 432 U. S. 335

(c) Even if the statute was not intended to be discriminatory and was enacted for the declared purpose of protecting consumers from deception and fraud because of the multiplicity of state grades, the statute does remarkably little to further that goal, at least with respect to Washington apples and grades, for it permits marketing of apples in closed containers under no grades at all, and does nothing to purify the flow of information at the retail level.  Moreover, Washington grades could not have led to the type of deception at which the statute was assertedly aimed, since those grades equal or surpass the comparable federal standards.  Pp.  432 U. S. 352-354.
(d) Nondiscriminatory alternatives to the outright ban of Washington State grades are readily available.  P.  432 U. S. 354.

v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
No. 76-99
Argued April 20, 1977
Decided June 20, 1977
432 U.S. 355

Syllabus 
About three years after an employee of petitioner company had first complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that petitioner had discriminated against her because of her sex, and five months after conciliation efforts by the EEOC had failed, the EEOC brought this enforcement action in the District Court for the Central District of California.  The court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the enforcement action was time-barred by  706(f)(1) of the Act, since the action had not been brought within 180 days of either the formal filing of the charge with the EEOC or the effective date of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972.  Alternatively, the court held that the action was subject to and barred by the California one-year statute of limitations.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Section 706(f)(1) provides in relevant part:
""If a charge filed with the Commission . . . is dismissed by the Commission, or within one hundred and eighty days from the filing of such charge or the expiration of any period of reference [from a state agency], whichever is later, the Commission has not filed a civil action under this section . . or the Commission has not entered into a conciliation agreement to which the person aggrieved is a party, the Commission . . . shall so notify the person aggrieved and within ninety days after the giving of such notice a civil action may be brought against the respondent named in the charge (A) by the person claiming to be aggrieved or (B) if such charge was filed by a member of the Commission, by any person whom the charge alleges was aggrieved by the alleged unlawful employment practice.""
Held:
1. Section 706(f)(1) imposes no limitation upon the EEOC's power to file suit in federal court.  The provision's language and legislative history show that it was intended to enable an aggrieved person unwilling to await the conclusion of extended EEOC proceedings to institute a private lawsuit 180 days after a charge has been filed.  Pp.  432 U. S. 358-366. 
Page 432 U. S. 356

2. EEOC enforcement actions are not subject to state statutes of limitations.  Pp.  432 U. S. 366-372.
(a) Though a congressional intent to apply a local limitations period has been inferred in instances where a federal statute creating a cause of action fails to specify such a period, state limitations periods will not be borrowed if their application would not comport with the federal statute's underlying policies.  P.  432 U. S. 367.
(b) Under the procedural structure created by amendments to the Act in 1972, when EEOC was created and given enforcement powers in lieu of the previous voluntary compliance scheme, EEC does not function as a vehicle for conducting litigation on behalf of private parties but is charged with investigating employment discrimination claims and settling them by informal conciliation if possible, and it is required to refrain from suing until it has discharged its administrative responsibilities.  Application of a State's limitation period would not thus further the federal policy, and the one-year California bar applied by the District Court could under some circumstances conflict with that policy.  Pp.  432 U. S. 367-369.
(c) Congress was well aware of the enormous backlog of EEOC cases, but the concern expressed for the fair operation of the Act focused on the filing of the initial charge with the EEOC, rather than on later limitations on EEOC's power to sue.  Pp.  432 U. S. 369-372.
3. The courts do not lack discretionary remedial power if, despite procedural protections accorded a Title VII defendant under the Act, EEOC delay in bringing suit, after conciliation efforts have failed, significantly handicaps the defense.

No. 76-545
Argued March 29, 1977
Decided June 20, 1977
432 U.S. 385

Syllabus 
Claiming that petitioner United Airlines had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by requiring stewardesses, though not stewards, to remain unmarried as an employment condition, one Romasanta, a stewardess who had been discharged by petitioner because of her marriage, brought this Title VII suit as a class action on behalf of herself and all other United stewardesses discharged because of the no-marriage rule.  The District Court ruled that only those stewardesses who, upon discharge because of marriage, had filed charges under either a fair employment statute or United's collective bargaining agreement constituted the class, and because that class was too small to satisfy the numerosity requirement of Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(a)(1), the court granted United's motion to strike the complaint's class allegations, but allowed 12 married stewardesses who had protested their discharge to intervene as additional parties plaintiff.  The District Court certified for appeal its order striking the class allegations, but the Court of Appeals declined to accept the interlocutory appeal.  The litigation proceeded as a joint suit on behalf of the original and intervening plaintiffs, and the District Court ultimately determined that the plaintiffs were entitled to reinstatement and backpay and, following agreement by the parties on the amounts to be awarded each plaintiff, the court entered a judgment of dismissal.  After learning of the Romasanta           judgment and that, despite their earlier attempt to do so, the plaintiffs in that case did not plan to appeal the order denying class certification, respondent, a former United stewardess who had been discharged on account of the no-marriage rule and was thus a putative member of the Romasanta class and who had not filed charges or a grievance, filed, 18 days after the judgment (and therefore within the applicable appeal period) a motion to intervene for the purpose of appealing the adverse class determination order.  The District Court denied intervention, from which denial as well as the denial of class certification respondent appealed.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the intervention denial as well as on the refusal to certify the class described in Romasanta's complaint -- a class consisting of all United stewardesses discharged 
Page 432 U. S. 386
 because of the no-marriage rule, whether or not they had formally protested their discharge.  Petitioner challenges the Court of Appeals' ruling that respondent's post-judgment intervention was timely under this Court's ruling in American Pipe & Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538, which held that
""the commencement of the original class suit tolls the running of the statute [of limitations] for all purported members of the class who make timely motions to intervene after the court has found the suit inappropriate for class action status.""
Petitioner argues that, under American Pipe, the relevant statute of limitations began to run after the denial of certification in Romasanta.
Held:  Respondent's motion to intervene was ""timely"" filed under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 24, and should have been granted.  Respondent sought to intervene not to litigate her individual claim based on the illegality of United's no-marriage rule (which would have put her in the same position as the American Pipe intervenors), but to obtain appellate review of the District Court's denial of the class action status in Romasanta.  The critical question is whether respondent as intervenor acted promptly after entry of the final judgment in Romasanta.  The District Court's refusal to certify the class was subject to appellate review after final judgment, and since the named plaintiffs had tried to take an interlocutory appeal, respondent had no reason to suppose that they would not later take an appeal until she was advised to the contrary after the trial court had entered its final judgment.  Thus, as soon as it became clear that the interests of the unnamed class members would no longer be protected by the named class representatives, and within the applicable appeal period, respondent moved to protect those interests.  Pp.  432 U. S. 391-396.

The provision of  4(b) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that a determination of the Attorney General or Director of the Census that a State is covered by the Act ""shall not be reviewable in any court"" held absolutely to preclude judicial review of such a determination.  Hence the District Court and Court of Appeals erred in holding that they had jurisdiction to review petitioners' claims that the Attorney General and Director of the Census (respondents) had erroneously applied  4(b) in determining that Texas is covered by the 1975 amendments to the Act extending its protections to language minorities, such as Mexican-Americans.

Syllabus 
Section 407(a) of the Social Security Act delegates to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare the power to prescribe ""standards"" for determining what constitutes ""unemployment"" for purposes of eligibility for benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Unemployed Fathers (AFDC-UF) program.  Pursuant to  407(a), the Secretary promulgated a regulation authorizing participating States, within their discretion, to exclude from the definition of an unemployed father one
""whose unemployment results from participation in a labor dispute or who is unemployed by reason of conduct or circumstances which result or would result in disqualification for unemployment compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law.""
In class actions on behalf of families who were denied AFDC-UF benefits under a state rule because the fathers' unemployment resulted from discharges for misconduct, involvement in a strike, or voluntarily quitting their jobs, the courts below held the federal regulation invalid as exceeding the Secretary's statutory authority.
Held:  The regulation is a proper exercise of the Secretary's statutory authority, and is reasonable.  Pp.  432 U. S. 424-432.
(a) Since the statute expressly delegated to the Secretary the power to prescribe standards for determining what constitutes ""unemployment"" for purposes of AFDC-UF eligibility, a reviewing court is not free to set aside the regulation simply because it would have interpreted the statute in a different manner from the Secretary, but only if the Secretary exceeded his statutory authority or the regulation is ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.""  Pp.  432 U. S. 424-426.
(b) By allowing the States to exclude persons who would be disqualified under the State's unemployment compensation law, the Secretary has incorporated a well known and widely applied standard for ""unemployment,"" and exclusion of individuals who are out of work as a result of their own conduct, and thus disqualified from state unemployment compensation is consistent with the goal of 
Page 432 U. S. 417
 AFDC-UF, namely, to aid the families of the involuntarily unemployed.  Pp.  432 U. S. 426-429.
(c) The power to prescribe ""standards"" for determining what constitutes ""unemployment"" gives the Secretary sufficient flexibility to recognize local options in determining AFDC-UF eligibility, including the option of denying unemployment compensation benefits to participants in a labor dispute.  While the congressional purpose was to promote greater uniformity in the application of the AFDC-UF program, such goal can be met without imposing identical standards on each State, and hence the Secretary's approach does not defeat the statute's purpose.

(a) Since the statute expressly delegated to the Secretary the power to prescribe standards for determining what constitutes ""unemployment"" for purposes of AFDC-UF eligibility, a reviewing court is not free to set aside the regulation simply because it would have interpreted the statute in a different manner from the Secretary, but only if the Secretary exceeded his statutory authority or the regulation is ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.""  Pp.  432 U. S. 424-426.
(b) By allowing the States to exclude persons who would be disqualified under the State's unemployment compensation law, the Secretary has incorporated a well known and widely applied standard for ""unemployment,"" and exclusion of individuals who are out of work as a result of their own conduct, and thus disqualified from state unemployment compensation is consistent with the goal of 
Page 432 U. S. 417
 AFDC-UF, namely, to aid the families of the involuntarily unemployed.  Pp.  432 U. S. 426-429.
(c) The power to prescribe ""standards"" for determining what constitutes ""unemployment"" gives the Secretary sufficient flexibility to recognize local options in determining AFDC-UF eligibility, including the option of denying unemployment compensation benefits to participants in a labor dispute.  While the congressional purpose was to promote greater uniformity in the application of the AFDC-UF program, such goal can be met without imposing identical standards on each State, and hence the Secretary's approach does not defeat the statute's purpose.  Pp.  432 U. S. 429-432.

Syllabus 
Title XIX of the Social Security Act establishes a Medical Assistance (Medicaid) program, under which participating States financially assist qualified individuals in five general categories of medical treatment, state plans being required to establish ""reasonable standards . . . for determining . . . the extent of medical assistance under the plan which are consistent with"" Title XIX's objectives.  Respondents, who are eligible for medical assistance under Pennsylvania's Medicaid plan and who were denied financial assistance for desired nontherapeutic abortions pursuant to state regulations limiting such assistance to abortions certified by physicians as medically necessary, brought this action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, contending that the certification requirement contravened Title XIX and denied them equal protection of the laws.  A three-judge District Court decided the statutory issue against respondents, but the constitutional issue partially in their favor.  The Court of Appeals, not reaching the constitutional question, reversed on the statutory issue, holding that Title XIX prohibits participating States from requiring a medical necessity certificate as a funding condition during the first two trimesters of pregnancy.
Held:
1. Title XIX of the Social Security Act does not require the funding of nontherapeutic abortions as a condition of participation in the Medicaid program established by that Act.  Pp.  432 U. S. 443-447.
(a) Nothing in the language of Title XIX requires a participating State to fund every medical procedure falling within the delineated categories of medical care.  Each State is given broad discretion to determine the extent of medical assistance that is ""reasonable"" and ""consistent with the objectives"" of Title XIX.  Pp.  432 U. S. 443-444.
(b) Although serious statutory questions might be presented if state Medicaid plans did not cover necessary medical treatment, it is not inconsistent with the Act's goals to refuse to fund unnecessary (though perhaps desirable) medical services.  Pp.  432 U. S. 444-445.
(c) The State has a strong interest in encouraging normal childbirth 
Page 432 U. S. 439
 that exists throughout the course of a woman's pregnancy, and nothing in Title XIX suggests that it is unreasonable for a State to further that interest.  It therefore will not be presumed that Congress intended to condition a State's participation in Medicaid on its willingness to undercut that interest by subsidizing the costs of nontherapeutic abortions.  Pp.  432 U. S. 445-446.
(d) When Congress passed Title XIX, nontherapeutic abortions were unlawful in most States, a fact that undermines the contention that Congress intended to require -- rather than permit -- participating States to fund such abortions.  Moreover, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the agency that administers Title XIX, takes the position that the Title allows, but does not mandate, funding for such abortions.  P.  432 U. S. 447.
2. Whether or not that aspect of Pennsylvania's program under which financial assistance is not provided for medically necessary abortions unless two physicians in addition to the attending physician have examined the patient and have concurred in writing as to the medical necessity of the abortion interferes with the attending physician's medical judgment in a manner not contemplated by Congress should be considered on remand.

Decided June 20, 1977
432 U.S. 464

Syllabus 
Appellees, two indigent women who were unable to obtain a physician's certificate of medical necessity, brought this action attacking the validity of a Connecticut Welfare Department regulation that limits state Medicaid benefits for first trimester abortions to those that are ""medically necessary.""  A three-judge District Court held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the exclusion of nontherapeutic abortions from a state welfare program that generally subsidizes the medical expenses incident to pregnancy and childbirth.  The court found implicit in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179, the view that ""abortion and childbirth . . . are simply two alternative medical methods of dealing with pregnancy. . . .""
Held:
1. The Equal Protection Clause does not require a State participating in the Medicaid program to pay the expenses incident to nontherapeutic abortions for indigent women simply because it has made a policy choice to pay expenses incident to childbirth.  Pp.  432 U. S. 469-480.
(a) Financial need alone does not identify a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis.  See San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1,  411 U. S. 29; Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471.  Pp.  432 U. S. 470-471.
(b) The Connecticut regulation does not impinge upon the fundamental right of privacy recognized in Roe, supra, that protects a woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.  That right implies no limitation on a State's authority to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion and to implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds.  An indigent woman desiring an abortion is not disadvantaged by Connecticut's decision to fund childbirth; she continues as before to be dependent on private abortion services.  Pp.  432 U. S. 471-474.
(c) A State is not required to show a compelling interest for its policy choice to favor normal childbirth.  Pp.  432 U. S. 475-477.
(d) Connecticut's regulation is rationally related to and furthers its ""strong and legitimate interest in encouraging normal childbirth,"" 
Page 432 U. S. 465
 Beal v. Doe, ante at  432 U. S. 446.  The subsidizing of costs incident to childbirth is a rational means of encouraging childbirth.  States, moreover, have a wide latitude in choosing among competing demands for limited public funds.  Pp.  432 U. S. 478-480.
2. Since it is not unreasonable for a State to insist upon a prior showing of medical necessity to insure that its money is being spent only for authorized purposes, the District Court erred in invalidating the requirements of prior written request by the pregnant woman and prior authorization by the Department of Social Services for abortions.  Although similar requirements are not imposed for other medical procedures, such procedures do not involve the termination of a potential human life.  P.  432 U. S. 480.

Syllabus 
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 establishes two alternative methods by which States subject to the Act can obtain federal preclearance review of a change in their voting laws:  (1) the State may file a declaratory judgment action in the District Court for the District of Columbia and subsequently may implement such change if that court declares that the change has no racially discriminatory purpose or effect; or (2) the State may submit the change to the Attorney General and subsequently may enforce the change if the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within 60 days.  A plan reapportioning the South Carolina Senate, enacted into law on May 6, 1972, and filed with the District Court for the District of South Carolina, which had invalidated a previous plan in a consolidated action challenging its constitutionality, was submitted to the Attorney General on May 12 for preclearance review under  5.  On May 23, the District Court found the new plan constitutional, and on June 30, the Attorney General notified South Carolina that he would interpose no objection, but would defer to the court's determination.  Thereafter, another suit was brought in the District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the Attorney General's failure to object to the new plan, and, in response to that court's order of May 16, 1973, to make a reasoned determination as to the constitutionality of the new plan, the Attorney General stated that, in his view, it was unconstitutional, but that he still refused to interpose an objection in deference to the ruling of the District Court for the District of South Carolina.  However, on July 19, 1973, the District Court for the District of Columbia directed the Attorney General to consider the new plan without regard to the other District Court's decision, and, the next day, the Attorney General interposed an objection to the plan.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, holding that the Attorney General's initial failure to interpose an objection was reviewable, and that  5 required him to make an independent determination on the merits of the  5 issues.  The present suit was then filed by appellant South Carolina voters in the District Court for the District of South Carolina, seeking to enjoin implementation 
Page 432 U. S. 492
 of the new plan on the ground that the Attorney General had interposed an objection and the State had not subsequently obtained a favorable declaratory judgment from the District Court for the District of Columbia.  A three-judge court dismissed the complaint, holding that the collateral estoppel doctrine did not preclude it from considering the State's contention that, notwithstanding the Court of Appeals' decision in the previous action, the requirements of  5 were satisfied when the Attorney General failed to interpose an objection within 60 days after submission of the new plan to him, and that the Administrative Procedure Act did not authorize judicial review of the Attorney General's initial determination to defer to the ruling that the new plan was constitutional, and that therefore the Attorney General's failure to interpose a timely objection left South Carolina free to implement the new plan.
Held:  The objection interposed by the Attorney General to the new plan on July 20, 1973, nunc pro tunc, is invalid, and therefore South Carolina is free to implement such plan.  Pp.  432 U. S. 499-507.
(a) The nature of the  5 remedy, which has been characterized as an ""unusual"" and ""severe"" procedure, strongly suggests that Congress did not intend the Attorney General's actions under that provision to be subject to judicial review.  Unlike the first alternative method of obtaining a declaratory judgment,  5 does not condition implementation of changes in voting laws under the second method of compliance on an affirmative statement by the Attorney General that the change is without racially discriminatory purpose or effect, but, to the contrary, compliance with  5 under this second method is measured solely by the absence, for whatever reason, of a timely objection on the Attorney General's part.  Pp.  432 U. S. 501-503.
(b) In light of the potential severity of the  5 remedy, the statutory language, and the legislative history, it is clear that Congress intended to provide covered jurisdictions with an expeditious alternative to declaratory judgment actions by providing submission to the Attorney General as such an alternative.  Since judicial review of the Attorney General's action would unavoidably extend the period specified in the statute, it is necessarily precluded.  Pp.  432 U. S. 504-505.
(c) Where the discriminatory character of an enactment is not detected upon review by the Attorney General, it can be challenged in traditional constitutional litigation, but it cannot be questioned in a suit seeking judicial review of the Attorney General's exercise of discretion under  5, or his failure to object within the statutory period.  Pp.  432 U. S. 505-507.
425 F.Supp. 331, affirmed.

 of the new plan on the ground that the Attorney General had interposed an objection and the State had not subsequently obtained a favorable declaratory judgment from the District Court for the District of Columbia.  A three-judge court dismissed the complaint, holding that the collateral estoppel doctrine did not preclude it from considering the State's contention that, notwithstanding the Court of Appeals' decision in the previous action, the requirements of  5 were satisfied when the Attorney General failed to interpose an objection within 60 days after submission of the new plan to him, and that the Administrative Procedure Act did not authorize judicial review of the Attorney General's initial determination to defer to the ruling that the new plan was constitutional, and that therefore the Attorney General's failure to interpose a timely objection left South Carolina free to implement the new plan.
Held:  The objection interposed by the Attorney General to the new plan on July 20, 1973, nunc pro tunc, is invalid, and therefore South Carolina is free to implement such plan.  Pp.  432 U. S. 499-507.
(a) The nature of the  5 remedy, which has been characterized as an ""unusual"" and ""severe"" procedure, strongly suggests that Congress did not intend the Attorney General's actions under that provision to be subject to judicial review.  Unlike the first alternative method of obtaining a declaratory judgment,  5 does not condition implementation of changes in voting laws under the second method of compliance on an affirmative statement by the Attorney General that the change is without racially discriminatory purpose or effect, but, to the contrary, compliance with  5 under this second method is measured solely by the absence, for whatever reason, of a timely objection on the Attorney General's part.  Pp.  432 U. S. 501-503.
(b) In light of the potential severity of the  5 remedy, the statutory language, and the legislative history, it is clear that Congress intended to provide covered jurisdictions with an expeditious alternative to declaratory judgment actions by providing submission to the Attorney General as such an alternative.  Since judicial review of the Attorney General's action would unavoidably extend the period specified in the statute, it is necessarily precluded.  Pp.  432 U. S. 504-505.
(c) Where the discriminatory character of an enactment is not detected upon review by the Attorney General, it can be challenged in traditional constitutional litigation, but it cannot be questioned in a suit seeking judicial review of the Attorney General's exercise of discretion under  5, or his failure to object within the statutory period.  Pp.  432 U. S. 505-507.
425 F.Supp. 331, affirmed.

Decided June 17, 1977
432 U.S. 233

Syllabus 
Prior to the decision in Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, petitioner was convicted in a North Carolina court of second-degree murder over his claim that he acted in self-defense.  The trial judge had instructed the jury that, if the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner intentionally killed the victim with a deadly weapon the law raised presumptions that the killing was unlawful and that it was done with malice, and that, in order to excuse his act, petitioner had to prove to the jury's ""satisfaction"" that he acted in self-defense.  The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed over petitioner's objection to such instructions, refusing to give retroactive application to Mullaney.  Although holding that a burden to ""satisfy"" a jury of a fact is not ""significantly less"" than persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence, and that therefore the charge was erroneous under Mullaney, which required the State to establish all elements of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt and which invalidated presumptions that shifted the burden of proving such elements to the defendant, the court concluded that the retroactive application of Mullaney would have a devastating impact on the administration of justice.
Held:
1. The North Carolina Supreme Court erred in declining to hold the Mullaney rule retroactive.  Ivan v. v. City of New York, 407 U. S. 203.  While, in deciding whether a new constitutional rule is to be applied retroactively, it is proper to consider the State's reliance on the old rule and the impact of the new rule on the administration of justice if the degree to which the new rule enhances the integrity of the factfinding process is sufficiently small,
""'where the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truthfinding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule [is] given complete retroactive effect.'""
Id. at  407 U. S. 204 (emphasis supplied).  The Mullaney rule falls within this latter category, since it was designed to diminish the probability that an innocent person would be convicted and thus to overcome an aspect of a criminal trial that ""substantially impairs its truthfinding function.""  Pp.  432 U. S. 240-244.
2. Nor can the North Carolina Supreme Court's judgment be affirmed on the ground that, even if Mullaney is applied retroactively, the trial 
Page 432 U. S. 234
 court's instructions left the burden of disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt on the prosecution, or at least did not require the accused to prove self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence, and thus did not violate the Mullaney rule.  The North Carolina Supreme Court construed the instructions to the contrary, and since such interpretation is a matter of state law, there is no basis for disagreeing with it.  Pp.  432 U.

432 U.S. 249

Syllabus 
In 1972 Congress amended the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (Act) to extend coverage to additional workers in an attempt to avoid anomalies inherent in a system that drew lines at the water's edge by allowing compensation under the Act only to workers injured on the seaward side of a pier.  The relevant sections, as so amended, broadened the definition of ""navigable waters of the United States"" as the required situs of a compensable injury to include
""any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel,""
33 U.S.C.  903(a) (1970 ed., Supp. V), and also modified the definition of a covered ""employee"" to mean
""any person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harborworker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and shipbreaker,""
33 U.S.C.  902(3) (1970 ed., Supp. V).  Respondent Blundo, whose job as a ""checker"" at a pier for petitioner International Terminal Operating Co. was to check and mark cargo being unloaded from a vessel or from a container (a large metal box resembling a truck trailer without wheels) which had been taken off a vessel, was injured when, while marking cargo ""stripped"" (unloaded) from a container, he slipped on some ice on the pier.  Respondent Caputo, who, though a member of a regular stevedoring ""gang"" for another company, had been temporarily hired by petitioner Northeast Marine Terminal Co. as a terminal laborer at a pier to load and unload containers, barges, and trucks, was injured while rolling a dolly loaded with ship's cargo into a consignee's truck.  Compensation awards to both respondents under the Act, as amended, were upheld by the Court of Appeals.
Held:
1. Both respondents satisfied the ""status"" test of eligibility for compensation, since they were both ""engaged in maritime employment"" and 
Page 432 U. S. 250
 were therefore ""employees"" within the meaning of  902(3) at the time of their injuries.  Pp.  432 U. S. 265-279.
(a) Congress' intent to adapt the Act to modern cargo-handling techniques, such as containerization, which have moved much of the longshoreman's work off the vessel and onto land, clearly indicates that such tasks as stripping a container are included in the category of ""longshoring operations"" under  902(3), and hence it is apparent that respondent Blundo, whose task was an integral part of the unloading process as altered by the advent of containers, was a statutory ""employee"" when he slipped on the ice.  Pp.  432 U. S. 269-271.
(b) Both the text of the 1972 amendments to the Act, which focuses primarily on occupations (longshoreman, harbor worker, etc.), and their legislative history, which shows that Congress wanted a system that did not depend on the fortuitous circumstance of whether the injury occurred on land or over water, demonstrate that Congress intended to provide continuous coverage to amphibious workers such as longshoremen, who, without the amendments, would be covered for only part of their activity, and that therefore the amendments were meant to cover such a person as respondent Caputo, who as a member of a regular stevedoring gang worked either on the pier or on the ship, and who, on the day of his injury in his job as a terminal laborer, could have been assigned to a number of tasks, including stripping containers, unloading barges, and loading trucks.  Pp.  432 U. S. 271-274.
(c) Respondents' coverage as ""employees"" under the Act cannot be defeated by the so-called ""point of rest"" theory, whereby longshoremen's ""maritime employment"" would be considered, in the case of unloading, to be taking cargo out of a vessel's hold, moving it away from the ship's side, and carrying it to its point of rest on a pier or in a terminal shed, since that theory appears nowhere in the Act, was never mentioned by Congress during the legislative process, does not comport with Congress' intent, and restricts coverage of a remedial Act designed to extend coverage.

Syllabus 
The Florida death penalty statute, which was upheld in Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242, requires, upon the conviction of a capital felon, a separate sentencing hearing before the trial judge and jury, at which certain evidence relating to aggravating or mitigating circumstances must be admitted.  The jury, based on such circumstances, then renders an advisory decision, not binding on the judge, who must then also weigh the circumstances, and, if he imposes a death sentence, he must set forth written findings of fact.  The judgment of conviction and death sentence are thereafter subject to an automatic priority review by the Florida Supreme Court.  Petitioner was convicted in a Florida court of, inter alia, first-degree murder of one of his children.  Pursuant to the above statute, the jury, after the required sentencing hearing, recommended a life sentence, but the judge overruled that recommendation and sentenced petitioner to death.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed.  Petitioner makes three claims based on the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws:  (1) the change in the role of the judge and jury in imposing the death sentence, in that, under the statute in effect at the time of the murder, a recommendation of mercy by the jury was not reviewable by the judge, constituted an ex post facto violation because the change deprived him of a substantial right to have the jury determine, without review by the trial judge, whether the death penalty should be imposed; (2) there was no death penalty ""in effect"" in Florida at the time of the murder, because the earlier statute in effect at such time was later held invalid by the Florida Supreme Court under Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238; and (3) the current statute (the one under which he was sentenced) requires anyone sentenced to life imprisonment to serve at least 25 years before becoming eligible for parole, whereas the prior statute contained no such limitation.  Petitioner also makes a related claim that, since, after Furman and its own decision invalidating the prior death penalty statute, the Florida Supreme Court resentenced to life imprisonment all prisoners then under death sentences pursuant to the old statute, and since his crimes were committed prior to Furman, the imposition of the death sentence upon him pursuant to the new statute denied 
Page 432 U. S. 283
 him equal protection of the laws.  He further claims that pretrial publicity concerning his crimes deprived him of his right to a fair trial.
Held:
1. The changes in the death penalty statute between the time of the murder and the time of the trial are procedural, and, on the whole, ameliorative, and hence there is no ex post facto violation.  Pp.  432 U. S. 293-297.
(a) The new statute simply altered the methods employed in determining whether the death penalty was to be imposed, and there was no change in the quantum of punishment attached to the crime.  Pp.  432 U. S. 293-294.
(b) The new statute provides capital defendants with more, rather than less, judicial protection than the old statute.  Death is not automatic, absent a jury recommendation of mercy, as it was under the old statute; a jury recommendation of life may be overridden by the trial judge only under exacting standards, but, unlike the old statute, a jury recommendation of death is not binding.  Defendants have a second chance for life with the trial judge, and a third, if necessary, with the Florida Supreme Court.  Pp.  432 U. S. 294-297.
2. The existence of the earlier statute at the time of the murder served as an ""operative fact"" to warn petitioner of the penalty which Florida would seek to impose on him if he were convicted of first-degree murder, and this was sufficient compliance with the ex post facto provision of the Constitution, notwithstanding the subsequent invalidation of the statute.  Pp.  432 U. S. 297-298.
3. Petitioner, having been sentenced to death, may not complain of burdens attached to a life sentence under the new statute which may not have attached to the old.  Pp.  432 U. S. 298-301.
4. The imposition of the death sentence upon petitioner pursuant to the new statute did not deny him equal protection of the laws.  Having been neither tried nor sentenced prior to Furman, he was not similarly situated to those whose death sentences were commuted, and it was not irrational for Florida to relegate him to the class of those prisoners whose acts could properly be punished under the new statute that was in effect at the time of his trial and sentence.  P.  432 U. S. 301.
5. Absent anything in the record, in particular with respect to the voir dire examination of the jurors, that would require a finding of constitutional unfairness as to the method of jury selection or as to the character of the jurors actually selected, petitioner has failed to show that, under the ""totality of circumstances,"" extensive pretrial news media coverage of his case denied him a fair trial.

No. 76-5306
Argued March 28, 1977
Decided June 17, 1977
432 U.S. 282

Syllabus 
The Florida death penalty statute, which was upheld in Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242, requires, upon the conviction of a capital felon, a separate sentencing hearing before the trial judge and jury, at which certain evidence relating to aggravating or mitigating circumstances must be admitted.  The jury, based on such circumstances, then renders an advisory decision, not binding on the judge, who must then also weigh the circumstances, and, if he imposes a death sentence, he must set forth written findings of fact.  The judgment of conviction and death sentence are thereafter subject to an automatic priority review by the Florida Supreme Court.  Petitioner was convicted in a Florida court of, inter alia, first-degree murder of one of his children.  Pursuant to the above statute, the jury, after the required sentencing hearing, recommended a life sentence, but the judge overruled that recommendation and sentenced petitioner to death.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed.  Petitioner makes three claims based on the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws:  (1) the change in the role of the judge and jury in imposing the death sentence, in that, under the statute in effect at the time of the murder, a recommendation of mercy by the jury was not reviewable by the judge, constituted an ex post facto violation because the change deprived him of a substantial right to have the jury determine, without review by the trial judge, whether the death penalty should be imposed; (2) there was no death penalty ""in effect"" in Florida at the time of the murder, because the earlier statute in effect at such time was later held invalid by the Florida Supreme Court under Furman v.

Title 12 U.S.C.  91, which prohibits an ""attachment, injunction, or execution"" from being issued against a national bank or its property before final judgment in any state or local court, held, when read in context, merely to prevent prejudgment seizure of bank property by creditors, and not to apply to a mortgagor debtor's action seeking a preliminary injunction to protect its real property from wrongful foreclosure.

|432 u.s. 63|"Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison
No. 75-1126
Argued March 30, 1977
Decided June 16, 1977*
432 U.S. 63

Syllabus 
Respondent Hardison (hereafter respondent) was employed by Trans World Airlines (TWA), petitioner in No. 75-1126, in a department that operated 24 hours a day throughout the year in connection with an airplane maintenance and overhaul base.  Respondent was subject to a seniority system in a collective bargaining agreement between TWA and the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (union), petitioner in No. 75-1385, whereby the most senior employees have first choice for job and shift assignments as they become available, and the most junior employees are required to work when enough employees to work at a particular time or in a particular job to fill TWA's needs cannot be found.  Because respondent's religious beliefs prohibit him from working on Saturdays, attempts were made to accommodate him, and these were temporarily successful mainly because, on his job at the time, he had sufficient seniority regularly to observe Saturday as his Sabbath.  But when he sought, and was transferred to, another job where he was asked to work Saturdays and where he had low seniority, problems began to arise.  TWA agreed to permit the union to seek a change of work assignments, but the union was not willing to violate the seniority system, and respondent had insufficient seniority to bid for a shift having Saturdays off.  After TWA rejected a proposal that respondent work only four days a week on the ground that this would impair critical function in the airline operations, no accommodation could be reached, and respondent was discharged for refusing to work on Saturdays.  Then, having first invoked the administrative remedy provided by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, respondent brought an action for injunctive relief against TWA and the union, claiming that his discharge constituted religious discrimination in violation of  703(a)(1) of the Act, which makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the basis of his religion.  He also made certain other charges against the union.  His claim of religious discrimination was based on 
Page 432 U. S. 64
 the 1967 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines in effect at the time requiring an employer, short of ""undue hardship,"" to make ""reasonable accommodations"" to the religious needs of its employees, and on similar language in the 1972 amendments to Title VII.  The District Court ruled in favor of both TWA and the union, holding that the union's duty to accommodate respondent's religious beliefs did not require it to ignore the seniority system, and that TWA had satisfied its ""reasonable accommodations"" obligation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment for the union but reversed the judgment for TWA, holding that TWA had not satisfied its duty to accommodate respondent's religious needs under the EEOC guidelines.  The court took the view that TWA had rejected three reasonable alternatives, any one of which would have satisfied its obligation without undue hardship:  (1) within the framework of the seniority system, TWA could have permitted respondent to work a four-day week, utilizing a supervisor or another worker on duty elsewhere, even though this would have caused other shop functions to suffer; (2) TWA could have filled respondent's Saturday shift from other available personnel, even though this would have involved premium overtime pay; and (3) TWA could have arranged a ""swap"" between respondent and another employee either for another shift or for the Sabbath days, even though this would have involved a breach of the seniority system.
Held:  TWA, which made reasonable efforts to accommodate respondent's religious needs, did not violate Title VII, and each of the Court of Appeals' suggested alternatives would have been an undue hardship within the meaning of the statute as construed by the EEOC guidelines.  Pp.  432 U. S. 76-85.
(a) The seniority system itself represented a significant accommodation to the needs, both religious and secular, of all of TWA's employees.  Pp.  432 U. S. 77-78.
(b) TWA itself cannot be faulted for having failed to work out a shift or job swap for respondent.  Both the union and TWA had agreed to the seniority system; the union was unwilling to entertain a variance over the objections of employees senior to respondent; and for TWA to have arranged unilaterally for a swap would have breached the collective bargaining agreement.  An agreed-upon seniority system is not required to give way to accommodate religious observances, and it would be anomalous to conclude that, by ""reasonable accommodations,"" Congress meant that an employer must deny the shift and job preferences of some employees, as well as deprive them of their contractual rights, in order to accommodate or prefer the religious needs of others.  Title VII does not require an employer to go that far.  Pp.  432 U. S. 79-81. 
Page 432 U. S. 65

(c) Under  703(h) of Title VII, absent a discriminatory purpose, the operation of a seniority system cannot be an unlawful employment practice even if the system is discriminatory in its effect.  Pp.  432 U. S. 81-82.
(d) To require TWA to bear more than a de minimis cost in order to give respondent Saturdays off would be an undue hardship, for, like abandonment of the seniority system, to require TWA to bear additional costs when no such costs are incurred to give other employees the days off that they want would involve unequal treatment of employees on the basis of their religion.  Absent clear statutory language or legislative history to the contrary, the statute, the paramount concern of which is to eliminate discrimination in employment, cannot be construed to require an employer to discriminate against some employees in order to enable others to observe their Sabbath.

No. 75-871
Argued November 29, 1976
Decided June 16, 1977
432 U.S. 98

Syllabus 
Glover, a trained Negro undercover state police officer, purchased heroin from a seller through the open doorway of an apartment while standing for two or three minutes within two feet of the seller in a hallway illuminated by natural light.  A few minutes later, Glover described the seller to another police officer as being
""a colored man, approximately five feet eleven inches tall, dark complexion, black hair, short Afro style, and having high cheekbones, and of heavy build.""
The other police officer, suspecting from the description that respondent might be the seller, left a police photograph of respondent at the office of Glover, who viewed it two days later and identified it as the picture of the seller.  In a Connecticut court, respondent was charged with, and convicted of, possession and sale of heroin, and at his trial, held some eight months after the crime, the photograph was received in evidence without objection and Glover testified that there was no doubt that the person shown in the photograph was respondent and also made a positive in-court identification without objection.  After the Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, respondent filed a petition for habeas corpus in Federal District Court, alleging that the admission of the identification testimony at his state trial deprived him of due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court dismissed the petition, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that evidence as to the photograph should have been excluded, regardless of reliability, because the examination of the single photograph was unnecessary and suggestive, and that the identification was unreliable in any event.

No. 75-871
Argued November 29, 1976
Decided June 16, 1977
432 U.S. 98

Syllabus 
Glover, a trained Negro undercover state police officer, purchased heroin from a seller through the open doorway of an apartment while standing for two or three minutes within two feet of the seller in a hallway illuminated by natural light.  A few minutes later, Glover described the seller to another police officer as being
""a colored man, approximately five feet eleven inches tall, dark complexion, black hair, short Afro style, and having high cheekbones, and of heavy build.""
The other police officer, suspecting from the description that respondent might be the seller, left a police photograph of respondent at the office of Glover, who viewed it two days later and identified it as the picture of the seller.  In a Connecticut court, respondent was charged with, and convicted of, possession and sale of heroin, and at his trial, held some eight months after the crime, the photograph was received in evidence without objection and Glover testified that there was no doubt that the person shown in the photograph was respondent and also made a positive in-court identification without objection.  After the Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, respondent filed a petition for habeas corpus in Federal District Court, alleging that the admission of the identification testimony at his state trial deprived him of due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court dismissed the petition, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that evidence as to the photograph should have been excluded, regardless of reliability, because the examination of the single photograph was unnecessary and suggestive, and that the identification was unreliable in any event.
Held:  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not compel the exclusion of the identification evidence.  Pp.  432 U. S. 109-117.

432 U.S. 137

Syllabus 
A federal grand jury returned two indictments against petitioner for offenses under 21 U.S.C.  One charged him and nine others with violating  846 by conspiring to distribute heroin and cocaine during a specified period in violation of  841(a)(1), the indictment specifying, inter alia, that the conspiracy was to be accomplished by petitioner's assumption of leadership of a certain organization, by distribution of controlled substances, and by acquisition of substantial sums of money through such distribution.  The other charged petitioner alone with violating  848, which prohibits conducting a continuing criminal enterprise to violate the drug laws, by his distributing and possessing with intent to distribute heroin and cocaine, in violation of  841(a)(1) during the same specified period, the indictment alleging that he had undertaken the distribution ""in concert"" with five or more others, with respect to whom he occupied the position of organizer and supervisor, and that, as a result of the distribution, he had obtained a substantial income.  The court denied a motion by the Government to consolidate the indictments for trial, which the petitioner and his codefendants had opposed on the grounds that neither the parties nor the charges were the same and that, based on the overt acts charged, much of the  846 evidence would not inculpate petitioner, and would therefore be inadmissible against him on the  848 charge.  Petitioner and six codefendants were first tried and found guilty on the  846 indictment, petitioner receiving the maximum sentence applicable to him of 15 years in prison, a $25,000 fine, and three-year special parole term, and the conviction was affirmed on appeal.  Petitioner then moved to dismiss the  848 indictment on the ground that in the  846 trial he had already been placed in jeopardy for the same offense and that the ""same evidence"" rule of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, barred the second prosecution since a  846 conspiracy was a lesser included offense of a  848 continuing criminal enterprise.  Following denial of petitioner's motion on the ground that the offenses were separate, petitioner was tried and found guilty of the  848 offense, and was given the maximum sentence for a first offender, viz., life imprisonment and a $100,000 fine, to run consecutively with the  846 sentence.  The Court of Appeals, 
Page 432 U. S. 138
 although concluding that  846 was a lesser included offense of  848, and that the earlier conviction would normally, under Blockburger, bar the subsequent prosecution, held that Iannelli v. United States, 420 U. S. 770, created a new double jeopardy rule applicable only to complex statutory crimes, where greater and lesser offenses could be separately punished if, as here, Congress so intended.  Petitioner challenged the Iannelli interpretation, and also contended that the Double Jeopardy Clause was violated by the prosecution on the greater offense and conviction of the lesser and that he had not waived the double jeopardy issue.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.  Pp.  432 U. S. 147-158;  432 U. S. 160.
532 F.2d 1101, affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded:
1. Petitioner's action in opposing the Government's motion to consolidate the indictments for trial deprived him of any right he might have had against consecutive trials, and the Government was therefore entitled to prosecute petitioner for the  848 offense.  This result is an exception to the rule established in Brown v. Ohio, post, p.  432 U. S. 161, that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the trial of a defendant for a greater offense after he has been convicted of a lesser included offense, being no different from other situations where a defendant enjoys protection under the Double Jeopardy Clause but, for one reason or another, may be retried.  Here petitioner, who could have been tried in one proceeding, chose not to adopt that course, and therefore was solely responsible for the separate prosecutions.  Pp.  432 U. S. 147-154.
2. It cannot be assumed that Congress intended to impose cumulative penalties under  846 and 848, and petitioner is therefore entitled to have the fine imposed at the second trial reduced so that the two fines together do not exceed $100,000.  Pp. 154-158.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE concluded that Iannelli v. United States, supra, controls this case, and therefore concurs in the judgment with respect to petitioner's conviction.  P.  432 U. S. 158.

New York statutory provision that bars certain resident aliens from state financial assistance for higher education held to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  432 U. S. 7-12.

(b) The statute discriminates against a class and is subject to strict scrutiny, since it is directed at aliens and only aliens are harmed by it even though its bar against them is not absolute in that those who have applied for citizenship or those not qualified to apply who have filed statements of intent may participate in the assistance programs.

(c) Any incentive through the statute for an alien to become naturalized is not a proper state concern, since control over immigration and naturalization is exclusively a federal function.  P  432 U. S. 10.
(d) The naturalization incentive (even if that could be accepted, arguendo, as a justification) or the further justification asserted by appellants, viz., that the financial assistance program is confined to actual or potential voters, thus enhancing the educational level of the electorate, cannot be deemed adequate to support the statute's ban.

432 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
New York statutory provision that bars certain resident aliens from state financial assistance for higher education held to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  432 U. S. 7-12.
(a) State classifications based on alienage are ""inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny.""  Graham v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 365,3 403 U. S. 72.  P.  432 U. S. 7.
(b) The statute discriminates against a class and is subject to strict scrutiny, since it is directed at aliens and only aliens are harmed by it even though its bar against them is not absolute in that those who have applied for citizenship or those not qualified to apply who have filed statements of intent may participate in the assistance programs.  Graham v. Richardson, supra; cf. Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495,  427 U. S. 504-505, n. 11.  Pp.  432 U. S. 7-9.
(c) Any incentive through the statute for an alien to become naturalized is not a proper state concern, since control over immigration and naturalization is exclusively a federal function.  P  432 U. S. 10.
(d) The naturalization incentive (even if that could be accepted, arguendo, as a justification) or the further justification asserted by appellants, viz., that the financial assistance program is confined to actual or potential voters, thus enhancing the educational level of the electorate, cannot be deemed adequate to support the statute's ban.  If the

 encouragement of naturalization through such programs were adequate, every discrimination against aliens could be similarly justified.  And the claimed interest in educating the electorate would not be frustrated by including resident aliens in the assistance program.  Pp.  432 U. S. 10-12.

Syllabus 
After the prosecutor's opening statement in petitioner's bench trial for theft in violation of the Assimilative Crimes Act and the applicable Indiana statute, petitioner's counsel moved to dismiss the information on the ground that it did not allege specific intent as required by the Indiana statute.  The court tentatively denied the motion subject to further study, whereupon petitioner's counsel outlined the defense and did not object to going forward with the trial.  At the close of the evidence, the court, though observing that petitioner's guilt had been proved beyond any reasonable doubt, granted petitioner's motion to dismiss.  Thereafter, petitioner was indicted for the same crime and convicted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's claim that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the second trial. Petitioner contends that (1) he should never have had to undergo the first trial, because the court was made aware of the defective information before jeopardy had attached, and (2) once the court had determined to hear evidence despite the defective charge, he was entitled to have the trial proceed to a formal finding of guilt or innocence.
Held:  Petitioner's retrial after dismissal of the defective information at his request did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.  432 U. S. 27-34.
(a) The proceedings against petitioner did not terminate in his favor, the dismissal clearly not being predicated on any judgment that he could never be prosecuted for or convicted of the theft.  The order entered by the District Court was functionally indistinguishable from a declaration of mistrial, which contemplates reprosecution of the defendant, see United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S. 470,  400 U. S. 476.  Thus, any distinction between dismissals and mistrials has no significance in the circumstances here presented, and established double jeopardy principles governing the permissibility of retrial after a declaration of mistrial fully apply in this case.  United States v. Jenkins, 420 U. S. 358, distinguished.  Pp.  432 U. S. 28-31.
(b) Where a defendant, by requesting a mistrial, exercises his choice in favor of terminating the trial, the Double Jeopardy Clause will not bar reprosecution absent provocative or bad-faith conduct by the judge or prosecutor.  United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600,  424 U. S. 611.  Here, as in Dinitz, the proceedings were terminated after jeopardy had attached at 
Page 432 U. S. 24
 the defendant's request and with his consent, and there was no judicial or prosecutorial error that was intended to provoke the motion or that was otherwise motivated by bad faith.  The prosecutor's failure properly to draft the information was, at most, negligent, and the District Court's failure to postpone the taking of evidence until it could fully consider petitioner's motion was entirely reasonable in light of the last-minute timing of the motion and defense counsel's failure to request a continuance or otherwise stress the importance to petitioner of not being placed in jeopardy on a defective charge.  Pp.  432 U. S. 33-34.
539 F.2d 612, affirmed.

Syllabus 
A New York statute provides that, if an officer of a political party subpoenaed by a grand jury or other authorized tribunal to testify concerning the conduct of his office refuses to testify or to waive immunity against subsequent criminal prosecution, his term of office shall terminate and he shall be disqualified from holding any other party or public office for five years.  Appellee, an attorney, was divested of his state political party offices pursuant to this statute when, in response to a subpoena, he appeared before a grand jury and refused to waive his constitutional immunity.  He then brought suit in Federal District Court, which granted him declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the statute on the ground that it violated his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.
Held:  The statute violated appellee's right to be free of compelled self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  431 U. S. 804-809.
(a) Government cannot penalize assertion of the constitutional privilege against compelled self-incrimination by imposing sanctions to compel testimony that has not been immunized.  Pp.  431 U. S. 804-806.
(b) The statute was coercive against appellee because it threatened him with loss of powerful offices and because the compelled forfeiture of those offices would diminish his general reputation in the community, would, as economic consequences, harm his professional standing as a practicing lawyer and bar him from holding any other party or public office for five years, and would impinge on his First Amendment right to participate in private, voluntary political associations.

In this litigation appellees, individual foster parents and a foster parents organization, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against New York State and New York City officials, alleging that the statutory and regulatory procedures for removal of foster children from foster homes violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Under the New York Social Services Law the authorized placement agency has discretion to remove the child from the foster home, and regulations provide for 10 days' advance notice of removal.  Objecting foster parents may request a conference with the Social Services Department where the foster parent may appear with counsel to be advised of the reasons for removal and to submit opposing reasons.  Within five days after the conference the agency official must render a written decision and send notice to the foster parent and agency.  If the child is removed after the conference the foster parent may appeal to the Department of Social Services, where a full adversary administrative hearing takes place, and the resultant determination is subject to judicial review.  Removal is not stayed pending the hearing and judicial review. New York City provides additional procedures (SSC Procedure No. 5) to the foregoing statewide scheme, under which, in lieu of or in addition to the conference, the foster parents are entitled to a full trial-type pre-removal hearing if the child is being transferred to another foster home.  An additional statewide procedure is provided by N.Y.Soc.Serv.Law  392 whereby a foster parent may obtain pre-removal judicial review of an agency 
Page 431 U. S. 817
 decision to remove a child who has been in foster care for 18 months or more.  The District Court held that the State's pre-removal procedures are constitutionally defective, and that,
""before a, foster child can be peremptorily transferred . . . to another foster home or to the natural parents . . .  The is entitled to [an administrative] hearing at which all concerned parties may present any relevant information. . . .""
Such a hearing would be held automatically, and before an officer free from contact with the removal decision who could order that the child remain with the foster parents.  Appellees contended that, when a child has lived in a foster home for a year or more, a psychological tie is created between the child and the foster parents that constitutes the foster family the child's ""psychological family,"" giving the family a ""liberty interest"" in its survival as a unit that is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court, avoiding the ""novel"" question of whether the foster home is entitled to the same constitutional deference as the biological family, held that the foster child had an independent right to be heard before being condemned to suffer ""grievous loss.""
Held:
1. The District Court erred in finding that the ""grievous loss"" to the foster child resulting from an improvident removal decision implicated the due process guarantee, as the determining factor is the nature of the interest involved, rather than its weight.  Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215,  427 U. S. 224; Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564,  408 U. S. 570-571.  Pp.  431 U. S. 840-841.
2. The challenged procedures are constitutionally adequate even were it to be assumed that appellees have a protected ""liberty interest"" under the Fourteenth Amendment.  The procedures employed by the State and New York City satisfy the standards for determining the sufficiency of procedural protections, taking into consideration the factors enumerated in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319,  424 U. S. 335:  (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) the government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.

(b) There is nothing in either the language or legislative history of the statute repealing the RRB and VRB system and establishing a new bonus system to show any intention on the part of Congress to affect the rights of those service members who had extended their enlistments and became entitled to receive VRB's.

Syllabus 
Petitioners and others were charged in a single-count indictment with conspiracy and an attempt to obstruct interstate commerce by means of extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act.  Petitioners challenged the indictment as duplicitous, contending that its single count improperly charged both a conspiracy and an attempt to violate the Hobbs Act.  The District Court refused to dismiss the indictment but required the prosecution to prove all the elements of both offenses charged in the indictment, and instructed the jury to that effect.  The jury returned a guilty verdict against each petitioner.  The Court of Appeals reversed and ordered a new trial on certain evidentiary grounds, at the same time directing the Government to elect between the conspiracy and attempt charges on remand.  After the Government elected to proceed on the conspiracy charge, petitioners moved to dismiss the indictment on grounds that the retrial would expose them to double jeopardy and that the indictment, as modified by the election, failed to charge an offense.  The District Court denied the motion, and petitioners immediately appealed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but did not address the Government's argument that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal since the denial of petitioners' motion to dismiss the indictment was not a ""final decision"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1291, which grants courts of appeals jurisdiction to review ""all final decisions"" of the district courts, both civil and criminal.
Held:
1. The District Court's pretrial order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds was a ""final decision"" within the meaning of  1291, and thus was immediately appealable.  Pp.  431 U. S. 656-662.
(a) Although lacking the finality traditionally considered indispensable to appellate review, such an order falls within the ""collateral order"" exception to the final judgment rule announced in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, since it constitutes a complete, formal, and, in the trial court, final rejection of an accused's double jeopardy claim, the very nature of which is such that it is collateral to, and separable from, the principal issue of whether or not the accused is guilty of the offense charged.  Pp.  431 U. S. 657-660. 
Page 431 U. S. 652

(b) Moreover, the rights conferred on an accused by the Double Jeopardy Clause would be significantly undermined if appellate review of double jeopardy claims were postponed until after conviction and sentence, since that Clause not only protects an individual against being subjected to double punishments, but also is a guarantee against being twice put to trial for the same offense.  Pp. 66662.
2. The Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction under  1291 to pass on the merits of petitioners' challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment, since the District Court's rejection of such challenge does not come within the Cohen exception.  That rejection is not ""collateral"" in any sense of that term, but rather goes to the very heart of the issues to be resolved at the upcoming trial.  Moreover, the issue resolved adversely to petitioners is such that it may be reviewed effectively, and, if necessary, corrected if and when a final judgment results.  Pp.  431 U. S. 662-663.
3. The Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude petitioners' retrial on the conspiracy charge.  It cannot be assumed that the jury disregarded the District Court's instructions at the initial trial that it could not return a guilty verdict unless the Government proved beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of both offenses charged in the indictment, and therefore it would appear that the jury did not acquit petitioners of the conspiracy charge, while convicting them on the attempt charge, as petitioners urge was a possibility in view of the general verdict.  Pp.  431 U. S. 663-665.

Syllabus 
A National Guard officer was permanently injured when the ejection system of his fighter aircraft malfunctioned during a midair emergency.  Although he was awarded a lifetime pension under the Veterans' Benefits Act for the injury, he brought a damages suit against, inter alia, the United States and petitioner, which had manufactured the ejection system pursuant to Government specifications and with components furnished by the Government.  The serviceman claimed that the ejection system had malfunctioned as a result of the defendants' individual and joint negligence.  Petitioner cross-claimed against the United States, alleging that any malfunction in the system was due to faulty Government specifications and components.  The District Court granted the Government's motions for summary judgment against the officer and for dismissal of petitioner's cross-claim, on the ground that Feres v. United States, 340 U. S. 135 (wherein it was held that an on-duty serviceman injured because of Government officials' negligence may not recover against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act), barred both the officer's claim and petitioner's claim.
Held:  Petitioner's third-party indemnity claim cannot be maintained.  Feres v. United States, supra.  The right of a third party to recover in an indemnity action against the United States recognized in United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 340 U. S. 543, is limited by the rationale of Feres where the injured party is a serviceman.  Pp.  431 U. S. 669-674.
(a) The relationship between the Government and its suppliers of ordnance is as ""distinctively federal in character"" as the relationship between the Government and members of its Armed Forces, and hence, if, as in Feres, it makes no sense to permit the fortuity of the situs of the alleged negligence to affect the Government's liability to a serviceman for service-connected injuries, it makes equally little sense to permit that situs to affect such liability to a Government contractor for the identical injury.  P.  431 U. S. 672.
(b) The Veterans' Benefits Act provides an upper limit of liability for the Government as to service-connected injuries, and to permit petitioner's claim would circumvent such limitation.  Pp.  431 U. S. 672-673. 
Page 431 U. S. 667

(c) Where the case concerns an injury to a serviceman while on duty, the adverse effect upon military discipline is identical whether the action is brought by the serviceman directly or by a third party, since, in either case, the issue would be the degree of the Government agents' fault, if any, and the effect upon the serviceman's safety, and the trial would involve second-guessing military orders.

431 U.S. 678

Syllabus 
Section 6811(8) of the New York Education Law makes it a crime (1) for any person to sell or distribute any contraceptive of any kind to a minor under 16; (2) for anyone other than a licensed pharmacist to distribute contraceptives to persons 16 or over; and (3) for anyone, including licensed pharmacists, to advertise or display contraceptives.  In appellees' action against appellant state officials challenging the constitutionality of $ 6811(8), a three-judge District Court declared the statute unconstitutional in its entirety under the First and Fourteenth Amendments insofar as it applies to nonprescription contraceptives, and enjoined its enforcement as so applied.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  431 U. S. 682-703;  431 U. S. 707-708;  431 U. S. 713-716.
398 F.Supp. 321, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, and V, finding that:
1. Appellee Population Planning Associates (PPA), a corporation that makes mail-order sales of nonmedical contraceptive devices from its North Carolina offices and regularly advertises its products in New York periodicals and fills mail orders from New York residents without limiting availability of the products to persons of any particular age, has the requisite standing to maintain the action not only in its own right but also on behalf of its potential customers, Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, and therefore there is no occasion to decide the standing of the other appellees.  Pp.  431 U. S. 682-684.
2. Regulations imposing a burden on a decision as fundamental as whether to bear or beget a child may be justified only by compelling state interests, and must be narrowly drawn to express only those interests.  Pp.  431 U. S. 684-686.
3. The provision prohibiting distribution of nonmedical contraceptives to persons 16 or over except through licensed pharmacists clearly burdens the right of such individuals to use contraceptives if they so desire, and the provision serves no compelling state interests.  It cannot be justified by an interest in protecting health insofar as it applies 
Page 431 U. S. 679
 to nonhazardous contraceptives or in protecting potential life, nor can it be justified by a concern that young people not sell contraceptives, or as being designed to serve as a quality control device or as facilitating enforcement of the other provisions of the statute.  Pp.  431 U. S. 686-691.
4. The prohibition of any advertisement or display of contraceptives that seeks to suppress completely any information about the availability and price of contraceptives cannot be justified on the ground that advertisements of contraceptive products would offend and embarrass those exposed to them, and that permitting them would legitimize sexual activity of young people.  These are classically not justifications validating suppression of expression protected by the First Amendment, and here the advertisements in question merely state the availability of products that are not only entirely legal, but constitutionally protected.   Pp.  431 U. S. 700-702.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded in Part IV that the provision prohibiting distribution of contraceptives to persons under 16, as applied to nonprescription contraceptives, cannot be justified as a permissible regulation of minors' morality in furtherance of the State's policy against promiscuous sexual intercourse among the young.  Pp.  431 U. S. 691-699.
(a) The right to privacy in connection with decisions affecting procreation extends to minors as well as to adults, and since a State may not impose a blanket prohibition, or even a blanket requirement of parental consent, on the choice of a minor to terminate her pregnancy, Planned Parenthood of Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, the constitutionality of a blanket prohibition of the distribution of contraceptives to minors is a fortiori foreclosed.  Pp.  431 U. S. 693-694.
(b) The argument that sexual activity may be deterred by increasing the hazards attendant on it has been rejected by the Court as a justification for restrictions on the freedom to choose whether to bear or beget a child.  Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438,  405 U. S. 448; Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113,  410 U. S. 148.  Moreover, there is substantial doubt whether limiting access to contraceptives will, in fact, substantially discourage early sexual behavior.  When a State, as here, burdens the exercise of a fundamental right, its attempt to justify that burden as a rational means for the accomplishment of some state policy requires more than the unsupported assertion (appellants here having conceded that there is no evidence that teenage extramarital sexual activity increases in proportion to the availability of contraceptives) that the burden is connected to such a policy.  Pp.  431 U. S. 694-696. 
Page 431 U. S. 680

(c) That, under another provision of the statute, a minor under 16 may be supplied with a contraceptive by a physician does not save the challenged provision, especially where appellants asserted no medical necessity for imposing a limitation on the distribution of nonprescription contraceptives to minors.  Pp.  431 U. S. 697-699.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE concluded that the prohibition against distribution of contraceptives to persons under 16 cannot be justified primarily because the State has not demonstrated that such prohibition measurably contributes to the deterrent purposes that the State advances as justification.  Pp.  431 U. S. 702-703.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL concluded that the prohibition against distribution of contraceptives to persons under 16 is defective both because it infringes the privacy interests of married females between the ages of 14 and 16 and because it prohibits parents from distributing contraceptives to their children, thus unjustifiably interfering with parental interests in rearing children.  Pp.  431 U. S. 707-708.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that the prohibition against distribution of contraceptives to persons under 16 denies such persons and their parents a choice which, if available, would reduce exposure to venereal disease or unwanted pregnancy, and that the prohibition cannot be justified as a means of discouraging sexual activity by minors.  Pp.  431 U. S. 713-716.
BRENNAN, J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered an opinion of the Court (Parts I, II, III, and V), in which STEWART, MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ., joined; in all but Part II of which WHITE, J., joined; and in Part I of which POWELL, J., joined; and an opinion (Part IV), in which STEWART, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined.

Respondents, the State of Illinois and 700 local governmental entities, brought this antitrust treble damages action under  4 of the Clayton Act alleging that petitioners, concrete block manufacturers (which sell to masonry contractors, which in turn sell to general contractors, from which respondents purchase the block in the form of masonry structures) had engaged in a price-fixing conspiracy in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  Petitioners, relying on Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U. S. 481, moved for partial summary judgment against all plaintiffs that were indirect purchasers of block from petitioners, contending that only direct purchasers could sue for the alleged overcharge.  The District Court granted the motion, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that indirect purchasers such as respondents could recover treble damages for an illegal overcharge if they could prove that the overcharge was passed on to them through the intermediate distribution channels.  Hanover Shoe held that generally the illegally overcharged direct purchaser suing for treble damages, and not others in the chain of manufacture or distribution, is the party ""injured in his business or property"" within the meaning of  4.
Held:
1. If a pass-on theory may not be used defensively by an antitrust violator (defendant) against a direct purchaser (plaintiff), that theory may not be used offensively by an indirect purchaser (plaintiff) against an alleged violator (defendant).  Therefore, unless Hanover Shoe is to be overruled or limited, it bars respondents' pass-on theory.  Pp.  431 U. S. 729-736.
(a) Allowing offensive but not defensive use of pass-on would create a serious risk of multiple liability for defendants, since even though an indirect purchaser had already recovered for all or part of an overcharge passed on to him, the direct purchaser would still automatically recover the full amount of the overcharge that the indirect purchaser had shown to be passed on, and, similarly, following an automatic recovery of the full overcharge by the direct purchaser, the indirect purchaser could sue to recover the same amount.  Overlapping recoveries would certainly result from the two lawsuits unless the indirect purchaser is unable to establish any pass-on whatsoever.  Pp.  431 U. S. 730-731. 
Page 431 U. S. 721

(b) The Court's perception in Hanover Shoe of the uncertainties and difficulties in analyzing price and output decisions ""in the real economic world, rather than an economist's hypothetical model,"" applies with equal force to the assertion of pass-on theories by plaintiffs as it does to such assertion by defendants.  Pp.  431 U. S. 731-733.
(c) Because Hanover Shoe would bar petitioners from using respondents' pass-on theory as a defense to a treble damages suit by the direct purchasers (the masonry contractors), Hanover Shoe must be overruled (or narrowly limited), or it must be applied to bar respondents' attempt to use this pass-on theory offensively.  Pp.  431 U. S. 735-736.
2. Hanover Shoe was correctly decided, and its construction of  4 is adhered to.  Pp.  431 U. S. 736-747.
(a) Considerations of stare decisis weigh heavily in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation of its legislation.  Pp.  431 U. S. 736-737.
(b) Whole new dimensions of complexity would be added to treble damages suits, undermining their effectiveness, if the use of pass-on theories under  4 were allowed.  Even under the optimistic assumption that joinder of potential plaintiffs would deal satisfactorily with problems of multiple litigation and liability,  4 actions would be transformed into massive multiparty litigations involving many distribution levels and including large classes of ultimate consumers remote from the defendant.  The Court's concern in Hanover Shoe with the problems of ""massive evidence and complicated theories"" involved in attempting to establish a pass-on defense against a direct purchaser applies a fortiori to the attempt to trace the effect of the overcharge through each step in the distribution chain from the direct purchasers to the ultimate consumer.  Pp.  431 U. S. 737-744.
(c) Attempts to carve out exceptions to Hanover Shoe for particular types of markets would entail the very problems that Hanover Shoe sought to avoid.  Pp.  431 U. S. 744-745.
(d) The legislative purpose in creating a group of ""private attorneys general"" to enforce the antitrust laws under  4, Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of California, 405 U. S. 251,  405 U. S. 262, is better served by holding direct purchasers to be injured to the full extent of the overcharge paid by them than by attempting to apportion the overcharge among all that may have absorbed a part of it.  Pp.  431 U. S. 745-747.

Syllabus 
Prior to the decision in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, appellant was convicted of selling obscene sado-masochistic materials in violation of the Illinois obscenity statute forbidding the sale of obscene matter and providing that
""[a] thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters.""
The conviction was affirmed after Miller, the Illinois Supreme Court rejecting appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of the statute for failure to conform to Miller standards, as well as his claim that the publications in question were not obscene.
Held:
1. The Illinois statute is not unconstitutionally vague as failing to give appellant notice that materials dealing with the kind of sexual conduct involved here could not be legally sold in the State, where (whether or not the State has complied with Miller's requirement that the sexual conduct that may not be depicted must be specifically defined by applicable state law as written or authoritatively construed) appellant had ample guidance from a previous decision of the Illinois Supreme Court making it clear that his conduct did not conform to Illinois law.  Pp.  431 U. S. 771-773.
2. Sado-masochistic materials are the kind of materials that may be proscribed by state law, Mishkin v. New York, 383 U. S. 502, even though they were not expressly included within the examples of the kinds of sexually explicit representations that Miller used to explicate the aspect of its obscenity definition dealing with patently offensive depictions of specifically defined sexual conduct.  P.  431 U. S. 773.
3. The materials in question were properly found by the courts below to be obscene under the Illinois statute, which conforms to the Miller standards, except that it retains the stricter ""redeeming social value"" obscenity criterion announced in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413.  P.  431 U. S. 773.
4. The Illinois statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad for failure to state specifically the kinds of sexual conduct the description or representation of which the State intends to proscribe, where it appears that in prior decisions the Illinois Supreme Court, although not expressly

Syllabus 
More than 18 months after federal criminal offenses were alleged to have occurred, respondent was indicted for committing them.  Beyond an investigative report made a month after the crimes were committed, little additional information was developed in the following 17 months.  Claiming that the preindictment delay, during which material defense testimony had been lost, deprived him of due process, respondent moved to dismiss the indictment.  The District Court, which found that the delay had not been explained or justified, and was unnecessary and prejudicial to respondent, granted the motion to dismiss.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the delay, which it found was solely attributable to the Government's hope that other participants in the crime would be discovered, was unjustified.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the District Court's dismissal of the indictment.  Pp.  431 U. S. 788-797.
(a) Although the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment is applicable only after a person has been accused of a crime and statutes of limitations provide ""the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,'"" United States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307,  404 U. S. 322, those statutes do not fully define a defendant's rights with respect to events antedating the indictment, and the Due Process Clause has a limited role to play in protecting against oppressive delay.  Pp.  431 U. S. 788-789.
(b) While proof of prejudice makes a due process claim ripe for adjudication, it does not automatically validate such a claim, and the reasons for the delay must also be considered.  Pp.  431 U. S. 789-790.
(c) To prosecute a defendant following good faith investigative delay, as apparently existed in this case, does not deprive him of due process even if his defense might have been somewhat prejudiced by the lapse of time.  Prosecutors are under no duty to file charges as soon as probable cause exists but before they are satisfied that they will be able to establish a suspect's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Nor is there a constitutional requirement that charges must be filed after there is sufficient evidence to prove such guilt but before the investigation is complete.  An immediate arrest or indictment might impair the prosecutors' ability to continue the investigation or obtain additional indictments,

Syllabus 
Respondent, who left employment with petitioner for military service but who returned after completion of such service and continued in employment until his retirement, held entitled under  9 of the Military Selective Service Act, which requires an employer to rehire a returning veteran without loss of seniority, to credit toward his pension under petitioner's pension plan for his period of military service.  Pp.  431 U. S. 583-594.
(a) A benefit is a right of seniority secured to a veteran by  9 if it would have accrued with reasonable certainty, as opposed to being subject to a significant contingency, had the veteran been continuously employed by the employer, McKinney v. Missouri-K.-T. R. Co., 357 U. S. 265; Tilton v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 376 U. S. 169, and if it is in the nature of a reward for length of service, rather than short-term compensation for services rendered, Accardi v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 383 U. S. 225; Foster v. Dravo Corp., 420 U. S. 92.  Pp.  431 U. S. 585-589.
(b) Here, not only is the ""reasonable certainty"" requirement met on the basis of respondent's work history both before and after his military service, but it also appears that the ""true nature"" of the pension payments is a reward for length of service, especially in view of the lengthy period (20 years or 15 years if age 50) required by the pension plan for pension rights to vest in the employee.  Pp.  431 U. S. 591-594.
(c) Moreover, respondent's claim is supported by the functions of pension plans in assuring financial security for long-term employees and, by providing such security, in encouraging such employees to retire when their efficiency declines.  P.  431 U. S. 594.

S. 169, and if it is in the nature of a reward for length of service, rather than short-term compensation for services rendered, Accardi v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 383 U. S. 225; Foster v. Dravo Corp., 420 U. S. 92.  Pp.  431 U. S. 585-589.
(b) Here, not only is the ""reasonable certainty"" requirement met on the basis of respondent's work history both before and after his military service, but it also appears that the ""true nature"" of the pension payments is a reward for length of service, especially in view of the lengthy period (20 years or 15 years if age 50) required by the pension plan for pension rights to vest in the employee.  Pp.  431 U. S. 591-594.
(c) Moreover, respondent's claim is supported by the functions of pension plans in assuring financial security for long-term employees and, by providing such security, in encouraging such employees to retire when their efficiency declines.  P.  431 U. S. 594.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who was convicted of selling obscene film in violation of California law, contends that portions of the instructions to the jury violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, claiming that the instructions (1) allowed the jury to convict him even though it might otherwise have found that the film was protected under the standards of Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, because the instructions permitted the jury to consider motives of commercial exploitation on the part of persons in the chain of distribution other than petitioner, and (2) violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws, and the fair warning requirement of Bouie v. Columbia., 378 U. S. 347.  The challenged instruction permitted the jury, in determining whether the film was utterly without redeeming social importance, to consider the circumstances of the sale and distribution, particularly whether such circumstances indicated that the film was being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal.  Held:
1. The instruction violated no First Amendment rights of the petitioner.  The circumstances of distribution of the material are relevant from the standpoint of whether public confrontation with potentially offensive aspects of the material is being forced, and are
""equally relevant to determining whether social importance claimed for material in the courtroom was, in the circumstances, pretense or reality -- whether it was the basis upon which it was traded in the marketplace or a spurious claim for litigation purposes.""

2. Though the section of the California Penal Code that authorized the challenged instruction was enacted after part of the conduct for which petitioner was convicted but prior to his trial, that section does not create any new substantive offense, but merely declares what type of evidence may be received and considered by the jury in deciding whether the allegedly obscene material was ""utterly without redeeming social importance.""

Syllabus 
Title 19 U.S.C.  482 and implementing postal regulations authorize customs officials to inspect incoming international mail when they have a ""reasonable cause to suspect"" that the mail contains illegally imported merchandise, although the regulations prohibit the reading of correspondence absent a search warrant.  Acting pursuant to the statute and regulations, a customs inspector, based on the facts that certain incoming letter-sized airmail envelopes were from Thailand, a known source of narcotics, and were bulky and much heavier than a normal airmail letter, opened the envelopes for inspection at the General Post Office in New York City, considered a ""border"" for border search purposes, and ultimately the envelopes were found to contain heroin.  Respondents were subsequently indicted for and convicted of narcotics offenses, the District Court having denied their motion to suppress the heroin.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the border search exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement applicable to persons, baggage, and mailed packages did not apply to the opening of international mail, and that the Constitution requires that, before such mail is opened, a showing of probable cause must be made and a warrant obtained.
Held:
1. Under the circumstances, the customs inspector had ""reasonable cause to suspect"" that there was merchandise or contraband in the envelopes, and therefore the search was plainly authorized by the statute.  Pp.  431 U. S. 611-616.
2. The Fourth Amendment does not interdict the actions taken by the inspector in opening and searching the envelopes.  Pp.  431 U. S. 616-625.
(a) Boarder searches without probable cause and without a warrant are nonetheless ""reasonable"" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  431 U. S. 616-619.
(b) The inclusion of international mail within the border search exception does not represent any ""extension"" of that exception.  The exception is grounded in the recognized right of the sovereign to control, subject to substantive limitations imposed by the Constitution, who and what may enter the country, and no different constitutional standards should apply simply because the envelopes were mailed, not carried -- the 
Page 431 U. S. 607
 critical fact being that the envelopes cross the border and enter the country, not that they are brought in by one mode of transportation, rather than another.  It is their entry into the country from without it that makes a resulting search ""reasonable.""  Pp.  431 U. S. 619-621.
(c) The border search exception is not based on the doctrine of ""exigent circumstances,"" but is a longstanding, historically recognized exception to the Fourth Amendment's general principle that a warrant be obtained.  Pp.  431 U. S. 621-622.
(d) The opening of international mail under the guidelines of the statute only when the customs official has reason to believe the mail contains other than correspondence, while the reading of any correspondence inside the envelopes is forbidden by the regulations, does not impermissibly chill the exercise of free speech under the First Amendment, and any ""chill"" that might exist under such circumstances is not only ""minimal"" but is also wholly subjective.

431 U.S. 324

Syllabus 
The United States instituted this litigation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against petitioners, a nationwide common carrier of motor freight, and a union representing a large group of the company's employees.  The Government alleged that the company had engaged in a pattern or practice of discriminating against Negroes and Spanish-surnamed persons (hereinafter sometimes collectively ""minority members"") who were hired as servicemen or local city drivers, which were lower paying, less desirable jobs than the positions of line drivers (over-the-road, long-distance drivers), which went to whites, and that the seniority system in the collective bargaining agreements between petitioners perpetuated (""locked in"") the effects of past racial and ethnic discrimination because, under that system, a city driver or serviceman who transferred to a line driver job had to forfeit all the competitive seniority he had accumulated in his previous bargaining unit and start at the bottom of the line drivers' ""board.""  The Government sought a general injunctive remedy and specific ""make whole"" relief for individual discriminatees, which would allow them an opportunity to transfer to line driver jobs with full company seniority.  Section 703(a) of Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice, inter alia, for an employer to fail or refuse to hire any individual or otherwise discriminate against him with regard to his employment because of his race or national origin.  Section 703(h) provides in part that, notwithstanding other provisions, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different employment standards ""pursuant to a bona fide seniority . . . system, . . . provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate. . . .""  The District Court after trial, with respect to both the employment discrimination and the seniority system in the collective bargaining agreements, held that petitioners had violated Title VII and enjoined both the company and the union from committing further violations thereof.  With respect to individual relief, the court determined that 
Page 431 U. S. 325
 the ""affected class"" of discriminatees included all minority members who had been hired as city drivers or servicemen at every company terminal with a line driver operation, whether they were hired before or after Title VII's effective date.  The discriminatees thereby became entitled to preference over all other line driver applicants in the future.  Finding that members of the affected class had been injured in varying degrees, the court created three subclasses, and applied to each a different formula for filling line driver jobs and for establishment of seniority, giving retroactive seniority to the effective date of the Act to those who suffered ""severe injury.""  The right of any class member to a line driver vacancy was made subject to the prior recall rights under the collective bargaining agreement of line drivers who had been on layoff for not more than three years.  Although agreeing with the District Court's basic conclusions, the Court of Appeals rejected the affected-class trisection, holding that the minority members could bid for future line driver jobs on the basis of their company seniority, and that, once a class member became a line driver, he could use his full company seniority even if it antedated Title VII's effective date, limited only by a ""qualification date"" formula, under which seniority could not be awarded for periods prior to the date when (1) a line driver job was vacant, and (2) the class member met (or, given the opportunity, would have met) the line driver qualifications.  Holding that the three-year priority in favor of laid-off workers ""would unduly impede the eradication of past discrimination,"" the Court of Appeals directed that, when a not purely temporary line driver vacancy arose, a class member might compete against any line driver on layoff on the basis of the member's retroactive seniority.
Held:
1. The Government sustained its burden of proving that the company engaged in a systemwide pattern or practice of employment discrimination against minority members in violation of Title VII by regularly and purposefully treating such members less favorably than white persons.  The evidence, showing pervasive statistical disparities in line driver positions between employment of the minority members and whites, and bolstered by considerable testimony of specific instances of discrimination, was not adequately rebutted by the company, and supported the findings of the courts below.  Pp.  431 U. S. 334-343.
2. Since the Government proved that the company engaged in a post-Act pattern of discriminatory employment policies, retroactive seniority may be awarded as relief for post-Act discriminatees even if the seniority system agreement makes no provision for such relief.  Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U. S. 747,  424 U. S. 778-779.  Pp.  431 U. S. 347-348. 
Page 431 U. S. 326

3. The seniority system was protected by  703(h), and therefore the union's conduct in agreeing to and maintaining the system did not violate Title VII.  Employees who suffered only pre-Act discrimination are not entitled to relief, and no person may be given retroactive seniority to a date earlier than the Act's effective date.  The District Court's injunction against the union must consequently be vacated.  Pp.  431 U. S. 348-356.
(a) By virtue of  703(h) a bona fide seniority system does not become unlawful simply because it may perpetuate pre-Title VII discrimination, for Congress (as is manifest from the language and legislative history of the Act) did not intend to make it illegal for employees with vested seniority rights to continue to exercise those rights, even at the expense of pre-Act discriminatees.  Thus, here, because of the company's intentional pre-Act discrimination, the disproportionate advantage given by the seniority system to the white line drivers with the longest tenure over the minority member employees who might by now have enjoyed those advantages were it not for the pre-Act discrimination is sanctioned by  703(h).  Pp.  431 U. S. 348-355.
(b) The seniority system at issue here is entirely bona fide, applying to all races and ethnic groups, and was negotiated and is maintained free from any discriminatory purpose.  Pp.  431 U. S. 355-356.
4. Every post-Act minority member applicant for a line driver position is presumptively entitled to relief, subject to a showing by the company that its earlier refusal to place the applicant in a line driver job was not based on its policy of discrimination.  Cf. Franks, supra at  424 U. S. 773 n. 32.  Pp.  431 U. S. 357-362.
5. An incumbent employee's failure to apply for a job does not inexorably bar an award of retroactive seniority, and individual nonapplicants must be afforded an opportunity to undertake their difficult task of proving that they should be treated as applicants, and therefore are presumptively entitled to relief accordingly.  Pp.  431 U. S. 362-371.
(a) Congress' purpose in vesting broad equitable powers in Title VII courts was ""to make possible the fashion[ing] [of] the most complete relief possible,'"" Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405,  422 U. S. 421.  Measured against the broad prophylactic purposes of Title VII, the company's assertion that a person who has not actually applied for a job can never be awarded seniority relief cannot prevail, for a consistently enforced discriminatory policy can surely deter job applications from those who are aware of it and are unwilling to subject themselves to the humiliation of explicit and certain rejection.  Pp.  431 U. S. 364-367.
(b) However, a nonapplicant must still show that he was a potential 
Page 431 U. S. 327
 victim of unlawful discrimination and that he would have applied for a line driver job but for the company's discriminatory practices.  The known prospect of discriminatory rejection shows only that employees who wanted line driving jobs may have been deterred from applying for them but does not show which of the nonapplicants actually wanted such jobs or were qualified.  Consequently, the Government has the burden of proving at a remedial hearing to be conducted by the District Court which specific nonapplicants would have applied for line driver jobs but for their knowledge of the company's discriminatory policies.  Pp.  431 U. S. 367-371.
6. At such hearing on remand, the District Court will have to identify which of the minority members were actual victims of discrimination and, by application of the basic principles of equity, to balance their interest against the legitimate expectations of other employees innocent of wrongdoing.  Pp.  431 U. S. 371-376.

Employees who suffered only pre-Act discrimination are not entitled to relief, and no person may be given retroactive seniority to a date earlier than the Act's effective date.  The District Court's injunction against the union must consequently be vacated.  Pp.  431 U. S. 348-356.
(a) By virtue of  703(h) a bona fide seniority system does not become unlawful simply because it may perpetuate pre-Title VII discrimination, for Congress (as is manifest from the language and legislative history of the Act) did not intend to make it illegal for employees with vested seniority rights to continue to exercise those rights, even at the expense of pre-Act discriminatees.  Thus, here, because of the company's intentional pre-Act discrimination, the disproportionate advantage given by the seniority system to the white line drivers with the longest tenure over the minority member employees who might by now have enjoyed those advantages were it not for the pre-Act discrimination is sanctioned by  703(h).  Pp.  431 U. S. 348-355.
(b) The seniority system at issue here is entirely bona fide, applying to all races and ethnic groups, and was negotiated and is maintained free from any discriminatory purpose.  Pp.  431 U. S. 355-356.
4. Every post-Act minority member applicant for a line driver position is presumptively entitled to relief, subject to a showing by the company that its earlier refusal to place the applicant in a line driver job was not based on its policy of discrimination.  Cf. Franks, supra at  424 U. S. 773 n. 32.  Pp.  431 U. S. 357-362.
5. An incumbent employee's failure to apply for a job does not inexorably bar an award of retroactive seniority, and individual nonapplicants must be afforded an opportunity to undertake their difficult task of proving that they should be treated as applicants, and therefore are presumptively entitled to relief accordingly.  Pp.  431 U. S. 362-371.
(a) Congress' purpose in vesting broad equitable powers in Title VII courts was ""to make possible the fashion[ing] [of] the most complete relief possible,'"" Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405,  422 U. S. 421.  Measured against the broad prophylactic purposes of Title VII, the company's assertion that a person who has not actually applied for a job can never be awarded seniority relief cannot prevail, for a consistently enforced discriminatory policy can surely deter job applications from those who are aware of it and are unwilling to subject themselves to the humiliation of explicit and certain rejection.  Pp.  431 U. S. 364-367.
(b) However, a nonapplicant must still show that he was a potential 
Page 431 U. S. 327
 victim of unlawful discrimination and that he would have applied for a line driver job but for the company's discriminatory practices.  The known prospect of discriminatory rejection shows only that employees who wanted line driving jobs may have been deterred from applying for them but does not show which of the nonapplicants actually wanted such jobs or were qualified.  Consequently, the Government has the burden of proving at a remedial hearing to be conducted by the District Court which specific nonapplicants would have applied for line driver jobs but for their knowledge of the company's discriminatory policies.  Pp.  431 U. S. 367-371.
6. At such hearing on remand, the District Court will have to identify which of the minority members were actual victims of discrimination and, by application of the basic principles of equity, to balance their interest against the legitimate expectations of other employees innocent of wrongdoing.  Pp.  431 U. S. 371-376.

Syllabus 
Respondents, Mexican-Americans, brought suit against petitioners, their unions and their employer, a common carrier that employs city and over-the-road (""line"") drivers, claiming that their rejection for line driver jobs under the company's ""no-transfer"" policy in conjunction with the discriminatory effect of the seniority system applicable under collective bargaining agreements between the company and the unions was racially and ethnically discriminatory, and violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Although respondents alleged that the case was a class action brought on behalf of the named plaintiffs and all Negroes and Mexican-Americans who had been denied equal employment opportunities with the company because of their race or national origin, they did not make a pretrial motion pursuant to Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23 to have the action certified as a class action, and the District Court made no such certification.  Respondents had stipulated before trial that they had not been discriminated against when they were first hired, and that the only issue before the court was whether the company's failure to consider respondents' line driver applications violated Title VII, and their evidence and arguments at trial were confined to respondents' individual claims, with petitioners' defense showing that respondents were not qualified to be line drivers.  The District Court following trial dismissed the class action allegations (stressing respondents' failure to move for class certification, their focus on individual claims, the lack of evidence, the stipulation, and the fact that a large majority of the union membership had recently rejected a proposal for the merger of 
Page 431 U. S. 396
 city driver and line driver seniority lists with free transfer between jobs), and the individual claims (ruling that the challenged policies were neutrally applied, were proper business policies, and that respondents lacked line driver qualifications).  The Court of Appeals reversed, discounting respondents' failure to move for certification (""a responsibility [that] falls to the court""), and the court itself certifying the class, after which it found classwide company and union liability on the basis of the proof adduced at trial.  The trial court ""lack of qualification"" finding was not disturbed, the Court of Appeals ruling only that it was ""premature"" because each plaintiff as a member of the class would be entitled to have his application considered on the merits when future line driver vacancies arose.
Held:  The Court of Appeals plainly erred in certifying a class action and in imposing classwide liability on petitioners.  Pp.  431 U. S. 403-406.
(a) The trial court proceedings made clear that respondents were not members of the class of discriminatees that they purported to represent, since there was abundant evidence that they were unqualified to be line drivers, which, in addition to the stipulation of each named plaintiff that he had not been discriminated against with respect to his initial employment, made them ineligible to represent a class of persons who did allegedly suffer injury or to attack the no-transfer rule and seniority system on the ground that these practices perpetuated past discrimination and locked minorities into the less desirable jobs to which they had been discriminatorily assigned.  Pp.  431 U. S. 403-404.
(b) The named plaintiffs' failure to protect the interest of class members by moving for certification strongly implies the inadequacy of the representation class members might receive.  P.  431 U. S. 405.

Syllabus 
Rather than charging appellees with the crime of fraudulently concealing assets while applying for and receiving public assistance, the Illinois Department of Public Aid (IDPA) brought a civil action against appellees in state court seeking only a return of the welfare payments alleged to have been wrongfully received, and as part of the action a writ of attachment was issued and executed pursuant to the Illinois Attachment Act against appellees' property without notice or hearing.  Instead of seeking a prompt hearing in the state court or moving there to quash the attachment on federal constitutional grounds, appellees filed suit against appellant IDPA officials in Federal District Court, alleging that the Attachment Act was unconstitutional in that it provided for deprivation of debtors' property without due process of law, and seeking, inter alia, return of the attached property.  Declining to dismiss the complaint under the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, and Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S. 592, a three-judge court held the Act unconstitutional and issued an injunction directing return of appellees' attached property.
Held:  The District Court should have dismissed appellees' complaint under Younger, supra, and Huffman, supra, unless their state remedies were inadequate to litigate their federal due process claim, since the injunction asked for and issued by the court interfered with Illinois' efforts to utilize the Attachment Act as an integral part of the State's enforcement action.  Pp.  431 U. S. 440-447.
(a) The principles of Younger and Huffman are broad enough to apply to interference by a federal court with an ongoing civil enforcement action such as this, brought by the State in its sovereign capacity.  Pp.  431 U. S. 443-444.
(b) For the federal court to have proceeded with the case rather than remitting appellees to their remedies in the pending state suit confronts the State with the choice of engaging in duplicative litigation, thereby risking a temporary federal injunction, or of interrupting its enforcement proceedings pending the federal court's decision at some unknown time in the future; and forecloses the state court's opportunity

Appellee, an employee of United States Steel Corporation (USS) at a plant in Ohio, was furloughed when the plant was shut down because of a reduction in fuel supply resulting from a nationwide strike of workers at USS's coal mines.  Appellee applied to appellant Ohio Bureau of Employment Services for unemployment benefits, but his claim was disallowed under an Ohio statute that disqualified a worker from such benefits if his unemployment was ""due to a labor dispute other than a lockout at any factory . . . owned or operated by the employer by which he is or was last employed.""  While appellee's request for reconsideration was pending before the Board of Review, he filed a class action in Federal District Court against appellants, the Bureau and its director, for declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting that the Ohio statute conflicted with certain provisions of the Social Security Act (SSA) and that, as applied, it was irrational and had no valid public purpose, in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Concluding that abstention was not proper, the District Court held that the statute, as applied to appellee and the class members, violated those Clauses.
Held:
1. Abstention is not required under either Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, or Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496.  Pp.  431 U. S. 477-481.
(a) Where Ohio has concluded to submit the constitutional issue to this Court for immediate resolution, Younger principles of equity and comity do not require this Court to refuse Ohio the immediate adjudication it seeks.  Pp.  431 U. S. 477-480.
(b) Nor is Pullman abstention appropriate where the possible benefits of abstention have become too speculative to justify or require avoidance of the constitutional question.  Pp.  431 U. S. 480-481.
2. The Ohio statute is neither in conflict with, nor is it preempted by 42 U.S.C.  503(a) (the provision of the SSA that precludes the Secretary of Labor from certifying payment of federal funds to state unemployment compensation programs unless state law provides for such methods of administration as the Secretary finds are ""reasonably 
Page 431 U. S. 472
 calculated to insure full payment of unemployment compensation when due""), or the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA).  Pp.  431 U. S. 482-489.
3. The Ohio statute, which has a rational relation to a legitimate state interest, is constitutional.  Pp.  431 U. S. 489-493.
(a) The statute does not involve any discernible fundamental interest or affect with particularity any protected class, and the test of constitutionality, therefore, is whether the statute has a rational relation to a legitimate state interest.  P.  431 U. S. 489.
(b) In considering the constitutionality of the statute, this Court must view its consequences not only for the recipient of the benefits, but also for the contributors to the compensation fund, and, although the system may provide only ""rough justice"" and a rough form of state ""neutrality"" in labor disputes, the statute cannot be said to be irrational, and the need for limitation of the liability of the compensation fund is a legitimate state interest.

(a) Where Ohio has concluded to submit the constitutional issue to this Court for immediate resolution, Younger principles of equity and comity do not require this Court to refuse Ohio the immediate adjudication it seeks.  Pp.  431 U. S. 477-480.
(b) Nor is Pullman abstention appropriate where the possible benefits of abstention have become too speculative to justify or require avoidance of the constitutional question.  Pp.  431 U. S. 480-481.
2. The Ohio statute is neither in conflict with, nor is it preempted by 42 U.S.C.  503(a) (the provision of the SSA that precludes the Secretary of Labor from certifying payment of federal funds to state unemployment compensation programs unless state law provides for such methods of administration as the Secretary finds are ""reasonably 
Page 431 U. S. 472
 calculated to insure full payment of unemployment compensation when due""), or the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA).  Pp.  431 U. S. 482-489.
3. The Ohio statute, which has a rational relation to a legitimate state interest, is constitutional.  Pp.  431 U. S. 489-493.
(a) The statute does not involve any discernible fundamental interest or affect with particularity any protected class, and the test of constitutionality, therefore, is whether the statute has a rational relation to a legitimate state interest.  P.  431 U. S. 489.
(b) In considering the constitutionality of the statute, this Court must view its consequences not only for the recipient of the benefits, but also for the contributors to the compensation fund, and, although the system may provide only ""rough justice"" and a rough form of state ""neutrality"" in labor disputes, the statute cannot be said to be irrational, and the need for limitation of the liability of the compensation fund is a legitimate state interest.  Pp.  431 U. S. 489-493.

||"Moore v. City of East Cleveland
No. 75-6289
Argued November 2, 1976
Decided May 31, 1977
431 U.S. 494

Syllabus 
Appellant lives in her East Cleveland, Ohio, home with her son and two grandsons (who are first cousins).  An East Cleveland housing ordinance limits occupancy of a dwelling unit to members of a single family, but defines ""family"" in such a way that appellant's household does not qualify.  Appellant was convicted of a criminal violation of the ordinance.  Her conviction was upheld on appeal over her claim that the ordinance is unconstitutional.  Appellee city contends that the ordinance should be sustained under Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U. S. 1, which upheld an ordinance imposing limits on the types of groups that could occupy a single dwelling unit.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  431 U. S. 498-506;  431 U. S. 513-521.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, joined by MR JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that the ordinance deprived appellant of her liberty in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(a) This case is distinguishable from Belle Terre, supra, where the ordinance affected only unrelated individuals.  The ordinance here expressly selects certain categories of relatives who may live together, and declares that others may not, in this instance making it a crime for a grandmother to live with her grandson.  Pp.  431 U. S. 498-499.
(b) When the government intrudes on choices concerning family living arrangements, the usual deference to the legislature is inappropriate, and the Court must examine carefully the importance of the governmental interests advanced and the extent to which they are served by the challenged regulation.  P.  431 U. S. 499.
(c) The ordinance, at best, has but a tenuous relationship to the objectives cited by the city:  avoiding overcrowding, traffic congestion, and an undue financial burden on the school system.  Pp.  431 U. S. 499-500.
(d) The strong constitutional protection of the sanctity of the family established in numerous decisions of this Court extends to the family choice involved in this case, and is not confined within an arbitrary boundary drawn at the limits of the nuclear family (essentially a couple 
Page 431 U. S. 495
 and their dependent children).  Appropriate limits on substantive due process come not from drawing arbitrary lines, but from careful ""respect for the teachings of history [and] solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society.""  Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479,  381 U. S. 501 (Harlan, J., concurring).  The history and tradition of this Nation compel a larger conception of the family.  Pp.  431 U. S. 500-506.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that, under the limited standard of review preserved in Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, and Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U. S. 183, before a zoning ordinance can be declared unconstitutional, it must be shown to be clearly arbitrary and unreasonable as having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare; that appellee city has failed totally to explain the need for a rule that would allow a homeowner to have grandchildren live with her if they are brothers, but not if they are cousins; and that, under that standard, appellee city's unprecedented ordinance constitutes a taking of property without due process and without just compensation.

 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
 See 434 U.S. 881. 

 Mr. Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Mr. Justice BLACKMUN and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 Shortly after midnight on September 13, 1970, Jessee Carter, an off- duty New York City police officer, was driving through the South Jamaica section of Queens on his way home from a movie. His suspicion was aroused when he observed two individuals, later identified as respondent and a companion, 'crouched' behind a parked automobile in a partially deserted, unfenced hotel parking lot. The two were approximately 15 to 20 feet from Carter, and he noted that respondent was holding an object in his upraised hand. Respondent's companion was also holding an object, which Carter saw him 
Page 431 U.S. 943 , 944
 place in his rear trouser pocket. Carter was unable to identify either of these objects. 
 The officer then drove his automobile onto the parking lot, stopping approximately two car lengths from the suspects. He turned off his headlights and observed them briefly. He then turned his lights back on and drove his car towards the men. He jumped from the car with his badge in one hand and his drawn revolver in the other, and shouted 'freeze police officer.' 
 Respondent rose from his crouched position, and Carter saw him drop the object he had been holding which turned out to be a fully loaded .38 caliber revolver. Officer Carter immediately placed the men under arrest, and proceeded to search them. He found six .38 caliber bullets in respondent's pocket and a loaded revolver in the pocket of his companion. Respondent was charged with possession of weapons and dangerous instruments and appliances. His motion to suppress the handgun as evidence was denied by the New York Supreme Court Criminal Term. Respondent then pled guilty to the charge and as permitted by New York law, 1 he appealed his conviction, charging that the motion to suppress should have been granted. 
 The Supreme Court Appellate Division affirmed respondent's conviction in an opinion joined by four Justices. One Justice dissented. The court first determined that Officer Carter 'was clearly possessed of such information as would warrant a 'founded suspicion' that criminal activity was 'afoot'.' People v.

Argued December 6, 1976
Decided May 23, 1977
431 U.S. 181

Syllabus 
Respondent, who was suspected, with others, of possible implication in a theft, was subpoenaed to appear as a witness before the District of Columbia grand jury investigating the crime.  The prosecutor did not advise respondent before his appearance that he might be indicted for the theft, but respondent was given a series of warnings after being sworn, including the warning that he had a right to remain silent.  Respondent nevertheless testified, and subsequently was indicted for the theft.  The trial court granted respondent's motion to suppress his grand jury testimony and to quash the indictment on the ground that it was based on evidence obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination.  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the suppression order, holding that ""the most significant failing of the prosecutor was in not advising [respondent] that he was a potential defendant"" and that
""[a]nother shortcoming was in the prosecutor's waiting until after administering the oath in the cloister of the grand jury before undertaking to furnish what advice was given.""
Held:  Respondent's grand jury testimony may properly be used against him in a subsequent trial.  The comprehensive warnings he received, whether or not such warnings were constitutionally required, dissipated any element of compulsion to self-incrimination that might otherwise have been present.  The fact that a subpoenaed grand jury witness is a putative or potential defendant neither impairs nor enlarges his constitutional rights, and hence it is unnecessary to give such a defendant the warnings that the Court of Appeals held were required.

No. 76-439
Argued March 29, 1977
Decided May 23, 1977
431 U.S. 195

Syllabus 
Provision of  22 of the 1950 Organic Act of Guam that the District Court of Guam ""shall have such appellate jurisdiction as the [Guam] legislature may determine"" held not to authorize the Guam Legislature to divest the District Court's appellate jurisdiction under the Act to hear appeals from local Guam courts, and to transfer that jurisdiction to the newly created Guam Supreme Court, but to empower the legislature to ""determine"" that jurisdiction only in the sense of the selection of what should constitute appealable causes.  This conclusion is supported not only by the text of  22, which expressly authorizes only a ""transfer"" of the District Court's original local jurisdiction, but also by the absence of any clear signal from Congress that it intended to allow the Guam Legislature to foreclose appellate review by Art. III courts, including this Court, of territorial courts' decisions in federal question cases; by the Act's legislative history; and by the fact that, if the word ""determine"" were read as giving Guam the power to transfer the District Court's appellate jurisdiction to the Guam Supreme Court and at the same time to authorize Guam to deny review of the District Court's decisions by any Art.

			"|"Territory of Guam v. Olsen
No. 76-439
Argued March 29, 1977
Decided May 23, 1977
431 U.S. 195

Syllabus 
Provision of  22 of the 1950 Organic Act of Guam that the District Court of Guam ""shall have such appellate jurisdiction as the [Guam] legislature may determine"" held not to authorize the Guam Legislature to divest the District Court's appellate jurisdiction under the Act to hear appeals from local Guam courts, and to transfer that jurisdiction to the newly created Guam Supreme Court, but to empower the legislature to ""determine"" that jurisdiction only in the sense of the selection of what should constitute appealable causes.  This conclusion is supported not only by the text of  22, which expressly authorizes only a ""transfer"" of the District Court's original local jurisdiction, but also by the absence of any clear signal from Congress that it intended to allow the Guam Legislature to foreclose appellate review by Art. III courts, including this Court, of territorial courts' decisions in federal question cases; by the Act's legislative history; and by the fact that, if the word ""determine"" were read as giving Guam the power to transfer the District Court's appellate jurisdiction to the Guam Supreme Court and at the same time to authorize Guam to deny review of the District Court's decisions by any Art. III tribunal, Congress would have given Guam a power not granted to any other Territory.  Pp.  431 U. S. 199-204.
540 F.2d 1011, affirmed.

No. 75-1153
Argued November 9, 1976
Decided May 23, 1977
431 U.S. 209
Syllabus
A Michigan statute authorizing union representation of local governmental employees permits an ""agency shop"" arrangement, whereby every employee represented by a union, even though not a union member, must pay to the union, as a condition of employment, a service charge equal in amount to union dues.  Appellant teachers filed actions (later consolidated) in Michigan state court against appellee Detroit Board of Education and appellee Union (which represented teachers employed by the Board) and Union officials, challenging the validity of the agency shop clause in a collective bargaining agreement between the Board and the Union.  The complaints alleged that appellants were unwilling or had refused to pay Union dues, that they opposed collective bargaining in the public sector, that the Union was engaged in various political and other ideological activities that appellants did not approve and that were not collective bargaining activities, and prayed that the agency shop clause be declared invalid under state law and under the United States Constitution as a deprivation of appellants' freedom of association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The trial court dismissed the actions for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The Michigan Court of Appeals, while reversing and remanding on other grounds, upheld the constitutionality of the agency shop clause, and, although recognizing that the expenditure of compulsory service charges to further ""political purposes"" unrelated to collective bargaining could violate appellants' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, held that, since the complaints had failed to allege that appellants had notified the Union as to those causes and candidates to which they objected, appellants were not entitled to restitution of any portion of the service charges.
Held:
1. Insofar as the service charges are used to finance expenditures by the Union for collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment purposes, the agency shop clause is valid.  Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, 351 U. S. 225; Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740.  Pp.  217-232.
(a) That government employment is involved, rather than private employment, does not mean that Hanson, supra, and Street, supra, can 
[210]
 be distinguished by relying in this case upon the doctrine that public employment cannot be conditioned upon the surrender of First Amendment rights, for the railroad employees' claim in Hanson that a union shop agreement was invalid failed not because there was no governmental action, but because there was no First Amendment violation.  Pp. 226-227.
(b) Although public employee unions' activities are political to the extent they attempt to influence governmental policymaking, the differences in the nature of collective bargaining between the public and private sectors do not mean that a public employee has a weightier First Amendment interest than a private employee in not being compelled to contribute to the costs of exclusive union representation.  A public employee who believes that a union representing him is urging a course that is unwise as a matter of public policy is not barred from expressing his viewpoint, but, besides voting in accordance with his convictions, every public employee is largely free to express his views, in public or private, orally or in writing, and, with some exceptions not pertinent here, is free to participate in the full range of political and ideological activities open to other citizens.  Pp.  227-232.
2. The principles that, under the First Amendment, an individual should be free to believe as he will, and that, in a free society, one's beliefs should be shaped by his mind and his conscience, rather than coerced by the State, prohibit appellees from requiring any of the appellants to contribute to the support of an ideological cause he may oppose as a condition of holding a job as a public school teacher.  Pp.  232-237.
(a) That appellants are compelled to make, rather than prohibited from making, contributions for political purposes works no less an infringement of their constitutional rights.  P.  234.
(b) The Constitution requires that a union's expenditures for ideological causes not germane to its duties as a collective bargaining representative be financed from charges, dues, or assessments paid by employees who do not object to advancing such causes and who are not coerced into doing so against their will by the threat of loss of governmental employment.  Pp.  234-235.
3. The Michigan Court of Appeals erred in holding that appellants were entitled to no relief even if they can prove their allegations and in depriving them of their right to such remedies as enjoining the Union from expending the service charges for ideological causes opposed by appellants, or ordering a refund of a portion of such charges, in the proportion such expenditures bear to the total Union expenditures.  Hanson, supra; Railway Clerks v. Allen, 373 U. S. 113.  In view, 
[211]
 however, of the fact that, since the commencement of this litigation, appellee Union has adopted an internal Union remedy for dissenters, it may be appropriate to defer further judicial proceedings pending the voluntary utilization by the parties of that internal remedy as a possible means of settling the dispute.

The federal enrollment and licensing laws, under which vessels engaged in domestic or coastwise trade or used for fishing are ""enrolled"" for the purpose of evidencing their national character and to enable them to obtain licenses regulating the use to which the vessels may be put held to preempt Virginia statutes that, in effect, prohibit nonresidents of Virginia from catching menhaden in the Virginia portion of Chesapeake Bay and that bar noncitizens (regardless of where they reside) from obtaining commercial fishing licenses for any kind of fish from Virginia.  Hence, under the Supremacy Clause, the Virginia laws cannot prevent appellees, whose fishing vessels, though foreign owned, have been federally licensed, from fishing for menhaden in Virginia's waters.

(a) Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824), decided three decades after the federal enrollment and licensing laws were enacted (and which have been reenacted without substantial change), established the invalidity of discriminatory state regulation of shipping as applied to vessels federally licensed to engage in the coasting trade, though subsequent decisions have permitted States to impose upon federal licensees reasonable nondiscriminatory conservation and environmental protection measures otherwise within the state police power.  Pp.  431 U. S. 274-279.
(b) The license does not merely establish the nationality of the vessel (which is performed by the enrollment), but ""implies, unequivocally, an authority to licensed vessels to carry on"" the activity for which they are licensed.  Gibbons, supra, at  22 U. S. 212. Pp.  431 U. S. 282.

No. 75-1439
Argued December 8, 1976
Decided May 23, 1977
431 U.S. 291

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who had been indicted in the Southern District of Iowa for mailing obscene materials in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1461, unavailingly sought to propound questions to the jury panel on voir dire relating to the panel members' knowledge of the contemporary community standards in that District with regard to the depiction of sex and nudity.  The case proceeded to trial and at the close of the Government's case and later, petitioner unsuccessfully moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on the grounds, inter alia, that the Iowa obscenity statute in effect at the time of petitioner's conduct, which proscribed only the dissemination of obscene materials to minors, set forth the applicable community standard, and that the prosecution had not proved that the materials at issue had offended that standard.  Petitioner was convicted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding (1) that petitioner's proposed community standards questions were impermissible, since they concerned the ultimate question of guilt or innocence, rather than juror qualifications, and (2) that the issue of offense to contemporary community standards was a federal question, and was not to be determined on the basis of the state obscenity law.
Held:
1. State law cannot define the contemporary community standards for appeal to the prurient interest and patent offensiveness that under Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, are applied in determining whether or not material is obscene, and the Iowa obscenity statute is therefore not conclusive as to those standards.  In federal prosecutions, such as this for violation of  1461, those issues are fact questions for the jury, to be judged in light of its understanding of contemporary community standards.  Pp.  431 U. S. 299-308.
(a) Though state legislatures are not completely foreclosed from setting substantive limitations for obscenity cases, they cannot declare what community standards shall be, any more than they could undertake to define ""reasonableness.""  Cf. Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87,  418 U. S. 104-105.  Pp.  431 U. S. 301-303.
(b) The community standards aspects of  1461 implicate federal, not state, law.  It is not material that the mailings here were solely intrastate, since  1461 was enacted under Congress' constitutional postal power, not the commerce power.  Pp.  431 U. S. 303-305. 
Page 431 U. S. 292

(c) Obscenity convictions remain reviewable on various grounds.  Pp.  431 U. S. 305-306.
(d) This Court's holding that the Iowa statute (which was properly admitted into evidence) is not conclusive on the issue of contemporary community standards does not nullify state law, but a State's right not to regulate in the obscenity field cannot correlatively compel the Federal Government to allow the mails to be used to send obscene materials into that State.  Pp.  431 U. S. 306-307.
2. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to ask the questions tendered by petitioner for voir dire about the jurors' understanding of community standards, which were no more appropriate than a request for a description of the meaning of ""reasonableness"" would have been.  P.  431 U. S. 308.
3. Section 1461 is not unconstitutionally vague as applied here, since the type of conduct covered by the statute can be ascertained with sufficient ease to avoid due process pitfalls. Cf. Hamling v. United States, supra. pp. 30309.

Syllabus 
The Illinois Driver Licensing Law authorizes the Secretary of State of Illinois to suspend or revoke a driver's license without preliminary hearing upon a showing by his records or other sufficient evidence that the driver's conduct falls into any of 18 enumerated categories, one of which is that the driver has been repeatedly convicted of offenses against traffic laws to a degree indicating
""lack of ability to exercise ordinary and reasonable care in the safe operation of a motor vehicle or disrespect for the traffic laws and the safety of other persons upon the highway.""
( 6-206(a)(3)).  Pursuant to this provision, the Secretary issued a regulation requiring revocation in the event a driver's license is otherwise suspended three times within a 10-year period.  Under the statutory scheme the Secretary must provide immediate written notice of a discretionary suspension or revocation and, within 20 days of his receiving a written request from the licensee, must schedule a full evidentiary hearing for a date ""as early as practical,"" and his final decision is subject to judicial review.  After the license of appellee, a truck driver, became subject to suspension under another section of the statute, the Secretary ordered the license revoked under  6-206(a)(3) and the corresponding rule.  Without requesting an administrative hearing, appellee brought this action challenging the constitutionality of  6-206(a)(3).  A three-judge District Court, relying on Bell v. Burson, 402 U. S. 535, granted appellee relief on the ground that a license cannot constitutionally be revoked under the challenged statute until after a hearing is held to determine whether the licensee meets the statutory criteria.
Held:  The Illinois statute, as implemented by the Secretary's regulations, is constitutionally adequate under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as analyzed in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319,  424 U. S. 333.  Pp.  431 U. S. 112-116.
(a) The nature of the private interest involved here (the granted license to operate a motor vehicle) is not so great as to require a departure from ""the ordinary principle . . . that something less than an evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action,""  Eldridge, supra at  424 U.

 hardship and for holders of commercial licenses, who are those most likely to be affected by the deprival of driving privileges.  P.  431 U. S. 113.
(b) The risk of an erroneous deprivation absent a prior hearing is not great and additional procedures would not significantly reduce the number of erroneous deprivations.

Syllabus 
The Illinois Driver Licensing Law authorizes the Secretary of State of Illinois to suspend or revoke a driver's license without preliminary hearing upon a showing by his records or other sufficient evidence that the driver's conduct falls into any of 18 enumerated categories, one of which is that the driver has been repeatedly convicted of offenses against traffic laws to a degree indicating
""lack of ability to exercise ordinary and reasonable care in the safe operation of a motor vehicle or disrespect for the traffic laws and the safety of other persons upon the highway.""
( 6-206(a)(3)).  Pursuant to this provision, the Secretary issued a regulation requiring revocation in the event a driver's license is otherwise suspended three times within a 10-year period.  Under the statutory scheme the Secretary must provide immediate written notice of a discretionary suspension or revocation and, within 20 days of his receiving a written request from the licensee, must schedule a full evidentiary hearing for a date ""as early as practical,"" and his final decision is subject to judicial review.  After the license of appellee, a truck driver, became subject to suspension under another section of the statute, the Secretary ordered the license revoked under  6-206(a)(3) and the corresponding rule.

Syllabus 
Appellees, five mentally ill individuals who were between 15 and 18 years old at the time the complaint was filed, were the named plaintiffs in an action challenging the constitutionality of a 1966 Pennsylvania statute governing the voluntary admission and voluntary commitment to state mental health institutions of persons aged 18 or younger.  Appellees sought to vindicate their constitutional rights and to represent a class consisting of all persons under 18 ""who have been, are, or, may be admitted or committed"" to state mental health facilities.  The statute provided, inter alia, that a juvenile might be admitted upon a parent's application, and that, unlike an adult, the admitted person was free to withdraw only with the consent of the parent admitting him.  After the commencement of the action, regulations were promulgated substantially increasing the procedural safeguards afforded minors aged 13 or older.  After those regulations had become effective, and notwithstanding the differentiation therein between juveniles of less than 13 and those 13 to 18, the District Court certified the class to be represented by the plaintiffs as consisting of all persons 18 or younger who have been or may be admitted or committed to Pennsylvania mental health facilities pursuant to the challenged provisions.  The District Court later issued a decision holding those provisions violative of due process.  In July, 1976, after that decision, and after this Court had noted probable jurisdiction, a new statute was enacted, repealing the provisions held to be unconstitutional except insofar as they relate to the mentally retarded.  Under the 1976 Act, a person 14 or over may voluntarily admit himself, but his parents may not do so; thus, those 14 to 18 who were subject to commitment by their parents under the 1966 Act are treated as adults by the 1976 Act.  Children 13 and younger may still be admitted for treatment by a parent.  Those f4 and over may withdraw from voluntary treatment by giving written notice.  Those under 14 may be released on the parent's request, and ""any responsible party"" may petition for release.
Held:
1. The enactment of the 1976 Act, which completely repealed and replaced the challenged provisions vis-a-vis the named appellees, clearly 
Page 431 U. S. 120
 moots the claims of the named appellees, who are treated as adults totally free to leave the hospital and who cannot be forced to return unless they consent to do so.  Pp.  431 U. S. 128-129.
2. The material changes in the status of those included in the class certified by the District Court that resulted from the 1976 Act and the regulations preclude an informed resolution of that class' constitutional claims.  Pp.  431 U. S. 129-133.
(a) Though the mootness of the claims of named plaintiffs does not ""inexorably"" require dismissal of the claims of the unnamed members of the class, Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393; Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U. S. 747, this Court has never adopted a flat rule that the mere fact of certification by a district court requires resolution of the merits of the claims of the unnamed members of the class when those of the named parties had become moot.  Pp.  431 U. S. 129-130.
(b) Here, the status of all members of the class, except those individuals who are younger than 13 and mentally retarded, has changed materially since this suit began; the intervening legislation has fragmented the class.  The propriety of the class certification is thus a matter of gravest doubt.  Cf. Indianapolis School Comm'rs v. Jacobs, 420 U. S. 128.  Pp.  431 U. S. 130-133.
(c) Moreover, the issue in this case with respect to a properly certified class is not one that is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review.""  Sosna, supra, distinguished.  P.  431 U. S. 133.
3. Since none of the critical factors that might allow adjudication of the claims of a class after mootness of the named plaintiffs' claims are present here, the case must be remanded to the District Court for reconsideration of the class definition, exclusion of those whose claims are moot, and substitution of class representatives with live claims.

No. 75-1906

431 U.S. 145

Syllabus 
Respondent and his codefendant, after robbing an intoxicated man in their car, abandoned him at night on an unlighted, rural road where the visibility was obscured by blowing snow.  Twenty or thirty minutes later, while helplessly seated in the road, the man was struck and killed by a speeding truck.  Respondent and his accomplice were subsequently convicted in a New York trial court of grand larceny, robbery, and second-degree murder.  A New York statute provides that a person is guilty of second-degree murder when,
""[u]nder circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another person.""
Although the element of causation was stressed in the arguments of both defense counsel and the prosecution at the trial, neither party requested an instruction on the meaning of the ""thereby causes"" language of the statute and none was given.  The trial judge, however, did read to the jury the statute and the indictment tracking the statutory language, and advised the jury that all elements of the crime charged must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and that a
""person acts recklessly with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur.""
Respondent's conviction was upheld on appeal, the New York Court of Appeals rejecting the argument that the truck driver's conduct constituted an intervening cause that relieved the defendants of criminal responsibility for the victim's death.  Respondent then filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, which refused to review, as not raising a question of constitutional dimension, respondent's attack on the sufficiency of the jury charge.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding, on the authority of In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, that, since the Constitution requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged, the failure to instruct the jury on an essential element as complex as the causation issue in this case created an impermissible risk that the jury had not made a finding that the Constitution requires. 
Page 431 U. S. 146

Held:  The trial judge's failure to instruct the jury on he issue of causation was not constitutional error requiring the District Court to grant habeas corpus relief.  Pp.  431 U. S. 153-157.
(a) The omission of the causation instruction did not create a danger that the jury failed to make an essential factual determination as required by Winship, supra, where there can be no question from the record that the jurors were informed that the issue of causation was an element which required decision, and where they were instructed that all elements of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  Pp.  431 U. S. 153-154.
(b) The opinion of the New York Court of Appeals makes it clear that an adequate instruction would have told the jury that, if the ultimate harm should have been foreseen as being reasonably related to the defendants' conduct, that conduct should be regarded as having caused the victim's death.  There is no reason to believe that the jury would have reached a different verdict if such an instruction had been given.  By returning a guilty verdict the jury necessarily found, in accordance with the trial court's instruction on recklessness, that respondent was ""aware of and consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk"" that death would occur.  This finding logically included a determination that the ultimate harm was foreseeable.  Pp.  431 U. S. 154-157.

Decided May 2, 1977
431 U.S. 63

Syllabus 
At the arraignment of respondent, who had been indicted in North Carolina for various state criminal offenses, he entered a guilty plea to a single count of attempted safe robbery.  In response to two of various form questions that under then-applicable procedures were put by the trial judge to those entering guilty pleas, respondent acknowledged that he understood that he could be imprisoned for a minimum of 10 years to a maximum of life, and that no one had made promises or threats to influence him to plead guilty.  Without further questioning, the judge accepted the plea on an ""Adjudication"" form, which, inter alia, recited that respondent had pleaded guilty to attempted safe robbery ""freely, understandingly and voluntarily,"" with full awareness of the consequences, and ""without undue . . . compulsion . . . duress, [or] promise of leniency.""  At a sentencing hearing three days later, respondent was sentenced to 17-21 years.  After unsuccessfully exhausting a state collateral remedy, respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus in a Federal District Court, claiming that his guilty plea had been induced by the promise of his attorney, who presumably had consulted with the judge and Solicitor, that he would get only a 10-year sentence.  He also stated that he was aware that he had been questioned by the judge before sentencing, but thought that he was going to get only 10 years, and had been instructed to answer the questions so that the court would accept the guilty plea.  The District Court granted a motion to dismiss the petition, on the ground that the form conclusively showed that respondent had chosen to plead guilty knowingly, voluntarily, and with full awareness of the consequences.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's allegation of a broken promise, as amplified by the explanation that his lawyer instructed him to deny the existence of any promises, was not foreclosed by his responses to the form questions, and that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing, at least in the absence of counteraffidavits conclusively proving the falsity of respondent's allegations.
Held:  In light of the nature of the record of the proceeding at which the guilty plea was accepted, and of the ambiguous status of the process of plea bargaining at the time the guilty plea was made, respondent's petition for a writ of habeas corpus should not have been summarily dismissed.

Decided May 2, 1977
431 U.S. 63

Syllabus 
At the arraignment of respondent, who had been indicted in North Carolina for various state criminal offenses, he entered a guilty plea to a single count of attempted safe robbery.  In response to two of various form questions that under then-applicable procedures were put by the trial judge to those entering guilty pleas, respondent acknowledged that he understood that he could be imprisoned for a minimum of 10 years to a maximum of life, and that no one had made promises or threats to influence him to plead guilty.  Without further questioning, the judge accepted the plea on an ""Adjudication"" form, which, inter alia, recited that respondent had pleaded guilty to attempted safe robbery ""freely, understandingly and voluntarily,"" with full awareness of the consequences, and ""without undue . . . compulsion . . . duress, [or] promise of leniency.""  At a sentencing hearing three days later, respondent was sentenced to 17-21 years.  After unsuccessfully exhausting a state collateral remedy, respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus in a Federal District Court, claiming that his guilty plea had been induced by the promise of his attorney, who presumably had consulted with the judge and Solicitor, that he would get only a 10-year sentence.  He also stated that he was aware that he had been questioned by the judge before sentencing, but thought that he was going to get only 10 years, and had been instructed to answer the questions so that the court would accept the guilty plea.

Syllabus 
A township ordinance prohibiting the posting of real estate ""For Sale"" and ""Sold"" signs for the purpose of stemming what the township perceived as the flight of white homeowners from a racially integrated community held to violate the First Amendment.  Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U. S. 748.  Pp.  431 U. S. 91-98.
(a) The ordinance cannot be sustained on the ground that it restricts only one method of communication while leaving ample alternative communication channels open.  The alternatives (primarily newspaper advertising and listing with real estate agents, which involve more cost and less autonomy than signs, are less likely to reach persons not deliberately seeking sales information, and may be less effective) are far from satisfactory.  And the ordinance is not genuinely concerned with the place (front lawns) or the manner (signs) of the speech, but rather proscribes particular types of signs based on their content because the township fears their ""primary"" effect -- that they will cause those receiving the information to act upon it.  Pp.  431 U. S. 93-94.
(b) Moreover, despite the importance of achieving the asserted goal of promoting stable, integrated housing, the ordinance cannot be upheld on the ground that it promotes an important governmental objective, since it does not appear that the ordinance was needed to achieve that objective and, in any event, the First Amendment disables the township from achieving that objective by restricting the free flow of truthful commercial information.

431 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
A 1962 statutory covenant between New Jersey and New York limited the ability of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to subsidize rail passenger transportation from revenues and reserves pledged as security for consolidated bonds issued by the Port Authority.  A 1974 New Jersey statute, together with a concurrent and parallel New York statute, retroactively repealed the 1962 covenant.  Appellant, both as a trustee for and as a holder of Port Authority bonds, brought suit in the New Jersey Superior Court for declaratory relief, claiming that the 1974 New Jersey statute impaired the obligation of the States' contract with the bondholders in violation of the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution.  The Superior Court dismissed the complaint after trial, holding that the statutory repeal was a reasonable exercise of New Jersey's police power and was not prohibited by the Contract Clause.  The New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The Contract Clause prohibits the retroactive repeal of the 1962 covenant.  Pp.  431 U. S. 14-32.
(a) The outright repeal of the 1962 covenant totally eliminated an important security provision for the bondholders, and thus impaired the obligation of the States' contract.  Pp.  431 U. S. 17-21.
(b) The security provision of the 1962 covenant was purely a financial 
Page 431 U. S. 2
 obligation, and thus not necessarily a compromise of the States' reserved powers that cannot be contracted away.  Pp.  431 U. S. 21-25.
(c) The repeal of the 1962 covenant cannot be sustained on the basis of Faitoute Iron & Steel Co. v. City of Asbury Park, 316 U. S. 502, and W. B. Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, 295 U. S. 56, simply because the bondholders' rights were not totally destroyed.  Pp.  431 U. S. 26-28.
(d) An impairment of contract such as is involved in this case can only be upheld if it is both reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose, but here the impairment was neither necessary to achieve the States' plan to encourage private automobile users to shift to public transportation nor reasonable in light of changed circumstances.  Total repeal of the 1962 covenant was not essential, since the States' plan could have been implemented with a less drastic modification of the covenant, and since, without modifying the covenant at all, the States could have adopted alternative means of achieving their twin goals of discouraging automobile use and improving mass transit.  Nor can the repeal be claimed to be reasonable on the basis of the need for mass transportation, energy conservation, and environmental protection, since the 1962 covenant was adopted with knowledge of such concerns.

No. 75-1221
Argued December 6, 1976
Decided April 26, 1977*
430 U.S. 725

Syllabus 
Under  801(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, an insurance company is considered a life insurance company for federal tax purposes if its life insurance reserves constitute more than 50% of its ""total reserves,"" as that term is defined in  801(c).  Qualifying companies are accorded preferential tax treatment.  The question here is how unearned premium reserves for accident and health (nonlife) insurance policies should be allocated between a primary insurer and a reinsurer for purposes of applying the 50% test.  The unearned premium reserve is the basic insurance reserve in the casualty insurance business, and an important component of ""total reserves"" under  801(c)(2).  The taxpayers contend that, by virtue of certain reinsurance agreements (""treaties""), they have maintained nonlife reserves below the 50% level.  These treaties were of two basic types:  (1) Treaty I, whereby the taxpayer served as reinsurer, and the ""other party"" was the primary insurer or ceding company; and (2) Treaty II, whereby the taxpayer served as the primary insurer and ceded a portion of the business to the ""other party,"" the reinsurer.  Both types of treaties provided that the other party would hold the premium dollars derived from accident and health business until such time as the premiums were ""earned,"" i.e., attributable to the insurance protection provided during the portion of the policy term already elapsed.  The other party also set up on its books the corresponding unearned premium reserve, relieving the taxpayer of that requirement, even though the taxpayer assumed all substantial insurance risks.  In each case, the taxpayer and the other party reported their affairs annually in this way to both the Internal Revenue Service and the appropriate state insurance departments.  Despite the state authorities' acceptance of these annual statements, the 
Page 430 U. S. 726
 Government argues that the unearned premium reserves must be allocated or attributed for tax purposes from the other parties to the taxpayers, with the result that the taxpayers fail the 50% test, and thus are disqualified from preferential tax treatment, primarily because, in the Government's view,  801 embodies a rule that ""insurance reserves follow the insurance risk.""
Held:
1. The reinsurance treaties served valid business purposes, and, contrary to the Government's argument, were not sham transactions without economic substance.  Pp.  430 U. S. 736-739.
2. Since the taxpayers neither held the unearned premium dollars nor set up the corresponding unearned premium reserves, and since that treatment was in accord with customary practice as policed by the state regulatory authorities,  801(c)(2) does not permit attribution to the taxpayers of the reserves held by the other parties to the reinsurance treaties.  Pp.  430 U. S. 739-750.
(a) The language of  801(c)(2) does not suggest that Congress intended a ""reserves follow the risk"" rule to govern determinations under  801.  Pp.  430 U. S. 740-741.
(b) Nor does the legislative history of  801 furnish support for the Government's interpretation.  Pp.  430 U. S. 742-745.
(c) Section 820 of the Code, prescribing the tax treatment of modified coinsurance contracts, affords an unmistakable indication that Congress did not intend  801 to embody a ""reserves follow the risk"" rule.  Pp.  430 U. S. 745-750
3. Nor is attribution of unearned premium reserves to the taxpayers required under  801(c)(3), counting in total reserves ""all other insurance reserves required by law.""  There is no indication that state statutory law in these cases required the taxpayers to set up and maintain the contested unearned premium reserves, especially since the insurance departments of the affected States consistently accepted annual reports showing reserves held as the taxpayers claim they should be.  Pp.  430 U. S. 750-752.

			"|"United States v. Consumer Life Insurance Co.
No. 75-1221
Argued December 6, 1976
Decided April 26, 1977*
430 U.S. 725

Syllabus 
Under  801(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, an insurance company is considered a life insurance company for federal tax purposes if its life insurance reserves constitute more than 50% of its ""total reserves,"" as that term is defined in  801(c).  Qualifying companies are accorded preferential tax treatment.  The question here is how unearned premium reserves for accident and health (nonlife) insurance policies should be allocated between a primary insurer and a reinsurer for purposes of applying the 50% test.  The unearned premium reserve is the basic insurance reserve in the casualty insurance business, and an important component of ""total reserves"" under  801(c)(2).  The taxpayers contend that, by virtue of certain reinsurance agreements (""treaties""), they have maintained nonlife reserves below the 50% level.  These treaties were of two basic types:  (1) Treaty I, whereby the taxpayer served as reinsurer, and the ""other party"" was the primary insurer or ceding company; and (2) Treaty II, whereby the taxpayer served as the primary insurer and ceded a portion of the business to the ""other party,"" the reinsurer.  Both types of treaties provided that the other party would hold the premium dollars derived from accident and health business until such time as the premiums were ""earned,"" i.e., attributable to the insurance protection provided during the portion of the policy term already elapsed.  The other party also set up on its books the corresponding unearned premium reserve, relieving the taxpayer of that requirement, even though the taxpayer assumed all substantial insurance risks.  In each case, the taxpayer and the other party reported their affairs annually in this way to both the Internal Revenue Service and the appropriate state insurance departments.  Despite the state authorities' acceptance of these annual statements, the 
Page 430 U. S. 726
 Government argues that the unearned premium reserves must be allocated or attributed for tax purposes from the other parties to the taxpayers, with the result that the taxpayers fail the 50% test, and thus are disqualified from preferential tax treatment, primarily because, in the Government's view,  801 embodies a rule that ""insurance reserves follow the insurance risk.""
Held:
1. The reinsurance treaties served valid business purposes, and, contrary to the Government's argument, were not sham transactions without economic substance.  Pp.  430 U. S. 736-739.
2. Since the taxpayers neither held the unearned premium dollars nor set up the corresponding unearned premium reserves, and since that treatment was in accord with customary practice as policed by the state regulatory authorities,  801(c)(2) does not permit attribution to the taxpayers of the reserves held by the other parties to the reinsurance treaties.  Pp.  430 U. S. 739-750.
(a) The language of  801(c)(2) does not suggest that Congress intended a ""reserves follow the risk"" rule to govern determinations under  801.  Pp.  430 U. S. 740-741.
(b) Nor does the legislative history of  801 furnish support for the Government's interpretation.  Pp.  430 U. S. 742-745.
(c) Section 820 of the Code, prescribing the tax treatment of modified coinsurance contracts, affords an unmistakable indication that Congress did not intend  801 to embody a ""reserves follow the risk"" rule.  Pp.  430 U. S. 745-750
3. Nor is attribution of unearned premium reserves to the taxpayers required under  801(c)(3), counting in total reserves ""all other insurance reserves required by law.""  There is no indication that state statutory law in these cases required the taxpayers to set up and maintain the contested unearned premium reserves, especially since the insurance departments of the affected States consistently accepted annual reports showing reserves held as the taxpayers claim they should be.  Pp.  430 U. S. 750-752.

 In this case, the Court of Appeals held that dredging by the Army Corps of Engineers is exempt from state water-pollution regulations. 543 F.2d 1198 (C.A. [Footnote 8] 1976).

 Congress was cautious indeed in allowing exceptions, as shown by the remainder of 313.

No. 75-1453
Argued November 29, 1976
Decided April 20, 1977
430 U.S. 705

Syllabus 
New Hampshire statutes require that noncommercial motor vehicles bear license plates embossed with the state motto, ""Live Free or Die,"" and make it a misdemeanor to obscure the motto.  Appellees, Maynard and his wife, who are followers of the Jehovah's Witnesses faith, view the motto as repugnant to their moral, religious, and political beliefs, and accordingly they covered up the motto on the license plates of their jointly owned family automobiles.  Appellee Maynard was subsequently found guilty in state court of violating the misdemeanor statute on three separate charges, and, upon refusing to pay the fines imposed, was sentenced to, and served, 15 days in jail.  Appellees then brought this action in Federal District Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against enforcement of the New Hampshire statutes; a three-judge court enjoined the State from arresting and prosecuting appellees in the future for covering the motto on their license plates.
Held:
1. The principles of equitable restraint enunciated in Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, do not preclude the District Court from exercising jurisdiction.  Pp.  430 U. S. 709-712.
(a) When a genuine threat of state prosecutions exists, a litigant is entitled to resort to a federal forum to seek redress for an alleged deprivation of federal rights, and, aside from Younger principles, may seek such redress under  42 U.S.C.  1983.  Pp.  430 U. S. 709-710.
(b) When the relief sought is wholly prospective, i.e., to preclude further prosecution under a statute alleged to violate constitutional rights, failure to seek state appellate review of criminal convictions does not bar relief in federal court.  Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S. 592, distinguished.  Pp.  430 U. S. 710-711.
(c) The threat of repeated prosecutions in the future against both appellees, and the effect of such a continuing threat on their ability to perform the ordinary tasks of daily life that require an automobile, are sufficient to justify injunctive relief, and hence the District Court was not limited to granting declaratory relief.  Pp.  430 U. S. 711-712.
2. The State may not constitutionally require an individual to participate 
Page 430 U. S. 706
 in the dissemination of an ideological message by displaying it on his private property in a manner and for the express purpose that it be observed and read by the public. Pp. 71717.
(a) New Hampshire's statute, by forcing an individual, as part of his daily life -- indeed, constantly while his automobile is in public view -- to be an instrument for advocating public adherence to an ideological point of view he finds unacceptable, ""invades the sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First Amendment . . . to reserve from all official control,"" Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624,  319 U. S. 642.  Pp.  430 U. S. 714-715.
(b) The State's claimed interests in requiring display of the state motto on license plates (1) so as to facilitate the identification of passenger vehicles, and (2) so as to promote appreciation of history, individualism, and state pride, are not sufficiently compelling to justify infringement of appellees' First Amendment rights.  The purpose of the first interest could be achieved by less drastic means, and the second interest cannot outweigh an individual's First Amendment right to avoid becoming the courier for the State's ideological message.  Pp.  430 U. S. 715-717.
406 F.Supp. 1381, affirmed.
BURGER, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BRENNAN, STEWART, MARSHALL, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ., joined, and in which WHITE, J., joined, except insofar as it affirms the District Court's issuance of an injunction.  WHITE, J., filed a opinion dissenting in part, in which BLACKMUN and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined, post, p.  430 U. S. 717.

(a) When a genuine threat of state prosecutions exists, a litigant is entitled to resort to a federal forum to seek redress for an alleged deprivation of federal rights, and, aside from Younger principles, may seek such redress under  42 U.S.C.  1983.  Pp.  430 U. S. 709-710.
(b) When the relief sought is wholly prospective, i.e., to preclude further prosecution under a statute alleged to violate constitutional rights, failure to seek state appellate review of criminal convictions does not bar relief in federal court.  Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S. 592, distinguished.  Pp.  430 U. S. 710-711.
(c) The threat of repeated prosecutions in the future against both appellees, and the effect of such a continuing threat on their ability to perform the ordinary tasks of daily life that require an automobile, are sufficient to justify injunctive relief, and hence the District Court was not limited to granting declaratory relief.  Pp.  430 U. S. 711-712.
2. The State may not constitutionally require an individual to participate 
Page 430 U. S. 706
 in the dissemination of an ideological message by displaying it on his private property in a manner and for the express purpose that it be observed and read by the public. Pp. 71717.
(a) New Hampshire's statute, by forcing an individual, as part of his daily life -- indeed, constantly while his automobile is in public view -- to be an instrument for advocating public adherence to an ideological point of view he finds unacceptable, ""invades the sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First Amendment . . . to reserve from all official control,"" Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624,  319 U. S. 642.  Pp.  430 U. S. 714-715.
(b) The State's claimed interests in requiring display of the state motto on license plates (1) so as to facilitate the identification of passenger vehicles, and (2) so as to promote appreciation of history, individualism, and state pride, are not sufficiently compelling to justify infringement of appellees' First Amendment rights.  The purpose of the first interest could be achieved by less drastic means, and the second interest cannot outweigh an individual's First Amendment right to avoid becoming the courier for the State's ideological message.  Pp.  430 U. S. 715-717.

430 U.S. 641

Syllabus 
Respondents, enrolled Coeur d'Alene Indians, were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of burglary, robbery, and murder of a non-Indian within the boundaries of their reservation.  One respondent was convicted of second-degree murder only; the other two were convicted of all three crimes as charged, including first-degree murder under the felony murder provisions of the federal enclave murder statute, 18 U.S.C.  1111, as made applicable to Indians by the Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C.  1153.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that respondents had been denied their constitutional rights under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.  The court agreed with respondents' contention that their felony murder convictions were racially discriminatory, since a non-Indian charged with the same crime would have been subject to prosecution only under Idaho law, under which premeditation and deliberation would have had to be proved, whereas no such elements were required under the felony murder provisions of 18 U.S.C.  1111.
Held:  Respondent Indians were not deprived of the equal protection of the laws.  Pp.  430 U. S. 645-650.
(a) The federal criminal statutes enforced here are based neither in whole nor in part upon impermissible racial classifications.  Federal regulation of Indian tribes is rooted in the unique status of Indians as ""a separate people"" with their own political institutions, and is not to be viewed as legislation of a ""racial' group consisting of Indians.' . . .""  Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535,  417 U. S. 553 n. 24.  Pp.  430 U. S. 645-647.
(b) The challenged statutes do not otherwise violate equal protection.  Respondents were subjected to the same body of law as any other individuals, Indian or non-Indian, charged with first-degree murder committed in a federal enclave.  Congress has undoubted power to prescribe a criminal code applicable to Indian country, and the disparity between federal law and Idaho law has no equal protection or other constitutional significance.

No. 75-6527
Argued November 2, 1976
Decided April 19, 1977
430 U.S. 651

Syllabus 
Petitioners, pupils in a Dade County, Fla., junior high school, filed this action in Federal District Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1981-1988 for damages and injunctive and declaratory relief against respondent school officials, alleging that petitioners and other students had been subjected to disciplinary corporal punishment in violation of their constitutional rights.  The Florida statute then in effect authorized corporal punishment after the teacher had consulted with the principal or teacher in charge of the school, specifying that the punishment was not to be ""degrading or unduly severe.""  A School Board regulation contained specific directions and limitations, authorizing punishment administered to a recalcitrant student's buttocks with a wooden paddle.  The evidence showed that the paddling of petitioners was exceptionally harsh.  The District Court granted respondents' motion to dismiss the complaint, finding no basis for constitutional relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment does not apply to disciplinary corporal punishment in public schools.  Pp.  430 U. S. 664-671.
(a) The history of the Eighth Amendment and the decisions of this Court make it clear that the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment was designed to protect those convicted of crime.  Pp.  430 U. S. 664-668.
(b) There is no need to wrench the Eighth Amendment from its historical context and extend it to public school disciplinary practices.  The openness of the public school and its supervision by the community afford significant safeguards against the kinds of abuses from which that Amendment protects convicted criminals.  These safeguards are reinforced by the legal constraints of the common law, whereby any punishment going beyond that which is reasonably necessary for the proper education and discipline of the child may result in both civil and criminal liability.  Pp.  430 U. S. 668-671.
2. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require notice and hearing prior to imposition of corporal punishment as that practice is authorized and limited by the common law.  Pp.  430 U. S. 672-682. 
Page 430 U. S. 652

(a) Liberty within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment is implicated where public school authorities, acting under color of state law, deliberately punish a child for misconduct by restraint and infliction of appreciable physical pain.  Freedom from bodily restraint and punishment is within the liberty interest in personal security that has historically been protected from state deprivation without due process of law.  Pp.  430 U. S. 672-674.
(b) Under the longstanding accommodation between the child's interest in personal security and the traditional common law privilege, there can be no deprivation of substantive rights as long as the corporal punishment remains within the limits of that privilege.  The child nonetheless has a strong interest in procedural safeguards that minimize the risk of wrongful punishment and provide for the resolution of disputed questions of justification.  Pp. 675-676.
(c) The Florida scheme, considered in light of the openness of the school environment, affords significant protection against unjustified corporal punishment of school children.  The teacher and principal must exercise prudence and restraint when they decide that corporal punishment is necessary for disciplinary purposes.  If the punishment is later found to be excessive, they may be held liable in damages or be subject to criminal penalties.  Where the State has thus preserved what ""has always been the law of the land,"" United States v. Barnett, 376 U. S. 681,  376 U. S. 692, the case for administrative safeguards is significantly less compelling than it would otherwise be.  Pp.  430 U. S. 676-680.
(d) Imposing additional administrative safeguards as a constitutional requirement would significantly intrude into the area of educational responsibility that lies primarily with the public school authorities.  Prior procedural safeguards require a diversion of educational resources, and school authorities may abandon corporal punishment as a disciplinary measure rather than incur the burdens of complying with procedural requirements.  The incremental benefit of invoking the Constitution to impose prior notice and a hearing cannot justify the costs.  Pp.  430 U. S. 680-682.

Syllabus 
Appellant Society, a nonprofit corporation with headquarters in the District of Columbia, which maintains two offices in California that solicit advertising for the Society's magazine but perform no activities related to the Society's mail-order business for the sale from the District of Columbia of maps, atlases, globes, and books, challenges the constitutionality of California's use tax, as applied to the Society's mail-order activities, which requires every retailer engaged in business in that State and making sales of tangible personal property for storage, use, or other consumption in that State to collect from the purchaser a use tax in lieu of the sales tax imposed on local retailers.  Orders for the Society's sales items are mailed from California directly to appellant's headquarters on coupons or forms enclosed with announcements mailed to Society members and magazine subscribers or on order forms contained in the magazine.
Held:  California's imposition of the use-tax-collection liability on the Society's mail-order operation does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Commerce Clause, since the Society's continuous presence in California in the two offices provides a sufficient nexus between the appellant and the State to justify imposition of the use tax collection liability as applied to appellant.  The out-of-state seller appellant runs no risk of double taxation, as the consumer's identification as a resident of the taxing State is obvious, and appellant becomes liable for the tax only by failing or refusing to collect it from the resident consumer.  Nor, contrary to appellant's contention, is it material that there is no relationship between the appellant's sales activity in California and the two advertising offices, for, without regard to the nature of the offices' activities, they had the advantage of the same municipal services as they would have had if their activities had included assistance to the mail-order operations.

No. 76-120

430 U.S. 564

Syllabus 
After a deadlocked jury was discharged when unable to agree upon a verdict at the criminal contempt trial of respondent corporations, the District Judge granted respondents' timely motions for judgments of acquittal under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 29(c), which provides that ""a motion for judgment of acquittal may be made . . . within 7 days after the jury is discharged [and] the court may enter judgment of acquittal. . . .""  The Government appealed pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  3731, which allows an appeal by the United States in a criminal case
""to a court of appeals from a . . . judgment . . . of a district court dismissing an indictment . . . except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.""
The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal.
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause bars appellate review and retrial following a judgment of acquittal entered under Rule 29(c).  Pp.  430 U. S. 568-576.
(a) The ""controlling constitutional principle"" of the Double Jeopardy Clause focuses on prohibitions against multiple trials, United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332,  420 U. S. 346, and where an appeal by the Government presents no threat of successive prosecutions, the Clause is not offended.  Pp.  430 U. S. 568-570.
(b) The normal policy granting the Government the right to retry a defendant after a mistrial that does not determine the outcome of a trial does not apply here, since valid judgments of acquittal were entered on the express authority of, and in strict compliance with, Rule 29(c), and a successful governmental appeal reversing the judgments of acquittal would necessitate another trial or further proceedings to resolve factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged.  Pp.  430 U. S. 570-571.
(c) The judgments of acquittal here were ""acquittals"" in substance as well as form, since the District Court plainly granted the Rule 29(c) motion on the express view that the Government had not proved facts constituting criminal contempt.  Pp.  430 U. S. 571-572.
(d) Rule 29 recognizes no legal distinction between judge and jury with respect to the invocation of the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  P.  430 U. S. 573. 
Page 430 U. S. 565

(e) Rule 29 contemplated no artificial distinctions between situations where the judge enters a judgment of acquittal prior to submission of the case to the jury under Rule 29(a), or after submission but prior to the jury's return of a verdict under Rule 29(b), and the jury is thereafter discharged, and the situation involved here, where the judge chose to await the outcome of the jury's deliberations and, upon its failure to reach a verdict, acted on a timely motion for acquittal after the jury's discharge.

			"|"United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.
No. 76-120
Argued February 23, 1977
Decided April 4, 1977
430 U.S. 564

Syllabus 
After a deadlocked jury was discharged when unable to agree upon a verdict at the criminal contempt trial of respondent corporations, the District Judge granted respondents' timely motions for judgments of acquittal under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 29(c), which provides that ""a motion for judgment of acquittal may be made . . . within 7 days after the jury is discharged [and] the court may enter judgment of acquittal. . . .""  The Government appealed pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  3731, which allows an appeal by the United States in a criminal case
""to a court of appeals from a . . . judgment . . . of a district court dismissing an indictment . . . except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.""
The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal.
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause bars appellate review and retrial following a judgment of acquittal entered under Rule 29(c).  Pp.  430 U. S. 568-576.
(a) The ""controlling constitutional principle"" of the Double Jeopardy Clause focuses on prohibitions against multiple trials, United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332,  420 U. S. 346, and where an appeal by the Government presents no threat of successive prosecutions, the Clause is not offended.  Pp.  430 U. S. 568-570.
(b) The normal policy granting the Government the right to retry a defendant after a mistrial that does not determine the outcome of a trial does not apply here, since valid judgments of acquittal were entered on the express authority of, and in strict compliance with, Rule 29(c), and a successful governmental appeal reversing the judgments of acquittal would necessitate another trial or further proceedings to resolve factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged.  Pp.  430 U. S. 570-571.
(c) The judgments of acquittal here were ""acquittals"" in substance as well as form, since the District Court plainly granted the Rule 29(c) motion on the express view that the Government had not proved facts constituting criminal contempt.  Pp.  430 U. S. 571-572.
(d) Rule 29 recognizes no legal distinction between judge and jury with respect to the invocation of the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  P.  430 U. S. 573. 
Page 430 U. S. 565

(e) Rule 29 contemplated no artificial distinctions between situations where the judge enters a judgment of acquittal prior to submission of the case to the jury under Rule 29(a), or after submission but prior to the jury's return of a verdict under Rule 29(b), and the jury is thereafter discharged, and the situation involved here, where the judge chose to await the outcome of the jury's deliberations and, upon its failure to reach a verdict, acted on a timely motion for acquittal after the jury's discharge.  United States v. Sanford, 429 U. S. 14, distinguished.  Pp.  430 U. S. 573-575.
534 F.2d 585, affirmed.

Syllabus 
Both the language and legislative history of the Acts of 1904, 1907, and 1910, whereby land in certain counties in South Dakota located within the boundaries of the Rosebud Sioux Reservation as defined in an 1889 Treaty was required to be ceded by the Reservation Indians to the Government for sale to settlers under the homestead and townsite laws with the proceeds to be credited to the Indians only as received or, with respect to certain parcels, for transfer to South Dakota for school use, held clearly to evidence a congressional intent to diminish the boundaries of the Reservation.  Although such Acts were unilateral Acts of Congress without the consent of three-fourths of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe's adult male members, as was required by the original 1868 Treaty establishing the Reservation, that fact does not directly bear on the question whether Congress, by these later Acts, intended to diminish the Reservation boundaries.  Nor is it conclusive with respect to congressional intent that these Acts changed the method of payment from an outright, fixed-sum payment to the Indians required by a 1901 Agreement that would have amended the 1889 Treaty and would have resulted in a diminution of the Reservation boundaries, but which, although approved by three-fourths of the Tribe's adult male members, was never ratified by Congress.

No. 75-1053
Argued December 7, 1976
Decided March 29, 1977*
430 U.S. 519

Syllabus 
Section 12211 of the California Business and Professions Code provides that
""the average weight or measure of the packages or containers in a lot of any . . . commodity sampled shall not be less, at the time of sale or offer for sale, than the net weight or measure stated upon the package.""
Article 5,  2930 et seq., of Title 4 of the California Administrative Code, in implementing  12211, requires a statistical sampling process for determining the average net weight of a lot, which implicitly allows for variations from stated weight caused by unavoidable deviations in the manufacturing process, but makes no allowance for loss of weight resulting from moisture loss during the course of good distribution practice.  Petitioner county Director of Weights and Measures, pursuant to  12211, ordered removed from sale bacon packaged by respondent packing company and flour packaged by respondent millers after he had determined under Art. 5 that the packages were contained in lots whose average net weights were less than the net weights stated on the packages.  Respondent packing company's bacon is also subject to inspection under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), as amended by the Wholesome Meat Act, which requires a meat or a meat product package to bear a label showing, inter alia, an accurate statement of the quantity of the contents in terms of weight, but permits ""reasonable variations""; and implementing regulations permit
""reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practices or by unavoidable deviation in good manufacturing practice.""
The FMIA prohibits labeling or packaging requirements ""different than"" those imposed under that statute.  The federal law governing net weight labeling of respondent millers' flour is contained in 
Page 430 U. S. 520
 the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA), which impose the same federal weight labeling standard for flour as the FMIA imposes for meat.  The FDCA and implementing regulations permit the same kind of reasonable variations from the packaging requirements as does the FMIA and its implementing regulations.  The FDCA contains no preemptive language, but the FPLA in 15 U.S.C.  1461 provides that the Act supersedes any state laws that are ""less stringent than or require information different from"" the requirements of the FPLA or its implementing regulations.  Respondents brought suits in Federal District Court, seeking declarations that  12211 and Art. 5 were preempted by the federal laws and injunctions against enforcement of those provisions.  The District Court granted the requested relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. With respect to respondent packing company's packaged bacon,  12211 and Art. 5 are preempted by the FMIA.  Since California makes no allowance for loss of weight resulting from moisture loss during the course of good distribution practice, the state law's requirement -- that the label accurately state the net weight, with implicit allowance only for reasonable manufacturing variations -- is ""different than"" the federal requirement, which permits manufacturing deviations and variations caused by moisture loss during good distribution practice.  Pp.  430 U. S. 528-532.
2. Although 15 U.S.C.  1461 does not preempt  12211 as implemented by Art. 5, since it appears that the California law is not ""less stringent than,"" and does not ""require information different from,"" the FPLA and implementing regulations, nevertheless, with regard to respondent millers' flour, enforcement of  12211, as implemented by Art. 5, would prevent ""the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,"" Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,  312 U. S. 67, in passing the FPLA, an impermissible result under the Constitution, and hence the state law must yield to the federal.  The goal of the FPLA to facilitate value comparisons among similar products cannot be accomplished unless packages that bear the same indicated weight in fact contain the same quantity of the product for which the consumer is paying.  Here, packages of flour that meet the federal labeling requirements and that have the same stated quantity of contents can be expected to contain the same amount of flour solids, since variations from stated weight caused by loss of moisture are permitted, whereas, as a result of the application of the California standard, which does not permit such variations, consumers who attempt to compare the value of identically labeled packages of flour would not be comparing packages 
Page 430 U. S. 521
 that contain identical amounts of flour solids, and hence would be misled.  Pp.  430 U. S. 532-543.

430 U.S. 387

Syllabus 
Respondent was arrested, arraigned, and committed to jail in Davenport, Iowa, for abducting a 10-year-old girl in Des Moines, Iowa.  Both his Des Moines lawyer and his lawyer at the Davenport arraignment advised respondent not to make any statements until after consulting with the Des Moines lawyer upon being returned to Des Moines, and the police officers who were to accompany respondent on the automobile drive back to Des Moines agreed not to question him during the trip.  During the trip, respondent expressed no willingness to be interrogated in the absence of an attorney, but instead stated several times that he would tell the whole story after seeing his Des Moines lawyer.  However, one of the police officers, who knew that respondent was a former mental patient and was deeply religious, sought to obtain incriminating remarks from respondent by stating to him during the drive that he felt they should stop and locate the girl's body because her parents were entitled to a Christian burial for the girl, who was taken away from them on Christmas Eve.  Respondent eventually made several incriminating statements in the course of the trip, and finally directed the police to the girl's body.  Respondent was tried and convicted of murder, over his objections to the admission of evidence relating to or resulting from any statements he made during the automobile ride, and the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed, holding, as did the trial court, that respondent had waived his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel.  Respondent then petitioned for habeas corpus in Federal District Court, which held that the evidence in question had been wrongly admitted at respondent's trial on the ground, inter alia, that he had been denied his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel, and further ruled that he had not waived that right.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Petitioner warden claims that the District Court, in making its findings of fact, disregarded 28 U.S.C.  2254(d), which provides that, subject to certain exceptions, federal habeas corpus courts shall accept as correct the factual determinations made by state courts.
Held:
1. The District Court correctly applied 28 U.S.C.  2254(d) in its 
Page 430 U. S. 388
 resolution of the disputed evidentiary facts where it appears that it made no findings of fact in conflict with those of the Iowa courts, and that its additional findings of fact based upon its examination of the state court record were conscientiously and carefully explained, and were approved by the Court of Appeals as being supported by the record. Pp. 395-397.
2. Respondent was deprived of his constitutional right to assistance of counsel.  Pp.  430 U. S. 397-401.
(a) The right to counsel granted by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments means at least that a person is entitled to a lawyer's help at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against him, and here there is no doubt that judicial proceedings had been initiated against respondent before the automobile trip started, since a warrant had been issued for his arrest, he had been arraigned, and had been committed to jail.  Pp.  430 U. S. 398-399.
(b) An individual against whom adversary proceedings have commenced has a right to legal representation when the government interrogates him, Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201, and since here the police officer's ""Christian burial speech"" was tantamount to interrogation, respondent was entitled to the assistance of counsel at the time he made the incriminating statements.  Pp.  430 U. S. 399-401.
3. The circumstances of record provide, when viewed in light of respondent's assertions of his right to counsel, no reasonable basis for finding that respondent waived his right to the assistance of counsel, the record falling far short of sustaining the State's burden to prove ""an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege,"" Johnson v.

(a) The right to counsel granted by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments means at least that a person is entitled to a lawyer's help at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against him, and here there is no doubt that judicial proceedings had been initiated against respondent before the automobile trip started, since a warrant had been issued for his arrest, he had been arraigned, and had been committed to jail.  Pp.  430 U. S. 398-399.
(b) An individual against whom adversary proceedings have commenced has a right to legal representation when the government interrogates him, Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201, and since here the police officer's ""Christian burial speech"" was tantamount to interrogation, respondent was entitled to the assistance of counsel at the time he made the incriminating statements.  Pp.  430 U. S. 399-401.
3. The circumstances of record provide, when viewed in light of respondent's assertions of his right to counsel, no reasonable basis for finding that respondent waived his right to the assistance of counsel, the record falling far short of sustaining the State's burden to prove ""an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege,"" Johnson v.

Decided March 23, 1977*
430 U.S. 442

Syllabus 
Upon finding that the existing state statutory remedies and common law actions for negligence and wrongful death were inadequate to protect employees from death and injury due to unsafe working conditions, Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA), under which a new statutory duty was imposed on employers to avoid maintaining unsafe working conditions.  Two new remedies were provided by permitting the Federal Government, proceeding before an administrative agency, (1) to obtain abatement orders requiring employers to correct unsafe working conditions, and (2) to impose civil penalties on any employer maintaining any unsafe working condition.  If an employer contests a penalty or abatement order, an evidentiary hearing is then held before an administrative law judge of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (Commission), who is empowered to affirm, modify, or vacate the proposed abatement order and penalty.  The judge's decision becomes the Commission's final, appealable order, subject to review by the full Commission.  If such review is granted, the Commission's subsequent order directing abatement and payment of a penalty becomes final unless the employer petitions for judicial review in the appropriate court of appeals, but the Commission's findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive.  If the employer fails to pay the assessed penalty, the Secretary of Labor may commence a collection action in a federal district court in which neither the fact of the violation nor the propriety of the penalty assessed may be retried.  In the instant cases separate abatement orders were issued and penalties proposed against petitioners for violations of safety standards promulgated under OSHA.  After hearings were held before Administrative Law Judges when petitioners each contested the orders 
Page 430 U. S. 443
 and penalties, and the judges and later the Commission had affirmed the findings of violations and the abatement orders and had assessed penalties, petitioners sought judicial review in the Courts of Appeals, challenging both the Commission's factual findings that violations had occurred and the constitutionality of OSHA's enforcement procedures.  Each Court of Appeals affirmed the Commission's orders over each petitioner's contention that the failure to afford the employer a jury trial on the question whether it had violated OSHA contravened the Seventh Amendment, which provides that, ""[i]n Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.""
Held:  The Seventh Amendment does not prevent Congress from assigning to an administrative agency the task of adjudicating violations of OSHA.  When Congress creates new statutory ""public rights,"" it may assign their adjudication to an administrative agency with which a jury trial would be incompatible, without violating the Seventh Amendment's injunction that jury trial is to be ""preserved"" in ""suits at common law.""  That Amendment was never intended to establish the jury as the exclusive mechanism for factfinding in civil cases, but took the existing legal order as it found it, and hence there is little or no basis for now interpreting it as providing an impenetrable barrier to administrative factfinding under otherwise valid federal regulatory statutes.  The Amendment did not render Congress powerless -- when it concluded that remedies available in courts of law were inadequate to cope with a problem within its power to regulate -- so to create such new public rights and remedies by statute and commit their enforcement, if it chose, to a tribunal other than a court of law (such as an administrative agency) in which facts are not found by juries.

Syllabus 
Delaware's ""short-form merger"" statute enables a parent company owning at least 90% of the stock of a subsidiary to merge with the subsidiary upon approval of the parent company's board of directors, and to make cash payments for the minority shareholders' shares.  Though advance notice to or consent of the minority shareholders is not required, they must be notified within 10 days of the merger's effective date, and any dissatisfied minority shareholder may petition the Delaware Court of Chancery for the payment of the fair value of his shares as determined by a court-appointed appraiser subject to court review.  Pursuant to that statutory procedure, petitioner Santa Fe Industries, which had acquired 95% control of another company (Kirby), after obtaining independent appraisals of Kirby's assets and submitting them with financial data to a banking firm to appraise the Kirby stock's fair market value, decided to offer the minority stockholders $150 per share, which was more than the banking firm's appraisal.  The minority stockholders were notified the day after the merger became effective, and advised of their right to obtain an appraisal if dissatisfied with the $150 price, and were given an information statement containing relevant financial data about Kirby, the appraisals of its assets, and the banking firm's stock appraisal.  Respondents, minority stockholders who objected to the merger, instead of pursuing their Delaware appraisal remedy, brought this action in District Court seeking to set aside the merger and to recover the fair value for their stock, which they claimed was at least $772 per share.  Respondents alleged that the Kirby stock had been fraudulently appraised in an effort to freeze out the minority stockholders at an inadequate price, in violation of  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which makes it
""unlawful for any person . . . [t]o use or employ . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of [Securities and Exchange Commission rules],""
and Rule 10b-5, issued thereunder, which, in addition to nondisclosure and misrepresentation, prohibits any ""artifice to defraud"" or any act ""which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit.""  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure, with 
Page 430 U. S. 463
 respect to the to aspects on which respondents' case was deemed to rest, to state a claim upon which relief could be granted:  (1) With regard to the claim that actionable fraud inhered in the allegedly gross undervaluation of the minority shares, the court concluded that, if ""full and fair disclosure is made, transactions eliminating minority interests are beyond the purview of Rule 10b-5,"" and that respondents did not allege any nondisclosure or misrepresentation in this case.  (2) With regard to the claim that the merger was undertaken without prior notice to minority shareholders, and was solely to eliminate the minority from the company, and therefore lacked any justifiable business purpose, the court concluded that Rule 10b-5 did not override the Delaware corporation law provisions, which do not require a business purpose or prior notice for a short-form merger.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  While not disagreeing with the lower Court's conclusions with respect to (1), supra, the Court of Appeals concluded that Rule 10b-5 reached ""breaches of fiduciary duty by a majority against minority shareholders without any charge of misrepresentation or lack of disclosure,"" and that therefore the complaint, taken as a whole, stated a cause of action under the Rule.
Held:
1. Only conduct involving manipulation or deception is reached by  10(b) or Rule 10b-5.
""When a statute speaks so specifically in terms of manipulation and deception, . . . and when its history reflects no more expansive intent, [the Court is] quite unwilling to extend the scope of the statute . . . ,""
Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185,  425 U. S. 214.  Pp.  430 U. S. 471-474.
2. The Kirby merger, if carried out as alleged in respondents' complaint, was neither deceptive nor manipulative, and therefore did not violate  10(b) or Rule 10b-5.  The minority shareholders were furnished with all relevant information with which to decide whether to accept the price offered for their stock or reject it and seek an appraisal in the Delaware court, and the cases relied on by respondents and the Court of Appeals in which breaches of fiduciary duty were held violative of Rule 10b-5, all of which included some element of deception, are inappropriate here, where there was none.  Manipulation is ""virtually a term of art when used in connection with securities markets,"" Ernst & Ernst, supra at  425 U. S. 199, referring to practices that are intended to mislead investors by artificially affecting market activities, none of which was involved here.  Pp.  430 U. S. 474-477.
3. A holding that the complaint in this case alleged fraud under Rule 10b-5 would bring within the Rule a wide variety of corporate conduct traditionally left to state regulation.  Absent a clear indication

Syllabus 
Under Texas' ""key man"" system for selecting grand juries, jury commissioners are appointed by a state district judge to select prospective jurors from different portions of the county, after which the district judge proceeds to test their qualifications.  A grand juror, in addition to being a citizen of the State and of the county in which he is to serve and a qualified voter in the county, must be ""of sound mind and good moral character,"" be literate, have no prior felony conviction, and be under no pending indictment or other accusation.  After respondent, a Mexican-American, had been convicted of a crime in a Texas District Court and had exhausted his state remedies on his claim of discrimination in the selection of the grand jury that had indicted him, he filed a habeas corpus petition in the Federal District Court, alleging a denial of due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, because of gross underrepresentation of Mexican-Americans on the county grand juries.  On the basis of the evidence before it, the District Court concluded that respondent had made out a weak prima facie case of invidious discrimination, and, on balance, the court's doubts about the reliability of population and grand jury statistics offered by respondent from census and county records, coupled with its opinion that Mexican-Americans constituted a ""governing majority"" in the county, caused it further to conclude that the prima facie case was rebutted by the State, and the petition was dismissed.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the State had failed to rebut respondent's prima facie case.
Held:  Based on all the facts that bear on the grand jury discrimination issue, such as the statistical disparities (the county population was 79% Mexican-American, but, over an 11-year period, only 39% of those summoned for grand jury service were Mexican-American), the method of jury selection, and any other relevant testimony as to the manner in which the selection process was implemented, the proof offered by respondent was sufficient to demonstrate a prima facie case of intentional discrimination in grand jury selection, and the State failed to rebut such presumption by competent evidence.  Pp.  430 U. S. 492-501.
(a) None of the evidence in the record rebutted respondent's prima facie case.  The State offered only the testimony of the State District 
Page 430 U. S. 483
 Judge who had selected the jury commissioners, dealing principally with the selection of the commissioners and the instructions given them, and did not call the commissioners themselves to testify.  Without evidence about the method by which the commissioners determined the other qualifications for grand jurors prior to the statutory time for testing qualifications, no inference explaining the disparity by reference to the literacy, sound mind, moral character, and criminal record qualifications can be drawn from the statistics about the population as a whole.  Pp.  430 U. S. 497-499.
(b) Nor did the District Court's ""governing majority"" theory dispel the presumption of intentional discrimination.  Because of the many facets of human motivation, it would be unwise to presume as a matter of law that human beings of one definable group will not discriminate against other members of their group.  Furthermore, the relevance of a governing majority of elected officials to the grand jury selection process is questionable, and even if a ""governing majority"" theory has general applicability in cases of this kind, the record in this case is inadequate to permit such an approach.

Following their failure to satisfy judgments against them in various civil actions in New York State courts, appellees, pursuant to provisions of the New York Judiciary Law, were held in contempt by appellant justices, and, except for appellees Ward and Rabasco, were fined and imprisoned for disobeying subpoenas to appear in supplemental proceedings brought by the respective judgment creditors in an attempt to collect the judgments.  Appellees subsequently brought a class action against appellants in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, seeking to have the statutory provisions authorizing contempt enjoined on federal constitutional grounds not raised in the state proceedings.  By the time this action was filed all the appellees, except Ward and Rabasco, had paid their fines and were released from jail, whereas Ward and Rabasco alleged that they were threatened with imprisonment.  The District Court declared the statute unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement.
Held:
1. Only appellees Ward and Rabasco have standing to seek injunctive relief, since they are subject to pending proceedings in the state courts.  The other appellees, absent any allegation or finding that they were threatened with further proceedings, have no standing, since, having been released from jail, they no longer have a live controversy with appellants or other state officials as to either the contempt citations or the short periods of incarceration that would entitle them to injunctive relief.

(a) The principles of federalism and comity enunciated in Younger and Huffman apply to a case in which the State's contempt process is involved.  Whether disobedience of a court-sanctioned subpoena, and the resulting process leading to a finding of contempt of court, is labeled civil, quasi-criminal, or criminal, the salient fact is that federal court interference with the State's contempt process is ""an offense to the State's interest . . . likely to be every bit as great as it would be were

430 U.S. 349

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder in a Florida court.  After the required separate sentencing hearing, the jury advised the court to impose a life sentence on the ground that the statutory mitigating circumstances required to be taken into account in imposing a sentence outweighed the aggravating circumstances.  But the trial judge, relying in part on a presentence investigation report that he had ordered and portions of which were not disclosed to or requested by counsel for the parties, imposed the death sentence on the ground that a certain aggravating circumstance justified it and that there was no mitigating circumstance.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence without expressly discussing petitioner's contention that the sentencing court had erred in considering the presentence report, including the confidential portion, in deciding to impose the death penalty, and without reviewing such confidential portion.
Held:  The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded.  Pp.  430 U. S. 355-364.
313 So.2d 675, vacated and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE POWELL concluded that:
1. Petitioner was denied due process of law when the death sentence was imposed, at least in part, on the basis of information that he had no opportunity to deny or explain.  Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, distinguished.  Pp.  430 U. S. 355-362.
(a) In light of the constitutional developments whereby it is now recognized that death is a different kind of punishment from any other and that the sentencing process, as well as the trial itself, must satisfy due process, the capital sentencing procedure followed here is not warranted by any of the following justifications offered by the State:  (i) an assurance of confidentiality is necessary to enable investigators to obtain relevant but sensitive disclosures about a defendant's background or character; (ii) full disclosure of a presentence report will unnecessarily delay the proceeding; (iii) such full disclosure, which often include psychiatric and psychological evaluations, will occasionally disrupt the rehabilitation process; and (iv) trial judges can be trusted to exercise 
Page 430 U. S. 350
 their sentencing discretion in a responsible manner, even though their decisions may be based on secret information.  Pp.  430 U. S. 357-360.
(b) Even if it were permissible upon finding good cause to withhold a portion of a presentence report from the defendant, and even from defense counsel, nevertheless the full report must be made a part of the record to be reviewed on appeal.  Since the State must administer its capital sentencing procedures with an even hand, that record must disclose to the reviewing court the considerations motivating the death sentence in every case in which it is imposed, since otherwise the capital sentencing procedure would be subject to the defects that resulted in the holding of unconstitutionality in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238.  Pp.  430 U. S. 360-361.
(c) Here defense counsel's failure to request access to the full presentence report cannot justify the submission of a less complete record to the reviewing court than the record on which the trial judge based his decision to sentence petitioner to death, nor does such omission by counsel constitute an effective waiver of the constitutional error.  Pp.  430 U. S. 361-362.
2. The proper disposition of the case is to vacate the death sentence and remand the case to the Florida Supreme Court with directions to order further proceedings at the trial court level not inconsistent with this opinion, rather than, as the State urges, merely remanding the case to the Florida Supreme Court with directions to have the entire presentence report made a part of the record to enable that court to complete its reviewing function, since this latter procedure could not fully correct the error.  P.  430 U. S. 362.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE concluded, on the basis of the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishments, that a procedure for selecting defendants for the death penalty that permits consideration of secret information in a presentence report relevant to the defendant's character and record fails to meet the ""need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment,""  Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280,  428 U. S. 305.  Pp.  430 U. S. 362-364.

Respondent, in custody pursuant to a sentence imposed by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, applied in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a writ of habeas corpus seeking a review of the constitutionality of the proceedings that led to his conviction and sentence.  The District Court dismissed the application on the basis of D.C.Code Ann.  23-110(g) (1973), which provides that an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a prisoner authorized to apply for collateral relief by motion in the Superior Court pursuant to the statute
""shall not be entertained by the Superior Court or by any Federal or State court if it appears that the applicant has failed to make a motion for relief under this section or that the Superior Court has denied him relief. . . .""
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  Doubting the constitutionality of the statutory curtailment of the District Court's jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus, the court construed the statute as merely requiring the exhaustion of local remedies before a habeas corpus petition could be filed in the District Court, and concluded that respondent had exhausted those remedies.
Held:
1. Section 23-110(g) prohibits the District Court from entertaining respondent's post-conviction application for a writ of habeas corpus.  The statute expressly covers the situation in which the applicant has exhausted his local remedies, and requires that the Federal District Court not entertain the habeas application in such a case.  Moreover, the language of  23-110(g) was deliberately patterned after 28 U.S.C.  2255, which created a new post-conviction remedy in sentencing district courts, and provided that a habeas corpus petition may not be entertained elsewhere;  23-110(g) was plainly intended to achieve the parallel result in the District of Columbia by requiring collateral review of convictions from the Superior Court to be heard in that court.  Pp.  430 U. S. 377-378.
2. Section 23-110(g) does not suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in violation of Art. I,  9, cl. 2, of the Constitution.  Pp.  430 U. S. 379-384.

(a) The final clause of  2110(g), which allows a Federal District Court to entertain a habeas corpus application if it ""appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the applicant's] detention,"" avoids any serious question about the statute's constitutionality.  The substitution of a new collateral remedy that is neither inadequate nor ineffective does not constitute a suspension of the writ.  Cf. United States v. Hayman, 342 U. S. 205,  342 U. S. 223.

No. 76-457
Decided March 21, 1977
430 U.S. 313

Syllabus 
Under  215 of the Social Security Act, old-age benefits are computed on the basis of a wage earner's ""average monthly wage"" earned during his ""benefit computation years"" which are the ""elapsed years"" (reduced by five) during which his covered wages were highest.  Until 1972, when the statute was amended to eliminate the distinction, ""elapsed years"" depended upon the wage earner's sex.  Section 215(b)(3) prescribed that the number of ""elapsed years"" for a male wage earner would be three higher than for an otherwise similarly situated female wage earner; for a male, the number of ""elapsed years"" equaled the number of years that elapsed after 1950 and before the year in which he became 65, whereas, for a female, the number of ""elapsed years"" equaled the number of years that elapsed after 1950 and before the year in which she became 62.  Accordingly, a female could exclude from the computation of her ""average monthly wage"" three more lower earning years than a similarly situated male could exclude, and this would result in a slightly higher ""average monthly wage"" and correspondingly higher monthly old-age benefits for the retired female wage earner.  On review of a denial of the request of appellee male wage earner (to whom the 1972 amendment did not apply because he reached age 62 before its effective date) that the more favorable formula be used to compute his old-age benefits, the District Court held that the statutory scheme violated the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment on the grounds that (1) to give women who reached age 62 before 1975 greater benefits than men of the same age and earnings record was irrational, and (2) in any event, the 1972 amendment was to be construed to apply retroactively, because otherwise it would be irrational.
Held:
1. ""[C]lassifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to the achievement of those objectives,"" Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190,  429 U. S. 197.
2. The statutory scheme itself, and the legislative history of former  215(b)(3), demonstrate that the statute was deliberately enacted to ""redres[s] our society's longstanding disparate treatment of women,"" 
Page 430 U. S. 314
 Califano v. Goldfarb, ante at  430 U. S. 209 n. 8, and was not ""the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about females.""  Ante at  430 U. S. 223 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).  The statute operated directly to compensate women for past economic discrimination by allowing them to eliminate additional low-earning years from the calculation of their retirement benefits, and in no way penalized women wage earners.
3. The failure to make the 1972 amendment retroactive does not constitute discrimination on the basis of date of birth.  Old-age benefits are not constitutionally immunized against alterations of this kind, but Congress may replace one constitutional computation formula with another, and make the new formula prospective only.

Section 215(b)(3) prescribed that the number of ""elapsed years"" for a male wage earner would be three higher than for an otherwise similarly situated female wage earner; for a male, the number of ""elapsed years"" equaled the number of years that elapsed after 1950 and before the year in which he became 65, whereas, for a female, the number of ""elapsed years"" equaled the number of years that elapsed after 1950 and before the year in which she became 62.  Accordingly, a female could exclude from the computation of her ""average monthly wage"" three more lower earning years than a similarly situated male could exclude, and this would result in a slightly higher ""average monthly wage"" and correspondingly higher monthly old-age benefits for the retired female wage earner.  On review of a denial of the request of appellee male wage earner (to whom the 1972 amendment did not apply because he reached age 62 before its effective date) that the more favorable formula be used to compute his old-age benefits, the District Court held that the statutory scheme violated the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment on the grounds that (1) to give women who reached age 62 before 1975 greater benefits than men of the same age and earnings record was irrational, and (2) in any event, the 1972 amendment was to be construed to apply retroactively, because otherwise it would be irrational.
Held:
1. ""[C]lassifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to the achievement of those objectives,"" Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190,  429 U. S. 197.
2. The statutory scheme itself, and the legislative history of former  215(b)(3), demonstrate that the statute was deliberately enacted to ""redres[s] our society's longstanding disparate treatment of women,"" 
Page 430 U. S. 314
 Califano v. Goldfarb, ante at  430 U. S. 209 n. 8, and was not ""the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about females.""  Ante at  430 U. S. 223 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).  The statute operated directly to compensate women for past economic discrimination by allowing them to eliminate additional low-earning years from the calculation of their retirement benefits, and in no way penalized women wage earners.
3. The failure to make the 1972 amendment retroactive does not constitute discrimination on the basis of date of birth.  Old-age benefits are not constitutionally immunized against alterations of this kind, but Congress may replace one constitutional computation formula with another, and make the new formula prospective only.
413 F.Supp. 127, reversed."|

Decided March 7, 1977
430 U.S. 243

Syllabus 
Petitioner corporation entered into a collective bargaining agreement with respondent Union which contained a provision for severance pay on termination of the employment of certain employees.  The agreement, which specified that any grievance arising between the parties was subject to binding arbitration, was to remain in effect until its expiration date and thereafter until execution of a new agreement or the existing agreement was terminated by either party upon seven days' written notice.  While contract changes were being negotiated after the contract's expiration date, respondent, on August 20, 1973, gave notice of cancellation, and the contract terminated August 27.  Negotiations nevertheless continued, but ended on August 31, when petitioner, threatened with a strike, informed respondent that it was closing its plant effective that day.  Plant operations ceased shortly thereafter.  Petitioner paid accrued wages, but rejected respondent's demand for severance pay under the collective bargaining agreement and declined to arbitrate the claim therefor on the ground that its obligation to do so terminated with the collective bargaining agreement.  Respondent then brought this action in District Court to compel petitioner, inter alia, to arbitrate the severance pay issue.  The District Court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment, holding that the employees' right to severance pay expired with respondent's voluntary termination of the agreement; that consequently there was no longer a severance pay issue to arbitrate; and that, in any event, the duty to arbitrate ended with the contract.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the parties' arbitration duties under the contract survived its termination with respect to claims arising by reason of the agreement.
Held:  Respondent's claim for severance pay under the expired contract is subject to resolution under the contract's arbitration terms.  Pp.  430 U. S. 248-255.
(a) The obligations of parties under the arbitration clause of a collective bargaining agreement may survive contract termination when the dispute is over an obligation arguably created by the expired agreement.  John Wiley & Sons v. Livingston, 376 U. S. 543.  Pp. 250-252.
(b) The parties agreed to resolve all disputes by resort to the mandatory grievance arbitration machinery established by the agreement.  
Page 430 U. S. 244
 There is nothing in the arbitration clause that expressly excluded from its operation a dispute arising under the contract but based on events occurring after its termination.  Absent some contrary indication, there are strong reasons to conclude that the parties did not intend their arbitration obligations to end automatically with the contract.  Pp.  430 U. S. 252-253.
(c) The parties clearly expressed their preference for an arbitral, rather than a judicial, interpretation of their obligations, and drafted their broad arbitration clause against a backdrop of a well established federal labor policy favoring arbitration as a means of resolving disputes.  There is a strong presumption favoring arbitrability.  Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574,  363 U. S. 582-583.  Pp.  430 U. S. 253-255.

Syllabus 
County government in New York has traditionally taken the form of a single-branch legislature, exercising general governmental powers, and such powers are also exercised by the county's constituent cities, villages, and towns.  The allocation of powers among these subdivisions can be changed, and a new form of county government adopted, pursuant to referendum procedures provided by the New York Constitution and an implementing statute, under which a proposed county charter submitted to the voters for approval is adopted only if a majority of the voting city dwellers and a majority of the voting noncity dwellers both approve.  After a proposed charter for Niagara County submitted to the voters pursuant to these procedures was defeated (despite the fact that a majority of those voting in the entire county favored it) when the city voters approved it but the noncity voters disapproved it, appellees, a group of Niagara County voters, brought suit in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of the procedures, and a three-judge court held that the concurrent majority requirements violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:  The challenged provisions, which are entitled to a presumption of constitutionality, do not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  The separate voter approval requirements are based on the perception that the real and long-term impact of a restructuring of local government is felt quite differently by the different county constituent units that in a sense compete to provide similar governmental services.  Voters in these constituent units are directly and differentially affected by the restructuring of county government, which may make the provider of public services more remote and less subject to the voters' individual influence, and these differing interests of city and noncity voters in the adoption of a new county charter are sufficient under the Equal Protection Clause to justify the classifications made under the law.

No. 75-804
Argued November 8, 1976

430 U.S. 290

Syllabus 
A member and officer (petitioner's decedent) of respondent local carpenters' Union brought a tort action for damages in California state court against respondent Unions and Union officials, alleging in count two of the complaint that, because of a sharp disagreement between him and Union officials over various internal Union policies, respondents had intentionally engaged in outrageous conduct, threats, and intimidation, and had thereby caused him to suffer emotional distress resulting in bodily injury; and alleging in other counts that respondent local Union had discriminated against him in referrals for employment in its hiring hall because of his dissident intra-Union political activities, that the Union had breached the hiring hall provisions of the collective bargaining agreement with a contractors association by failing to refer him on a nondiscriminatory basis, and that such failure to comply with the collective bargaining agreement also breached his membership contract with the union.  The trial court sustained a demurrer to the allegations of discrimination and breach of contract on the ground that federal law preempted state jurisdiction over them, but allowed the case to go to trial on count two.  The jury returned a verdict of actual and punitive damages for the plaintiff, and the trial court entered a judgment on the verdict.  The California Court of Appeal reversed, holding that state courts had no jurisdiction over the complaint since the ""crux"" of the action concerned employment relations and involved conduct arguably subject to the National Labor Relations Board's jurisdiction.
Held:
1. The National Labor Relations Act does not preempt the action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Pp.  430 U. S. 295-306.
(a) No provision of the NLRA protects the ""outrageous conduct"" complained of in count two, and regardless of whether the operation of the hiring hall was lawful or unlawful under federal statutes, there is no federal protection for union officers' conduct that is so outrageous that ""no reasonable man in a civilized society should be expected to endure it.""  Hence, permitting the state courts to exercise jurisdiction over such 
Page 430 U. S. 291
 complaints does not result in state regulation of federally protected conduct.  Pp.  430 U. S. 301-302.
(b) The State, on the other hand, has a substantial interest in protecting its citizens from the kind of abuse of which the plaintiff complained, and that interest is no less worthy of recognition because it concerns protection from emotional distress caused by outrageous conduct, rather than protection from physical injury or damage to reputation.  Pp.  430 U. S. 302-303.
(c) Viewed in light of the discrete concerns of the federal scheme of labor regulation and the state tort law, the potential for interference with the federal scheme by the state cause of action is insufficient to counterbalance the legitimate and substantial interest of the State in protecting its citizens, since the state tort action can be resolved without reference to any accommodation of the special interests of unions and members in the hiring hall context.  Pp. 30305.
(d) To permit concurrent state court jurisdiction it is essential that the state tort be either unrelated to employment discrimination or a function of the particularly abusive manner in which the discrimination is accomplished or threatened, rather than a function of the actual or threatened discrimination itself  P.  430 U. S. 305.
2. It is clear from the record that the trial of the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress did not meet the above standards, since the evidence supporting the verdict for the plaintiff focuses less on the alleged ""outrageous conduct"" complained of than on employment discrimination; hence, the consequent risk that the verdict represented damages for employment discrimination, rather than for instances of intentional infliction of emotional distress precludes reinstatement of the trial court's judgment.  P.  430 U. S. 306.
49 Cal.App.3d 614, 122 Cal.Rptr. 722, vacated and remanded.

A member and officer (petitioner's decedent) of respondent local carpenters' Union brought a tort action for damages in California state court against respondent Unions and Union officials, alleging in count two of the complaint that, because of a sharp disagreement between him and Union officials over various internal Union policies, respondents had intentionally engaged in outrageous conduct, threats, and intimidation, and had thereby caused him to suffer emotional distress resulting in bodily injury; and alleging in other counts that respondent local Union had discriminated against him in referrals for employment in its hiring hall because of his dissident intra-Union political activities, that the Union had breached the hiring hall provisions of the collective bargaining agreement with a contractors association by failing to refer him on a nondiscriminatory basis, and that such failure to comply with the collective bargaining agreement also breached his membership contract with the union.  The trial court sustained a demurrer to the allegations of discrimination and breach of contract on the ground that federal law preempted state jurisdiction over them, but allowed the case to go to trial on count two.  The jury returned a verdict of actual and punitive damages for the plaintiff, and the trial court entered a judgment on the verdict.  The California Court of Appeal reversed, holding that state courts had no jurisdiction over the complaint since the ""crux"" of the action concerned employment relations and involved conduct arguably subject to the National Labor Relations Board's jurisdiction.
Held:
1. The National Labor Relations Act does not preempt the action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Pp.  430 U. S. 295-306.
(a) No provision of the NLRA protects the ""outrageous conduct"" complained of in count two, and regardless of whether the operation of the hiring hall was lawful or unlawful under federal statutes, there is no federal protection for union officers' conduct that is so outrageous that ""no reasonable man in a civilized society should be expected to endure it.""  Hence, permitting the state courts to exercise jurisdiction over such 
Page 430 U. S. 291
 complaints does not result in state regulation of federally protected conduct.  Pp.  430 U. S. 301-302.
(b) The State, on the other hand, has a substantial interest in protecting its citizens from the kind of abuse of which the plaintiff complained, and that interest is no less worthy of recognition because it concerns protection from emotional distress caused by outrageous conduct, rather than protection from physical injury or damage to reputation.  Pp.  430 U. S. 302-303.
(c) Viewed in light of the discrete concerns of the federal scheme of labor regulation and the state tort law, the potential for interference with the federal scheme by the state cause of action is insufficient to counterbalance the legitimate and substantial interest of the State in protecting its citizens, since the state tort action can be resolved without reference to any accommodation of the special interests of unions and members in the hiring hall context.  Pp. 30305.
(d) To permit concurrent state court jurisdiction it is essential that the state tort be either unrelated to employment discrimination or a function of the particularly abusive manner in which the discrimination is accomplished or threatened, rather than a function of the actual or threatened discrimination itself  P.  430 U. S. 305.
2. It is clear from the record that the trial of the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress did not meet the above standards, since the evidence supporting the verdict for the plaintiff focuses less on the alleged ""outrageous conduct"" complained of than on employment discrimination; hence, the consequent risk that the verdict represented damages for employment discrimination, rather than for instances of intentional infliction of emotional distress precludes reinstatement of the trial court's judgment.  P.  430 U. S. 306.
49 Cal.App.3d 614, 122 Cal.Rptr. 722, vacated and remanded.
POWELL, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Syllabus 
A state court's pretrial order enjoining the news media from publishing the name or photograph of an 11-year-old boy in connection with a pending juvenile proceeding charging the boy with delinquency by second-degree murder held to abridge the freedom of the press in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

These Amendments will not permit a state court to prohibit the publication of widely disseminated information obtained at court proceedings that were, in fact, open to the public.  Here, notwithstanding that a state statute provided for closed juvenile hearings unless specifically opened to the public by court order, it appears that whether or not the presiding judge made such an order, members of the press were in fact present at the boy's detention hearing with full knowledge of, and without objection by, the judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel, and there is no evidence that petitioner newspaper publisher acquired the boy's name and photograph unlawfully, or even without the State's implicit approval.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 7, 1977
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner's decedent, a retired Army sergeant, died shortly after undergoing a gall bladder operation performed by respondents, two Army surgeons. Petitioner instituted survival and wrongful-death claims under New Jersey law in the Superior Court of New Jersey. Respondents removed the action to the United States District Court. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that respondents were absolutely immune from personal liability for acts done within the scope of their official duties under Barr v. Mateo, 360 U.S. 564d 1434 (1959). The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed. 
 The Court of Appeals placed principal reliance on its decision in Bailey v. DeQuevedo, 375 F.2d 72 (CA3), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 923, 88 S. Ct. 247 (1967), which in turn relied heavily upon Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135 (1950). In Feres the Court held that the United States was not subject to suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. 1346 and 2671 et seq., for injuries resulting from the negligence of an Army surgeon in the performance of his duties. In Bailey the Third Circuit applied this rule to bar a diversity suit arising under state law against an Army surgeon personally. 
Page 430 U.S. 920 , 921
 The Court of Appeals' reliance on Feres and Bailey deserves further scrutiny. First, in both Feres and Bailey the persons injured were active- duty military personnel, a fact critical to the reasoning in both decisions, while petitioner's decedent was in a retired status at the time that the injury occurred. This Court has held that Feres does not apply where, as here, the person injured is a discharged veteran of the Armed Services. United States v. Brown, 348 U.S. 110 ( 1954). Second, the question presented in Bailey whether the decision in Feres, which involved a statutory interpretation of the Tort Claims Act, creates an unqualified personal immunity for military physicians from suits arising under state law has never been decided by this Court. 
 In the past, when Congress has seen fit to immunize certain categories of federal officials, including physicians, from suit, it has done so by statute. See 38 U.S.C. 4116; 42 U.S.C. 233. No such statute was applicable in this case.* Apart from these statutes this Court has recognized a very narrow category of judicially created absolute immunity for some federal officials. See Barr v. Mateo, supra. However, such absolute immunity heretofore has only been applied to policymaking officials, and nowhere has it been suggested that there is a judicially created unqualified immunity for government functionaries operating at respondents' level. Indeed, when faced with precisely the [430 U.S. 920 , 922]

Argued October 5, 1976
Decided March 2, 1977
430 U.S. 199

Syllabus 
Under the Social Security Act survivors' benefits based on the earnings of a deceased husband covered by the Act are payable to his widow regardless of dependency, but under 42 U.S.C.  402(f)(1)(D), such benefits on the basis of the earnings of a deceased wife covered by the Act are payable to her widower only if he was receiving at least half of his support from her.  In a suit challenging these provisions, a three-judge District Court held that the different treatment of men and women mandated by  402 (f)(1)(D) constituted invidious discrimination against female wage earners by affording them less protection for their surviving spouses than is provided to male employees.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  430 U. S. 204-217;  430 U. S. 217-224.
396 F.Supp. 308, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that the gender-based distinction created by  402(f)(1)(D) violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636; Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677.  Pp.  430 U. S. 204-217.
(a) Such distinction, which results in the efforts of female workers required to pay social security taxes producing less protection for their spouses than is produced by the efforts of male workers, is constitutionally forbidden, at least when supported by no more substantial justification than ""archaic and overbroad"" generalizations or ""old notions,"" such as ""assumptions as to dependency,"" that are more consistent with ""the role-typing society has long imposed"" than with contemporary reality.  Pp.  430 U. S. 204-207.
(b) Equal protection analysis here cannot center solely on the distinction drawn between widowers and widows, but must be focused as well on the gender-based discrimination against covered female wage earners.  Pp.  430 U. S. 207-209.
(c) The fact that a covered employee's interest in future social security benefits is ""noncontractual"" does not preclude any claim of 
Page 430 U. S. 200
 equal protection denial, but benefits
""directly related to years worked and amount earned by a covered employee, and not to the needs of the beneficiaries directly . . . , must be distributed according to classifications which do not without sufficient justification differentiate among covered employees solely on the basis of sex,""
Wiesenfeld, supra at  420 U. S. 647.  Pp.  430 U. S. 210-212.
(d) It appears from  402(f)(1)(D)'s phrasing and legislative history, as well as from the general scheme of the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits program, that the differential treatment of nondependent widows and widowers results not from a deliberate congressional intention to remedy the arguably greater needs of the former, but rather from an intention to aid the dependent spouses of deceased wage earners, coupled with a presumption that wives are usually dependent.  The only justification for a classification based on this latter presumption is the unverified assumption that it would save the Government time, money, and effort simply to pay benefits to all widows, rather than to require proof of dependency of both sexes, and such an assumption does not suffice to justify a gender-based discrimination in the distribution of employment-related benefits.  Pp.  430 U. S. 212-217.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that the relevant discrimination is against surviving male spouses, rather than against deceased female wage earners, that such discrimination is merely the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about females, and that something more than accident is necessary to justify, under the Fifth Amendment, the disparate treatment of persons who have as strong a claim to equal treatment as do similarly situated surviving spouses.

No. 75-104
Argued October 6, 1976
Decided March 1, 1977
430 U.S. 144

Syllabus 
After New York State had submitted for the approval of the Attorney General its 1972 reapportionment statute with respect to Kings County and two other counties which were subject to  4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, he concluded that, as to certain districts in Kings County, the State had not met its burden under  5 of demonstrating that the redistricting had neither the purpose nor the effect of abridging the right to vote by reason of race or color.  In May, 1974, the State submitted to the Attorney General a revision of those portions of the 1972 plan to which he had objected, including provisions for elections to the state senate and assembly from Kings County.  The 1974 plan did not change the number of districts with nonwhite majorities, but did change the size of the nonwhite majorities in most of those districts.  To attain a nonwhite majority of 65%, which it was felt would be acceptable to the Attorney General for the assembly district in which the Hasidic Jewish community was located (which had been 61% nonwhite under the 1972 plan), a portion of the white population, including part of the Hasidic community, was reassigned to an adjoining district, and that community was also split between two senatorial districts, though it had been within one such district under the 1972 plan.  Petitioners, on behalf of the Hasidic community, brought this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that the 1974 plan violated their rights under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  Petitioners contended that the plan ""would dilute the value of [their] franchise by halving its effectiveness,"" solely for the purpose of achieving a racial quota, and that they were assigned to electoral districts solely on the basis of race.  Upon motions by the Attorney General (who had advised the State that he did not object to the 1974 plan) and an intervenor, the District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that petitioners enjoyed no constitutional right in reapportionment to separate community recognition as Hasidic Jews; that the redistricting did not disenfranchise them; and that racial considerations were permissible to correct past discrimination.  The Court 
Page 430 U. S. 145
 of Appeals affirmed.  Noting that the 1974 plan left approximately 70% of the Kings County senate and assembly districts with white majorities, and that only 65% of the county was white, the court held that the plan would not underrepresent the white population.  The court, relying on Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U. S. 544,  393 U. S. 569, concluded that a State could use racial considerations in an effort to secure the approval of the Attorney General under the Voting Rights Act, reasoning that the Act contemplated that he and the state legislature would have ""to think in racial terms"" because the Act ""necessarily deals with race or color, corrective action under it must do the same.""
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  430 U. S. 155-168;  430 U. S. 179-180.
510 F.2d 512, affirmed.
MR JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that the use of racial criteria by the State of New York in its 1974 plan in attempting to comply with  5 of the Act and to secure the approval of the Attorney General did not violate the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment.  Pp.  430 U. S. 155-165.
(a) Under  5, new or revised reapportionment plans are among those voting procedures, standards, or practices that may not be adopted by a State covered by the Act without a ruling by the Attorney General or the specified court that the plan does not have a racially discriminatory purpose or effect.  Allen v. State Board of Elections, supra.  Pp.  430 U. S. 157-159.
(b) Compliance with the Act in reapportionment cases will often necessitate the use of racial considerations in drawing district lines, and the Constitution does not prevent a State subject to the Act from deliberately creating or preserving black majorities in particular districts in order to ensure that its reapportionment plan complies with  5.  Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130; City of Richmond v. United States, 422 U. S. 358.  Pp.  430 U. S. 159-161.
(c) Permissible use of racial criteria is not confined to eliminating the effects of past discriminatory districting or apportionment.  P.  430 U. S. 161.
(d) A reapportionment cannot violate the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment merely because a State uses specific numerical quotas in establishing a certain number of black majority districts.  P.  430 U. S. 162.
(e) Petitioners have not shown or offered to prove that minority voting strength was increased under the 1974 plan in comparison with the 1966 apportionment, and thus have not shown that New York did more than the Attorney General was authorized to require it to do under 
Page 430 U. S. 146
 the nonretrogression principle of Beer v. United States, supra, a principle that this Court has accepted as constitutionally valid.  Pp.  430 U. S. 162-165.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEVENS and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that, wholly aside from New York's obligations under the Act to preserve minority voting strength in Kings County, the Constitution permits the State to draw lines deliberately in such a way that the percentage of districts with a nonwhite majority roughly approximates the percentage of nonwhites in the county.  Though, in individual districts where nonwhite majorities were increased to about 65%, it became more likely that nonwhite candidates would be elected, as long as Kings County whites, as a group, were provided with fair representation, there was no cognizable discrimination against whites.  See Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U. S. 735,  412 U. S. 754.  Pp.  430 U. S. 165-168.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, joined by MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that, having failed to show that the 1974 plan had either the purpose or effect of discriminating against them because of their race, petitioners, who erroneously contend that racial awareness in legislative reapportionment is unconstitutional per se, have offered no basis for affording them the constitutional relief that they seek.  Pp.  430 U. S. 179-180.
WHITE, J., announced the Court's judgment, and delivered an opinion in which STEVENS, J., joined; in all but Part IV of which BRENNAN and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined; and in Parts I and IV of which REHNQUIST, J., joined.

After New York State had submitted for the approval of the Attorney General its 1972 reapportionment statute with respect to Kings County and two other counties which were subject to  4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, he concluded that, as to certain districts in Kings County, the State had not met its burden under  5 of demonstrating that the redistricting had neither the purpose nor the effect of abridging the right to vote by reason of race or color.  In May, 1974, the State submitted to the Attorney General a revision of those portions of the 1972 plan to which he had objected, including provisions for elections to the state senate and assembly from Kings County.  The 1974 plan did not change the number of districts with nonwhite majorities, but did change the size of the nonwhite majorities in most of those districts.  To attain a nonwhite majority of 65%, which it was felt would be acceptable to the Attorney General for the assembly district in which the Hasidic Jewish community was located (which had been 61% nonwhite under the 1972 plan), a portion of the white population, including part of the Hasidic community, was reassigned to an adjoining district, and that community was also split between two senatorial districts, though it had been within one such district under the 1972 plan.  Petitioners, on behalf of the Hasidic community, brought this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that the 1974 plan violated their rights under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  Petitioners contended that the plan ""would dilute the value of [their] franchise by halving its effectiveness,"" solely for the purpose of achieving a racial quota, and that they were assigned to electoral districts solely on the basis of race.  Upon motions by the Attorney General (who had advised the State that he did not object to the 1974 plan) and an intervenor, the District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that petitioners enjoyed no constitutional right in reapportionment to separate community recognition as Hasidic Jews; that the redistricting did not disenfranchise them; and that racial considerations were permissible to correct past discrimination.  The Court 
Page 430 U. S. 145
 of Appeals affirmed.  Noting that the 1974 plan left approximately 70% of the Kings County senate and assembly districts with white majorities, and that only 65% of the county was white, the court held that the plan would not underrepresent the white population.  The court, relying on Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U. S. 544,  393 U. S. 569, concluded that a State could use racial considerations in an effort to secure the approval of the Attorney General under the Voting Rights Act, reasoning that the Act contemplated that he and the state legislature would have ""to think in racial terms"" because the Act ""necessarily deals with race or color, corrective action under it must do the same.""
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  430 U. S. 155-168;  430 U. S. 179-180.
510 F.2d 512, affirmed.
MR JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that the use of racial criteria by the State of New York in its 1974 plan in attempting to comply with  5 of the Act and to secure the approval of the Attorney General did not violate the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment.  Pp.  430 U. S. 155-165.
(a) Under  5, new or revised reapportionment plans are among those voting procedures, standards, or practices that may not be adopted by a State covered by the Act without a ruling by the Attorney General or the specified court that the plan does not have a racially discriminatory purpose or effect.  Allen v. State Board of Elections, supra.  Pp.  430 U. S. 157-159.
(b) Compliance with the Act in reapportionment cases will often necessitate the use of racial considerations in drawing district lines, and the Constitution does not prevent a State subject to the Act from deliberately creating or preserving black majorities in particular districts in order to ensure that its reapportionment plan complies with  5.  Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130; City of Richmond v. United States, 422 U. S. 358.  Pp.  430 U. S. 159-161.
(c) Permissible use of racial criteria is not confined to eliminating the effects of past discriminatory districting or apportionment.  P.  430 U. S. 161.
(d) A reapportionment cannot violate the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment merely because a State uses specific numerical quotas in establishing a certain number of black majority districts.  P.  430 U. S. 162.
(e) Petitioners have not shown or offered to prove that minority voting strength was increased under the 1974 plan in comparison with the 1966 apportionment, and thus have not shown that New York did more than the Attorney General was authorized to require it to do under 
Page 430 U. S. 146
 the nonretrogression principle of Beer v. United States, supra, a principle that this Court has accepted as constitutionally valid.  Pp.  430 U. S. 162-165.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEVENS and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that, wholly aside from New York's obligations under the Act to preserve minority voting strength in Kings County, the Constitution permits the State to draw lines deliberately in such a way that the percentage of districts with a nonwhite majority roughly approximates the percentage of nonwhites in the county.  Though, in individual districts where nonwhite majorities were increased to about 65%, it became more likely that nonwhite candidates would be elected, as long as Kings County whites, as a group, were provided with fair representation, there was no cognizable discrimination against whites.  See Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U. S. 735,  412 U. S. 754.  Pp.  430 U. S. 165-168.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, joined by MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that, having failed to show that the 1974 plan had either the purpose or effect of discriminating against them because of their race, petitioners, who erroneously contend that racial awareness in legislative reapportionment is unconstitutional per se, have offered no basis for affording them the constitutional relief that they seek.  Pp.  430 U. S. 179-180.
WHITE, J., announced the Court's judgment, and delivered an opinion in which STEVENS, J., joined; in all but Part IV of which BRENNAN and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined; and in Parts I and IV of which REHNQUIST, J., joined.

No. 75-353
Argued October 6, 1976
Decided February 23, 1977*
430 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Respondent Chris-Craft Industries was the unsuccessful tender offeror in a contest for the control of a corporation.  During the course of the takeover contest, Chris-Craft brought suit for damages and injunctive relief against the management of the target corporation, its investment adviser, and Bangor Punta Corp., the successful competitor, alleging, inter alia, violations of  14(e) and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-6 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Section 14(e) makes unlawful
""any fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices, in connection with any tender offer . . . or any solicitation of security holders in opposition to or in favor of any such offer. . . .""
Rule 10b-6 prohibits issuers whose stock is in the process of distribution from market tampering by purchasing stock or stock rights until the distribution has been completed.  After protracted litigation, the Court of Appeals ultimately held that Chris-Craft had standing to sue for damages under  14(e) and Rule 10b-6, and that a claim for damages had been established. The court stated that it would not infer from the silence of the statute that Congress intended to deny a federal remedy as a ""means of furthering the general 
Page 430 U. S. 2
 objective of  14(e). . . .""  On the merits the court found violations of  14(e) by all the defendants and violations of Rule 10b-6 by the successful competitor.  The court then remanded for a determination of the amount of damages, and instructed the District Court to enjoin the successful competitor for at least five years from voting the target company's shares acquired through violation of  14(e) and Rule 10b-6.
Held:
1. A tender offeror, suing in its capacity as a takeover bidder, does not have standing to sue for damages under  14(e); hence, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that Chris-Craft, as a defeated tender offeror, had an implied cause of action for damages under that provision.  Pp.  430 U. S. 24-42.
(a) The legislative history shows that the sole purpose of  14(e) was the protection of investors who are confronted with a tender offer.  Congress was intent on regulating takeover bidders, who had previously operated covertly, in order to protect shareholders of target companies; tender offerors, the class regulated by the statute, were not the intended beneficiaries of the legislation.  Pp.  430 U. S. 26-37.
(b) The creation of an implied cause of action for damages by judicial interpretation, such as is urged by Chris-Craft, is not necessary to effectuate Congress' objectives in enacting  14(e).  This conclusion is confirmed by the four factors identified in Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66, as ""relevant"" in determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one:  (i) Chris-Craft, a member of the class whose activities Congress intended to regulate for the benefit of target shareholders, was not ""one of the class for whose especial benefit [ 14(e)] was enacted . . .'""; (ii) although nothing in the legislative history manifests an intent to deny a damages remedy to tender offerors, there is no material showing an intention to create such a remedy, and the pervasive legislative history negates any claim that the statute was intended to provide tender offerors with additional weapons in contests for control; (iii) it is not consistent with the underlying legislative purpose to imply a damages remedy for the tender offeror in a statute especially designed to protect shareholders of target corporations, particularly where the damages award (here $36 million to Chris-Craft) favors the tender offeror, not the ""injured"" shareholders of the target; and (iv) the cause of action by a tender offeror is one appropriately ""relegated to state law,"" to the extent that the offeror seeks damages for loss of an opportunity to control a corporation.  Pp.  430 U. S. 37-41.
2. In the context of this case, Chris-Craft has no standing to sue for damages on account of the asserted Rule 10b-6 violations by the 
Page 430 U. S. 3
 successful competitor, since Chris-Craft's complaint is not that the price paid for the target company's shares was influenced by the Rule 106 violations, but that the opportunity to gain control of the target company was lost by virtue of those violations.  Thus, Chris-Craft's complaint does not implicate the concerns of Rule 10b, which is aimed at maintaining an orderly market for the distribution of securities free from manipulative influences.  Pp.  430 U. S. 42-46.
3. The Court of Appeals erred, under the circumstances presented here, in awarding Chris-Craft injunctive relief.  The case was tried in the District Court exclusively as a suit for damages after Chris-Craft expressly waived any claim to injunctive relief.  Under these circumstances, this Court's holding that Chris-Craft has no cause of action for damages under either  14(e) or Rule 106 renders the injunction granted by the District Court inappropriate, premised as it was upon the impermissible award of damages.

No. 75-1301
Argued November 10, 1976
Decided February 23, 1977*
430 U.S. 73

Syllabus 
The Delaware Indians, who originally resided in the Northeastern United States, were gradually forced to move westward in the 19th century, and the tribe became geographically scattered.  One group (the Cherokee Delawares), which initially had settled on a Kansas reservation as part of the tribe's main body, eventually moved to ""Indian Country"" in Oklahoma, became assimilated with the Cherokees, and is today a federally recognized tribe.  Another group (the Absentee Delawares), which never joined the main body in Kansas, but migrated to Oklahoma and settled with the Wichita and Caddo Indians, is also a federally recognized tribe.  A third group (the Kansas Delawares) lived with the main body on the Kansas reservation, but remained in Kansas when the Cherokee Delawares moved to Oklahoma; under an 1866 treaty, the Kansas Delawares elected to become United States citizens and to receive individual parcels of land in Kansas on condition that they dissolve their relationship with the tribe and participate in tribal assets only to the extent of a ""just proportion"" of the tribe's credits ""then held in trust by the United States,"" and the descendants of this group are not a federally recognized tribe.  The question presented by this litigation is whether the Kansas Delawares were denied equal protection of the laws in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because they were excluded from the distribution of funds authorized by an Act of Congress, which provided for distribution of funds only to the Cherokee and Absentee Delawares pursuant to an award by the Indian Claims Commission to redress a breach by the United States of an 1854 treaty with the Delaware Tribe.
Held:
1. The plenary power of Congress in matters of Indian affairs does not mean that an equal protection challenge to the instant distribution statute is not justiciable.  ""The power of Congress over Indian affairs 
Page 430 U. S. 74
 may be of a plenary nature, but it is not absolute.""  United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, 329 U. S. 40,  329 U. S. 54.

2. The exclusion of the Kansas Delawares from distribution under the Act does not offend the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, since, on the record, such exclusion was ""tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress' unique obligation toward the Indians.""  Pp.  430 U. S. 85-89.
(a) The Kansas Delawares, not being a recognized tribal entity, are simply individual Indians with no vested rights in any tribal property, such as is distributed by the Act.  As tribal property, the appropriated funds were subject to Congress' exercise of its traditional broad authority over the management and distribution of property held by recognized tribes, an authority ""drawn both explicitly and implicitly from the Constitution itself,"" Morton v. Mancari, supra at  417 U. S. 551-552.  Pp.  430 U. S. 85-86.
(b) An earlier exclusion of the Kansas Delawares from participation in tribal assets in another Act settling clam of the Delaware Tribe, while not of itself legitimating their exclusion from the Act in question, nevertheless indicates that Congress has historically distinguished them from the Cherokee Delawares in distributing tribal awards.  Pp.  430 U. S. 86-87.
(c) It appears from the legislative history of the Act in question that Congress deliberately limited the distribution under the Act to the Cherokee and Absentee Delawares to avoid undue delay, administrative difficulty, and potentially unmeritorious claims, and this congressional choice is rationally supported, even though based on an unrelated experience in ignorance of the effect of the limitation of the distribution on the Kansas Delawares.

(c) It appears from the legislative history of the Act in question that Congress deliberately limited the distribution under the Act to the Cherokee and Absentee Delawares to avoid undue delay, administrative difficulty, and potentially unmeritorious claims, and this congressional choice is rationally supported, even though based on an unrelated experience in ignorance of the effect of the limitation of the distribution on the Kansas Delawares.

Syllabus 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Amendments) authorized a series of steps to be taken to eliminate all discharges of pollutants into the Nation's waters by 1985.  The first steps are described in  304 of the Act (as added by the Amendments), which directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (the agency charged under  101 with administering the Amendments) to develop and publish various kinds of technical data as guidelines for carrying out responsibilities under the Amendments.  Section 301(a) proscribes the discharge of any pollutant unless the discharge complies with certain sections, including  301 itself,  306, and  402.  Section 301(b) defines the effluent limitations that must be achieved for existing ""point sources"" (conveyances from which pollutants are discharged) in two stages:  (1) No later than July 1, 1977, such limitations for point sources must require the application of the ""best practicable control technology currently available,"" and (2) by July 1, 1983, the limitations for ""categories and classes of point sources"" must require application of the ""best available technology economically achievable.""  Section 301(c) authorizes the EPA Administrator to grant variances for the 1983 limitations for any point source for which a permit application is filed after July 1, 1977.  Section 306(b) directs the Administrator to publish regulations establishing national standards for new sources within each category of sources discharging pollutants, and  306(e) makes it unlawful to operate a new source in violation of the applicable standard.  Section 402 authorizes the Administrator to issue permits for individual point sources, and also to review and approve the plan of any State desiring to administer its own permit program.  Section 509(b)(1) (E) provides that review of the Administrator's action in approving or promulgating any effluent limitation under  301 or 
Page 430 U. S. 113
  306 may be had in the court of appeals.  The EPA, which is empowered under  501(a) to make ""such regulations as are necessary to carry out"" its functions, promulgated industrywide regulations imposing three sets of limitations on petitioner inorganic chemical manufacturers' discharges of pollutants into waters.  The first two impose progressively higher levels of pollutant control on existing point sources (a) after July 1, 1977, and (b) after July 1, 1983, and the third set imposes limits on ""new sources"" that may be constructed in the future.  Petitioner manufacturers filed both a suit in the District Court to set aside the regulations and a petition for review of the regulations in the Court of Appeals, contending that  301 is not an independent source of authority for setting effluent limitations by regulation, but is merely a description of such limitations which are set for each plant on an individual basis during the permit issuance process, and that  402 provides the only authority for issuance of enforceable limitations on the discharge of pollutants by existing plants.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the suit to set aside the regulations on the ground that the Court of Appeals had exclusive jurisdiction to consider the validity of the regulations, and held on the petition for review that the EPA was authorized to issue ""presumptively applicable"" effluent limitations and new source standards, and was required to provide a variance procedure for new sources.
Held:
1. The EPA has authority under  301 to limit discharges by existing plants through industrywide regulations setting forth uniform effluent limitations for both 1977 and 1983, provided some allowance is made for variations in individual plants.  Pp.  430 U. S. 126-136.
(a) Both the language of  301 and the legislative history of the Amendments support the view that  301 limitations are to be adopted by the Administrator, that they are to be based primarily on classes and categories, and that they are to take the form of regulations.  Pp.  430 U. S. 126-130.
(b) The legislative history also makes it clear that  304 guidelines are not merely aimed at guiding the discretion of permit issuers in setting limitations for individual plants, but  304 requires that the guidelines survey the practicable or available pollution control technology for an industry and assess its effectiveness, and then describe the methodology the EPA intends to use in the  301 regulations to determine the effluent limitations for particular plants.  Pp.  430 U. S. 130-132.
(c) The above construction of the Amendments is also supported by  101(d) and 501(a).  Pp.  430 U. S. 132-133.
2. Section 509(b)(1)(E) unambiguously authorizes court of appeals review of EPA action promulgating an effluent limitation for existing

 point sources under  301, and the reference in  509(b)(1)(E) to  301 was not intended only to provide for review of the grant or denial of an individual variance under  301(c).  Since effluent limitations are typically promulgated in the same proceeding as the new-source standards under  306, there is no doubt that Congress intended review of the two sets of regulations to be had in the same forum.  Pp.  430 U. S. 136-137.
3. Variances for individual plants unable to comply with the new source standards issued under  306 are not authorized.  Congress clearly intended regulations under  306 to be absolute prohibitions, as is indicated by the use of the word ""standards"" in  306, as well as by the description of the preferred standard as one ""permitting no discharge of pollutants.""  Pp.  430 U. S. 137-139.

Syllabus 
A subcontractor (Hudik) had a subcontract with a general contractor (Austin) for the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning work in the construction of a home for the aged.  The subcontract job specifications provided that Austin would purchase certain climate control units manufactured by Slant/Fin Corp. to be installed in the home, and that the internal piping in these units was to be cut, threaded, and installed at the Slant/Fin factory.  However, the collective bargaining agreement between respondent union and Hudik provided that pipe threading and cutting were to be performed on the jobsite.  When the units arrived on the job, the union steamfitters employed by Hudik refused, at the union's instigation, to install them on the ground that the factory-installed internal piping violated the collective bargaining agreement, and was steamfitters' work.  Austin then filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that the union had committed an unfair labor practice under  8(b)(4)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to induce employees to refuse to handle particular goods or products or coerce any person, where ""an object"" of the inducement or coercion is to require any person to cease doing business with any other person, provided that the section shall not be construed to make unlawful any primary strike or primary picketing.  Specifically, Austin charged that the union's action was taken to force Hudik to cease doing business with Austin and to force Hudik and Austin to cease dealing with Slant/Fin's products.  The Administrative Law Judge held that the union had violated  8(b)(4)(B) because, in seeking to enforce the collective bargaining agreement and to obtain the work, the union's object was in reality to influence Austin by exerting pressure on Hudik, an employer who had no power to award the work to the union.  The NLRB agreed, noting that, although the union's refusal to install the climate control units was based on a valid 
Page 429 U. S. 508
 work preservation clause in the collective bargaining agreement, the pressure exerted by the union on Hudik was undertaken for its effect on other employers, and thus was secondary and prohibited by  8(b)(4)(B).  The Court of Appeals set aside the NLRB's cease and desist order, disagreeing with the NLRB on both legal and factual grounds.
Held:  The union's refusal to install the climate control units was secondary activity prohibited by  8(b)(4)(B), rather than primary activity beyond the reach of that provision.  Pp.  429 U. S. 514-532.
(a) The existence of a work preservation agreement is not an adequate defense to a  8(b)(4)(B) unfair labor practice charge.  To hold, as the Court of Appeals did, that a work stoppage is necessarily primary, and not an unfair labor practice when it aims at enforcing a legal promise in a collective bargaining agreement is inconsistent with the statute as construed in Carpenters v. NLRB, 357 U. S. 93 (Sand Door), a construction that was accepted and that has never been abandoned by Congress.  Pp.  429 U. S. 514-521.
(b) The Court of Appeals also erred in taking the view that the NLRB's ""control"" test, under which the union commits an unfair labor practice under  8(b)(4)(B) when it coerces an employer in order to obtain work that the employer has no power to assign, is invalid as a matter of law because it fails to comply with the standard of National Woodwork Mfrs. Assn. v. NLRB, 386 U. S. 612, that the union's conduct be judged in light of all the relevant circumstances.  It does not appear that either the Administrative Law Judge or the NLRB, in agreeing with him, articulated a different standard from that recognized as proper in National Woodwork, or that the NLRB, in applying its control test, failed to consider all of the relevant circumstances.  Pp.  429 U. S. 521-528.
(c) The record amply supports the NLRB's conclusion that the union's objectives were not confined to the employment relationship with Hudik, but included the object of influencing Austin in a manner prohibited by  8(b)(4)(B).  Pp.  429 U. S. 528-531.
(d) The Court of Appeals was obliged to review the case under the statutory standard of whether the NLRB's findings were ""supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole,"" and thus, in reweighing the facts and setting aside the NLRB's order, the Court of Appeals improperly substituted its own views of the facts for those of the NLRB.

 work preservation clause in the collective bargaining agreement, the pressure exerted by the union on Hudik was undertaken for its effect on other employers, and thus was secondary and prohibited by  8(b)(4)(B).  The Court of Appeals set aside the NLRB's cease and desist order, disagreeing with the NLRB on both legal and factual grounds.
Held:  The union's refusal to install the climate control units was secondary activity prohibited by  8(b)(4)(B), rather than primary activity beyond the reach of that provision.  Pp.  429 U. S. 514-532.
(a) The existence of a work preservation agreement is not an adequate defense to a  8(b)(4)(B) unfair labor practice charge.  To hold, as the Court of Appeals did, that a work stoppage is necessarily primary, and not an unfair labor practice when it aims at enforcing a legal promise in a collective bargaining agreement is inconsistent with the statute as construed in Carpenters v. NLRB, 357 U. S. 93 (Sand Door), a construction that was accepted and that has never been abandoned by Congress.  Pp.  429 U. S. 514-521.
(b) The Court of Appeals also erred in taking the view that the NLRB's ""control"" test, under which the union commits an unfair labor practice under  8(b)(4)(B) when it coerces an employer in order to obtain work that the employer has no power to assign, is invalid as a matter of law because it fails to comply with the standard of National Woodwork Mfrs. Assn. v. NLRB, 386 U. S. 612, that the union's conduct be judged in light of all the relevant circumstances.  It does not appear that either the Administrative Law Judge or the NLRB, in agreeing with him, articulated a different standard from that recognized as proper in National Woodwork, or that the NLRB, in applying its control test, failed to consider all of the relevant circumstances.  Pp.  429 U. S. 521-528.
(c) The record amply supports the NLRB's conclusion that the union's objectives were not confined to the employment relationship with Hudik, but included the object of influencing Austin in a manner prohibited by  8(b)(4)(B).  Pp.  429 U. S. 528-531.
(d) The Court of Appeals was obliged to review the case under the statutory standard of whether the NLRB's findings were ""supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole,"" and thus, in reweighing the facts and setting aside the NLRB's order, the Court of Appeals improperly substituted its own views of the facts for those of the NLRB.  Pp.  429 U. S. 531-532.

No. 75-1510
Argued December 7, 1976
Decided February 22, 1977
429 U.S. 545

Syllabus 
Respondent and petitioner Weatherford (hereinafter petitioner), an undercover agent, were arrested for a state criminal offense, each thereafter retaining separate counsel.  Petitioner had two pretrial meetings with respondent and respondent's counsel, who had sought petitioner's presence for the purpose of securing information or suggestions as to respondent's defense.  Petitioner had no discussions concerning respondent's trial strategy or the pending criminal action either with his superiors or with the prosecution.  Petitioner (who had told respondent he would not be a prosecution witness) testified for the prosecution, which, on the morning of the trial, decided to call petitioner as a witness because he had been seen in the company of police officers, and had thus lost effectiveness as an undercover agent.  Respondent was convicted.  After he had served his sentence, he brought this action against petitioner under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that petitioner's participation in the two meetings had deprived respondent of the effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments as well as his right to a fair trial guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court found for petitioner.  The Court of Appeals, without disturbing the District Court's factual findings, reversed, concluding that
""whenever the prosecution knowingly arranges or permits intrusion into the attorney-client relationship, the right to counsel is sufficiently endangered to require reversal and a new trial,""
and that the concealment of petitioner's undercover status lulled respondent into a false sense of security, interfering with his trial preparations and denying him due process of law under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83.
Held:
1. Respondent was not deprived of his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment, which does not establish a per se rule forbidding an undercover agent to meet with a defendant's counsel.  Black v. United States, 385 U. S. 26; O'Brien v. United States, 386 U. S. 345; Hoffa v. United States, 385 U. S. 293, distinguished.  Pp.  429 U. S. 550-559. 
Page 429 U. S. 546

(a) As long as the information possessed by petitioner about the two meetings remained uncommunicated, he posed no threat to respondent's Sixth Amendment rights.  Pp.  429 U. S. 554-557.
(b) Petitioner went to the meetings not to spy, but because he was asked by respondent and his counsel and because the State was interested in maintaining petitioner's status as an informant and not arousing respondent's suspicions.  Adoption of the Court of Appeals' per se rule would, for all practical purposes, have required petitioner to unmask himself.  Pp.  429 U. S. 557-558.
2. The Due Process Clause does not require that the prosecution must reveal before trial the names of undercover agents or other witnesses who will testify unfavorably to the defense.  Pp.  429 U. S. 559-561.
(a) There is no constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and Brady, supra, did not create one.  P.  429 U. S. 559.
(b) That petitioner not only concealed his identity but represented that he would not be a prosecution witness did not deny respondent a right to a fair trial.  The misrepresentation was not deliberate, and there is no constitutional difference between the surprise testimony of an informer who is not suspected and therefore is not asked about testifying for the prosecution and the informer who, like petitioner, is asked by the defendant but denies that he will testify.  P.  429 U. S. 560.
(c) Though the Court of Appeals also suggested that petitioner' continued duplicity denied respondent the opportunity to plea bargain, there is no constitutional right to plea bargain.  Pp.  429 U. S. 560-561.

Syllabus 
Petitioner accrual basis corporate taxpayer, by delivering fully secured promissory demand notes to the trustees of its qualified employees' profit-sharing trust, held not entitled to income tax deductions therefor under  404(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which allows a deduction for contributions ""paid"" by an employer to a profit-sharing plan in the taxable year ""when paid,"" and further allows the deduction if the contribution was a ""payment . . . made"" within a specified grace period following the end of the employer's taxable year.  Pp.  429 U. S. 574-583.
(a) The statutory terms ""paid"" and ""payment,"" coupled with the grace period and the legislative history's reference to ""paid"" and ""actually paid,"" demonstrate that, regardless of the method of accounting, all taxpayers must pay out cash or its equivalent by the end of the grace period in order to qualify for the  404(a) deduction.  This accords with the apparent statutory policy that the profit-sharing plan receive full advantage of any contribution that entitles the employer to a tax benefit.  Here, the petitioner's issuance and delivery of the promissory notes did not make the accrued contributions ones that were ""paid"" within the meaning of  404(a).  Pp.  429 U. S. 574-579.
(b) Though the notes had value and would qualify as income to a seller-recipient, the notes, for the maker, even though fully secured, are still only a promise to pay, and do not, in themselves, constitute an outlay of cash or other property.  P.  429 U. S. 579.
(c) The transactions in question cannot be treated as payments of cash to the trustees followed by loans, evidenced by the notes in return, since ""a transaction is to be given its tax effect in accord with what actually occurred, and not in accord with what might have occurred,"" Commissioner v. National Alfalfa Dehydration, 417 U. S. 134,  417 U. S. 148.  Pp.  429 U. S. 579-580.
(d) The word ""paid"" in  404(a) cannot be assumed to have the same meaning it has in  267(a) of the Code, which disallows deductions by an accrual basis taxpayer for certain items that are accrued but not yet paid to related cash basis payees.  The situation under

(e) A promissory note cannot properly be equated with a check, since a note, even when payable on demand and fully secured, is still only a promise to pay, whereas a check is a direction to the bank for immediate payment, is a medium of exchange, and is treated, for federal tax purposes, as a conditional payment of cash.

Syllabus 
Responding to a concern that drugs were being diverted into unlawful channels, the New York Legislature, in 1972, enacted a statutory scheme to correct defects in the previous law.  The 1972 statute classifies potentially harmful drugs and provides that prescriptions for the category embracing the most dangerous legitimate drugs (Schedule II) be prepared on an official form.  One copy of the form, which requires identification of the prescribing physician, dispensing pharmacy, drug and dosage, and the patient's name, address, and age, must be filed with the State Health Department, where pertinent data are recorded on tapes for computer processing.  All forms are retained for a five-year period under a system to safeguard their security, and are thereafter destroyed.  Public disclosure of the patient's identity is prohibited, and access to the files is confined to a limited number of health department and investigatory personnel.  Appellees, including a group of patients regularly receiving Schedule II drugs and prescribing doctors, brought this action challenging the constitutionality of the Schedule II patient identification requirements.  Holding that ""the doctor-patient relationship is one of the zones of privacy accorded constitutional protection"" and that the Act's patient identification provisions invaded that zone with ""a needlessly broad sweep,"" since appellant had been unable to demonstrate the need for those requirements, a three-judge District Court enjoined the enforcement of the challenged provisions.
Held:
1. The patient identification requirement is a reasonable exercise of the State's broad police powers, and the District Court's finding that the necessity for the requirement had not been proved is not a sufficient reason for holding the statute unconstitutional.  Pp.  429 U. S. 596-598.
2. Neither the immediate nor the threatened impact of the patient identification requirement on either the reputation or the independence of patients for whom Schedule II drugs are medically indicated suffices to constitute an invasion of any right or liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  429 U. S. 598-604.
(a) The possibility that a doctor or pharmacist may voluntarily 
Page 429 U. S. 590

(b) There is no support in the record or in the experience of the two States that the New York program emulates for assuming that the statute's security provisions will be improperly administered.  P.  429 U. S. 601.
(c) The remote possibility that judicial supervision of the evidentiary use of particular items of stored information will not provide adequate protection against unwarranted disclosure is not a sufficient reason for invalidating the entire patient identification program.  Pp.  429 U. S. 601-602.
(d) Though it is argued that concern about disclosure may induce patients to refuse needed medication, the 1972 statute does not deprive the public of access to Schedule II drugs, as is clear from the fact that about 100,000 prescriptions for such drugs were filed each month before the District Court's injunction was entered.

Syllabus 
In exchange for respondent real estate development corporation's promise to purchase prefabricated houses to be erected on certain land, petitioner United States Steel Corp.'s Home Division (the manufacturer of the houses) and petitioner Credit Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary that provides financing to the Home Division's customers, agreed to finance respondent's cost of acquiring and developing the land.  After difficulties arose while the development was in progress, respondent brought a treble damages action against petitioners, alleging that the transaction was a tying arrangement forbidden by the Sherman Act, because the competition for prefabricated houses (the tied product) was restrained by petitioners abuse of power over credit (the tying product).  After this Court, in a prior review of the case upon reversing a summary judgment in petitioners' favor, held that the agreement affected a ""not insubstantial"" amount of commerce in the tied product, and that respondent was entitled to an opportunity to prove that petitioners possessed ""appreciable economic power"" in the market for the tying product, the District Court ultimately held that the evidence justified the conclusion that petitioners did have sufficient economic power in the credit market to make the tying arrangement unlawful, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  That evidence related to four propositions:  (1) petitioner Credit Corp. and the Home Division were owned by one of the Nation's largest corporations; (2) petitioners entered into tying arrangements with a significant number of customers in addition to respondent; (3) the Home Division charged respondent a noncompetitive price for its prefabricated houses; and (4) the financing provided to respondent was ""unique,"" primarily because it covered 100% of respondent's acquisition and development costs.
Held:  The record does not support the conclusion that petitioners had appreciable economic power in the market for credit, the tying product.  Where the record merely shows that the credit terms are unique because the seller was willing to accept a lesser profit -- or to incur greater risks -- than its competitors, such uniqueness does not give rise to any inference of economic power in the credit market.  The 
Page 429 U. S. 611
 unusual credit bargain offered to respondent proves nothing more than a willingness to provide cheap financing in order to sell expensive houses, and without any evidence that the Credit Corp. had some cost advantage over its competitors -- or could offer a form of financing that was significantly differentiated from that which other lenders could offer if they so elected -- the unique character of its financing does not support the lower courts' conclusion that petitioners had the kind of economic power that respondent had the burden of proving in order to prevail.

In exchange for respondent real estate development corporation's promise to purchase prefabricated houses to be erected on certain land, petitioner United States Steel Corp.'s Home Division (the manufacturer of the houses) and petitioner Credit Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary that provides financing to the Home Division's customers, agreed to finance respondent's cost of acquiring and developing the land.  After difficulties arose while the development was in progress, respondent brought a treble damages action against petitioners, alleging that the transaction was a tying arrangement forbidden by the Sherman Act, because the competition for prefabricated houses (the tied product) was restrained by petitioners abuse of power over credit (the tying product).  After this Court, in a prior review of the case upon reversing a summary judgment in petitioners' favor, held that the agreement affected a ""not insubstantial"" amount of commerce in the tied product, and that respondent was entitled to an opportunity to prove that petitioners possessed ""appreciable economic power"" in the market for the tying product, the District Court ultimately held that the evidence justified the conclusion that petitioners did have sufficient economic power in the credit market to make the tying arrangement unlawful, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  That evidence related to four propositions:  (1) petitioner Credit Corp. and the Home Division were owned by one of the Nation's largest corporations; (2) petitioners entered into tying arrangements with a significant number of customers in addition to respondent; (3) the Home Division charged respondent a noncompetitive price for its prefabricated houses; and (4) the financing provided to respondent was ""unique,"" primarily because it covered 100% of respondent's acquisition and development costs.
Held:  The record does not support the conclusion that petitioners had appreciable economic power in the market for credit, the tying product.  Where the record merely shows that the credit terms are unique because the seller was willing to accept a lesser profit -- or to incur greater risks -- than its competitors, such uniqueness does not give rise to any inference of economic power in the credit market.  The 
Page 429 U. S. 611
 unusual credit bargain offered to respondent proves nothing more than a willingness to provide cheap financing in order to sell expensive houses, and without any evidence that the Credit Corp. had some cost advantage over its competitors -- or could offer a form of financing that was significantly differentiated from that which other lenders could offer if they so elected -- the unique character of its financing does not support the lower courts' conclusion that petitioners had the kind of economic power that respondent had the burden of proving in order to prevail.

Syllabus 
A local district court's inquiry in an action under  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, claiming that new voting procedures of a State or political subdivision thereof fail to comply with  5 procedures, is limited to determining whether a voting requirement is covered by  5 but has not been subjected to the required federal scrutiny.  Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U. S. 544; Perkins v. Mathews, 400 U. S. 379; Connor v. Waller, 421 U. S. 656.  Such limitation inheres in Congress' determination that only the District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction to consider the issue whether a proposed change discriminates on account of race, and that other district courts may consider only  5 ""coverage"" questions.  Hence, here the District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, in an action by the Attorney General under  5 challenging a redistricting plan submitted to him by a Mississippi county and to which he had objected, erred in deciding that such plan was unconstitutional and that a new plan submitted to the Attorney General as ordered by the court but not approved by him was constitutional, and the court should have determined only whether the county could be enjoined from holding elections under a new plan because it had not been cleared under  5.

Pursuant to California statutes authorizing counties to impose an annual use or property tax on possessory interests in improvements on tax-exempt land, appellee counties imposed a tax on the possessory interests of appellant United States Forest Service employees in housing located in national forests within the counties and owned and supplied to appellants by the Forest Service as part of their compensation.
Held:  The tax is not barred by the Supremacy Clause as a state tax on the Federal Government or federal property.  Pp.  429 U. S. 457-468.
(a) A State may, in effect, raise revenues on the basis of property owned by the United States as long as that property is being used by a private citizen and as long as it is the possession or use by the private citizen that is being taxed.  City of Detroit v. Murray Corp., 355 U. S. 489; United States v. City of Detroit, 355 U. S. 466; United States v. Township of Muskegon, 355 U. S. 484.  P.  429 U. S. 462.
(b) The economic burden on a federal function of a state tax imposed on those who deal with the Federal Government does not render the tax unconstitutional as long as the tax is imposed equally on the other similarly situated constituents of the State.  Pp.  429 U. S. 462-464.
(c) The ""legal incidence"" of the tax in question falls neither on the Federal Government nor on federal property, but is imposed solely on private citizens who work for the Federal Government and threatens to interfere with federal laws relating to the Forest Service's functions only insofar as it may impose an economic burden on the Forest Service to reimburse its employees for the taxes owed or, failing reimbursement, to remove an advantage otherwise enjoyed by the Government in the employment market.  P.  429 U. S. 464.
(d) The tax does not discriminate against Forest Service or other federal employees, and the fact that it is imposed on real property renters only if the owner is exempt from taxation does not make it discriminatory, United States v. City of Detroit, supra.  Since the state property tax imposed on owners of nonexempt property is passed on to their lessees, appellants are no worse off than those who work

 for private employers and rent houses in the private sector.  Pp.  429 U. S. 464-465.
(e) It cannot be properly contended that appellants are required to occupy their houses for the Forest Service's sole benefit, and not for their own personal benefit, since the occupancy of the houses constitutes part of appellants' ""compensation"" for services performed, and thus concededly is of personal benefit to the employee, and since, moreover, the Forest Service itself purports to measure the personal benefit of the occupancy to the employee, and collects rent in such an amount through deductions from the employee's paycheck.

Respondents, bowling centers in three distinct markets, brought this antitrust action against petitioner, one of the two largest bowling equipment manufacturers and the largest operator of bowling centers, claiming that petitioner's acquisitions of competing bowling centers that had defaulted in payments for bowling equipment that they had purchased from petitioner might substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of  7 of the Clayton Act.  Respondents sought treble damages pursuant to  4 of the Act, as well as injunctive and other relief.  At trial, they sought to prove that petitioner, because of its size, had the capacity to lessen competition in the markets it had entered by driving smaller competitors out of business.  To establish damages, respondents attempted to show that, had petitioner allowed the defaulting centers to close, respondents' profits would have increased.  The jury returned a verdict for damages in favor of respondents, which the District Court trebled in accordance with  4.  The Court of Appeals, while endorsing the legal theories upon which respondents' claim was based, reversed the case and remanded for further proceedings because of errors in the trial court's instructions to the jury.  The court concluded that a properly instructed jury could have found that a ""giant"" like petitioner entering a market of ""pygmies"" might lessen horizontal retail competition.  The court also concluded that there was sufficient evidence to permit a jury to find that, but for petitioner's actions, the acquired centers would have gone out of business.  The court held that, if a jury were to make such findings, respondents would be entitled to damages for threefold the income they would have earned.  Petitioner's petition for certiorari challenged the theory that the Court of Appeals had approved for awarding damages.
Held:
1. For plaintiffs in an antitrust action to recover treble damages on account of  7 violations, they must prove more than that they suffered injury which was causally linked to an illegal presence in the market; they must prove injury of the type that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes the defendants' acts unlawful.  The injury must reflect the anticompetitive effect 
Page 429 U. S. 478
 of either the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation.  Pp.  429 U. S. 484-489.
(a) Section 4 is essentially a remedial provision, and, to recover damages, respondents must prove more than that petitioner violated  7.  Pp.  429 U. S. 485-487.
(b) Congress has condemned mergers only when they may produce anticompetitive effects; yet, under the Court of Appeals' holding, once a merger is found to violate  7, all dislocations that the merger caused are actionable regardless of whether the dislocations have anything to do with the reason the merger was condemned.  Here, if the acquisitions were unlawful it, is because they brought a ""deep pocket"" parent into a market of ""pygmies,"" but respondents' injury is unrelated to the size of either the acquiring company or its competitors; it would have suffered the identical loss, but without any recourse had the acquired centers secured refinancing or had they been bought by a ""shallow pocket"" parent.  Pp.  429 U. S. 487-488.
2. Petitioner is entitled under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 50(b) to judgment on the damages claim notwithstanding the verdict, since respondents' case was based solely on their novel theory, rejected herein, of damages ascribable to profits they would have received had the acquired centers been closed, and since respondents have not shown any reason to require a new trial.

With respect to nonsignatory subcontractors, a subcontractor's clause of the agreement specified that petitioner should require the subcontractor to be bound by the agreement or that petitioner should maintain daily records of the subcontractor's employees' hours and to be liable for payment of the contributions to the trust funds with respect to these employees.  Petitioner subcontracted certain carpentry work on a federally subsidized low income apartment project in Oregon to a nonsignatory employer (whose employees were not entitled to benefits in the trust funds), but did not exercise either of the above options.  Instead, the subcontractor paid directly to his employees, as fringe benefits, 96 cents per hour in addition to their wages at union scale, thus paying out the same aggregate of wages and fringe benefits paid by signatory employers in the form of wages to their employees and contributions to the trust funds.  Upon completion of the project, respondents sued petitioner in Oregon state court to enforce the subcontractor's clause, and petitioner defended on the ground that the clause violated  302(a)(1).  The trial court sustained respondents' demurrer, and, while holding that it would be ""inequitable"" to require contributions to the Health and Welfare, Pension, and Vacation Savings Funds because they would 
Page 429 U. S. 402
 amount to a double payment with respect to the subcontractor's employees, ordered an accounting limited to contributions to the Apprenticeship and CIAF trusts that did ""not accrue benefits directly to the workmen.""  The Oregon Supreme Court affirmed sustainment of the demurrer, but, construing the subcontractor's clause as giving all the funds equal standing, reversed the judgment insofar as it limited the accounting to the Apprenticeship and CIAF trusts.
Held:
1. Federal- rather than state law principles of contract construction apply in determining the meaning of the subcontractor's clause, since it is a provision of a collective bargaining agreement and application of federal law is necessary to avoid the ""possibility that individual contract terms might have different meanings under state and federal law,"" Teamsters Local v. Lucas Flour Co., 369 U. S. 95,  369 U. S. 103.  Pp.  429 U. S. 407-408.
2. The subcontractor's clause, as construed by the Oregon Supreme Court to require petitioner to make contributions to the trust funds measured by the hours worked by his subcontractor's employees, the benefits being payable only to carpenters employed by petitioner or other signatory employers, does not violate  302(a)(1), but is authorized by  302(c)(5) and (6).  Enforcement of the clause as so construed not only is consistent with the wording of  302(c)(5) and (6), but also does no disservice to the congressional purpose in enacting  302 to combat
""corruption of collective bargaining through bribery of employee representatives by employers, . . . extortion by employee representatives, and . . . the possible abuse by union officers of the power which they might achieve if welfare funds were left to their sole control.""

3. The objective of the Davis-Bacon Act to protect contractors' employees from substandard earnings by fixing a floor under wages on Government projects, is not ""frustrated"" by the subcontractor's clause, since such objective is clearly not ""frustrated"" when contractual arrangements between employers and their employees result in higher compensation and benefits than the floor established by that Act.

No. 75-212
Argued October 13, 1976
Decided January 18, 1977
429 U.S. 413

Syllabus 
Title 18 U.S.C.  2518(1)(b)(iv), which is part of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, requires the Government to include in its wiretap applications ""the identity of the person, if known, committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted.""  Section 2518(8)(d) requires the judge to whom a wiretap application is made to cause to be served on the persons named in the wiretap order or application an inventory, which must give notice of entry of the order or application, state the disposition of the application, and indicate whether communications were intercepted, and further provides that the judge may order similar notice to other parties to intercepted communications if he concludes that such action is in the interest of justice.  Evidence derived from wiretaps must be suppressed under  2518(10)(a)(i) if ""the communication was unlawfully intercepted.""  On December 26, 1972, the Government applied for an extension of an order authorizing a wiretap interception of gambling-related conversations of certain named individuals other than respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco and ""others as yet unknown"" to or from four listed telephones, and the Government did not identify these respondents in the application even though it had previously learned they were discussing illegal gambling activities with the named subjects.  The District Court authorized a 15-day interception.  On February 21, 1973, the Government submitted to the court a proposed order giving notice of the interception to 37 persons, the court signed the order, and an inventory notice was served on the listed persons, including respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco.  Subsequently, after the Government submitted the names of two additional persons whose identities allegedly had been omitted inadvertently from the initial list, the court entered an amended order giving notice to those individuals, but as a result of ""administrative oversight"" respondents Merlo and Lauer were not included in either list of names and were never served with an inventory notice.  Respondents, along with others, were indicted for federal gambling offenses.  On respondents' motion, the District Court suppressed as to respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco all evidence derived from the 
Page 429 U. S. 414
 December 26 intercept order on the ground that failure to name them in the application and order of that date violated  2518(1)(b)(iv), inter alia, and suppressed as to respondents Merlo and Lauer all evidence derived from both intercept orders on the ground that these two respondents had not been served with an inventory notice as required by  2518(8)(d).  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Section 2518(1)(b)(iv) is not satisfied when the wiretap application identifies only the ""principal target"" (usually the individual whose phone is monitored) of the interception, but the Government is required to name all individuals who it has probable cause to believe are engaged in the criminal activity under investigation and whose conversations it expects will be intercepted over the target telephone.  Neither the language and structure of Title III nor its legislative history supports the interpretation that Congress intended to remove from the identification requirement those suspects whose intercepted communications originated on a telephone other than that listed in the wiretap application.  Pp.  429 U. S. 423-428.
2. Under  2518(8)(d), the Government has a statutory responsibility to inform the issuing judge of the identities of persons whose conversations were overheard in the course of the interception, thus enabling him to decide whether they should be served with notice of the interception.  Here the Government did not comply adequately with  2518(8)(d), since the names of respondents Merlo and Lauer were not included on the purportedly complete list of identifiable persons submitted to the issuing judge.  Pp.  429 U. S. 428-432.
3. Although the Government was required under  2518(1)(b)(iv) to identify respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco in the December 26 application, failure to do so under these circumstances did not warrant suppression under  2518(10)(a)(i), since the identification in an intercept application of all those likely to be overheard in incriminating conversations does not play a ""substantive role"" with respect to judicial authorization of intercept orders and hence does not impose a limitation on the use of intercept procedures.  Pp.  429 U. S. 435-437.
(a) Here the statutorily imposed preconditions to judicial authorization (a determination that normal investigative techniques have failed or are unlikely to succeed, and probable cause to believe that (i) an individual is engaged in criminal activity, (ii) particular communications concerning the offense will be obtained through interception, and (iii) the target facilities are being used in connection with the specified criminal activity) were satisfied, and the issuing judge was simply unaware that additional persons might be overheard engaging in incriminating 
Page 429 U. S. 415
 conversations, the intercept being lawful because the application provided sufficient information to enable the judge to determine that the statutory preconditions were satisfied.  Pp.  429 U. S. 435-436.
(b) There is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Congress intended  2518(1)(b)(iv)'s broad identification requirement to play ""a central, or even functional, role in guarding against unwarranted use of wiretapping or electronic surveillance,"" United States v. Chavez, 416 U. S. 562,  416 U. S. 578.  P.  429 U. S. 437.
4. Nor was suppression justified under  2518(10)(a)(i) with respect to respondents Merlo and Lauer simply because the Government inadvertently omitted their names from the comprehensive list of all identifiable persons whose conversations had been overheard.  Pp.  429 U. S. 438-439.
(a) There is nothing in the structure or legislative history of the Act to suggest that incriminating conversations are ""unlawfully intercepted"" whenever parties to those conversations do not receive discretionary inventory notice under  2518(8)(d) as a result of the Government's failure to inform the court of their identities.  P.  429 U. S. 438.
(b) Here, at the time inventory notice was served on the other identifiable persons, the intercept had been completed and the conversations had been ""seized"" under a valid intercept order, and the fact that discretionary notice reached 39, rather than 41, identifiable persons does not, in itself, mean that the conversations were unlawfully intercepted.  Pp.  429 U. S. 438-439.

Syllabus 
The provision of petitioner labor unions' constitution limiting eligibility for local union office to members who have attended at least one-half of the local's regular meetings for three years previous to the election of officers, held to violate  401(e) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, which provides that every union member in good standing shall be eligible to be a candidate and to hold office, subject to ""reasonable qualifications.""  Pp.  429 U. S. 308-314.
(a) Where such meeting attendance requirement resulted in the exclusion of 96.5% of petitioner local's members from candidacy for office, the requirement cannot be considered a ""reasonable qualification"" consistent with Title IV's goal of free and democratic union elections, since a requirement having that result restricts the free choice of the membership in selecting its leaders.  P.  429 U. S. 310.
(b) The requirement has a restrictive effect on union democracy even when considered as simply mandating a procedure to be followed by any member who wishes to be a candidate, rather than as excluding a category of members from eligibility for office, since it is probable that to require a member to decide upon a potential candidacy at least 18 months in advance of an election when no issues exist to prompt that decision may discourage candidacies, and, to that extent, impair the general membership's freedom to oust incumbents in favor of new leadership.  Pp.  429 U. S. 310-311.
(c) Procedures that unduly restrict free choice among candidates are forbidden without regard to their success or failure in maintaining corrupt leadership, and hence it is immaterial whether or not it was shown that incumbent leaders of petitioner local became ""entrenched"" in their offices as a consequence of the operation of the meeting attendance requirement.  Pp.  429 U. S. 311-312.
(d) The challenged requirement cannot be justified as encouraging attendance at union meetings, since it plainly has not served that goal.  Nor can it be justified as assuring the election of knowledgeable and dedicated leaders, since Congress has determined that the best means

 to this end is open democratic elections, unfettered by unreasonable candidacy restrictions.  P.  429 U. S. 312.

Syllabus 
A New York statute imposing a transfer tax on securities transactions, if part of the transaction occurs in New York, was amended in 1968 so that transactions involving an out-of-state sale are taxed more heavily than most transactions involving a sale within the State.  The amendment provides for two deviations from the prior uniform application of the statute under which a transaction involving a sale and transfer of shares in New York was taxed the same as a transaction involving an in-state transfer but an out-of-state sale:  (1) transactions by nonresidents of New York are afforded a 50% reduction in the tax rate when the transaction involves an in-state sale; and (2) the total tax liability of any taxpayer (resident or nonresident) is limited to $350 for a single transaction when it involves a New York sale.  The purpose of the amendment was to provide relief from the competitive disadvantage thought to be created by the transfer tax for New York stock exchanges, as against out-of-state exchanges.  Appellant ""regional"" stock exchanges brought action in state court against appellee State Tax Commission and its members challenging the constitutionality of the 1968 amendment under the Commerce Clause.  The trial court denied the Commission's motion to dismiss, but on appeal the amendment was declared to be constitutional.
Held:  The amendment discriminates against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  429 U. S. 328-337.
(a) No State, consistent with the Commerce Clause, may ""impose a tax which discriminates against interstate commerce . . . by providing a direct commercial advantage to local business,"" Northwestern Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450,  358 U. S. 458.  P.  429 U. S. 329.
(b) Because it imposes a greater tax liability on out-of-state sales than on in-state sales, the transfer tax, as amended, falls short of the substantially evenhanded treatment demanded by the Commerce Clause, the extra tax burden on out-of-state sales neither compensating for a like burden on in-state sales nor neutralizing an economic advantage previously enjoyed by appellant exchanges as a result of the unamended statute.  Pp.  429 U. S. 329-332.
(c) The diversion of interstate commerce and diminution of free 
Page 429 U. S. 319
 competition in securities, sales created by the 1968 amendment are wholly inconsistent with the free trade purpose of the Commerce Clause.  With respect to residents, the discriminatory burden of the maximum tax on out-of-state sales promotes intrastate transactions at the expense of interstate commerce to out-of-state exchanges.  With respect to nonresidents, both the maximum tax and the rate reduction provisions discriminate against out-of-state sales, and the fact that this discrimination is in favor of nonresident, in-state sales which may also be considered as interstate commerce, does not save the amendment from Commerce Clause restrictions.

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), having investigated the income tax liability of a taxpayer who was a fugitive from justice, determined deficiencies for two taxable years, and because of the taxpayer's failure to file proper returns and his fugitive status, made jeopardy assessments pursuant to  6861(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.  Petitioner corporation was determined to be the alter ego of the taxpayer.  Thereafter, pursuant to a decision to levy upon and seize automobiles registered in petitioner's name in partial satisfaction of the assessments against the taxpayer, agents made warrantless seizures of several such automobiles from property in which petitioner had no interest.  For the purpose of levying on other property subject to seizure, they also went to petitioner's office, a cottage-type building, and made a warrantless forced entry.  Pending further information as to whether the cottage was an office or a residence, the agents made no initial seizures, but two days later they again entered the cottage without a warrant and seized books, records, and other property.  Thereafter petitioner, claiming that it was not the taxpayer's alter ego, that the assessment was invalid, and that the seizures of the automobiles and the contents of the office violated the Fourth Amendment, instituted this suit, seeking return of the automobiles, suppression of evidence obtained from the seized documents, and damages from the IRS agents.  The District Court entered judgment for petitioner, finding that the IRS agents had committed illegal searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals for the most part reversed, ruling that the assessments were valid, that the evidence conclusively established that petitioner was the taxpayer's alter ego, and that the warrantless searches and seizures were not unconstitutional.  Section 6331(a) of the 1954 Code authorizes the IRS to collect taxes ""by levy upon all property and rights to property"" belonging to a person who ""neglects or refuses to pay"" any tax, and  6331(b) defines ""levy"" as including ""the power of distraint and seizure by any means.""
Held:
1. This Court granted certiorari limited to the Fourth Amendment issue, and thus accepts the Court of Appeals' determinations that the assessments and levies were valid and that petitioner was the taxpayer's 
Page 429 U. S. 339
 alter ego.  Petitioner does not challenge any other aspect of probable cause to believe that the items seized were properly subject to seizure, and therefore the only question before the Court is whether warrants were required.  P.  429 U. S. 351.
2. The warrantless automobile seizures, which occurred in public streets, parking lots, or other open areas, involved no invasion of privacy and were not unconstitutional.  Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improv. Co., 18 How. 272.  Pp.  429 U. S. 351-352.
3. The warrantless entry into the privacy of petitioner's office violated the Fourth Amendment, since,
""except in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper consent is 'unreasonable' unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant.""
Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523,  387 U. S. 528-529.  Pp.  429 U. S. 352-359.
(a) Business premises are protected by the Fourth Amendment, and corporations have Fourth Amendment rights.  The intrusion here was based not on the nature of petitioner's business, its license, or regulation of its activities, but on the ground that its assets were seizable to satisfy tax assessments, which does not justify depriving petitioner of its Fourth Amendment rights simply because it is a corporation.  Pp.  429 U. S. 353-354.
(b) Neither the history of the common law and the laws in several States prior to the adoption of the Bill of Rights nor the case law since that time justifies creation of a broad exception to the warrant requirement for intrusions in furtherance of tax enforcement.  Pp.  429 U. S. 354-356.
(c) Section 6331(b) must be read as authorizing only warrantless seizures, as opposed to warrantless searches.  Pp.  429 U. S. 356-358.
(d) This case does not fall under the ""exigent circumstances"" exception to the warrant requirement, as is clear from the agents' own delay in making the entry in which the records were seized.  Pp.  429 U. S. 358-359.
4. Of the various remedy issues raised by petitioner, only the issue of damages against the individual agents need be addressed under the limited grant of certiorari and in the present posture of the case.

Syllabus 
This litigation involves a dispute between the State of Oregon and an Oregon corporation over the ownership of two portions of land underlying the Willamette River, which is navigable but not an interstate boundary.  The first portion has been within the riverbed since Oregon's admission into the Union, while the second portion is in an area that was not part of the riverbed at the time of Oregon's admission, but later became part of the riverbed because of changes in the river's course.  In an ejectment action brought by Oregon against the corporation, which had been digging in the disputed part of the riverbed for 40 to 50 years without a lease from the State, the trial court awarded the first portion to the State on the ground that it had acquired sovereign title thereto upon admission into the Union and had not conveyed it, but with respect to the second portion found that avulsion, rather than accretion, had caused the changes in the river channel, and that therefore the title to the land remained in the corporation, its original owner before it became riverbed.  The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed, taking the view that it was bound to apply federal common law to the resolution of the dispute by Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, 414 U. S. 313, and accordingly holding that the trial court's award of the second portion to the corporation was correct either under the theory of avulsion or under an exception to the accretion rule, and that preservation of the State's interest in navigation, fishing, and other related goals did not require that it acquire ownership of the new riverbed.  The Oregon Supreme Court affirmed, with certain modifications dealing only with a factual question regarding the length of the second portion.
Held:  The disputed ownership of the riverbed lands should be decided solely as a matter of Oregon law, and not by federal common law, since application of federal common law is required neither by the equal-footing doctrine nor by any other principle of federal law.  If the lands at issue did pass under the equal-footing doctrine, state title is not subject to defeasance and state law governs subsequent 
Page 429 U. S. 364
 dispositions.  A similar result obtains in the case of riparian lands which did not pass under that doctrine; state law governs issues relating to such property, like other real property, unless some other principle of federal law requires a different result.  Bonelli Cattle Co., supra, was wrong in treating the equal-footing doctrine as a source of federal common law after the doctrine had vested title to the riverbed in question in that case in the State of Arizona as of the time of its admission into the Union, and, accordingly, that case's application of federal common law to cases such as the instant one is overruled.

Housing Development Corp.
No. 75-616
Argued October 13, 1976
Decided January 11, 1977
429 U.S. 252

Syllabus 
Respondent Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. (MHDC), a nonprofit developer, contracted to purchase a tract within the boundaries of petitioner Village in order to build racially integrated low- and moderate-income housing.  The contract was contingent upon securing rezoning as well as federal housing assistance.  MHDC applied to the Village for the necessary rezoning from a single-family to a multiple-family (R-5) classification.  At a series of Village Plan Commission public meetings, both supporters and opponents touched upon the fact that the project would probably be racially integrated.  Opponents also stressed zoning factors that pointed toward denial of MHDC's application:  the location had always been zoned single-family, and the Village's apartment policy called for limited use of R-5 zoning, primarily as a buffer between single-family development and commercial or manufacturing districts, none of which adjoined the project's proposed location.  After the Village denied rezoning, MHDC and individual minority respondents filed this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that the denial was racially discriminatory and violated, inter alia, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fair Housing Act.  The District Court held that the Village's rezoning denial was motivated not by racial discrimination but by a desire to protect property values and maintain the Village's zoning plan.  Though approving those conclusions, the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the ""ultimate effect"" of the rezoning denial was racially discriminatory and observing that the denial would disproportionately affect blacks, particularly in view of the fact that the general suburban area, though economically expanding, continued to be marked by residential segregation.
Held:
1. MHDC and at least one individual respondent have standing to bring this action.  Pp.  429 U. S. 260-264.
(a) MHDC has met the constitutional standing requirements by showing injury fairly traceable to petitioners' acts.  The challenged action of the Village stands as an absolute barrier to constructing the housing for which MHDC had contracted, a barrier which could be 
Page 429 U. S. 253
 removed if injunctive relief were granted.  MHDC, despite the contingency provisions in its contract, has suffered economic injury based upon the expenditures it made in support of its rezoning petition, as well as noneconomic injury from the defeat of its objective, embodied in its specific project, of making suitable low-cost housing available where such housing is scarce.  Pp.  429 U. S. 261-263.
(b) Whether MHDC has standing to assert the constitutional rights of its prospective minority tenants need not be decided, for at least one of the individual respondents, a Negro working in the Village and desirous of securing low-cost housing there but who now lives 20 miles away, has standing.  Focusing on the specific MHDC project, he has adequately alleged an ""actionable causal relationship"" between the Village's zoning practices and his asserted injury.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490,  422 U. S. 507.  Pp.  429 U. S. 263-264.
2. Proof of a racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and respondents failed to carry their burden of proving that such an intent or purpose was a motivating factor in the Village's rezoning decision.

			"|"Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan
Housing Development Corp.
No. 75-616
Argued October 13, 1976
Decided January 11, 1977
429 U.S. 252

Syllabus 
Respondent Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. (MHDC), a nonprofit developer, contracted to purchase a tract within the boundaries of petitioner Village in order to build racially integrated low- and moderate-income housing.  The contract was contingent upon securing rezoning as well as federal housing assistance.  MHDC applied to the Village for the necessary rezoning from a single-family to a multiple-family (R-5) classification.  At a series of Village Plan Commission public meetings, both supporters and opponents touched upon the fact that the project would probably be racially integrated.  Opponents also stressed zoning factors that pointed toward denial of MHDC's application:  the location had always been zoned single-family, and the Village's apartment policy called for limited use of R-5 zoning, primarily as a buffer between single-family development and commercial or manufacturing districts, none of which adjoined the project's proposed location.  After the Village denied rezoning, MHDC and individual minority respondents filed this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that the denial was racially discriminatory and violated, inter alia, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fair Housing Act.  The District Court held that the Village's rezoning denial was motivated not by racial discrimination but by a desire to protect property values and maintain the Village's zoning plan.  Though approving those conclusions, the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the ""ultimate effect"" of the rezoning denial was racially discriminatory and observing that the denial would disproportionately affect blacks, particularly in view of the fact that the general suburban area, though economically expanding, continued to be marked by residential segregation.
Held:
1. MHDC and at least one individual respondent have standing to bring this action.  Pp.  429 U. S. 260-264.
(a) MHDC has met the constitutional standing requirements by showing injury fairly traceable to petitioners' acts.  The challenged action of the Village stands as an absolute barrier to constructing the housing for which MHDC had contracted, a barrier which could be 
Page 429 U. S. 253
 removed if injunctive relief were granted.  MHDC, despite the contingency provisions in its contract, has suffered economic injury based upon the expenditures it made in support of its rezoning petition, as well as noneconomic injury from the defeat of its objective, embodied in its specific project, of making suitable low-cost housing available where such housing is scarce.  Pp.  429 U. S. 261-263.
(b) Whether MHDC has standing to assert the constitutional rights of its prospective minority tenants need not be decided, for at least one of the individual respondents, a Negro working in the Village and desirous of securing low-cost housing there but who now lives 20 miles away, has standing.  Focusing on the specific MHDC project, he has adequately alleged an ""actionable causal relationship"" between the Village's zoning practices and his asserted injury.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490,  422 U. S. 507.  Pp.  429 U. S. 263-264.
2. Proof of a racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and respondents failed to carry their burden of proving that such an intent or purpose was a motivating factor in the Village's rezoning decision.  Pp.  429 U. S. 264-271.
(a) Official action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact.  ""[Such] impact is not irrelevant, but it is not the sole touchstone of an invidious racial discrimination.""  Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229,  426 U. S. 242.  A racially discriminatory intent, as evidenced by such factors as disproportionate impact, the historical background of the challenged decision, the specific antecedent events, departures from normal procedures, and contemporary statements of the decisionmakers, must be shown.

No. 75-1278
Argued November 3, 1976
Decided January 11, 1977
429 U.S. 274

Syllabus 
Respondent, an untenured teacher (who had previously been involved in an altercation with another teacher, an argument with school cafeteria employees, an incident in which he swore at students, and an incident in which he made obscene gestures to girl students), conveyed through a telephone call to a radio station the substance of a memorandum relating to teacher dress and appearance that the school principal had circulated to various teachers.  The radio station announced the adoption of the dress code as a news item.  Thereafter, petitioner School Board, adopting a recommendation of the superintendent, advised respondent that he would not be rehired, and cited his lack of tact in handling professional matters, with specific mention of the radio station and obscene gesture incidents.  Respondent then brought this action against petitioner for reinstatement and damages, claiming that petitioner's refusal to rehire him violated his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Although respondent asserted jurisdiction under both 28 U.S.C.  1343 and  1331, the District Court rested jurisdiction only on  1331.  The District Court, which found that the incidents involving respondent had occurred, concluded that the telephone call was ""clearly protected by the First Amendment"" and that, because it had played a ""substantial part"" in petitioner's decision not to rehire respondent, he was entitled to reinstatement with backpay.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Petitioner, in addition to attacking the District Court's jurisdiction under  1331 on the ground that the $10,000 jurisdictional requirement of that provision was not satisfied in this case, raised an additional jurisdictional issue after this Court had granted certiorari and after petitioner had filed its reply brief, claiming that respondent's only substantive constitutional claim arises under 42 U.S.C.  1983, and that, because petitioner School Board is not a ""person"" for purposes of  1983, liability may no more be imposed on it where federal jurisdiction rests on  1331 than where jurisdiction is grounded on  1343.
Held:
1. Respondent's complaint sufficiently pleaded jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1331.  Though the amount in controversy thereunder must  
Page 429 U. S. 275
 exceed $10,000, even if the District Court had chosen to award only compensatory damages, it was far from a ""legal certainty"" at the time of suit that respondent would not have been entitled to more than that amount.  St. Paul Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U. S. 283,  303 U. S. 288-289.  Pp.  429 U. S. 276-277.
2. Petitioner, in making its belated contention concerning  1983, failed to preserve the issue whether the complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted against it.  Because the question involved is not of the jurisdictional sort which the Court raises on its own motion, it is assumed without deciding that respondent could sue under  1331 without regard to the limitations imposed by  1983.  Pp.  429 U. S. 277-279.
3. Since, under Ohio law, the ""State"" does not include ""political subdivisions"" (a category including school districts), and the record shows that a local school board like petitioner is more like a county or city than it is an arm of the State, petitioner is not immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.  Pp.  429 U. S. 279-281.
4. Respondent's constitutional claims are not defeated because he did not have tenure.  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593.  Pp.  429 U. S. 283-284.
5. That conduct protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments played a substantial part in the decision not to rehire respondent does not necessarily amount to a constitutional violation justifying remedial action.  The proper test is one that protects against the invasion of constitutional rights without commanding undesirable consequences not necessary to the assurance of those rights.  Since respondent here satisfied the burden of showing that his conduct was constitutionally protected and was a motivating factor in the petitioner's decision not to rehire him, the District Court should have gone on to determine whether petitioner had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision even in the absence of the protected conduct.  Pp.  429 U. S. 284--287.
529 F.2d 524, vacated and remanded.

Syllabus 
Federal and state regulations that disallow a deduction for transportation expenses in connection with a job training program for purposes of computing the income of food stamp recipients held not to conflict with the Food Stamp Act of 1964 or to deny equal protection or due process.  Pp. 292-297.
(a) Though under the Act's broad delegation of authority, the Secretary of Agriculture might have defined income in a variety of ways, his decision to adopt a definition of income including wages, welfare payments, training allowances, and other monetary receipts, with a 10% standardized deduction of the wages or training allowance (including tuition grants and travel allowances), and only a few specific deductions, is a valid exercise of his statutory authority.  The availability of alternatives does not render the Secretary's choice invalid.  Pp.  429 U. S. 293-295.
(b) Allowing a specific deduction for items such as transportation expenses would significantly increase administrative costs as well as risks of disparate treatment.  P.  429 U. S. 295.

429 U.S. 298

Syllabus 
Petitioners, operating a large, vertically integrated poultry business (including breeding farms, chicken hatcheries, a slaughtering and processing plant, and a mill for producing poultry feed), contract with 119 independently owned and operated farms for the raising of chickens which are hatched in petitioners' hatcheries.  Petitioners supply the farms with one-day-old chicks, their feed, medicine and supplies, and fuel, and pick up the chicks about nine weeks later when ready for slaughtering and processing.  Petitioners retain title to the chicks at all times, and pay the farmers a guaranteed sum plus a bonus based on poultry weight in exchange for the farmers' services in caring for and housing the chicks.  The chicks are fed with feed from petitioners' feedmill delivered by truck drivers employed by petitioners specifically for this purpose.  The petitioners refused to bargain collectively with a union representing these drivers, contending that the drivers were not employees as defined in  2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, but were exempted from protections of the Act as agricultural laborers by the related definition in  3(f) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  The union's resulting unfair labor practice charge was sustained by the National Labor Relations Board and the Court of Appeals on the ground that the truck drivers were not agricultural laborers because their duties were not incidental to petitioners' agricultural activities.
Held:  The drivers are ""employees"" within the coverage of the NLRA, not agricultural laborers, their status being determined by the character of the work that they perform for their employer, which work is not incidental to any of their employer's (petitioners') agricultural activities, the feedmill operation being nonagricultural and the storage and use of feed on the independent farms being agricultural activity performed by the independent farmers, not by petitioners.  The NLRB's conclusion that the truck drivers are employees is based on a reasonable interpretation of the NLRA, comports with the NLRB's prior holdings, and is supported by the Secretary of Labor's construction of  3(f).

 On petition for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 On October 20, 1977, this Court stayed the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission served June 28, 
Page 434 U.S. 949 , 950
 1977, in its Investigation and Suspension Docket No. 9164, Trans Alaska Pipeline System (Rate Filings), pending final disposition of the petitions for writ of certiorari by this Court. To further effectuate that order, it is hereby ordered: 
 1. During the period the stay is in effect, commencing at 3 p. m., e. d.t., October 20, 1977, the following pipeline companies may collect their respective rates set forth in the tariffs that were suspended by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its order of June 28, 1977: 
 Amerada Hess Pipeline Corporation 
 Arco Pipe Line Company 
 BP Pipelines, Inc. 
 Mobil Alaska Pipeline Company 
 Sohio Pipe Line Company 
 Exxon Pipeline Company 
 Union Alaska Pipeline Company 
 2. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may proceed with its investigation of the rates set forth in said tariffs (FERC Docket No. OR78- 1) and in connection with that investigation may enter any appropriate orders not inconsistent with either this order or this Court's order of October 20, 1977. 
 3. During the period the stay is in effect, the pipeline companies shall keep account of all sums collected under the terms of said tariffs by virtue of the stay entered by this Court. 
 4. In the event certiorari is denied or it is otherwise ultimately determined that said pipeline companies were not lawfully entitled to collect a portion of the rates so collected, the pipeline companies shall refund such portion of said rates, with interest computed in accordance with Section 15(8)(e) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, 90 Stat. 38, 49 U.S.C.A 15(8)(e) (Supp. 1977), to the persons entitled thereto without further order of this Court.
