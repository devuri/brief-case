Decided December 21, 1978
439 U.S. 1395

Syllabus 
Application to stay Court of Appeals' judgment and mandate affirming applicants' criminal contempt convictions for violating District Court's injunction is denied. The Court of Appeals apparently has granted a stay with respect to other individuals who were convicted of criminal contempt for violation of the same injunction; it is uncertain whether applicants have sought a stay from the Court of Appeals pending this Court's disposition of their petition for certiorari; and this Court has granted certiorari in a related case in which applicants' asserted basis for a stay will be reviewed.  Accordingly, it is the better exercise of discretion to require applicants to apply to the Court of Appeals for a stay pending this Court's disposition of their petition for certiorari.

Syllabus 
After respondent had been arrested in Michigan and charged with receiving and concealing stolen property (a truck driven from Arizona) and Michigan had notified Arizona authorities, Arizona charged respondent with theft, and an Arizona Justice of the Peace issued an arrest warrant reciting, in accordance with Arizona law, that there was ""reasonable cause"" to believe that respondent had committed the offense.  Thereafter, the Governor of Arizona issued a requisition for respondent's extradition accompanied by the arrest warrant, supporting affidavits, and the original complaint; the Governor of Michigan issued an arrest warrant and ordered extradition.  Upon being arraigned on the Michigan warrant, respondent petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that the extradition warrant was invalid because it did not comply with the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act in effect in Michigan, and the petition was denied.  The Michigan Supreme Court reversed the denial of habeas relief and ordered respondent's release on the ground that Arizona had failed to show a factual basis for its finding of probable cause to support its charge, the Arizona judicial finding of ""reasonable cause"" and the other supporting documents being found deficient in this respect.
Held:  Once the Governor of the asylum State has acted on a requisition for extradition based on the demanding State's judicial determination that probable cause existed, no further judicial inquiry may be had on that issue in the asylum State.  Pp.  439 U. S. 286-290.
(a) Interstate extradition was intended to be a summary and mandatory executive proceeding derived from the language of the Extradition Clause of the United States Constitution, which requires that a fugitive from justice found in another State be delivered to the State from which he fled on demand of that State's executive authority, and that Clause never contemplated that the asylum State was to conduct the kind of preliminary inquiry traditionally intervening between the initial arrest and trial.  P.  439 U. S. 288.

Pp.  439 U. S. 288-289.
(c) The Michigan Supreme Court's holding that the Arizona judicial finding of ""reasonable cause"" was deficient finds no support in the record read in the light of the Extradition Clause and Arizona law, and overlooks the ""conclusory language"" in which criminal charges are ordinarily cast.

Syllabus 
The First National Bank of Omaha (Omaha Bank) is a national banking association chartered in Nebraska; it is enrolled in the BankAmericard plan, and solicits for that plan in Minnesota.  Omaha Bank charges its Minnesota cardholders interest on their unpaid balances at a rate permitted by Nebraska law, but in excess of that permitted by Minnesota law.  The Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis (Marquette), a Minnesota-chartered national banking association enrolled in the BankAmericard plan, brought suit in Minnesota against Omaha Bank and its subsidiary, respondent First of Omaha Service Corp., inter alia, to enjoin the operation of Omaha Bank's BankAmericard program in Minnesota until such time as it complied with the Minnesota usury law.  Rejecting respondent's contention that Minnesota's usury law was preempted by the National Bank Act provision codified as 12 U.S.C.  85, which authorizes a national banking association ""to charge on any loan"" interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the State ""where the bank is located,"" the state trial court granted Marquette's motion for partial summary judgment.  The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed.
Held:  Section 85 permits Omaha Bank to charge its Minnesota BankAmericard customers the higher interest rate that is sanctioned by Nebraska law.  Pp.  439 U. S. 307-319.
(a) As a national bank, Omaha Bank is a federal instrumentality whose interest rate for its BankAmericard program is governed by federal law, and under  85, a national bank may charge interest ""on any loan"" at the rate allowed by the laws of the State where the bank is ""located.""

Section 1611(f) of the Social Security Act, which provides that no benefits under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program for the needy aged, blind, and disabled are to be paid for any month that the recipient spends entirely outside of the United States, held to be constitutional as having a rational basis and not to impose an impermissible burden on the freedom of international travel in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

No. 77-1016
Argued October 4, 1978
Decided December 11, 1978
439 U.S. 180

Syllabus 
The issue in this case involves the computation of the alternative income tax of a decedent's estate that had net long-term capital gains, a portion of which, pursuant to the decedent's will, was set aside for charitable purposes within the meaning of  642(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.  Under the provisions of the Code in effect during the years in question, taxpayers, including decedents' estates, with net long-term capital gains exceeding net short-term capital losses, paid either a ""normal"" income tax calculated by applying ordinary graduated rates to taxable income computed with a 50% capital gains deduction permitted by  1202 or, if it was a lesser sum, the alternative tax calculated under  1201(b).  In 1967 and 1968, petitioners, executors of an estate, realized long-term capital gains from the sale of securities included in the residue; there were no short-term capital losses.  Petitioners set aside a portion of the long-term capital gains for the benefit of a specified charity as directed by the decedent's will.  In the fiduciary income tax returns for 1967 and 1968, petitioners sought to use the alternative tax, and, in computing this tax, excluded from the long-term capital gains the portion set aside for charity.  The District Director disallowed the exclusion, without which the alternative tax was higher than the normal tax, with the result that the latter tax was due.  Additional taxes were assessed and paid, and this suit for refund followed.  The District Court allowed the exclusion, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The net long-term gains to which the alternative tax is applicable is reducible by the amount of the charitable set-asides in the years in question.  Pp.  439 U. S. 187-199.
(a) While charitable distributions or set-asides by an estate are not within the conduit system applicable to capital gains passing to noncharitable beneficiaries under  661(a) and 662(a) of the Code whereby an estate's distributable income to such beneficiaries is taxable to them, rather than to the estate, this does not mean that similar treatment may not be accorded to charitable distributions or set-asides deductible by the estate under  642(c).  Section 642(c) serves to extract income destined for charitable entities from an estate's taxable income, and thus 
Page 439 U. S. 181
 supplies a conduit for charitable contributions similar to that provided by  661(a) and 662(a) for income passing to taxable distributees.  The express exclusion, pursuant to  663, from  661(a) and 662(a) of those amounts deductible under  642(c) does not refute conduit treatment of such amounts, but, rather, such exclusion merely prevents a second deduction for charitable set-asides and recognizes as well that they are accorded separate treatment elsewhere in the Code.  Pp.  439 U. S. 187-194.
(b) It is doubtful that Congress intended that an estate which set aside part of its capital gain for charity should pay a higher income tax than if the same portion of capital gain had been distributed to a taxable beneficiary, or that the burden of the extra tax should be borne by the charities themselves or by the noncharitable residual legatees.  The former allocation would contravene  642(c), which permits deduction of charitable set-asides ""without limitation,"" and would indirectly offend the tax exemption extended to charities by  501.  And allocating the burden to the noncharitable legatees would result in taxation of the capital gain accruing to their benefit at an effective rate higher than the 25% ceiling that  1201 was intended to impose on the taxation of net long-term capital gains.  Pp.  439 U. S. 194-195.
(c) The legislative history of the 1954 Code is not incompatible with the general applicability of the conduit concept, and in fact clearly indicates that Congress sought rigorously to adhere to the theory that an estate or trust in general is to be treated as a conduit through which income passes to the beneficiary.  Pp.  439 U. S. 195-196.
(d) A construction of the alternative tax that permits petitioners to exclude the charitable set-asides does not conflict with the decision in United States v. Foster Lumber Co., 429 U. S. 32.  Pp.  439 U. S. 197-199.
(e) The principle that currently distributable income is not to be treated ""as the [estate's] income, but as the beneficiary's,"" whose ""share of the income is considered his property from the moment of its receipt by the estate,"" Freuler v. Helvering, 291 U. S. 35,  291 U. S. 41-42, survived in substance in the 1954 Code.  To treat charitable and noncharitable distributions of capital gain differently for the purpose of computing the alternative tax under  1201(b) ""stresses the form at the neglect of substance,"" and ""the letter of  1201(b) must yield when it would lead to an unfair and unintended result,"" Statler Trust Co. v.

No. 77-5903
Argued October 3, 1978
Decided December 11, 1978
439 U.S. 212

Syllabus 
Under the New Jersey homicide statutes, life imprisonment is the mandatory punishment for defendants convicted by a jury of first-degree murder, while a term of not more than 30 years is the punishment for second-degree murder.  Trials to the court and guilty pleas are not allowed in murder cases, but a plea of non vult is allowed.  If such a plea is accepted, the judge need not decide whether the murder is first or second degree, but the punishment is either life imprisonment or the same punishment as is imposed for second-degree murder.  Appellant, after pleading not guilty to a murder indictment, was convicted by a jury of first-degree murder and accordingly sentenced to life imprisonment.  The New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting appellant's contention that the possibility of a sentence of less than life upon the plea of non vult, combined with the absence of a similar possibility when found guilty of first-degree murder by a jury, was an unconstitutional burden on his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments and also violated his right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:
1. The New Jersey sentencing scheme does not impose an unconstitutional burden on appellant's rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  439 U. S. 216-225.
(a) Although the mandatory punishment when a jury finds a defendant guilty of first-degree murder is life imprisonment, the risk of that punishment is not completely avoided by pleading non vult because the judge accepting the plea has authority to impose a life term.  United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S. 570, distinguished.  Pp. 216-217.
(b) Not every burden on the exercise of a constitutional right, and not every pressure or encouragement to waive such a right, is invalid; specifically, there is no per se rule against encouraging guilty pleas.  Here, the probability or certainty of leniency in return for a non vult plea did not invalidate the mandatory life sentence, there having been no assurances that a plea would have been accepted and if it had been that a lesser sentence would have been imposed.  Cf. Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S. 357.  Pp.  439 U. S. 218-222.
(c) If appellant had tendered a plea and if it had been accepted and a term of years less than life had been imposed, this would simply 
Page 439 U. S. 213
 have recognized that there had been a plea, and that, in sentencing, it is constitutionally permissible to take that fact into account.  Absent the abolition of guilty pleas and plea bargaining, it is not forbidden under the Constitution to extend a proper degree of leniency in return for guilty pleas, and New Jersey has done no more than that.  Pp.  439 U. S. 222-223.
(d) There was no element of retaliation or vindictiveness against appellant for going to trial where it does not appear that he was subjected to unwarranted charges or was being punished for exercising a constitutional right.  While defendants pleading non vult may be treated more leniently than those who go to trial, withholding the possibility of leniency from the latter cannot be equated with impermissible punishment as long as plea bargaining is held to be a proper procedure.  Pp.  439 U. S. 223-224.
(e) The New Jersey sentencing scheme does not exert such a powerful influence to coerce inaccurate pleas non vult as to be deemed constitutionally suspect.  Here, the State did not trespass on appellant's rights so long as he was free to accept or refuse the choice presented to him by the State, i.e., to go to trial and face the risk of life imprisonment or to seek acceptance of a non vult plea and imposition of the lesser penalty.  P.  439 U. S. 225.
2. Nor does the sentencing scheme infringe appellant's right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, since all New Jersey defendants are given the same choice as to whether to go to trial or plead non vult.  Defendants found guilty by a jury are not penalized for exercising their right to a jury trial any more than defendants who plead guilty are penalized for giving up the chance of acquittal at trial.  Equal protection does not free those who made a bad assessment of risks or a bad choice from the consequences of their decision.  Pp.  439 U. S. 225-226.
74 N.J. 379, 378 A.2d 235, affirmed.

439 U.S. 234

Syllabus 
Section 3(a) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (Act) prohibits any company from acquiring control of a bank without prior approval by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board).  Under  3(c) of the Act, the Board must disapprove a transaction that would, inter alia, generate anticompetitive effects not clearly outweighed by beneficial effects upon the acquired bank's ability to serve the community.  Section 3(c) also directs the Board ""[i]n every case"" to
""take into consideration the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company or companies and the banks concerned, and the convenience and needs of the community to be served.""
Individual stockholders who controlled an existing bank organized respondent corporation to acquire their bank stock.  Respondent submitted the transaction for the Board's approval.  Upon review, the Board found that the transaction would have no anticompetitive effects and would not change the services offered by the bank to customers.  However, it ultimately disapproved the transaction, against the recommendation of the Comptroller of the Currency, on the ground that formation of the holding company would not bring the bank's financial position up to the Board's standards.  The Court of Appeals set aside the Board's order, holding that  3(c) empowers the Board to withhold approval because of financial or managerial deficiencies only if those deficiencies would be ""caused or enhanced by the proposed transaction.""
Held:
1. The Board has authority under  3(c) to disapprove formation of a bank holding company solely on grounds of financial or managerial unsoundness.  This conclusion is supported by the language of the statute and the legislative history, and, in addition, comports with the Board's own longstanding construction, which is entitled to great respect.  Pp.  439 U. S. 242-248.
2. The Board's authority is not limited to instances in which the financial or managerial unsoundness would be caused or exacerbated by the proposed transaction.  Such a limitation would be inconsistent with the language and legislative history of the statute and with the Board's own construction of its mandate, a construction in which Congress has

 acquiesced.  Nor does the legislative history suggest that Congress intended to reserve questions of bank safety to the Comptroller of the Currency or state agencies except where a transaction would harm the financial condition of an applicant or a bank.  Pp.  439 U. S. 249-252.
3. The Board's denial of the application is supported by substantial evidence that respondent would not be a sufficient source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank.  Pp.  439 U. S. 252-254.

Syllabus 
Appellant, assertedly the illegitimate son of Mario Lalli, who died intestate in New York, filed a petition for a compulsory accounting from appellee administratrix of the estate, claiming that he was entitled to inherit from Mario as his child.  Appellee opposed the petition, arguing that, even if appellant were Mario's child, he was not a lawful distributee of the estate because he had failed to comply with a New York statutory provision ( 4-1.2) that, in pertinent part, allows an illegitimate child to inherit from his intestate father only if a court of competent jurisdiction has, during the father's lifetime, entered an order declaring paternity.  Appellant contended that his failure to obtain such an order during Mario's lifetime could not bar his inheritance because  4-1.2 discriminated against him on the basis of his illegitimate birth in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Appellant tendered evidence that he was Mario's child.  The Surrogate's Court ruled that appellant was properly excluded as a distributee under  4-1.2.  The New York Court of Appeals affirmed and upheld the constitutionality of the statute.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  439 U. S. 264-276;  439 U. S. 276;  439 U. S. 276-277.
43 N.Y.2d 65, 371 N.E.2d 481, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concluded that  4-1.2 does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U. S. 762, distinguished.  Pp.  439 U. S. 264-276.
(a) While classifications based on illegitimacy are not subject to ""strict scrutiny,"" they are invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment if they are not substantially related to permissible state interests, Mathews v.

(b) The Illinois statute invalidated in Trimble (which, in addition to requiring the father's acknowledgment of paternity, required the legitimation of the child through intermarriage of the parents as a precondition to inheritance) eliminated ""the possibility of a middle ground between the extremes of complete exclusion [of illegitimates claiming under their fathers' estates] and case by-case determination of paternity.""  But the single requirement at issue under  4-1.2 is an evidentiary one; the marital status of the parents is irrelevant.  Pp.  439 U. S. 266-267.
(c) The primary goal underlying the challenged aspects of  4-1.2 is 
Page 439 U. S. 260
 to provide for the just and orderly disposition of a decedent's property where paternal inheritance by illegitimate children is concerned, an area involving unique and difficult problems of proof.  Pp.  439 U. S. 268-271.
(d) Section 4-1.2 represents a carefully considered legislative judgment on how best to ""grant to illegitimates, insofar as practicable, rights of inheritance on a par with those enjoyed by legitimate children,"" while protecting the important state interest in the just and orderly disposition of decedents' estates.  Accuracy is enhanced by placing paternity disputes in a judicial forum during the lifetime of the father, which (in addition to permitting a man to defend his reputation against unjust paternity claims) helps to forestall fraudulent assertions of paternity.  Estate administration is facilitated, and delay and uncertainty minimized, where the entitlement of an illegitimate child is a matter of judicial record before administration commences.  While there may be some instances where  4-1.2, as is often the case with statutory classifications, will produce inequitable results, the reach of the statute, unlike that involved in Trimble, does not exceed justifiable state objectives.

 The Court today lets stand a decision that upholds, after the most minimal scrutiny, an unwarranted governmental intrusion into the privacy of public employees. The ruling below permits a public employer to dictate the sexual conduct and family living arrangements of its employees, without a meaningful showing that these private choices have any relation to job performance.

 Petitioner Rebecca Hollenbaugh served as a librarian and petitioner Fred Philburn as a custodian at the state-maintained Carnegie Free Library in Connellsville, Pa. The two began seeing each other socially, although Mr. Philburn was married at the time. In 1972, Ms. Hollenbaugh learned that she was pregnant with Mr. Philburn's child, and within a month, Mr. Philburn left his wife and moved in with Ms. Hollenbaugh. Due to her pregnancy, Ms. Hollenbaugh sought and was granted a leave of absence by the respondent Board of Trustees from March to September 1973. While petitioners did not conceal their arrangement, neither did they advertise it. 
 Responding to some complaints from members of the community, the Board of Trustees attempted to dissuade petitioners from continuing to live together. When petitioners refused to alter their arrangement, they were discharged. They subsequently brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and monetary damages. 
 After a nonjury trial, the District Court found that under the minimum rationality test, petitioners' discharge did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.

|439 u.s. 96|"New Motor Vehicle Board of California v. Orrin W. Fox Co.
No. 77-837
Argued October 3-4, 1978
Decided December 5, 1978*
439 U.S. 96

Syllabus 
The California Automobile Franchise Act (Act) requires an automobile manufacturer to obtain approval of the California New Motor Vehicle Board (Board) before opening or relocating a retail dealership within the market area of an existing franchisee if the latter protests, and the Act also directs the Board to notify the manufacturer of such requirement upon the existing franchisee's filing of a protest.  The Board is not required to hold a hearing on the merits of the protest before sending the notice to the manufacturer.  Appellee manufacturer and proposed new and relocated franchisees, after being notified pursuant to the Act of protests from existing franchisees and before any hearings were held, brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the statutory scheme on due process grounds.  A three-judge District Court held that the absence of a prior hearing requirement denied manufacturers and their proposed franchisees the procedural due process mandated by the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:
1. The statutory scheme does not violate due process.  Pp.  439 U. S. 104-108.
(a) The Act does not have the effect of affording a protesting dealership a summary administrative adjudication in the form of a notice tantamount to a temporary injunction restraining the manufacturer's exercise of its right to franchise at will.  The Board's notice has none of the attributes of an injunction, but serves only to inform the manufacturer of the statutory scheme and of the status, pending the Board's determination, of its franchise permit application.  Pp.  439 U. S. 104-105.
(b) Nor can the Board's notice be characterized as an administrative order, since it did not involve any exercise of discretion, did not find or assume any adjudicative facts, and did not terminate or suspend any right or interest that the manufacturer was then enjoying.  Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U. S. 67; Bell v. Burson, 402 U. S. 535, distinguished.  P.  439 U. S. 105. 
Page 439 U. S. 97

(c) Even if the right to franchise constituted an interest protected by due process when the Act was enacted, the California Legislature was still constitutionally empowered to enact a general scheme of business regulation that imposed reasonable restrictions upon the exercise of the right.  In particular, the legislature was empowered to subordinate manufacturers' franchise rights to their franchisees' conflicting rights where necessary to prevent unfair or oppressive trade practices, and also to protect franchisees' conflicting rights through customary and reasonable procedural safeguards, i.e., by providing existing dealers with notice and an opportunity to be heard by an impartial tribunal (the Board) before their franchisor is permitted to inflict upon them grievous loss.  Such procedural safeguards cannot be said to deprive the franchisor of due process.  Pp. 106-108.
(d) Once having enacted a reasonable general scheme of business regulation, California was not required to provide for a prior individualized hearing each time the Act's provisions had the effect of delaying consummation of the business plans of particular individuals.  P.  439 U. S. 108.
2. The statutory scheme does not constitute an impermissible delegation of state power to private citizens by requiring the Board to delay franchise establishments and relocations only when protested by existing franchisees who have unfettered discretion whether or not to protest.  An otherwise valid regulation is not rendered invalid simply because those whom it is designed to safeguard may elect to forgo its protection.  Pp.  439 U. S. 108-109.
3. The Act does not conflict with the Sherman Act.  Pp.  439 U. S. 109-111.
(a) The statutory scheme is a system of regulation designed to displace unfettered business freedom in establishing and relocating automobile dealerships, and hence is outside the reach of the antitrust laws under the ""state action"" exemption.  This exemption is not lost simply because the Act accords existing dealers notice and an opportunity to be heard before their franchisor is permitted to locate a dealership likely to subject them to injurious and possible illegal competition.  Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U. S. 384, distinguished.  Pp.  439 U. S. 109-110.
(b) To the extent that there is a conflict with the Sherman Act because the Act permits dealers to invoke state power for the purpose of restraining intrabrand competition, such a conflict ""cannot itself constitute a sufficient reason for invalidating the . . . statute,"" for
""if an adverse effect on competition were, in and of itself, enough to render a state statute invalid, the States' power to engage in economic regulation

No. 77-5781
Argued October 3, 1978
Decided December 5, 1978
439 U.S. 128

Syllabus 
After receiving a robbery report, police stopped the suspected getaway car, which the owner was driving and in which petitioners were passengers.  Upon searching the car, the police found a box of rifle shells in the glove compartment and a sawed-off rifle under the front passenger seat and arrested petitioners.  Subsequently, petitioners were convicted in an Illinois court of armed robbery at a trial in which the rifle and shells were admitted as evidence.  Before trial petitioners had moved to suppress the rifle and shells on Fourth Amendment grounds, but the trial court denied the motion on the ground that petitioners lacked standing to object to the lawfulness of the search of the car because they concededly did not own either the car or the rifle and shells.  The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed.
Held:
1. ""Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights which . . . may not be vicariously asserted,"" Alderman v. United States, 394 U. S. 165,  394 U. S. 174, and a person aggrieved by an illegal search and seizure only through the introduction of damaging evidence secured by a search of a third person's premises or property has not had any of his Fourth Amendment rights infringed.  The rule of standing to raise vicarious Fourth Amendment claims should not be extended by a so-called ""target"" theory, whereby any criminal defendant at whom a search was ""directed"" would have standing to contest the legality of that search and object to the admission at trial of evidence obtained as a result of the search.  Pp.  439 U. S. 133-138.
2. In any event, the better analysis of the principle that Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights that may not be asserted vicariously should focus on the extent of a particular defendant's rights under that Amendment, rather than on any theoretically separate but invariably intertwined concept of standing.  Pp.  439 U. S. 138-140.
3. The phrase ""legitimately on premises"" coined in Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257, creates ""too broad a gauge"" for measurement of Fourth Amendment rights.  The holding in Jones can best be explained by the fact that Jones had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the premises he was using, and therefore could claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment.  Pp. 140-148.

4. Petitioners, who asserted neither a property nor a possessory interest in the automobile searched nor an interest in the property seized, and who failed to show that they had any legitimate expectation of privacy in the glove compartment or area under the seat of the car in which they were merely passengers, were not entitled to challenge a search of those areas.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 4, 1978
 Rehearing Denied Jan. 22, 1979. 
 See 439 U.S. 1135. 
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
 Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Mr. Justice POWELL joins, dissenting. 
 Efforts to describe the complex of factors that go into a decision by this Court to deny certiorari in any given case date back at least to the opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, 338 U.S. 912 (1950), and I shall make no attempt to embroider them here. Some Members of the Court may feel that a case is wrongly decided, but lacking in general importance; others may feel that it is of general importance, but rightly decided; for either reason, a vote to deny certiorari is logically dictated. In these cases it seems to me demonstrable that the Court of Appeals has not properly assessed the relationship between Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1971), and Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424d 599 [ Huch v. U.S 439 U.S. 1007 (1978) ][1007-Continued.]

Obviously we cannot review in this Court every school desegregation case decided by a Court of Appeals, and particularly where, as here, the Court of Appeals merely remands the case to the District Court for further proceedings, there is a very natural tendency to conclude that the decisions of the Court of Appeals are not deserving of plenary review given the almost unmanageable caseload of the Court. But the Court of Appeals from which these cases come historically has had to decide more school desegregation cases than any other Court of Appeals, and the interminable pendency of school desegregation litigation resulting from remand orders such as these is precisely what was condemned in Pasadena, supra.

 Rehearing Denied Jan. 22, 1979. 
 See 439 U.S. 1135. 
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
 Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Mr. Justice POWELL joins, dissenting. 
 Efforts to describe the complex of factors that go into a decision by this Court to deny certiorari in any given case date back at least to the opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, 338 U.S. 912 (1950), and I shall make no attempt to embroider them here. Some Members of the Court may feel that a case is wrongly decided, but lacking in general importance; others may feel that it is of general importance, but rightly decided; for either reason, a vote to deny certiorari is logically dictated. In these cases it seems to me demonstrable that the Court of Appeals has not properly assessed the relationship between Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1971), and Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424d 599 [ Huch v. U.S 439 U.S. 1007 (1978) ][1007-Continued.]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Georgia. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting. 
 Respectfully, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 I  
 Section 223 of the Motor Carrier Act, 49 Stat. 565, 49 U.S.C. 323, prohibits a common carrier by motor vehicle from delivering freight transported in interstate commerce until all tariff rates and charges have been paid, except as permitted by rules and regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to 49 U. S.C. 323, has adopted regulations that allow delivery without prior collection of freight charges but limit the credit that may be extended: Freight bills must be presented to the shipper and collected within seven days. 49 CFR 1322 (1977). A ""shipper"" is defined as the person who undertakes to pay the tariff charges. Ibid. The regulations are silent about what happens if the carrier fails to comply with the time limits established by them. The question raised by this case is whether failure by the carrier to comply with 
Page 439 U.S. 1014 , 1015
 the time limits prescribed by 49 CFR 1322 (1977) estops the carrier from collecting the freight charges from the shipper. 
 The Georgia Court of Appeals in this case held that it did, thereby joining the Seventh Circuit, which had reached a similar result in Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Delaware v. Admiral Corp., 442 F.2d 56 ( 1971). 
 Judge Swygert dissented in the Consolidated Freightways Corp. case, reasoning that ""[n]othing in the Motor Carrier Act provides that a carrier's failure to comply with section 323 or the Interstate Commerce Commission's credit regulation should result in the carrier's forfeiting its right to collect freight charges."" Id., at 65. At least two jurisdictions share this view. AAA Trucking Corp. v. Spherex, Inc., 110 N. H. 472, 272 A.2d 594 (1970); East Texas Motor Freight Lines v. Franklin County Distilling Co., 184 S.W.2d 505 (Tex.Civ.App.1944). 
 This conflict among jurisdictions over an issue which ""imperatively demand[s] a single uniform rule,"" Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, 319 (1852), commands the Court's immediate attention. There is further justification for review in Pittsburgh, C., C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Fink, 250 U.S. 577 (1919). There the Court held that a shipper remains liable for the full legal tariff even though the carrier mistakenly billed him for less, rejecting an argument that estoppel prevented collection on the ground that ""[e]stoppel could not become the means of successfully avoiding the requirement of the act as to equal rates, in violation of the provisions of the statute."" Id., at 583. The Fink case, although concerning Interstate Commerce Act provisions regulating railroads and not motor carriers, is directly analogous to this case, suggesting that the decision below may be at variance with our prior case law. 
 Because of the substantiality of the federal issue raised, I would grant certiorari and set this case for argument. [439 U.S. 1014 , 1016]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice POWELL, with whom Mr. Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting. 
 This case presents the question whether the Due Process Clause permits a tort plaintiff to obtain jurisdiction in New York over a defendant whose sole contact with the State arises from the defendant's contract for indemnity with a company that does business in New York. [Footnote 1] The case presents an issue of considerable importance, with troublesome ramifications in the spacious arena of personal injury litigation. Moreover, it seems to me that the rationale of our recent decision in Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186 (1977), is at odds with the decision of the Court of Appeals here. I therefore would grant certiorari and set the case for argument.

 The petitioners are residents of Virginia. While working for petitioner Lee-Hy Paving Corp. (Lee-Hy) in Virginia, the respondent's decedent (a New York resident) was killed when Lee-Hy's grader, operated by petitioner Clem, struck him near Richmond, Va. The respondent instituted this suit in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York as executrix for her husband's estate, claiming damages for the wrongful death of her husband. In order to obtain jurisdiction over the petitioners, who are conceded to have no other connection with New York, the respondent sought and obtained under New York law an order attaching the contractual obligations of two insurance companies doing business in New York to defend and indemnify Lee-Hy. The District Court denied petitioners' motion to vacate the attachment and dismiss the suit. Acknowledging that there was a ""substantial ground for difference of opinion"" on the question of law, and that the issue was an important one, the District Court certified an appeal to the Court of Appeals under 28 U. S.C. 1292(b). 
 The Second Circuit affirmed. 579 F.2d 194 (1978). The court based its ruling on the theory of quasi in rem jurisdiction adopted by the New York Court of Appeals in Seider v. Roth, 17 N.Y.2d 111, 269 N.Y.S.2d 99, 216 N.E.2d 312 (1966).

In Minichiello v. Rosenberg, 410 F.2d 106 (1968), the Second Circuit affirmed the constitutionality of Seider jurisdiction, reasoning that the New York Court of Appeals had created judicially a direct-action law similar to the Louisiana statute held constitutional in Watson v.

No. 77-120
Argued October 2-3, 1978
Decided November 28, 1978
439 U.S. 32

Syllabus 
Shortly after appellee, a Negro employee of the Dougherty County Board of Education, announced his candidacy for the Georgia House of Representatives, the Board adopted a requirement (Rule 58) that its employees take unpaid leaves of absence while campaigning for elective political office.  As a consequence of Rule 58, appellee, who sought election to the Georgia House on three occasions, was forced to take leave, and lost over $11,000 in salary.  When compelled to take his third leave of absence, appellee brought this action in District Court, alleging that Rule 58 was unenforceable because it had not been precleared under  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Act).  Concluding that Rule 58 had the ""potential for discrimination,"" the District Court enjoined its enforcement pending compliance with  5.
Held:
1. Rule 58 is a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting"" within the meaning of  5 of the Act.  Pp.  439 U. S. 36-43.
(a) Informed by the legislative history and the Attorney General's interpretation of  5, this Court has consistently given the phrase ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting"" the ""broadest possible scope,"" and has construed it to encompass any state enactments altering the election law of a covered State ""in even a minor way,"" Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U. S. 544,  393 U. S. 566.  Pp.  439 U. S. 37-40.
(b) Rule 58, like a filing fee, imposes substantial economic disincentives on employees who seek elective public office, and the circumstances surrounding its adoption and its effect on the political process suggest a potential for discrimination.  Pp.  439 U. S. 40-43.

|439 u.s. 60|"Holt Civic Club v. City of Tuscaloosa
No. 77-515
Argued October 11, 1978
Decided November 28, 1978
439 U.S. 60

Syllabus 
Appellants, a civic association and certain individual residents of Holt, Ala., a small unincorporated community outside the corporate limits of Tuscaloosa but within three miles thereof, brought this statewide class action challenging the constitutionality of ""police jurisdiction"" statutes that extend municipal police, sanitary, and business licensing powers over those residing within three miles of certain corporate boundaries without permitting such residents to vote in municipal elections.  A three-judge District Court granted appellees' motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
Held:
1. The convening of a three-judge court under then-applicable 28 U.S.C.  2281 (1970 ed.) was proper, since appellants challenged the constitutionality of state statutes that created a statewide system under which Alabama cities exercise extraterritorial powers.  Moody v. Flowers, 387 U. S. 97, distinguished.  Pp.  439 U. S. 63-65.
2. Alabama's police jurisdiction statutes do not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  439 U. S. 66-75.
(a) A government unit may legitimately restrict the right to participate in its political processes to those who reside within its borders.

			"|"Holt Civic Club v. City of Tuscaloosa
No. 77-515
Argued October 11, 1978
Decided November 28, 1978
439 U.S. 60

Syllabus 
Appellants, a civic association and certain individual residents of Holt, Ala., a small unincorporated community outside the corporate limits of Tuscaloosa but within three miles thereof, brought this statewide class action challenging the constitutionality of ""police jurisdiction"" statutes that extend municipal police, sanitary, and business licensing powers over those residing within three miles of certain corporate boundaries without permitting such residents to vote in municipal elections.  A three-judge District Court granted appellees' motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
Held:
1. The convening of a three-judge court under then-applicable 28 U.S.C.  2281 (1970 ed.) was proper, since appellants challenged the constitutionality of state statutes that created a statewide system under which Alabama cities exercise extraterritorial powers.  Moody v. Flowers, 387 U. S. 97, distinguished.  Pp.  439 U. S. 63-65.
2. Alabama's police jurisdiction statutes do not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  439 U. S. 66-75.
(a) A government unit may legitimately restrict the right to participate in its political processes to those who reside within its borders.  Various voting qualification decisions on which appellants rely in support of their contention that the denial of the franchise to them can stand only if justified by a compelling state interest are inapposite.  In those cases, unlike the situation here, the challenged statutes disfranchised individuals who physically resided within the geographical boundaries of the governmental entity concerned.  Pp.  439 U. S. 66-70.
(b) Alabama's police jurisdiction statutory scheme is a rational legislative response to the problems faced by the State's burgeoning cities, and the legislature has a legitimate interest in ensuring that residents of areas adjoining city borders be provided such basic municipal services as police, fire, and health protection.  Nor is it unreasonable for the legislature to require police jurisdiction residents to contribute through license fees, as they do here on a reduced scale, to the expense of such services.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice POWELL, with whom Mr. Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting. 
 Respondent, a nontenured public school teacher, was dismissed from her job in May 1975, following months of disagreement and dissension with her supervisors. The situation came to a head about six weeks before her dismissal. An informal conference was arranged and respondent, accompanied by her counsel, met with several school administrators to discuss her performance as a teacher. Although the meeting lasted for some time, it was confined primarily to an extensive cross-examination by respondent's counsel of the school administrators. The meeting was terminated inconclusively because respondent's counsel insisted upon a "" specific written statement of charges"" as a precondition of his client's full participation in the meeting and ""never allowed her to speak."" *

His record of the events leading to the adjournment of the meeting was as follows: ""Mr. Ditowsky [counsel for Miss Berger]: Again, Dr. Robinson, I respectfully submit that since we do not have a specific written statement of charges, and furthermore, since the nature of some of these charges are components of a Court suit we already have against the Board of Education, I do not feel that my client's participation in this meeting is proper . . . .

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 In 1971 a grocery store clerk in Tulsa, Okla., was shot and killed during the course of a robbery of the store. Petitioner has undergone two separate trials based on two separate 
Page 439 U.S. 970 , 971
 charges arising out of this event. Petitioner was convicted of armed robbery in the District Court of Tulsa County, Case No. CRF-73-228, on July 19, 1973. On November 21, 1973, petitioner was convicted in a second trial of the crime of felony murder, the armed robbery providing an essential element of the crime. Case No. CRF-73-227. Claiming that his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment had been violated, petitioner sought post-conviction relief in the District Court of Tulsa County, Okl. This relief was denied. 
 Petitioner then appealed to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, which ordered petitioner's conviction for felony murder vacated because of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Court stated: 
 ""This order is made without prejudice to the trial of the said Floyd Harris on any charge of homicide which the facts and justice may warrant, not inconsistent with the views expressed by the Supreme Court of the United States in Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, and Harris v. Oklahoma, [433 U.S. 682]."" Order Reversing Denial of Post-Conviction Relief, No. PC-78-93 (June 5, 1978). 
 Petitioner subsequently filed with the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals an application entitled Writ of Habeas Corpus or alternatively, Petition for Rehearing sua sponte, alleging that the court's order in No. PC-78-93 was erroneous because in contravention of Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U.S. 682 (1977). The court denied petitioner's application, stating: 
 ""As petitioner's trial on the charge of Murder in the First Degree is barred solely because the armed robbery for which he was previously convicted is a necessary element of the murder conviction, the holding of Harris v. Oklahoma . . . does not prevent petitioner's trial on a lesser degree of homicide which does not require proof of the armed robbery as a necessary element.""

 On Motion to Vacate Stay.
 Mr. Justice STEVENS, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 Because the Court in practical effect has summarily reversed the unanimous holding of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts on a question of Massachusetts law, it is appropriate to note my dissent. The highest court of the State held that a Massachusetts ""municipality has no authority to appropriate funds for the purpose of taking action to influence the result of a referendum proposed to be submitted to the people at a State election."" 1 
 Unless state action has violated some federal law, a federal court has no power to compel a State to spend its money or to grant a political subdivision of the state authority which the State has withheld. [Footnote 2] Federal questions may, of course, arise 
Page 439 U.S. 951 , 952
 when a State regulates the communicative activities of third parties, whether they be individuals or private corporations. Such questions may also arise if a State authorizes expenditures to advance or explain a particular point of view. But in this case we are merely confronted with "" a State's determination to refrain from speech on a given topic or topics and to bar its various subdivisions from expending funds in contravention of that determination."" 3 I consider it frivolous to suggest that the First Amendment, or any other provision of the United States Constitution, empowers this Court to interfere with that determination. I would therefore grant the motion to vacate the stay entered by Mr. Justice BRENNAN as Circuit Justice on October 20, 1978. 
Footnote 1 Jurisdictional Statement, at 6a. 
Footnote 2 ""Municipal corporations are political subdivisions of the State, created as convenient agencies for exercising such of the governmental powers of the State as may be entrusted to them. For the purpose of executing these powers properly and efficiently they usually are given the power to acquire, hold, and manage personal and real property. The number, nature and duration of the powers conferred upon these corporations and the territory over which they shall be exercised rests in the absolute discretion of the State. Neither their charters, nor any law conferring governmental powers, or vesting in them property to be used for governmental purposes, or authorizing them to hold or manage such property, or exempting them from taxation upon it, constitutes a contract with the State within the meaning of the Federal 
 Constitution. The State, therefore, at its pleasure may modify or withdraw all such powers, may take without compensation such property, hold it itself, or vest it in other agencies, expand or contract the territorial area, unite the whole or a part of it with another municipality, repeal the charter and destroy the corporation. All this may be done, conditionally or unconditionally, with or without the consent of the citizens, or even against their protest. In all these respects the State is supreme, and its legislative body, conforming its action to the state constitution, may do as it will, unrestrained by any provision of the Constitution of the United States. Although the inhabitants and property owners may by such changes suffer inconvenience, and their property may be lessened in value by the burden of increased taxation, or for any other reason, they have no right by contract or otherwise in the unaltered or continued existence of the corporation or its powers, and there is nothing in the Federal Constitution which protects them from these injurious consequences.

The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL and MR. JUSTICE POWELL join, dissenting.
The issue in this federal income tax case is whether a cash distribution that petitioner husband (hereafter petitioner) received in 1965 with respect to his shares in Capital Southwest Corporation (CSW) was taxable to him as a dividend, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held, or whether that distribution was a return of capital, and therefore not taxable, as the Tax Court held.  I regard the issue as of sufficient importance in the administration of the income tax laws to justify review here, and I dissent from the Court's failure to grant certiorari.

The issue in this federal income tax case is whether a cash distribution that petitioner husband (hereafter petitioner) received in 1965 with respect to his shares in Capital Southwest Corporation (CSW) was taxable to him as a dividend, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held, or whether that distribution was a return of capital, and therefore not taxable, as the Tax Court held.  I regard the issue as of sufficient importance in the administration of the income tax laws to justify review here, and I dissent from the Court's failure to grant certiorari."|

No. 77-1515
Decided October 16, 1978
439 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
The Interstate Commerce Commission initially denied petitioner railroad's request for an interim terminal surcharge to offset the increased taxes imposed by the Railroad Retirement Amendments of 1973 to fund additional retirement benefits for railroad employees.  But after a three-judge District Court set aside this denial and enjoined the ICC from refusing petitioner's terminal surcharge as an interim rate increase under  15a(6)(b) of the Interstate Commerce Act, the ICC allowed an interim terminal surcharge.  On respondent railroads' petition to set aside the ICC's order, the Court of Appeals directed that the interim surcharge be held in a separate trust fund pending the ICC's determination of final rates on remand.
Held:  The Court of Appeals' imposition of the trust fund requirement is contrary to  15a(6)(b)'s purpose of providing an expeditious method of allowing higher rates in order to minimize the effect that the increased railroad retirement taxes would have on the railroads' financial condition.  Under  15a(6)(b), once the interim rates were filed, the ICC could not suspend them until it made final rate determinations.  By impressing the trust on proceeds from these interim charges made by petitioner, the Court of Appeals exercised authority that Congress did not repose even in the ICC.
Certiorari granted; 565 F.2d 327, reversed in part and remanded.

 Albert SMITH, President of the Village of Skokie, Illinois, et al.v. Frank COLLIN et alNo. 77-1736 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 16, 1978
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Mr. Justice WHITE joins, dissenting. 
 It is a matter of regret for me that the Court denies certiorari in this case, for this is litigation that rests upon critical, disturbing, and emotional facts, and the issues cut down to the very heart of the First Amendment. 
 The village of Skokie, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, in 1974 had a population of approximately 70,000 persons. A majority were Jewish; of the Jewish population a substantial number were survivors of World War II persecution. In March 1977, respondents Collin and the National Socialist Party of America, which Collin described as a ""Nazi organization,"" publicly announced plans to hold an assembly in front of the Skokie Village Hall. On May 2, the village enacted three ordinances. The first established a permit system for parades and public assemblies and required applicants to post public liability and property damage insurance. The second prohibited the dissemination of material that incited racial or religious hatred with intent so to incite. The third prohibited public demonstrations by members of political parties while wearing military- style uniforms. 
 On June 22, respondent Collin applied for a permit under the first ordinance. His application stated that a public assembly would take place on July 4, would consist of persons demonstrating in front of the Village Hall, would last about a 
Page 439 U.S. 916 , 917
 half hour, and would not disrupt traffic. It also stated that the participants would wear uniforms with swastikas and would carry placards proclaiming free speech for white persons, but would not distribute handbills or literature. The permit was denied. 
 Skokie's Village Hall stood on a street that was zoned commercial. There were residential areas, however, adjoining to the North, South, and West. The front of the Village Hall was visible from dwellings in those areas. 
 Upon the rejection of the permit application, respondents filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the president of the village of Skokie, its manager, its corporation counsel, and the village itself. Respondents asked that the ordinances be declared void and their enforcement enjoined. The District Court, after receiving evidence, ruled that the ordinances were unconstitutional on their face, and granted the requested declaratory and injunctive relief. It filed a comprehensive opinion. 447 F.Supp. 676 ( 1978). The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, with one judge dissenting in part, affirmed. 578 F.2d 1197 (1978). 
 A permit then was issued to respondents for a demonstration on the afternoon of June 25, 1978, in front of the Village Hall. Respondents, however, shifted their assembly from Skokie to Chicago where activities took place on June 24 and July 9. 
 Other aspects of the controversy already have reached this Court. In April 1977, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Ill., entered an injunction against respondents prohibiting them, within the village, from parading in the National Socialist uniform, displaying the swastika, or displaying materials that incite or promote hatred against persons of the Jewish or any other faith. The Illinois Appellate Court denied an application for stay pending appeal. The Supreme Court of Illinois, in turn, denied a stay and also denied leave for an expedited appeal. Relief was sought here. This Court, per curiam but [439 U.S. 916 , 918]

 MELLON BANK, N. A.,v. SOUTHLAND MOBILE HOMES OF SOUTH CAROLINA, INC., et alNo. 78-188 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 10, 1978
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of South Carolina. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, dissenting. 
 This case raises a substantial issue concerning state-court venue of a transitory cause of action asserted against a national bank. For me, the issue merits plenary consideration, and I dissent from the Court's denial of certiorari insofar as the case concerns one of the two respondents. 
 Petitioner Mellon Bank, N. A., is a national banking association with principal place of business in Pittsburgh, Pa. In 1972 respondent Associates Financial Services Company, Inc. and Mellon executed an agreement under which Associates was to seek out mobile home dealers whose time-sale contracts for retail sales of mobile homes could be financed by Mellon. Respondent Southland Mobile Homes of South Carolina, Inc. operated mobile home retail sales lots in the State of South Carolina and was induced by Associates to enter Mellon's mobile home service program. As a consequence, Mellon directly financed a number of Southland's sales. The program provided for Mellon's release to Southland of something less that the full purchase price of any mobile home so sold, with the balance to be held in reserve for six months, after which only a 2% contingency fund was retained. At Southland's request, the total reserve later was limited to $20,000 in return for a personal guarantee from Southland's president and other security. 
 Southland subsequently instituted in the Court of Common 
Page 439 U.S. 900 , 901
 Pleas for Sumter County, S. C., this breach of contract action against both Mellon and Associates. The latter answered and filed a cross- complaint against Mellon. Mellon, by special appearance as allowed by state law, challenged the state court's jurisdiction over it on the grounds that it was ""located"" in Allegheny County, Pa., and that, under Rev.Stat. 5198, 12 U.S.C. 94 (1976 ed.) 1 a state-court suit against it could be brought only in Allegheny County. [Footnote 2] The court, however, ruled that it had jurisdiction over Mellon. It concluded that branch banking for the benefit of Mellon was taking place at Associates' office; that South Carolina's long arm statute, S.C.Code 36-2-803 (1976), applied; and that Mellon by its conduct had waived any immunity from suit in South Carolina it may have possessed. 
 Mellon appealed to the Supreme Court of South Carolina. In an opinion concerning Associates, 270 S.C. 527, 244 S.E.2d 212 (1978), that Court, without considering waiver, affirmed. [Footnote 3] [439 U.S. 900 , 902]

 NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY and Myron Farber, petitioners,v. NEW JERSEY and Mario E. JascalevichNo. 78-540 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 6, 1978
 Motion to vacate stay granted, and it is ordered that the order of Mr. Justice STEWART dated September 26, 1978, is hereby, vacated.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 I dissent from the decision of the Court to vacate the stay entered by Mr. Justice STEWART on September 26, 1978. 
 The motion to vacate provides a third occasion for me to consider the merits of the contentions raised by the New York Times and Farber in their petition for certiorari. On the first occasion, I denied their reapplication for a stay because of the premature stage of the state court proceedings. 439 U.S. 1304 (1978). Upon petitioners' reapplication for a stay after they had been held in contempt, I expressed my opinion that: 
 ""Given the likelihood that forced disclosure even for in camera review will inhibit the reporter's and newspaper's exercise of First Amendment rights, I believe that some threshold showing of materiality, relevance, and ne- 
Page 439 U.S. 886 , 887
 cessity should be required. . . . Examination of the record submitted with this application discloses that the Superior Court did not make any independent determinations of materiality, relevance, or necessity prior to ordering the applicants to submit the subpoenaed materials for in camera review."" 439 U.S. 1331, 1335 (1978). 
 I was compelled to deny that reapplication for a stay, however, because I could not conclude in good faith that four members of this Court would vote to grant a writ of certiorari, a criterion that must be satisfied before a single Justice can grant an application for a stay. Now that the matter is presented to the entire Court for decision, I am no longer so constrained. 
 I adhere to my view, notwithstanding the intervening decision by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, that petitioners have raised substantial claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Under the circumstances, I believe that both the criminal and civil contempt penalties should be stayed until this Court disposes of the petition for certiorari. 
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this motion.

It appears unlikely that four Justices of this Court would vote to grant certiorari at this time to consider the liability issues decided below, and, although four Justices might grant certiorari to consider the scope of the District Court's authority to grant such a drastic remedy as it did, the case is not presently at the certiorari stage, and a stay would be too disruptive, since school is to begin in three days.

Syllabus 
Application to stay, pending the filing of a petition for certiorari or an appeal, California Supreme Court's order vacating Court of Appeal's stay against enforcement of trial court's desegregation order for the Los Angeles school system requiring extensive busing of students, is denied.  It appears that the California Supreme Court continues to be of the view that the State Constitution requires less of a showing on the part of plaintiffs who seek court-ordered busing than this Court has required of plaintiffs who seek similar relief under the Federal Constitution.  Thus, applicant's complaint involves state law, and should be resolved in the state courts.  Accordingly, it is unlikely that four Justices of this Court would vote to grant certiorari to review the California Supreme Court's judgment.

ON APPLICATION FOR STAY 
MR. JUSTICE WHITE.
This is an application for a stay of an order of the Supreme Court of New Jersey refusing to stay, except temporarily to permit this application, an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey holding applicants in civil contempt for refusing to obey a subpoena for documents that was issued at the behest of the defendant in the course of an ongoing murder trial and that the Superior Court refused to quash. [Footnote 1]  Applicant Farber, a reporter for the New York Times, a newspaper, was committed to jail until he complied with the subpoena by submitting the requested documents for in camera inspection by the trial judge; and the New York Times Co., the corporation owning and controlling the newspaper, was ordered to pay $5,000 for each day of noncompliance with the subpoena.  Both applicants were also found guilty of criminal contempt.  On appeal to the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, that court stayed the convictions for criminal contempt but refused to stay the civil contempt judgment.  It did expedite the appellate proceedings, which are still pending.  The Supreme Court of New Jersey, in turn, refused to stay the Superior Court's judgment and to take immediate jurisdiction of the appeal. 
Page 439 U. S. 1318

This application for stay, which then followed, was addressed to MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, but, upon his recusal, was referred to me at 11 a.m. on July 28.  Because the stay entered by the New Jersey Supreme Court would otherwise have expired an hour later, a temporary stay was entered to permit an examination of the somewhat voluminous papers filed in support of the application and to consider a response which was requested from respondent.
There is an initial question of the jurisdiction of an individual Justice or of the Court to enter a stay in circumstances such as these.  Under 28 U.S.C.  2101(f), a stay is authorized only if the judgment sought to be stayed is final and is subject to review by the Supreme Court on writ of certiorari. [Footnote 2]  Whether a state court judgment is subject to review by the Supreme Court on writ of certiorari is, in turn, governed by 28 U.S.C.  1257, which provides that we have jurisdiction to review ""[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had. . . .""  Also, it is only final judgments with respect to issues of federal law that provide the basis for our appellate jurisdiction with respect to state court cases.

ON APPLICATION FOR STAY 
MR. JUSTICE WHITE.
Since MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN has disqualified himself in this matter, I have before me an application for stay of an order of the Supreme Court of New Jersey of July 6, 1978, which refused to stay and denied leave to appeal from an order of a state trial court refusing to quash a subpoena issued in the course of an ongoing criminal trial for murder.  The order of the trial court, issued June 30, ordered the New York Times Co. and Myron Farber, a reporter for the New York Times, to produce certain documents covered by a subpoena served upon them in New York pursuant to the Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings, N.J.Stat.Ann.  2A:81-18 to 2A: 81-23 (West 1976).  The subpoena was issued at the behest of the defendant in the New Jersey murder trial; and the documents, which were sought for the purpose of cross-examining prosecution witnesses, included statements, pictures, recordings, and notes of interviews with respect to witnesses for the defense or prosecution.  The subpoena was challenged by applicants on the grounds that it was overbroad and sought irrelevant material, and hence was illegal under state law; that it violated the state Reporter's Shield Law; and that it invaded rights of the reporter and the press protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
In denying the motion to quash and in ordering in camera

 inspection, the trial judge, having already certified that the documents sought were ""necessary and material for the defendant in this criminal proceeding,"" stated that, when the materials had been produced for his inspection, he would afford applicants a full hearing on the issues, including the state law issues of the scope of the subpoena and the materiality of the documents sought, as well as upon the claim under the state Shield Law.
I cannot with confidence predict that four Members of the Court would now vote to grant a petition for certiorari at this stage of the proceedings.  Orders denying motions to quash subpoenas are not usually appealable in the federal court system, United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683,  418 U. S. 690-691 (1974); United States v. Ryan, 402 U. S. 530,  402 U. S. 532 (1971); Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S. 323,  309 U. S. 324-326 (1940); Alexander v. United States, 201 U. S. 117 (1906), and, since leave to appeal was denied in this case, it may be that such orders are not appealable in the New Jersey system.  The applicants insist that, as a constitutional matter, the rule must be different where, as here, the subpoena runs against a reporter and the press, and that more basis for enforcing the subpoena must be shown than appears in this record.  There is no present authority in this Court that a newsman need not produce documents material to the prosecution or defense of a criminal case, cf. Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U. S. 665 (1972), or that the obligation to obey an otherwise valid subpoena served on a newsman is conditioned upon the showing of special circumstances.  But if the Court is to address the issue tendered by applicants, it appears to me that it would prefer to do so at a later stage in these proceedings.  The asserted federal issue might not survive the trial court's in camera inspection should applicants prevail on any of their state law issues.  Nor, in light of the trial court's evident views that the documents sought appear sufficiently material to warrant in camera inspection, 
Page 439 U. S. 1303
 do I perceive any irreparable injury to applicants' rights that would warrant staying the enforcement of the subpoena at this Juncture.  Cf. United States v. Nixon, supra at  418 U. S. 714.

Syllabus 
The Ohio death penalty statute provides that once a defendant is found guilty of aggravated murder with at least one of seven specified aggravating circumstances, the death penalty must be imposed unless, considering ""the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history, character, and condition of the offender,"" the sentencing judge determines that at least one of the following circumstances is established by a preponderance of the evidence:  (1) the victim induced or facilitated the offense; (2) it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed but for the fact that the offender was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation; or (3) the offense was primarily the product of the offender's psychosis or mental deficiency.  Petitioner, whose conviction of aggravated murder with specifications that it was committed to escape apprehension for, and while committing or attempting to commit, aggravated robbery, and whose sentence to death were affirmed by the Ohio Supreme Court, makes various challenges to the validity of her conviction, and attacks the constitutionality of the death penalty statute on the ground, inter alia, that it does not give the sentencing judge a full opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances in capital cases as required by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held:  The judgment is reversed insofar as it upheld the death penalty, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  438 U. S. 594-609;  438 U. S. 613-619;  438 U. S. 619-621;  438 U. S. 624-628.
49 Ohio St.2d 48, 358 N.E.2d 1062, reversed in part and remanded.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding:
1. The prosecutor's closing references to the State's evidence as ""unrefuted"" and ""uncontradicted"" (no evidence having been introduced to rebut the prosecutor's case after petitioner decided not to testify) did not violate the constitutional prohibitions against commenting on an accused's failure to testify, where petitioner's counsel had already focused the jury's attention on her silence by promising a defense and telling the jury that she would testify.  Pp.  438 U. S. 594-595.
2. The exclusion from the venire of four prospective jurors who made it ""unmistakably clear"" that, because of their opposition to the death penalty, they could not be trusted to ""abide by existing law"" and to 
Page 438 U. S. 587
 ""follow conscientiously"" the trial judge's instructions, Boulden v. Holman, 394 U. S. 478,  394 U. S. 484; did not violate petitioner's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the principles of Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, or Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522.  Pp.  438 U. S. 595-597.
3. Petitioner's contention that the Ohio Supreme Court's interpretation of the complicity provision of the statute under which she was convicted was so unexpected that it deprived her of fair warning of the crime with which she was charged, is without merit.  The court's construction was consistent with both prior Ohio law and the statute's legislative history.  P.  438 U. S. 597.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded, in Part III, that the limited range of mitigating circumstances that may be considered by the sentencer under the Ohio death penalty statute is incompatible with the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  438 U. S. 597-609.
(a) The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, not be precluded from considering as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.  Pp.  438 U. S. 604-605.
(b) The need for treating each defendant in a capital case with the degree of respect due the uniqueness of the individual is far more important than in noncapital cases, particularly in view of the unavailability with respect to an executed capital sentence of such postconviction mechanisms in noncapital cases as probation, parole, and work furloughs.  P.  438 U. S. 605.
(c) A statute that prevents the sentencer in capital cases from giving independent mitigating weight to aspects of the defendant's character and record and to the circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors that may call for a less severe penalty, and, when the choice is between life and death, such risk is unacceptable and incompatible with the commands of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  P.  438 U. S. 605.
(d) The Ohio death penalty statute does not permit the type of individualized consideration of mitigating factors required by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Only the three factors specified in the statute can be considered in mitigation of the defendant's sentence, and, once it is determined that none of those factors is present, the statute mandates the death sentence.  Pp.  438 U. S. 606-608.
MR JUSTICE WHITE concluded that petitioner's death sentence should 
Page 438 U. S. 588
 be vacated on the ground that the Ohio death penalty statute permits a defendant convicted of aggravated murder with specifications to be sentenced to death, as petitioner was in this case, without a finding that he intended death to result.  Pp.  438 U. S. 624-628.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, being of the view that the death penalty is, under all circumstances, a cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment, concurred in the judgment insofar as it vacates petitioner's death sentence, and also concurred in the judgment insofar as it affirms her conviction.  Pp.  438 U. S. 619-621.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded that petitioner's death sentence should be vacated on the grounds that (1) the Ohio death penalty statute is deficient in regard to petitioner, a nontriggerman charged with aiding and abetting a murder, in failing to allow consideration of the extent of petitioner's involvement, or the degree of her mens rea, in the commission of the homicide, and (2) the procedure provided by an Ohio Rule of Criminal Procedure giving the sentencing court full discretion to bar the death sentence ""in the interests of justice"" if the defendant pleads guilty or no contest, but no such discretion if the defendant goes to trial, creates an unconstitutional disparity of sentencing alternatives, United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S. 570.  Pp.  438 U. S. 613-619.
BURGER, C.J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered an opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, in which STEWART, WHITE, BLACKMUN, POWELL, REHNQUIST, and STEVENS, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part III, in which STEWART, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.

No. 77-285
Argued March 28, 1978
Decided July 3, 1978
438 U.S. 645

Syllabus 
The United States Bureau of Reclamation applied to the California State Water Resources Control Board for a permit to appropriate water that would be impounded by the New Melones Dam, a unit of the California Central Valley Project.  Congress specifically directed that the Dam be constructed and operated pursuant to the Reclamation Act of 1902, which established a program for federal construction and operation of reclamation projects to irrigate arid western land.  Section 8 of that Act provides that
""nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting or intended to affect or to in any way interfere with the laws of any State or Territory relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation, . . . and the Secretary of the Interior in carrying out the provisions of this Act, shall proceed in conformity with such laws. . . .""
After lengthy hearings, the Board, having found that unappropriated water was available for the project during certain times of the year, approved the Bureau's application, but attached 25 conditions to the permit (the most important of which prohibited full impoundment until the Bureau was able to show a specific plan for use of the water) which the Board concluded were necessary to meet California's statutory water appropriation requirements.  The United States then brought this action against petitioners (the State, the Board, and its members) seeking a declaratory judgment that the United States may impound whatever unappropriated water is necessary for a federal reclamation project without complying with state law.  The District Court held that, as a matter of comity, the United States must apply to the State for an appropriation permit, but that the State must issue the permit without conditions if there is sufficient unappropriated water.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but held that  8, rather than comity, requires the United States to apply for a permit.
Held:
1. Under the clear language of  8 and in light of its legislative history, a State may impose any condition on ""control, appropriation, use or distribution of water"" in a federal reclamation project that is not inconsistent with clear congressional directives respecting the project.  To the extent that petitioners would be prevented by dicta that may

The United States, in setting aside the Gila National Forest from other public lands, held to have reserved the use of water out of the Rio Mimbres only where necessary to preserve the timber in the forest or to secure favorable water flows, and hence not to have a reserved right for aesthetic, recreational, wildlife preservation, and stockwatering purposes.

No. 77-528
Argued April 18, 19, 1978
Decided July 3, 1978
438 U.S. 726

Syllabus 
A radio station of respondent Pacifica Foundation (hereinafter respondent) made an afternoon broadcast of a satiric monologue, entitled ""Filthy Words,"" which listed and repeated a variety of colloquial uses of ""words you couldn't say on the public airwaves.""  A father who heard the broadcast while driving with his young son complained to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which, after forwarding the complaint for comment to and receiving a response from respondent, issued a declaratory order granting the complaint.  While not imposing formal sanctions, the FCC stated that the order would be
""associated with the station's license file, and, in the event subsequent complaints are received, the Commission will then decide whether it should utilize any of the available sanctions it has been granted by Congress.""
In its memorandum opinion, the FCC stated that it intended to ""clarify the standards which will be utilized in considering"" the growing number of complaints about indecent radio broadcasts, and it advanced several reasons for treating that type of speech differently from other forms of expression.  The FCC found a power to regulate indecent broadcasting, inter alia, in 18 U.S.C.  1464 (1976 ed.), which forbids the use of ""any obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of radio communications.""  The FCC characterized the language of the monologue as ""patently offensive,"" though not necessarily obscene, and expressed the opinion that it should be regulated by principles analogous to the law of nuisance, where the ""law generally speaks to channeling behavior, rather than actually prohibiting it.""  The FCC found that certain words in the monologue depicted sexual and excretory activities in a particularly offensive manner, noted that they were broadcast in the early afternoon, ""when children are undoubtedly in the audience,"" and concluded that the language, as broadcast, was indecent and prohibited by  1464.  A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals reversed, one judge concluding that the FCC's action was invalid either on the ground that the order constituted censorship, which was expressly forbidden by  326 of the Communications Act of 1934, or on the ground that the FCC's opinion was the functional equivalent of 
Page 438 U. S. 727
 a rule, and, as such, was ""overbroad.""  Another judge, who felt that  326's censorship provision did not apply to broadcasts forbidden by  1464, concluded that  1464, construed narrowly as it has to be, covers only language that is obscene or otherwise unprotected by the First Amendment.  The third judge, dissenting, concluded that the FCC had correctly condemned the daytime broadcast as indecent.  Respondent contends that the broadcast was not indecent within the meaning of the statute because of the absence of prurient appeal.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  438 U. S. 734-741;  438 U. S. 748-750;  438 U. S. 761-762.
181 U.S.App.D.C. 132, 556 F.2d 9, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I-III and IV-C, finding:
1. The FCC's order was an adjudication under 5 U.S.C.  554(e) (1976 ed.), the character of which was not changed by the general statements in the memorandum opinion; nor did the FCC's action constitute rulemaking or the promulgation of regulations.  Hence, the Court's review must focus on the FCC's determination that the monologue was indecent as broadcast.  Pp.  438 U. S. 734-735.
2. Section 326 does not limit the FCC's authority to sanction licensees who engage in obscene, indecent, or profane broadcasting.  Though the censorship ban precludes editing proposed broadcasts in advance, the ban does not deny the FCC the power to review the content of completed broadcasts.  Pp.  438 U. S. 735-738.
3. The FCC was warranted in concluding that indecent language within the meaning of  1464 was used in the challenged broadcast.  The words ""obscene, indecent, or profane"" are in the disjunctive, implying that each has a separate meaning.  Though prurient appeal is an element of ""obscene,"" it is not an element of ""indecent,"" which merely refers to conconformance with accepted standards of morality.  Contrary to respondent's argument, this Court, in Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, has not foreclosed a reading of  1464 that authorizes a proscription of ""indecent"" language that is not obscene, for the statute involved in that case, unlike  1464, focused upon the prurient, and dealt primarily with printed matter in sealed envelopes mailed from one individual to another, whereas  1464 deals with the content of public broadcasts.  Pp.  438 U. S. 738-741.
4. Of all forms of communication, broadcasting has the most limited First Amendment protection.  Among the reasons for specially treating indecent broadcasting is the uniquely pervasive presence that medium of expression occupies in the lives of our people.  Broadcasts extend into the privacy of the home, and it is impossible completely to avoid 
Page 438 U. S. 728
 those that are patently offensive.  Broadcasting, moreover, is uniquely accessible to children.  Pp.  438 U. S. 747-750.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded in Part IV-A and IV-B:
1. The FCC's authority to proscribe this particular broadcast is not invalidated by the possibility that its construction of the statute may deter certain hypothetically protected broadcasts containing patently offensive references to sexual and excretory activities.  Cf. Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367.  Pp.  438 U. S. 742-743.
2. The First Amendment does not prohibit all governmental regulation that depends on the content of speech.  Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47,  249 U. S. 52.  The content of respondent's broadcast, which was ""vulgar,"" ""offensive,"" and ""shocking,"" is not entitled to absolute constitutional protection in all contexts; it is therefore necessary to evaluate the FCC's action in light of the content of that broadcast.  Pp.  438 U. S. 744-748.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, joined by MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that the FCC's holding does not violate the First Amendment, though, being of the view that Members of this Court are not free generally to decide on the basis of its content which speech protected by the First Amendment is most valuable and therefore deserving of First Amendment protection, and which is less ""valuable"" and hence less deserving of protection, he is unable to join Part IV-B (or IV-A) of the opinion.  Pp.  438 U. S. 761-762.
STEVENS, J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered an opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I-III and IV-C, in which BURGER, C.J., and REHNQUIST, J., joined, and in all but Parts IV-A and IV-B of which BLACKMUN and POWELL, JJ., joined, and an opinion as to Parts IV-A and IV-B, in which BURGER, C.J., and REHNQUIST, J., joined.

No. 76-1560
Argued March 1, 1978
Decided June 29, 1978
438 U.S. 422

Syllabus 
Several major gypsum board manufacturers and various of their officials were indicted for violations of  1 of the Sherman Act by allegedly engaging in a price-fixing conspiracy.  One of the types of actions allegedly taken in formulating and effectuating the conspiracy was interseller price verification, i.e., the practice of telephoning a competing manufacturer to determine the price being currently offered on gypsum board to a specific customer.  After some of the defendants pleaded nolo contendere and were sentenced, the remaining defendants were convicted after a trial of some 19 weeks.  The Government's case focused on the interseller price verification charge, which the defendants defended on the ground that the price information exchanges were to enable them to take advantage of the ""meeting competition"" defense contained in  2(b) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act (which permits a seller to rebut a prima facie price discrimination charge by showing that a lower price to a purchaser was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor).  On the verification issue, tho trial judge charged the jury that, if the price information exchanges were found to have been undertaken in good faith to comply with the Robinson-Patman Act, verification alone would not suffice to establish an illegal price-fixing agreement, but that, if the jury found that the effect of verification was to fix prices, then the parties would be presumed, as a matter of law, to have intended that result.  The judge further charged that, since only a single conspiracy was alleged, liability could only be predicated on the knowing involvement of each defendant, considered individually, in the conspiracy alleged, the judge having refused the defendants' requested charge directing the jury to determine what kind of agreement, if any, existed as to each defendant before any could be found to be a member of the conspiracy.  With respect to the defendants' evidence as to withdrawal from the conspiracy, the judge instructed the jury that withdrawal had to be established by either affirmative notice to every other member of the conspiracy or by disclosure of the illegal enterprise to law enforcement officials.  The judge 
Page 438 U. S. 423
 refused the defendants' requested instruction that vigorous price competition during the period in question could also be considered as evidence of abandonment of the conspiracy.  After all the testimony had been presented, the jurors were sequestered for deliberation, and apparently disagreement among them arose.  After approximately seven days of deliberations, the foreman of the jury informed the judge that he wanted to discuss the jury's condition, and this resulted, with the parties' consent, in an ex parte meeting between the judge and the foreman.  Most of the discussion at the meeting involved the jurors' deteriorating health, but the foreman also referred to the jury's deadlock; there followed an exchange strongly suggesting that the foreman may have carried away from the meeting the impression that the judge wanted a verdict ""one way or the other.""  The jury rendered its guilty verdict the following morning.  The Court of Appeals reversed the convictions on various grounds, holding, inter alia, that verification of price concessions with competitors for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the ""meeting competition"" defense of  2(b) constitutes a ""controlling circumstance"" precluding liability under  1 of the Sherman Act, and thus an instruction allowing the jury to ignore the defendants' purpose in engaging in the alleged misconduct could not be sustained.
Held:
1. A defendant's state of mind or intent is an element of a criminal antitrust offense which must be established by evidence and inferences drawn therefrom, and cannot be taken from the trier of fact through reliance on a legal presumption of wrongful intent from proof of an effect on prices.  Since the trial judge's instruction on the verification issue had this prohibited effect, it was improper.  Pp.  438 U. S. 434-446.
(a) The Sherman Act is not to be construed as mandating a regime of strict liability crimes; rather, the criminal offenses defined therein are to be construed as including intent as an element.  Pp.  438 U. S. 436-443.
(b) Action undertaken with knowledge of its probable consequences and having the requisite anticompetitive effects can be a sufficient predicate for a finding of criminal liability under the antitrust laws.  Where carefully planned and calculated conduct is being scrutinized in the context of a criminal prosecution, the perpetrator's knowledge of the anticipated consequences is a sufficient predicate for a finding of criminal intent.  Pp.  438 U. S. 443-446.
2. A good faith belief, rather than an absolute certainty, that a price concession is being offered to meet an equally low price offered by a competitor suffices to invoke the  2(b) defense; exchanges of price information, even when putatively for the purpose of Robinson-Patman Act compliance, must remain subject to close scrutiny under the Sherman 
Page 438 U. S. 424
 Act.  Therefore, the Court of Appeals erred in treating interseller price verification even as a limited ""controlling circumstance"" exception precluding Sherman Act liability.  Pp.  438 U. S. 447-459.
3. The ex parte meeting between the trial judge and the jury foreman was improper, and the Court of Appeals would have been justified in reversing the convictions solely because of the risk that the foreman believed the judge was insisting on a dispositive verdict.  Such a meeting is pregnant with possibilities for error, since it is difficult to contain, much less to anticipate, the direction the conversation will take at such a meeting, any occasion which leads to communication with the whole jury panel through one juror inevitably risks innocent misstatements of the law and misinterpretations despite the undisputed good faith of the participants, and the absence of counsel from the meeting aggravates the problems of having one juror serve as a conduit for communication with the whole panel.  Here the meeting was allowed to drift into a supplemental instruction relating to the jury's obligation to reach a verdict, and counsel were denied any chance to correct whatever mistaken impression the foreman might have taken from the meeting.  Pp.  438 U. S. 459-462.
4. The trial judge's charge concerning participation in the conspiracy, although perhaps not completely clear, was sufficient, but his charge on withdrawal from the conspiracy was erroneous, since it limited the jury's consideration to only two circumscribed and arguably impractical methods of demonstrating withdrawal, rather than permitting consideration of any affirmative acts inconsistent with the object of the conspiracy and communicated in a manner reasonably calculated to reach coconspirators.  Pp.  438 U. S. 462-465.

No. 76-1560
Argued March 1, 1978
Decided June 29, 1978
438 U.S. 422

Syllabus 
Several major gypsum board manufacturers and various of their officials were indicted for violations of  1 of the Sherman Act by allegedly engaging in a price-fixing conspiracy.  One of the types of actions allegedly taken in formulating and effectuating the conspiracy was interseller price verification, i.e., the practice of telephoning a competing manufacturer to determine the price being currently offered on gypsum board to a specific customer.  After some of the defendants pleaded nolo contendere and were sentenced, the remaining defendants were convicted after a trial of some 19 weeks.  The Government's case focused on the interseller price verification charge, which the defendants defended on the ground that the price information exchanges were to enable them to take advantage of the ""meeting competition"" defense contained in  2(b) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act (which permits a seller to rebut a prima facie price discrimination charge by showing that a lower price to a purchaser was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor).  On the verification issue, tho trial judge charged the jury that, if the price information exchanges were found to have been undertaken in good faith to comply with the Robinson-Patman Act, verification alone would not suffice to establish an illegal price-fixing agreement, but that, if the jury found that the effect of verification was to fix prices, then the parties would be presumed, as a matter of law, to have intended that result.  The judge further charged that, since only a single conspiracy was alleged, liability could only be predicated on the knowing involvement of each defendant, considered individually, in the conspiracy alleged, the judge having refused the defendants' requested charge directing the jury to determine what kind of agreement, if any, existed as to each defendant before any could be found to be a member of the conspiracy.  With respect to the defendants' evidence as to withdrawal from the conspiracy, the judge instructed the jury that withdrawal had to be established by either affirmative notice to every other member of the conspiracy or by disclosure of the illegal enterprise to law enforcement officials.  The judge 
Page 438 U. S. 423
 refused the defendants' requested instruction that vigorous price competition during the period in question could also be considered as evidence of abandonment of the conspiracy.  After all the testimony had been presented, the jurors were sequestered for deliberation, and apparently disagreement among them arose.  After approximately seven days of deliberations, the foreman of the jury informed the judge that he wanted to discuss the jury's condition, and this resulted, with the parties' consent, in an ex parte meeting between the judge and the foreman.

No. 76-709

Decided June 29, 1978
438 U.S. 478

Syllabus 
After an unsuccessful Department of Agriculture proceeding to revoke or suspend the registration of respondent's commodity futures commission company, respondent filed an action for damages in District Court against petitioner officials (including the Secretary and Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, the Judicial Officer, the Chief Hearing Examiner who had recommended sustaining the administrative complaint, and the Department attorney who had prosecuted the enforcement proceeding), alleging, inter alia, that, by instituting unauthorized proceedings against him, they had violated various of his constitutional rights.  The District Court dismissed the action on the ground that the individual defendants, as federal officials, were entitled to absolute immunity for all discretionary acts within the scope of their authority.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the defendants were entitled only to the qualified immunity available to their counterparts in state government.
Held:
1. Neither Barr v. Matteo, 360 U. S. 564, nor Spalding v. Vilas, 161 U. S. 483, supports petitioners' contention that all of the federal officials sued in this case are absolutely immune from any liability for damages even if, in the course of enforcing the relevant statutes, they infringed respondent's constitutional rights, and even if the violation was knowing and deliberate.  Nor did either of those cases purport to abolish the liability of federal officers for actions manifestly beyond their line of duty; if they are accountable when they stray beyond the plain limits of their statutory authority, it would be incongruous to hold that they may nevertheless willfully or knowingly violate constitutional rights without fear of liability.  Pp.  438 U. S. 485-496.
2. Without congressional directions to the contrary, it would be untenable to draw a distinction for purposes of immunity law between suits brought against state officials under 42 U.S.C.  1983, Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, and suits brought directly under the Constitution against federal officials, Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388.  Federal officials should enjoy no greater zone of protection when they violate federal constitutional rules than do state officers.  Pp.  438 U. S. 496-504. 
Page 438 U. S. 479

3. In a suit for damages arising from unconstitutional action, federal executive officials exercising discretion are entitled only to the qualified immunity specified in Scheuer v. Rhodes, supra, subject to those exceptional situations where it is demonstrated that absolute immunity is essential for the conduct of the public business.  While federal officials will not be liable for mere mistakes in judgment, whether the mistake is one of fact or one of law, there is no substantial basis for holding that executive officers generally may with impunity discharge their duties in a way that is known to them to violate the Constitution, or in a manner that they should know transgresses a clearly established constitutional rule.  Pp.  438 U. S. 504-508.
4. Although a qualified immunity from damages liability should be the general rule for executive officials charged with constitutional violations, there are some officials whose special functions require a full exemption from liability.  Pp.  438 U. S. 508-517.
(a) In light of the safeguards provided in agency adjudication to assure that the hearing examiner or administrative law judge exercises his independent judgment on the evidence before him, free from pressures by the parties or other officials within the agency, the risk of an unconstitutional act by one presiding at the agency hearing is clearly outweighed by the importance of preserving such independent judgment.  Therefore, persons subject to these restraints and performing adjudicatory functions within a federal agency are entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability for their judicial acts.  Pp.  438 U. S. 508-514.
(b) Agency officials who perform functions analogous to those of a prosecutor must make the decision to move forward with an administrative proceeding free from intimidation or harassment.  Because the legal remedies already available to the defendant in such a proceeding provide sufficient checks on agency zeal, those officials who are responsible for the decision to initiate or continue a proceeding, subject to agency adjudication are entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability for their parts in that decision.  Pp.  438 U. S. 515-516.
(c) There is no substantial difference between the function of an agency attorney in presenting evidence in an agency hearing and the function of the prosecutor who brings evidence before a court, and, since administrative agencies can act in the public interest only if they can adjudicate on the basis of a complete record, an agency attorney who arranges for the presentation of evidence on the record in the course of an adjudication is absolutely immune from suits based on the introduction of such evidence.  Pp.  438 U. S. 516-517.

Syllabus 
Respondents, licensed physicians practicing in Rhode Island and their patients, brought a class action against petitioners, four insurance companies writing medical malpractice insurance in the State, alleging a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act in which three of the four companies refused to deal on any terms with the policyholders of the fourth as a means of compelling them to submit to new ground rules set by the fourth, whereby coverage on an ""occurrence"" basis would not be renewed and coverage would issue only on a ""claims made"" basis.  Petitioners' motion to dismiss the antitrust claim on the ground that it was barred by the McCarran-Ferguson Act was granted by the District Court.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the complaint stated a claim within the ""boycott"" exception in  3(b) of that Act, which provides that the Sherman Act shall remain applicable ""to any agreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate, or act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation.""
Held:
1. The antitrust claim is not mooted by the fact that, after the complaint was filed, Rhode Island formed a Joint Underwriters Association to provide medical malpractice insurance and to require all personal injury liability insurers in the State to pool expenses and losses in providing such insurance.  Since Rhode Island now permits the writing of such insurance outside of the Association, it cannot be said that ""subsequent events ma[ke] it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,"" United States v. Phosphate Expert Assn., 393 U. S. 199,  393 U. S. 203.  Pp.  438 U. S. 537-538.
2. The ""boycott"" exception of  3(b) applies to certain types of disputes between policyholders and insurers, and is not limited to concerted activity directed against competitor insurers or agents or, more generally, against competitors of members of the boycotting group.  Pp.  438 U. S. 538-551.
(a) The language of  3(b) is broad and unqualified, covering ""any"" act or agreement amounting to a ""boycott, coercion, or intimidation.""  Had Congress intended to limit its scope to boycotts of competitor insurer companies or agents, and to preclude all Sherman Act 
Page 438 U. S. 532
 protection for policyholders, it presumably would have made this explicit.  The customary understanding of ""boycott"" at the time of enactment, as elaborated in the Sherman Act decisions of this Court, does not support a definition of the term that embraces only those combinations that target competitors of the boycotters as the ultimate objects of a concerted refusal to deal.  Pp.  438 U. S. 541-546.
(b) The legislative history, while not unambiguous, provides no substantial evidence that Congress sought to attach a special meaning to the language of  3(b) that would exclude policyholders from all Sherman Act protection from restrictive agreements and practices by insurers falling outside of the realm of state-supervised cooperative action.  Congress intended to preserve Sherman Act review of certain forms of regulation by private combinations and groups, including but not limited to the eradication of ""blacklisting"" and other exclusionary devices directed at independent insurance companies or agents.  Pp.  438 U. S. 546-550.
(c) Nor does the structure of the McCarran-Ferguson Act support the proposed limitation on the reach of  3(b). Section 3(b) is an exception to  2(b), which limits the general applicability of the federal antitrust laws ""to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law.""  Congress intended in the ""boycott"" clause of  3(b) to carve out of the overall framework of plenary state regulation an area that would remain subject to Sherman Act scrutiny.  Pp.  438 U. S. 550-551.
3. The type of private conduct alleged to have taken place here, directed against policyholders, constitutes a ""boycott"" within the meaning of  3(b).  Pp.  438 U. S. 552-555.
(a) Such conduct accords with the common understanding of a boycott.  The agreement binding petitioners erected a barrier between respondents and any alternative source of the desired coverage, effectively foreclosing all possibility of competition anywhere in the relevant market.  Pp.  438 U. S. 552-553.
(b) The conduct with which petitioners are charged appears to have occurred outside of any regulatory or cooperative arrangement established by the laws of Rhode Island.  This is not a case where a State has decided that regulatory policy requires that certain risks be allocated in a particular fashion among insurers or has authorized insurers to decline to insure particular risks.  Here, a group of insurers decided to resolve by private action the problem of escalating damages claims and verdicts by coercing policyholders of one of the insurers to accept a severe limitation of coverage.

Section 3(b) is an exception to  2(b), which limits the general applicability of the federal antitrust laws ""to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law.""  Congress intended in the ""boycott"" clause of  3(b) to carve out of the overall framework of plenary state regulation an area that would remain subject to Sherman Act scrutiny.  Pp.  438 U. S. 550-551.
3. The type of private conduct alleged to have taken place here, directed against policyholders, constitutes a ""boycott"" within the meaning of  3(b).  Pp.  438 U. S. 552-555.
(a) Such conduct accords with the common understanding of a boycott.  The agreement binding petitioners erected a barrier between respondents and any alternative source of the desired coverage, effectively foreclosing all possibility of competition anywhere in the relevant market.  Pp.  438 U. S. 552-553.
(b) The conduct with which petitioners are charged appears to have occurred outside of any regulatory or cooperative arrangement established by the laws of Rhode Island.  This is not a case where a State has decided that regulatory policy requires that certain risks be allocated in a particular fashion among insurers or has authorized insurers to decline to insure particular risks.  Here, a group of insurers decided to resolve by private action the problem of escalating damages claims and verdicts by coercing policyholders of one of the insurers to accept a severe limitation of coverage.  Pp.  438 U. S. 553-555.

Syllabus 
Petitioner corporation specializes in relining blast furnaces with ""firebrick.""  It maintains no permanent force of bricklayers, but delegates to the superintendent of a particular job the task of hiring a workforce.  Respondents, three black bricklayers, sought employment with petitioner on a particular job, but two of them, though fully qualified, were never offered employment, and the third was hired only long after he had initially applied.  The job superintendent, pursuant to industry practice, did not accept applications at the jobsite, but hired only bricklayers who he knew were experienced and competent or who had been recommended to him as similarly skilled.  Respondents brought suit against petitioner claiming employment discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The District Court held, inter alia, that respondents had not proved a case of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, and that petitioner's hiring practices were justified as a ""business necessity"" in that they were required for the safe and efficient operation of petitioner's business.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondents had made out a prima facie case of employment discrimination under McDonnell Douglas, which petitioner had not effectively rebutted.  Disagreeing with the District Court's finding that petitioner's hiring practices were justified as a business necessity, the Court of Appeals devised a hiring procedure whereby petitioner would take written applications, with inquiry as to qualifications and experience, and then check, evaluate, and compare those claims against the qualifications and experience of other bricklayers with whom the superintendent was already acquainted, thereby allowing petitioner to consider the qualifications of more minority applicants.
Held: The Court of Appeals erred in its treatment of the nature of the evidence necessary to rebut a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas, and in substituting its own judgment as to the proper hiring practices for an employer who claims its hiring practices do not violate Title VII.  Pp.  438 U. S. 575-580.
(a) While the Court of Appeals was justified in concluding that, as a matter of law, respondents had made out a prima facie case of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas, the court went awry in apparently equating such a prima facie showing with an ultimate finding 
Page 438 U. S. 568
 of fact as to discriminatory refusal to hire under Title VII, and the court's imposition of a hiring method enabling the employer to consider, and perhaps to hire, more minority employees finds no support in either the nature of the prima facie case or Title VII's purpose.  Courts may not impose such a remedy on an employer, at least until a violation of Title VII has been proved, and here none had been proved under the reasoning of either the District Court or the Court of Appeals.  Pp.  438 U. S. 575-578.
(b) The Court of Appeals also appears improperly to have concluded that, once a McDonnell Douglas prima facie showing had been made out, statistics offered by petitioner to show that its workforce was racially balanced were totally irrelevant to the question of motive.  A McDonnell Douglas showing is not the equivalent of a factual finding of discrimination, but simply proof of actions taken by the employer from which discriminatory animus can be inferred because experience has proved that, in the absence of any other explanation, it is more likely than not those actions were based on impermissible considerations.  The employer, therefore, must be allowed some latitude to introduce evidence bearing on his motive.  Thus, although petitioner's statistics were not and could not be sufficient to demonstrate conclusively that its actions were not discriminatorily motivated, the District Court was entitled to consider the racial mix of the workforce when making a determination as to motivation, and the Court of Appeals should likewise give similar consideration to such proof in any further proceedings.

Syllabus 
Appellee minors brought a class action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 seeking, on the basis of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment as applied to the States by the Fourteenth, to prevent the State of Maryland from filing exceptions with the Juvenile Court to proposed nondelinquency findings made by masters of that court pursuant to a rule of procedure (Rule 911) permitting the State to file such exceptions, but further providing that the Juvenile Court judge, who is empowered to accept, modify, or reject, the master's proposals, can act on the exceptions only on the basis of the record made before the master, except that he may receive additional evidence to which the parties do not object.  The District Court held that a juvenile subjected to a hearing before the master is placed in jeopardy, even though the master has no power to enter a final order, and that the Juvenile Court judge's review placed the juvenile in jeopardy a second time, and accordingly enjoined the appellant state officials from taking exceptions to either a master's proposed finding of nondelinquency or his proposed disposition.
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit Maryland officials, acting in accordance with Rule 911, from taking exceptions to a master's proposed findings.  Breed v. Jones, 421 U. S. 519, distinguished.  Pp.  438 U. S. 214-219.
(a) The State by filing such exceptions does not require an accused to stand trial a second time, but rather the State has created a system with Rule 911 in which an accused juvenile is subjected to a single proceeding which begins with a master's hearing and culminates with an adjudication by a judge.  P.  438 U. S. 215.
(b) A Rule 911 proceeding does not provide the prosecution the forbidden ""second crack"" at the accused, since, under the Rule, the State presents its evidence once before the master, and the record is then closed unless the minor consents to the presentation of additional evidence before the judge.  Pp.  438 U. S. 215-216.
(c) Nor does Rule 911, on the alleged ground that it gives the State a chance to persuade two factfinders -- the master and the judge -- violate the Double Jeopardy Clause's prohibition against the prosecutor's 
Page 438 U. S. 205
 enhancing t,he risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted, since the Rule confers the role of factfinder and adjudicator only on the judge, who is empowered to accept, modify, or reject the master's proposals.  P.  438 U. S. 216.
(d) There is nothing in the record to indicate that the Rule 911 procedure unfairly subjects the defendant to the embarrassment, expense, and ordeal of a second trial proscribed in Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, since, even if the juvenile participates and his attorney appears in the Juvenile Court proceeding (and it does not appear that this is the practice), the burdens are more akin to those resulting from a judge's permissible request for post-trial briefing or argument following a bench trial than to the ""expense"" of a full-blown second trial.  Pp.  438 U. S. 216-217.
(e) To the extent the Juvenile Court judge makes supplemental findings in a manner permitted by Rule 911 -- either sua sponte or in response to the State's or juvenile's exceptions, and either on the record before the master or on a record supplemented by evidence to which the parties do not object -- he does so without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause's constraints.

Syllabus 
Appellant, an Illinois corporation, maintained an office in Minnesota with 30 employees.  Under appellant's pension plan, adopted in 1963 and qualified under  401 of the Internal Revenue Code, employees were entitled to retire and receive a pension at age 65 regardless of length of service, and an employee's pension right became vested if he satisfied certain conditions as to length of service and age.  Appellant was the sole contributor to the pension trust fund, and each year made contributions to the fund based on actuarial predictions of eventual payout needs.  But the plan neither required appellant to make specific contributions nor imposed any sanction on it for failing to make adequate contributions, and appellant retained a right not only to amend the plan, but also to terminate it at any time and for any reason.  In 1974, Minnesota enacted the Private Pension Benefits Protection Act (Act), under which a private employer of 100 employees or more (at least one of whom was a Minnesota resident) who provided pension benefits under a plan meeting the qualifications of  401 of the Internal Revenue Code, was subject to a ""pension funding charge"" if he terminated the plan or closed a Minnesota office.  The charge was assessed if the pension funds were insufficient to cover full pensions for all employees who had worked at least 10 years, and periods of employment prior to the effective date of the Act were to be included in the 10-year employment criterion.  Shortly thereafter, in a move planned before passage of the Act, appellant closed its Minnesota office, and several of its employees, who were then discharged, had no vested pension rights under appellant's plan, but had worked for appellant for 10 years or more, thus qualifying as pension obligees under the Act.  Subsequently, the State notified appellant that it owed a pension funding charge of $185,000 under the Act.  Appellant then brought suit in Federal District Court for injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming that the Act unconstitutionally impaired its contractual obligations to its employees under its pension plan, but the court upheld the Act as applied to appellant.
Held:  The application of the Act to appellant violates the Contract Clause of the Constitution, which provides that ""[n]o State shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.""  Pp.  438 U. S. 240-251. 
Page 438 U. S. 235

(a) While the Contract Clause does not operate to obliterate the police power of the States, it does impose some limits upon the power of a State to abridge existing contractual relationships, even in the exercise of its otherwise legitimate police power.

(b) The impact of the Act upon appellant's contractual obligations was both substantial and severe.  Not only did the Act retroactively modify the compensation that appellant had agreed to pay its employees from 1963 to 1974, but it did so by changing appellant's obligations in an area where the element of reliance was vital -- the funding of a pension plan.  Moreover, the retroactive state-imposed vesting requirement was applied only to those employers who terminated their pension plans or who, like appellant, closed their Minnesota offices, thus forcing the employer to make all the retroactive changes in its contractual obligations at one time.

No. 7811
Argued October 12, 1977

438 U.S. 265

Syllabus 
The Medical School of the University of California at Davis (hereinafter Davis) had two admissions programs for the entering class of 100 students -- the regular admissions program and the special admissions program.  Under the regular procedure, candidates whose overall undergraduate grade point averages fell below 2.5 on a scale of 4.0 were summarily rejected.  About one out of six applicants was then given an interview, following which he was rated on a scale of 1 to 100 by each of the committee members (five in 1973 and six in 1974), his rating being based on the interviewers' summaries, his overall grade point average, his science courses grade point average, his Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) scores, letters of recommendation, extracurricular activities, and other biographical data, all of which resulted in a total ""benchmark score.""  The full admissions committee then made offers of admission on the basis of their review of the applicant's file and his score, considering and acting upon applications as they were received.  The committee chairman was responsible for placing names on the waiting list and had discretion to include persons with ""special skills.""  A separate committee, a majority of whom were members of minority groups, operated the special admissions program.  The 1973 and 1974 application forms, respectively, asked candidates whether they wished to be considered as ""economically and/or educationally disadvantaged"" applicants and members of a ""minority group"" (blacks, Chicanos, Asians, American Indians).  If an applicant of a minority group was found to be ""disadvantaged,"" he would be rated in a manner similar to the one employed by the general admissions committee.  Special candidates, however, did not have to meet the 2.5 grade point cutoff and were not ranked against candidates in the general admissions process.  About one-fifth of the special applicants were invited for interviews in 1973 and 1974, following which they were given benchmark scores, and the top choices were then given to the general admissions committee, which could reject special candidates for failure to meet course requirements or other specific deficiencies.  The special committee continued to recommend candidates until 16 special admission selections had been made.  During a four-year period, 63 minority 
Page 438 U. S. 266
 students were admitted to Davis under the special program and 44 under the general program.  No disadvantaged whites were admitted under the special program, though many applied.  Respondent, a white male, applied to Davis in 1973 and 1974, in both years being considered only under the general admissions program.  Though he had a 468 out of 500 score in 1973, he was rejected, since no general applicants with scores less than 470 were being accepted after respondent's application, which was filed late in the year, had been processed and completed.  At that time, four special admission slots were still unfilled.  In 1974 respondent applied early, and though he had a total score of 549 out of 600, he was again rejected.  In neither year was his name placed on the discretionary waiting list.  In both years, special applicants were admitted with significantly lower scores than respondent's.  After his second rejection, respondent filed this action in state court for mandatory, injunctive, and declaratory relief to compel his admission to Davis, alleging that the special admissions program operated to exclude him on the basis of his race in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a provision of the California Constitution, and  601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which provides, inter alia, that no person shall on the ground of race or color be excluded from participating in any program receiving federal financial assistance.  Petitioner cross-claimed for a declaration that its special admissions program was lawful.  The trial court found that the special program operated as a racial quota, because minority applicants in that program were rated only against one another, and 16 places in the class of 100 were reserved for them.  Declaring that petitioner could not take race into account in making admissions decisions, the program was held to violate the Federal and State Constitutions and Title VI.  Respondent's admission was not ordered, however, for lack of proof that he would have been admitted but for the special program.  The California Supreme Court, applying a strict scrutiny standard, concluded that the special admissions program was not the least intrusive means of achieving the goals of the admittedly compelling state interests of integrating the medical profession and increasing the number of doctors willing to serve minority patients.  Without passing on the state constitutional or federal statutory grounds, the court held that petitioner's special admissions program violated the Equal Protection Clause.  Since petitioner could not satisfy its burden of demonstrating that respondent, absent the special program, would not have been admitted, the court ordered his admission to Davis.
Held:  The judgment below is affirmed insofar as it orders respondent's admission to Davis and invalidates petitioner's special admissions program, 
Page 438 U. S. 267
 but is reversed insofar as it prohibits petitioner from taking race into account as a factor in its future admissions decisions.
18 Cal.3d 34, 553 P.2d 1152, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL concluded:
1. Title VI proscribes only those racial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause if employed by a State or its agencies.  Pp.  438 U. S. 281-287.
2. Racial and ethnic classifications of any sort are inherently suspect and call for the most exacting judicial scrutiny.  While the goal of achieving a diverse student body is sufficiently compelling to justify consideration of race in admissions decisions under some circumstances, petitioner's special admissions program, which forecloses consideration to persons like respondent, is unnecessary to the achievement of this compelling goal, and therefore invalid under the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  438 U. S. 287-320.
3. Since petitioner could not satisfy its burden of proving that respondent would not have been admitted even if there had been no special admissions program, he must be admitted.  P.  438 U. S. 320.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded:
1. Title VI proscribes only those racial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause if employed by a State or its agencies.  Pp.  438 U. S. 328-355.
2. Racial classifications call for strict judicial scrutiny.  Nonetheless, the purpose of overcoming substantial, chronic minority underrepresentation in the medical profession is sufficiently important to justify petitioner's remedial use of race.  Thus, the judgment below must be reversed in that it prohibits race from being used as a factor in university admissions.  Pp.  438 U. S. 355-379.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, being of the view that whether race can ever be a factor in an admissions policy is not an issue here; that Title VI applies; and that respondent was excluded from Davis in violation of Title VI, concurs in the Court's judgment insofar as it affirms the judgment of the court below ordering respondent admitted to Davis.

No. 7811
Argued October 12, 1977
Decided June 28, 1978
438 U.S. 265

Syllabus 
The Medical School of the University of California at Davis (hereinafter Davis) had two admissions programs for the entering class of 100 students -- the regular admissions program and the special admissions program.  Under the regular procedure, candidates whose overall undergraduate grade point averages fell below 2.5 on a scale of 4.0 were summarily rejected.  About one out of six applicants was then given an interview, following which he was rated on a scale of 1 to 100 by each of the committee members (five in 1973 and six in 1974), his rating being based on the interviewers' summaries, his overall grade point average, his science courses grade point average, his Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) scores, letters of recommendation, extracurricular activities, and other biographical data, all of which resulted in a total ""benchmark score.""  The full admissions committee then made offers of admission on the basis of their review of the applicant's file and his score, considering and acting upon applications as they were received.  The committee chairman was responsible for placing names on the waiting list and had discretion to include persons with ""special skills.""  A separate committee, a majority of whom were members of minority groups, operated the special admissions program.  The 1973 and 1974 application forms, respectively, asked candidates whether they wished to be considered as ""economically and/or educationally disadvantaged"" applicants and members of a ""minority group"" (blacks, Chicanos, Asians, American Indians).  If an applicant of a minority group was found to be ""disadvantaged,"" he would be rated in a manner similar to the one employed by the general admissions committee.  Special candidates, however, did not have to meet the 2.5 grade point cutoff and were not ranked against candidates in the general admissions process.  About one-fifth of the special applicants were invited for interviews in 1973 and 1974, following which they were given benchmark scores, and the top choices were then given to the general admissions committee, which could reject special candidates for failure to meet course requirements or other specific deficiencies.  The special committee continued to recommend candidates until 16 special admission selections had been made.  During a four-year period, 63 minority

 students were admitted to Davis under the special program and 44 under the general program.  No disadvantaged whites were admitted under the special program, though many applied.

438 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
After respondent broadcasting company, KQED, had been refused permission to inspect and take photographs at a portion (Little Greystone) of a county jail where a prisoner's suicide reportedly had occurred and where conditions were assertedly responsible for prisoners' problems, respondents brought this action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioner, who supervised the jail, claiming deprivation of their First Amendment rights.  Thereafter petitioner announced a program of regular monthly tours open to the public, including media reporters, of parts of the jail (but not including Little Greystone).  Cameras or tape recorders were not allowed on the tours, nor were interviews with inmates.  Persons, including members of the media, who knew a prisoner at the jail could visit him.  The District Court preliminarily enjoined petitioner from denying KQED news personnel and responsible news media representatives reasonable access to the jail, including Little Greystone, and from preventing their using photographic or sound equipment or from conducting inmate interviews.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.  Pp.  438 U. S. 8-16;  438 U. S. 16-19.
546 F.2d 284, reversed and remanded.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that neither the First Amendment nor the Fourteenth Amendment provides a right of access to government information 
Page 438 U. S. 2
 or sources of information within the government's control.  The news media have no constitutional right of access to the county jail, over and above that of other persons, to interview inmates and make sound recordings, films, and photographs for publication and broadcasting by newspapers, radio, and television.  Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817; Saxbe v. Washington Post 417 U. S. 843.  Pp.  438 U. S. 8-16.
(a) The public importance of conditions in penal facilities and the media's role of providing information afford no basis for reading into the Constitution a right of the public or the media to enter those institutions, gather information, and take pictures for broadcast purposes.  The First Amendment does not guarantee a right of access to sources of information within government control.  Grosjean v. American Press, 297 U. S. 233, Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214, and other cases relied upon by respondents, concerned the freedom of the press to communicate information already obtained, but neither Grosjean nor Mills indicated that the Constitution compels the government to provide the press with information.  Pp.  438 U. S. 8-12.
(b) Whether the government should open penal institutions in the manner sought by respondents is a matter for legislative, not judicial, resolution.  Pp.  438 U. S. 12-16.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, while agreeing that the Constitution does no more than assure the public and the press equal access to information generated or controlled by the government once the government has opened its doors, concluded that terms of access that are reasonably imposed on individual members of the public may -- if they impede effective reporting without sufficient justification -- be unreasonable as applied to journalists who are at a jail to convey to the general public what the visitors see.  KQED was thus clearly entitled to some preliminary relief from the District Court, but not to an order requiring petitioner to permit reporters into the Little Greystone facility and requiring him to let them interview randomly encountered inmates.  In those respects, the injunction gave the press access to areas and sources of information from which persons on the public tours had been excluded, thus enlarging the scope of what had been opened to public view.  Pp.  438 U. S. 16-19.

No. 77-262
Argued March 20, 1978
Decided June 26, 1978*
438 U.S. 59

Syllabus 
The Price-Anderson Act (Act), having the dual purpose of protecting the public and encouraging the development of the nuclear energy industry, imposes a $560 million limitation on liability for nuclear accidents resulting from the operation of federally licensed private nuclear power plants, requires those indemnified by the $560 million fund established under the Act to waive all legal defenses in the event of a substantial nuclear accident, and further provides that, in the event of a nuclear accident involving damages in excess of the amount of aggregate liability, Congress ""will take whatever action is deemed necessary and appropriate to protect the public from the consequences of a disaster of such magnitude.""  Appellant Duke Power Co. (Duke), an investor-owned public utility which is constructing nuclear power plants in North and South Carolina, and appellant Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), were sued by appellees (an environmental organization, a labor union, and a number of individuals who live near the plants in question) who sought a declaration that the Act is unconstitutional.  After finding, inter alia, that the ""immediate"" adverse effects upon appellees resulting from the operation of the plants included thermal pollution of lakes in the vicinity, and emission of non-natural radiation into appellees' environment, and also that there was a ""substantial likelihood"" that Duke would not be able to complete construction and maintain operation of the plants ""but for"" the protection provided by the Act, the District Court held that appellees had standing to challenge the Act's constitutionality, and that their claim could be properly adjudicated.  The court then went on to hold that the Act violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the amount of recovery is not rationally related to the potential losses, the Act tends to encourage irresponsibility in matters of safety and environmental protection, and there is no quid pro quo for the liability limitation; and the Act also offended the equal 
Page 438 U. S. 60
 protection component of the Fifth Amendment by forcing the victims of nuclear incidents to bear the burden of injury, whereas society as a whole benefits from the existence and development of nuclear power.
Held:
1. The District Court had jurisdiction over appellees' complaint against the NRC under 28 U.S.C.  1331(a) (1976 ed.), rather than  1337, the jurisdictional base pleaded.  The complaint, fairly read, raised two basic challenges to the Act, both of which are derived from the Fifth Amendment.  Appellees' cause of action against the NRC directly under the Constitution is sufficiently substantial to sustain jurisdiction; the further question of whether such a cause of action is to be generally recognized need not be decided on this record.  Pp.  438 U. S. 68-72.
2. Appellees have standing to challenge the Act's constitutionality.  That several of the ""immediate"" adverse effects of construction of the plants were found to harm appellees is sufficient to satisfy the ""injury in fact"" prong of the constitutional requirement for standing.  And the finding as to the ""but for"" causal connection between the Act and the construction of the plants satisfies the second prong of the constitutional test for standing, that the exercise of the court's remedial powers would redress the claimed injuries.  Pp.  438 U. S. 72-81.
3. The constitutional challenges to the Act are ripe for adjudication, since all parties would be adversely affected by a decision to defer definitive resolution of the constitutional validity vel non of the Act.  To the extent that ""issues of ripeness involve, at least in part, the existence of a live Case or Controversy,'"" Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102,  419 U.

No. 77-262
Argued March 20, 1978
Decided June 26, 1978*
438 U.S. 59

Syllabus 
The Price-Anderson Act (Act), having the dual purpose of protecting the public and encouraging the development of the nuclear energy industry, imposes a $560 million limitation on liability for nuclear accidents resulting from the operation of federally licensed private nuclear power plants, requires those indemnified by the $560 million fund established under the Act to waive all legal defenses in the event of a substantial nuclear accident, and further provides that, in the event of a nuclear accident involving damages in excess of the amount of aggregate liability, Congress ""will take whatever action is deemed necessary and appropriate to protect the public from the consequences of a disaster of such magnitude.""  Appellant Duke Power Co. (Duke), an investor-owned public utility which is constructing nuclear power plants in North and South Carolina, and appellant Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), were sued by appellees (an environmental organization, a labor union, and a number of individuals who live near the plants in question) who sought a declaration that the Act is unconstitutional.  After finding, inter alia, that the ""immediate"" adverse effects upon appellees resulting from the operation of the plants included thermal pollution of lakes in the vicinity, and emission of non-natural radiation into appellees' environment, and also that there was a ""substantial likelihood"" that Duke would not be able to complete construction and maintain operation of the plants ""but for"" the protection provided by the Act, the District Court held that appellees had standing to challenge the Act's constitutionality, and that their claim could be properly adjudicated.  The court then went on to hold that the Act violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the amount of recovery is not rationally related to the potential losses, the Act tends to encourage irresponsibility in matters of safety and environmental protection, and there is no quid pro quo for the liability limitation; and the Act also offended the equal 
Page 438 U. S. 60
 protection component of the Fifth Amendment by forcing the victims of nuclear incidents to bear the burden of injury, whereas society as a whole benefits from the existence and development of nuclear power.
Held:
1. The District Court had jurisdiction over appellees' complaint against the NRC under 28 U.S.C.  1331(a) (1976 ed.), rather than  1337, the jurisdictional base pleaded.  The complaint, fairly read, raised two basic challenges to the Act, both of which are derived from the Fifth Amendment.  Appellees' cause of action against the NRC directly under the Constitution is sufficiently substantial to sustain jurisdiction; the further question of whether such a cause of action is to be generally recognized need not be decided on this record.  Pp.  438 U. S. 68-72.
2. Appellees have standing to challenge the Act's constitutionality.  That several of the ""immediate"" adverse effects of construction of the plants were found to harm appellees is sufficient to satisfy the ""injury in fact"" prong of the constitutional requirement for standing.  And the finding as to the ""but for"" causal connection between the Act and the construction of the plants satisfies the second prong of the constitutional test for standing, that the exercise of the court's remedial powers would redress the claimed injuries.  Pp.  438 U. S. 72-81.
3. The constitutional challenges to the Act are ripe for adjudication, since all parties would be adversely affected by a decision to defer definitive resolution of the constitutional validity vel non of the Act.  To the extent that ""issues of ripeness involve, at least in part, the existence of a live Case or Controversy,'"" Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102,  419 U. S. 138 (1974), the fact that appellees will sustain immediate injury from the operation of the disputed power plants and that such injury would be redressed by the relief requested satisfies this requirement.  Pp.  438 U. S. 81-82.
4. The Act does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  438 U. S. 82-94.
(a) The record supports the need for the imposition of a statutory limit on liability to encourage private industry participation, and hence bears a rational relationship to Congress' concern for stimulating private industry's involvement in the production of nuclear electric energy.

No. 77-444
Argued April 17, 1978
Decided June 26, 1978
438 U.S. 104

Syllabus 
Under New York City's Landmarks Preservation Law (Landmarks Law), which was enacted to protect historic landmarks and neighborhoods from precipitate decisions to destroy or fundamentally alter their character, the Landmarks Preservation Commission (Commission) may designate a building to be a ""landmark"" on a particular ""landmark site"" or may designate an area to be a ""historic district.""  The Board of Estimate may thereafter modify or disapprove the designation, and the owner may seek judicial review of the final designation decision.  The owner of the designated landmark must keep the building's exterior ""in good repair,"" and, before exterior alterations are made, must secure Commission approval.   Under two ordinances, owners of landmark sites may transfer development rights from a landmark parcel to proximate lots.  Under the Landmarks Law, the Grand Central Terminal (Terminal), which is owned by the Penn Central Transportation Co. and its affiliates (Penn Central) was designated a ""landmark"" and the block it occupies a ""landmark site.""  Appellant Penn Central, though opposing the designation before the Commission, did not seek judicial review of the final designation decision.  Thereafter appellant Penn Central entered into a lease with appellant UGP Properties, whereby UGP was to construct a multistory office building over the Terminal.  After the Commission had rejected appellants' plans for the building as destructive of the Terminal's historic and aesthetic features, with no judicial review thereafter being sought, appellants brought suit in state court claiming that the application of the Landmarks Law had ""taken"" their property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and arbitrarily deprived them of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The trial court's grant of relief was reversed on appeal, the New York Court of Appeals ultimately concluding that there was no ""taking,"" since the Landmarks Law had not transferred control of the property to the city, but only restricted appellants' exploitation of it; and that there was no denial of due process because (1) the same use of the Terminal was permitted as before; (2) the appellants had not shown that they could not earn a reasonable return on their investment 
Page 438 U. S. 105
 in the Terminal itself; (3) even if the Terminal proper could never operate at a reasonable profit, some of the income from Penn Central's extensive real estate holdings in the area must realistically be imputed to the Terminal; and (4) the development rights above the Terminal, which were made transferable to numerous sites in the vicinity, provided significant compensation for loss of rights above the Terminal itself.
Held:  The application of the Landmarks Law to the Terminal property does not constitute a ""taking"" of appellants' property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  438 U. S. 123-138.
(a) In a wide variety of contexts, the government may execute laws or programs that adversely affect recognized economic values without its action constituting a ""taking,"" and, in instances such as zoning laws where a state tribunal has reasonably concluded that ""the health, safety, morals, or general welfare"" would be promoted by prohibiting particular contemplated uses of land, this Court has upheld land use regulations that destroyed or adversely affected real property interests.  In many instances use restrictions that served a substantial public purpose have been upheld against ""taking"" challenges, e.g., Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590; Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U. S. 394, though a state statute that substantially furthers important public policies may so frustrate distinct investment-backed expectations as to constitute a ""taking,"" e.g., Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, and government acquisitions of resources to permit uniquely public functions constitute ""takings,"" e.g., United States v. Causby, 328 U. S. 256.  Pp.  438 U. S. 123-128.
(b) In deciding whether particular governmental action has effected a ""taking,"" the character of the action and nature and extent of the interference with property rights (here the city tax block designated as the ""landmark site"") are focused upon, rather than discrete segments thereof.  Consequently, appellants cannot establish a ""taking"" simply by showing that they have been denied the ability to exploit the superjacent airspace, irrespective of the remainder of appellants' parcel.  Pp.  438 U. S. 130-131.
(c) Though diminution in property value alone, as may result from a zoning law, cannot establish a ""taking,"" as appellants concede, they urge that the regulation of individual landmarks is different, because it applies only to selected properties.  But it does not follow that landmark laws, which embody a comprehensive plan to preserve structures of historic or aesthetic interest, are discriminatory, like ""reverse spot"" zoning.  Nor can it be successfully contended that designation of a landmark involves only a matter of taste, and therefore will inevitably 
Page 438 U. S. 106
 lead to arbitrary results, for judicial review is available, and there is no reason to believe it will be less effective than would be so in the case of zoning or any other context.  Pp.  438 U. S. 131-133.
(d) That the Landmarks Law affects some landowners more severely than others does not, itself, result in ""taking,"" for that is often the case with general welfare and zoning legislation.  Nor, contrary to appellants' contention, ar they solely burdened and unbenefited by the Landmarks Law, which has been extensively applied and was enacted on the basis of the legislative judgment that the preservation of landmarks benefits the citizenry both economically and by improving the overall quality of city life.  Pp.  438 U. S. 133-135.
(e) The Landmarks Law no more effects an appropriation of the airspace above the Terminal for governmental uses than would a zoning law appropriate property; it simply prohibits appellants or others from occupying certain features of that space while allowing appellants gainfully to use the remainder of the parcel.  United States v. Causby, supra, distinguished.  P.  438 U. S. 135.
(f) The Landmarks Law, which does not interfere with the Terminal's present uses or prevent Penn Central from realizing a ""reasonable return"" on its investment, does not impose the drastic limitation on appellants' ability to use the air rights above the Terminal that appellants claim, for, on this record, there is no showing that a smaller, harmonizing structure would not be authorized.  Moreover, the preexisting air rights are made transferable to other parcels in the vicinity of the Terminal, thus mitigating whatever financial burdens appellants have incurred.  Pp.  438 U. S. 135-137.

Syllabus 
Prior to petitioner's Delaware state trial on rape and related charges and in connection with his motion to suppress on Fourth Amendment grounds items of clothing and a knife found in a search of his apartment, he challenged the truthfulness of certain factual statements made in the police affidavit supporting the warrant to search the apartment, and sought to call witnesses to prove the misstatements.  The trial court sustained the State's objection to such proposed testimony and denied the motion to suppress, and the clothing and knife were admitted as evidence at the ensuing trial, at which petitioner was convicted.  The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed, holding that a defendant under no circumstances may challenge the veracity of a sworn statement used by police to procure a search warrant.
Held:  Where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment, as incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that a hearing be held at the defendant's request.

(a) To mandate an evidentiary hearing, the challenger's attack must be more than conclusory, and must be supported by more than a mere desire to cross-examine.  The allegation of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard must point out specifically with supporting reasons the portion of the warrant affidavit that is claimed to be false.  It also must be accompanied by an offer of proof, including affidavits or sworn or otherwise reliable statements of witnesses, or a satisfactory explanation of their absence.  P.  438 U. S. 171.
(b) If these requirements as to allegations and offer of proof are met, and if, when material that is the subject of the alleged falsity or reckless disregard is set to one side, there remains sufficient content in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, no hearing is required, but if the remaining content is insufficient, the defendant is entitled under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to a hearing.

|438 u.s. 190|"Berry v. Doles
No. 76-1690
Decided June 26, 1978
438 U.S. 190

Syllabus 
In 1968, the Georgia statute covering the voting procedures for election of the three members of the Peach County Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues was amended so that, instead of all three posts being filled at four-year intervals, the single at-large member was to be elected to a two-year term in 1968 and to a four-year term at subsequent elections.  Shortly before the 1976 primary election for two seats on the Board not including the at-large post, appellants brought an action to enforce  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which requires changes in voting procedures to be submitted for approval either to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or to the Attorney General.  After the scheduled 1976 primary and general elections, a three-judge District Court enjoined further enforcement of the 1968 amendment until appellees effected compliance with  5, but refused to set aside the 1976 elections, noting ""an apparent lack of any discriminatory purpose or effect surrounding the use of the law in the 1976 elections.""
Held:  The District Court erred in denying affirmative relief as to the 1976 election, and should enter an order allowing appellees 30 days within which to apply for federal approval of the 1968 voting change under  5.
Affirmed in part and reversed in part.

No. 77-404
Argued March 27, 1978
Decided June 23, 1978
437 U.S. 617

Syllabus 
New Jersey statute (ch. 363) that prohibits the importation of most ""solid or liquid waste which originated or was collected outside the territorial limits of the State . . ."" held to violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.  Pp.  437 U. S. 621-629.
(a) All objects of interstate trade merit Commerce Clause protection, and none is excluded from the definition of ""commerce"" at the outset; hence, contrary to the suggestion of the court below, there can be no doubt that the banning of ""valueless"" out-of-state wastes by ch. 363 implicates constitutional protection.  Bowman v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 125 U. S. 465, distinguished.  Pp.  437 U. S. 621-623.
(b) The crucial inquiry here must be directed to determining whether ch. 363 is basically an economic protectionist measure, and thus virtually per se invalid, or a law directed at legitimate local concerns that has only incidental effects on interstate commerce.   Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137,  397 U. S. 142. Pp.  437 U. S. 623-624.
(c) Since the evil of protectionism can reside in legislative means as well as legislative ends, it is immaterial whether the legislative purpose of ch. 363 is to protect New Jersey's environment or its economy, for, whatever the purpose, it may not be accomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently.  Both on its face and in its plain effect, ch. 363 violates this principle of nondiscrimination.  A State may not attempt to isolate itself from a problem common to many by erecting a barrier against the movement of interstate trade, as ch. 363 seeks to do by imposing on out-of-state commercial interests the full burden of conserving New Jersey's remaining landfill space.  Pp.  437 U. S. 625-628.
(d) The New Jersey statute cannot be likened to a quarantine law which bans importation of articles of commerce because of their innate harmfulness, and not because of their origin.  Though New Jersey concedes that out-of-state waste is no different from domestic waste, it has banned the former while leaving its landfill sites open to the latter, thus trying to saddle those outside the State with the entire burden of slowing the flow of wastes into New Jersey's remaining landfill sites.  Pp.  437 U. S. 628-629.

|437 u.s. 655|"Will v. Calvert Fire Insurance Co.
No. 77-693
Argued April 19, 1978
Decided June 23, 1978
437 U.S. 655

Syllabus 
After Calvert Fire Insurance Co. (hereafter respondent) had advised American Mutual Reinsurance Co. (American) that respondent was rescinding its membership in a reinsurance pool that American operated, American sued respondent in an Illinois state court for a declaration that the pool agreement with respondent remained in effect.  Six months later, respondent, in its answer, asserted the unenforceability of the pool agreement on the grounds that American had violated, inter alia, the Securities Act of 1933; Rule 10b-5, promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (hereafter 1934 Act); and the Illinois Securities Act, and counterclaimed for damages on all its defense claims except the one involving Rule 10b-5, which, under the 1934 Act's terms, was exclusively enforceable in the federal courts.  Respondent on the same day filed a complaint against American in the Federal District Court for damages for American's alleged Rule 10b-5 violation, and joined therewith claims based on each of the other defensive counts made in the state court action.  American moved to dismiss or abate the federal court action, the motion to dismiss being based on the contention that the reinsurance agreement was not a ""security"" within the meaning of the 1933 or 1934 Act, and the motion to abate being on the ground that the earlier state proceeding included all issues except the one involving Rule 10b-5.  Petitioner, the District Court Judge, granted American's motion to defer the federal proceeding until completion of the state proceeding, except the Rule 10b-5 damages claim.  He rejected respondent's contention that the District Court should proceed with the entire case because of its exclusive jurisdiction over that claim, and noted that the state court was bound to provide the equitable relief sought by respondent by recognizing a valid Rule 10b-5 claim as a defense to the state action.  Petitioner heard argument on, but has not yet decided, the question of whether respondent's interest in the reinsurance pool constituted a ""security"" as defined in the 1934 Act.  After petitioner had rejected motions to reconsider his stay order and refused to certify an interlocutory appeal, respondent petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus directing petitioner to adjudicate 
Page 437 U. S. 656
 the Rule 10b-5 claim.  Thereafter, that court, relying on Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, granted the petition and directed petitioner to ""proceed immediately with Calvert's claim for damages and equitable relief"" under the 1934 Act.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  437 U. S. 661-667;  437 U. S. 667-668.
560 F.2d 792, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded:
Issuance of the writ of mandamus by the Court of Appeals impermissibly interfered with petitioner's discretion to control his docket.  Pp.  437 U. S. 661-667.
(a) Though a court of appeals has the power to issue a writ of mandamus directing a district court to proceed to judgment in a pending case when it is the district court's duty to do so, the burden is on the moving party to show that its right to issuance of the writ is ""clear and indisputable.""  P.  437 U. S. 662.
(b) Where there is duplicative litigation in the state and federal courts, the decision whether or not to defer to the state courts is largely committed to the discretion of the district court, Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co., 316 U. S. 491,  316 U. S. 494, even when matters of federal law are involved, Colorado River, supra at  424 U. S. 820.  Pp.  437 U. S. 662-664.
(c) This case, unlike Colorado River, did not involve outright dismissal of the action, and respondent remained free to urge petitioner to reconsider his decision to defer based on new information as to the progress of the state case; to that extent, deferral (contrary to respondent's argument) was not equivalent to dismissal.  Pp.  437 U. S. 664-665.
(d) Though a district court's exercise of discretion may be subject to review in a proper interlocutory appeal, it ought not be overridden by a writ of mandamus.  Where a matter is committed to a district court's discretion, it cannot be said that a litigant's right to a particular result is ""clear and indisputable.""  Here, petitioner has not heedlessly refused to adjudicate the Rule 10b-5 damages claim (the only issue that may not concurrently be resolved by both the state and federal courts), and, as far as the record shows, his delay in adjudicating that claim is simply the product of a district court's normal excessive workload, compounded by ""the unfortunate consequence of making the judge a litigant"" in this mandamus proceeding.

			"|"Will v. Calvert Fire Insurance Co.
No. 77-693
Argued April 19, 1978
Decided June 23, 1978
437 U.S. 655

Syllabus 
After Calvert Fire Insurance Co. (hereafter respondent) had advised American Mutual Reinsurance Co. (American) that respondent was rescinding its membership in a reinsurance pool that American operated, American sued respondent in an Illinois state court for a declaration that the pool agreement with respondent remained in effect.  Six months later, respondent, in its answer, asserted the unenforceability of the pool agreement on the grounds that American had violated, inter alia, the Securities Act of 1933; Rule 10b-5, promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (hereafter 1934 Act); and the Illinois Securities Act, and counterclaimed for damages on all its defense claims except the one involving Rule 10b-5, which, under the 1934 Act's terms, was exclusively enforceable in the federal courts.  Respondent on the same day filed a complaint against American in the Federal District Court for damages for American's alleged Rule 10b-5 violation, and joined therewith claims based on each of the other defensive counts made in the state court action.  American moved to dismiss or abate the federal court action, the motion to dismiss being based on the contention that the reinsurance agreement was not a ""security"" within the meaning of the 1933 or 1934 Act, and the motion to abate being on the ground that the earlier state proceeding included all issues except the one involving Rule 10b-5.  Petitioner, the District Court Judge, granted American's motion to defer the federal proceeding until completion of the state proceeding, except the Rule 10b-5 damages claim.  He rejected respondent's contention that the District Court should proceed with the entire case because of its exclusive jurisdiction over that claim, and noted that the state court was bound to provide the equitable relief sought by respondent by recognizing a valid Rule 10b-5 claim as a defense to the state action.  Petitioner heard argument on, but has not yet decided, the question of whether respondent's interest in the reinsurance pool constituted a ""security"" as defined in the 1934 Act.  After petitioner had rejected motions to reconsider his stay order and refused to certify an interlocutory appeal, respondent petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus directing petitioner to adjudicate 
Page 437 U. S. 656
 the Rule 10b-5 claim.  Thereafter, that court, relying on Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, granted the petition and directed petitioner to ""proceed immediately with Calvert's claim for damages and equitable relief"" under the 1934 Act.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  437 U. S. 661-667;  437 U. S. 667-668.
560 F.2d 792, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded:
Issuance of the writ of mandamus by the Court of Appeals impermissibly interfered with petitioner's discretion to control his docket.  Pp.  437 U. S. 661-667.
(a) Though a court of appeals has the power to issue a writ of mandamus directing a district court to proceed to judgment in a pending case when it is the district court's duty to do so, the burden is on the moving party to show that its right to issuance of the writ is ""clear and indisputable.""  P.  437 U. S. 662.
(b) Where there is duplicative litigation in the state and federal courts, the decision whether or not to defer to the state courts is largely committed to the discretion of the district court, Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co., 316 U. S. 491,  316 U. S. 494, even when matters of federal law are involved, Colorado River, supra at  424 U. S. 820.  Pp.  437 U. S. 662-664.
(c) This case, unlike Colorado River, did not involve outright dismissal of the action, and respondent remained free to urge petitioner to reconsider his decision to defer based on new information as to the progress of the state case; to that extent, deferral (contrary to respondent's argument) was not equivalent to dismissal.  Pp.  437 U. S. 664-665.
(d) Though a district court's exercise of discretion may be subject to review in a proper interlocutory appeal, it ought not be overridden by a writ of mandamus.  Where a matter is committed to a district court's discretion, it cannot be said that a litigant's right to a particular result is ""clear and indisputable.""  Here, petitioner has not heedlessly refused to adjudicate the Rule 10b-5 damages claim (the only issue that may not concurrently be resolved by both the state and federal courts), and, as far as the record shows, his delay in adjudicating that claim is simply the product of a district court's normal excessive workload, compounded by ""the unfortunate consequence of making the judge a litigant"" in this mandamus proceeding.

437 U.S. 678

Syllabus 
After finding in respondent prison inmates' action against petitioner prison officials that conditions in the Arkansas prison system constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, the District Court entered a series of detailed remedial orders.  On appeal to the Court of Appeals, petitioners challenged two aspects of that relief:  (1) an order placing a maximum limit of 30 days on confinement in punitive isolation, and (2) an award of attorney's fees to be paid out of Department of Correction funds, based on the District Court's finding that petitioners had acted in bad faith in failing to cure the previously identified violations.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, and assessed an additional attorney's fee to cover services on appeal.
Held:
1. The District Court did not err in including the 30-day limitation on sentences to isolation as part of its comprehensive remedy to correct the constitutional violations.  Where the question before the court was whether these past constitutional violations had been remedied, it was entitled to consider the severity of the violations in assessing the constitutionality of conditions in the isolation cells, the length of time each inmate spent in isolation being simply one consideration among many.  Pp.  437 U. S. 685-688.
2. The District Court's award of attorney's fees to be paid out of Department of Correction funds is adequately supported by its finding that petitioners had acted in bad faith, and does not violate the Eleventh Amendment.  The award served the same purpose as a remedial fine imposed for civil contempt, and vindicated the court's authority over a recalcitrant litigant.  There being no reason to distinguish the award from any other penalty imposed to enforce a prospective injunction, the Eleventh Amendment's substantive protections do not prevent the award against the Department's officers in their official capacities, and the fact that the order directed the award to be paid out of Department funds, rather than being assessed against petitioners in their official capacities, does not constitute reversible error.  Pp.  437 U. S. 689-693.
3. The Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, which provides that, ""[i]n any action"" to enforce certain civil rights laws (including the law under which this action was brought), federal courts 
Page 437 U. S. 679
 may award prevailing parties reasonable attorney's fees ""as part of the costs,"" supports the additional award of attorney's fees by the Court of Appeals.  Pp.  437 U. S. 693-700.
(a) The Act's broad language, and the fact that it primarily applies to laws specifically passed to restrain unlawful state action, as well as the Act's legislative history, make it clear that Congress, when it passed the Act, intended to exercise its power to set aside the States' immunity from retroactive relief in order to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, and to authorize fee awards payable by the States when their officials are sued in their official capacities.  Pp.  437 U. S. 693-694.
(b) Costs have traditionally been awarded against States without regard for the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity, and it is much too late to single out attorney's fees as the one kind of litigation cost whose recovery may not be authorized by Congress without an express statutory waiver of States' immunity.  Pp.  437 U. S. 694-698.
(c) The fact that neither the State nor the Department of Correction was expressly named as a defendant does not preclude the Court of Appeals' award, since, although the Eleventh Amendment prevented respondents from suing the State by name, their injunctive suit against petitioner prison officials was, for all practical purposes, brought against the State, so that, absent any indication that petitioners acted in bad faith before the Court of Appeals, the Department of Correction is the entity intended by Congress to bear the burden of the award.

437 U.S. 483

Syllabus 
Petitioner nonprofit hospital had a written rule that prohibited employees from soliciting and distributing literature except in certain employee locker rooms and certain adjacent restrooms.  The cafeteria was the common gathering place of employees, and had been used by petitioner or with its approval for solicitation and distribution of literature to employees for various nonunion purposes.  After an employee had made general distribution in the cafeteria to other employees of a union newsletter and had been warned that she had violated the hospital's rule, and would be dismissed if she did so again, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), following a charge by the union, issued an unfair labor practice complaint against petitioner.  The NLRB applied to petitioner the rule that it had adopted in St. John's Hospital & School of Nursing, Inc., 222 N.L.R.B. 1150, that, since ""the primary function of a hospital is patient care,"" and ""a tranquil atmosphere is essential to the carrying out of that function,"" a hospital may be warranted in imposing more stringent restrictions on employee solicitation and distribution in immediate patient care areas than are generally permitted other employers, but the balance should be struck against such restrictions in other areas such as lounges and cafeterias, absent a showing of disruption to patients.  The NLRB held that petitioner's ban violated  8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), which, by amendments to the Act in 1974, was made applicable to employees of nonprofit health care institutions, and that the disciplining of employees for not observing the prohibition violated  8(a)(3).  The NLRB ordered petitioner to cease and desist from interfering with ""concerted union activities"" and employees'  7 rights, and to rescind its written rule.  The Court of Appeals accepted as settled law that restrictions on employee solicitation and distribution during nonworking hours are presumptively invalid absent special circumstances, and that, here, petitioner had not satisfied its burden of justifying the ban on protected activities in the eating areas.  While narrowing the scope of the remedies ordered by the NLRB, the court upheld the NLRB's action rescinding that part of petitioner's rule applicable to those areas.
Held:  The Court of Appeals 
Page 437 U. S. 484
 did not err in enforcing the NLRB's order to petitioner to rescind its rule as applied to the hospital's eating facilities.  Pp.  437 U. S. 491-508.
(a) Freedom of employees effectively to communicate with one another regarding self-organization on the jobsite is essential to their right to self-organize and to bargain collectively established by  7 of the Act, Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793, and, in the light of its experience, the NLRB is free to adopt a rule that, absent special circumstances, an employer's restriction on employee solicitation during nonworking time and distribution during such time in nonworking areas is presumptively an unreasonable interference with  7 rights constituting an unfair labor practice under  8(a)(1), without the necessity of proving the underlying generic facts that persuaded it to reach that conclusion.  Pp.  437 U. S. 491-493.
(b) Nothing in the legislative history of the 1974 amendments shows a congressional policy inconsistent with the NLRB's approach to enforcement of  7 organizational rights in the hospital context.  Pp.  437 U. S. 496-500.
(c) The NLRB, by those amendments, is responsible for administering the federal national labor relations policy in the health care industry.  Though the NLRB is no more an expert in that industry than it is in other enterprises within its jurisdiction, it is the NLRB's function to strike the balance in all areas within its jurisdiction between conflicting legitimate interests in order to effectuate the national labor policy.  Hence, petitioner's argument that the NLRB lacks expertise to make judgments involving hospitals, and that the principle of limited judicial review should not apply in that area, is without merit.  Pp.  437 U. S. 500-501.
(d) The NLRB's conclusion that ""the possibility of any disruption in patient care resulting from solicitation or distribution of literature is remote"" as applied to petitioner's cafeteria is rational and fully supported by the record, as indicated by much cogent evidence, including the facts that only 1.56% of the cafeteria's patrons are patients and that petitioner itself permitted nonunion solicitation and distribution in the cafeteria.  Moreover, petitioner introduced no evidence of untoward effects on patients during the period when the rules permitted limited union solicitation in the cafeteria.  Pp.  437 U. S. 501-505.
(e) Contrary to petitioner's argument, it is not irrational for the NLRB to uphold, as it has, a ban against solicitation in the dining area of a public restaurant, where such solicitation tends to upset patrons, while prohibiting a ban on such activity in a hospital cafeteria like petitioner's, 77% of whose patrons are employees, absent evidence that nonemployee patrons would be upset.  That argument fails to consider that the NLRB's position struck the appropriate balance between organizational

Syllabus 
Appellants, at least five of whom are not residents of Alaska, challenged in state court the constitutionality of the ""Alaska Hire"" statute (which was enacted professedly for the purpose of reducing unemployment within the State) that requires that all Alaskan oil and gas leases, easements or right-of-way permits for oil and gas pipelines, and unitization agreements contain a requirement that qualified Alaska residents be hired in preference to nonresidents.  The trial court upheld the statute.  The Alaska Supreme Court affirmed except for that part of the Act that contained a one-year durational residency requirement, which it held invalid.
Held:
1. The invalidation of the one-year durational residency requirement does not moot the case, since a controversy still exists between the nonresident appellants, none of whom can qualify as ""residents"" under the statutory definition, and the appellees, state officials. Those appellants thus have a continuing interest in restraining the statutory discrimination favoring state residents.  P.  437 U. S. 523.
2. Alaska Hire violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV,  2.  Pp.  437 U. S. 523-534.

No. 77-324
Argued March 21, 1978
Decided June 22, 1978
437 U.S. 518

Syllabus 
Appellants, at least five of whom are not residents of Alaska, challenged in state court the constitutionality of the ""Alaska Hire"" statute (which was enacted professedly for the purpose of reducing unemployment within the State) that requires that all Alaskan oil and gas leases, easements or right-of-way permits for oil and gas pipelines, and unitization agreements contain a requirement that qualified Alaska residents be hired in preference to nonresidents.  The trial court upheld the statute.  The Alaska Supreme Court affirmed except for that part of the Act that contained a one-year durational residency requirement, which it held invalid.
Held:
1. The invalidation of the one-year durational residency requirement does not moot the case, since a controversy still exists between the nonresident appellants, none of whom can qualify as ""residents"" under the statutory definition, and the appellees, state officials. Those appellants thus have a continuing interest in restraining the statutory discrimination favoring state residents.  P.  437 U. S. 523.
2. Alaska Hire violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV,  2.  Pp.  437 U. S. 523-534.
(a) Though the Clause ""does not preclude disparity of treatment in the many situations where there are perfectly valid independent reasons for it,"" it ""does bar discrimination against citizens of other States where there is no reason for the discrimination beyond the mere fact that they are citizens of other States.""  Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385,  334 U. S. 396.  See also Mullaney v. Anderson, 342 U. S. 415.  Pp.  437 U. S. 524-526.

437 U.S. 535

Syllabus 
Respondents, Negro and Mexican-American residents of Dallas, Tex., brought this action for injunctive and declaratory relief against petitioners, the Mayor and members of the Dallas City Council, alleging that the City Charter's at-large system of electing council members unconstitutionally diluted the vote of racial minorities.  After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court orally declared that system unconstitutional and then ""afforded the city an opportunity as a legislative body for the City of Dallas to prepare a plan which would be constitutional.""  The City Council then passed a resolution expressing its intention to enact an ordinance that would provide for eight council members to be elected from single-member districts and for the three remaining members, including the Mayor, to be elected at large.  After an extensive remedy hearing, the District Court approved the plan, which the City Council thereafter formally enacted as an ordinance.  The District Court later issued a memorandum opinion that sustained the plan as a valid legislative Act.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court had erred in evaluating the plan only under constitutional standards without also applying the teaching of East Carroll Parish School Bd. v. Marshall, 424 U. S. 636, which held that, absent exceptional circumstances, judicially imposed reapportionment plans should use only single-member districts.
Held. The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.  Pp.  437 U. S. 539-547;  437 U. S. 547-549.
551 F.2d 1043, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concluded:
1. Federal courts, absent special circumstances, must employ single member districts when they impose remedial reapportionment plans.  That standard, however, is more stringent than the constitutional standard that is applicable when the reapportionment is accomplished by the legislature.  Here, after the District Court had invalidated the Dallas at-large election scheme in the City Charter, the city discharged its duty to devise a substitute by enacting the eight/three ordinance, which the District Court reviewed as a legislatively enacted plan and held constitutional despite the use of at-large voting for three council seats.  Pp.  437 U. S. 539-543. 
Page 437 U. S. 536

2. The eight/three ordinance was properly considered to be a legislative plan, and the Court of Appeals erred in evaluating it under principles applicable to judicially devised reapportionment plans.  Pp.  437 U. S. 543-546.
(a) No special reason for not applying the standard applicable to a legislatively devised plan can be found in the provisions of Texas law that specify that a city charter can be amended only by a vote of the people, for the City Council, in enacting the plan, did not purport to amend the Charter, but only to exercise its legislative powers after the Charter provision had been declared unconstitutional.  P.  437 U. S. 544.
(b) East Carroll Parish School Bd., supra, does not support the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the plan presented by the city must be viewed as judicial, and therefore as subject to a level of scrutiny more stringent than that required by the Constitution, rather than legislative.  In reaching the conclusion that singe-member districts are to be preferred, the Court emphasized that the bodies that submitted the plans did not purport to reapportion themselves, and could not legally do so under federal law because state legislation providing them with such powers had been disapproved under  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  On the facts of the instant case, however, unlike the situation in East Carroll Parish School Bd., the Dallas City Council validly met its responsibility of replacing the invalid apportionment provision with one that could withstand constitutional scrutiny.  Pp.  437 U. S. 545-546.
3. Though it has been urged that  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which became applicable to Texas while this case was pending on appeal, barred effectuation of the challenged ordinance absent the clearance mandated by  5, that issue was not dealt with by the Court of Appeals, and should more appropriately be considered by that court on remand.  Pp.  437 U. S. 546-547.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, while agreeing that the eight/three ordinance was a ""legislative plan"" for purposes of federal court review, concluded that the instant case is controlled by Burns v. Richardson, 384 U. S. 73.  By analogy to the reasoning of that case, the eight/three plan must be considered legislative, even if the Council had no power to apportion itself, a Charter amendment being necessary to that end.  Under the Burns rule, whereby
""a State's freedom of choice to devise substitutes for an apportionment plan found unconstitutional . . . should not be restricted beyond the clear commands of the Equal Protection Clause,""
plans proposed by the local body must be regarded as ""legislative"" even if, as in that case, the Court's examination of state law suggests that the local body lacks authority to reapportion 
Page 437 U. S. 537
 itself.  To the extent that East Carroll Parish School Bd. implies anything further about the principle established in Burns, the latter must be held to control.  Pp.  437 U. S. 547-549.
WHITE, J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered an opinion, in which STEWART, J., joined.

Syllabus 
Employees of petitioner corporation sought to distribute a four-part union newsletter in nonworking areas of petitioner's plant during nonworking time.  The first and fourth sections urged employees to support the union and extolled union solidarity.  The second section encouraged employees to write their legislators to oppose incorporation of the state ""right-to-work"" statute into a revised state constitution.  The third section criticized a Presidential veto of an increase in the federal minimum wage and urged employees to register to vote to ""defeat our enemies and elect our friends.""  After representatives of petitioner refused to permit the requested distribution, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), alleging that petitioner's refusal interfered with the employees' exercise of their rights under  7 of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), which provides that
""[e]mployees shall have the right . . . to engage in . . . concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection . . . ,""
and thus violated  8(a)(1).  Following a hearing, at which petitioner contended that the second and third sections of the letter were not protected by  7 because they did not relate to petitioner's association with the union, the NLRB ordered petitioner to cease and desist from the violation, having determined that both those sections of the newsletter came within the ambit of  7's protection.  The second section of the newsletter was held to be protected because union security is ""central to the union concept of strength through solidarity"" and ""a mandatory subject of bargaining in other than right-to-work states,"" and the fact that Texas already has a ""right-to-work"" statute was held not to diminish employees' interest in the matter.  The third section was held to be protected even though petitioner's employees were paid more than the vetoed minimum wage, on the ground that the ""minimum wage inevitably influences wage levels derived from collective bargaining, even those far above the minimum,"" and that the petitioner's employees' concern ""for the plight of other employees might gain support for them at some future time when they might have a dispute with their employer.""  The Court of Appeals enforced 
Page 437 U. S. 557
 the NLRB's order, rejecting petitioner's contention that  7's ""mutual aid or protection"" clause protects only concerted activity by employees that is directed at conditions that their employer has the authority or power to change or control, and that the second and third sections of the newsletter did not constitute such activity.  The court concluded that
""whatever is reasonably related to the employees' jobs or to their status or condition as employees in the plant may be the subject of such handouts as we treat of here, distributed on the plant premises in such a manner as not to interfere with the work . . . ,""
and that the material in the newsletter met that test.
Held:
1. Distribution of the challenged second and third sections of the newsletter is protected under the ""mutual aid or protection"" clause of  7.  Pp.  437 U. S. 563-570.
(a) The Act's definition of ""employee"" in  2(3) was intended to protect employees when they engage in otherwise proper concerted activities in support of employees of employers other than their own, and it has long been held that ""mutual aid or protection"" encompasses such activity.  Pp.  437 U. S. 564-565.
(b) Employees do not lose their protection under the ""mutual aid or protection"" clause when they seek to improve terms and conditions of employment or otherwise improve their lot as employees through channels outside the immediate employee-employer relationship, and the NLRB did not err in holding that distribution of the challenged parts of the newsletter was for the purpose of ""mutual aid or protection.""  Pp.  437 U. S. 565-570.
2. The NLRB did not err in holding that petitioner's employees may distribute the newsletter in nonworking areas of petitioner's property during nonworking time.  The fact that the distribution is to take place on petitioner's property does not give rise to a countervailing interest that petitioner can assert outweighing the exercise of  7 rights by its employees in that location.  Under the circumstances of this case, the NLRB was not required to apply a rule different from the one it applied in Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793, to the effect that an employer may not prohibit his employees from distributing union literature (in that case, organizational material) in nonworking areas of industrial property during nonworking time, absent a showing by the employer that a ban is necessary to maintain plant discipline or production.  Here, as in Republic Aviation, petitioner's employees were ""already rightfully on the employer's property,"" so that in the context of this case it is the employer's management interests, rather than its property interests that primarily are implicated.  Petitioner, however, made no attempt to show that its management interests would be prejudiced 
Page 437 U. S. 558
 by distribution of the sections to which it objected, and any incremental intrusion on its property rights from their distribution together with the other sections would be minimal.

Syllabus 
Respondent, a citizen of Iowa, sued for damages based on the wrongful death of her husband, who was electrocuted when the boom of a steel crane next to which he was walking came too close to a high-tension electric power line.  The action was brought in federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship against a Nebraska corporation (OPPD), whose negligent operation of the power line was alleged to have caused decedent's death.  OPPD then filed a third-party complaint against petitioner company which owned and operated the crane, alleging that petitioner's negligence proximately caused the death.  Respondent was thereafter granted leave to amend her complaint by naming petitioner, which she alleged to be a Nebraska corporation with its principal place of business in Nebraska, as an additional defendant.  OPPD successfully moved for summary judgment, leaving petitioner as the sole defendant.  Though, in its answer, petitioner admitted that it was a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Nebraska, during trial it was disclosed that petitioner's principal place of business was in Iowa.  Since both parties were thus Iowa citizens, petitioner moved to dismiss on the basis of lack of federal jurisdiction.  After the jury had returned a verdict. for respondent, the District Court denied petitioner's motion to dismiss.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, under Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715, the District Court had jurisdictional power, in its discretion, to adjudicate the claim, which arose from the ""core of operative facts' giving rise to both [respondent's] claim against OPPD and OPPD's claim against [petitioner],"" and that the District Court had properly exercised its discretion because petitioner had concealed its Iowa citizenship from respondent.
Held:  The District Court had no power to entertain respondent's lawsuit against petitioner as a third-party defendant since diversity jurisdiction was lacking.  Gibbs, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  437 U. S. 370-377.
(a) A finding that federal and nonfederal claims arise from a ""common nucleus of operative fact,"" the Gibbs test, does not suffice to establish that a federal court has power to hear nonfederal as well as 
Page 437 U. S. 366
 federal claims, since, though the constitutional power to adjudicate the nonfederal claim may exist, it does not follow that statutory authorization has been granted.  Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1; Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U. S. 291.  Pp.  437 U. S. 370-373.
(b) Here, the relevant statute, 28 U.S.C.  1332(a)(1), which confers upon federal courts jurisdiction over civil actions where the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 and is between citizens of different States, requires complete diversity of citizenship, and it is thus congressionally mandated that diversity jurisdiction is not available when any plaintiff is a citizen of the same State as any defendant, a situation that developed in this case when respondent amended her complaint.  Pp.  437 U. S. 373-374.
(c) Under the Court of Appeals' ancillary jurisdiction theory, a plaintiff could defeat the statutory requirement of complete diversity simply by suing only those defendants of diverse citizenship and waiting for them to implead nondiverse defendants.  Pp.  437 U. S. 374-375.
(d) In determining whether jurisdiction over a nonfederal claim exists, the context in which that claim is asserted is crucial.  Here the nonfederal claim was simply not ancillary to the federal one, as respondent's claim against petitioner was entirely separate from her original claim against OPPD, and petitioner's liability to her did not depend at all upon whether or not OPPD was also liable.  Moreover, the nonfederal claim here was asserted by the plaintiff, who voluntarily chose to sue upon a state law claim in federal court, whereas ancillary jurisdiction typically involves claims by a defending party haled into court against his will, or by another person whose rights might be irretrievably lost unless he could assert them in an ongoing action in federal court.

No. 77-5353
Argued February 21, 1978

437 U.S. 385

Syllabus 
During a narcotics raid on petitioner's apartment by an undercover police officer and several plainclothes policemen, the undercover officer was shot and killed, and petitioner was wounded, as were two other persons in the apartment.  Other than looking for victims of the shooting and arranging for medical assistance, the narcotics agents, pursuant to a police department directive that police officers should not investigate incidents in which they are involved, made no further investigation.  Shortly thereafter, however, homicide detectives arrived on the scene to take charge of the investigation, and they proceeded to conduct an exhaustive four-day warrantless search of the apartment, which included the opening of dresser drawers, the ripping up of carpets, and the seizure of 200 to 300 objects.  In the evening of the same day as the raid, one of the detectives went to the hospital where petitioner was confined in the intensive care unit, and, after giving him Miranda warnings, persisted in interrogating him while he was lying in bed barely conscious, encumbered by tubes, needles, and a breathing apparatus, and despite the fact that he repeatedly asked that the interrogation stop until he could get a lawyer.  Subsequently, petitioner was indicted for, and convicted of, murder, assault, and narcotics offenses.  At his trial in an Arizona court, during which much of the evidence introduced against him was the product of the four-day search, and on appeal, petitioner contended that the evidence used against him had been unlawfully seized from his apartment without a warrant, and that statements obtained from him at the hospital, used to impeach his credibility, were inadmissible because they had not been made voluntarily.  The Arizona Supreme Court reversed the murder and assault convictions on state law grounds, but affirmed the narcotics convictions, holding that the warrantless search of a homicide scene is permissible under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and that petitioner's statements in the hospital were voluntary.
Held:
1. The ""murder scene exception"" created by the Arizona Supreme Court to the warrant requirement is inconsistent with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the warrantless search of petitioner's apartment was not constitutionally permissible simply because a homicide had occurred there.  Pp.  437 U. S. 388-395. 
Page 437 U. S. 386

(a) The search cannot be justified on the ground that no constitutionally protected right of privacy was invaded, it being one thing to say that one who is legally taken into police custody has a lessened right of privacy in his person, and quite another to argue that he also has a lessened right of privacy in his entire house.  Pp.  437 U. S. 391-392.
(b) Nor can the search be justified on the ground that a possible homicide inevitably presents an emergency situation, especially since there was no emergency threatening life or limb, all persons in the apartment having been located before the search began.  Pp.  437 U. S. 392-393.
(c) The seriousness of the offense under investigation did not itself create exigent circumstances of the kind that under the Fourth Amendment justify a warrantless search, where there is no indication that evidence would be lost, destroyed, or removed during the time required to obtain a search warrant and there is no suggestion that a warrant could not easily and conveniently have been obtained.  Pp.  437 U. S. 393-394.
(d) The Arizona Supreme Court's guidelines for the ""murder scene exception"" did not afford sufficient protection to a person in whose home a homicide or assault occurs where they conferred unbridled discretion upon the individual officer to interpret such terms as ""reasonable . . . search,"" ""serious personal injury with likelihood of death where there is reason to suspect foul play,"" and ""reasonable period,"" it being this kind of judgmental assessment of the reasonableness and scope of a proposed search that the Fourth Amendment requires be made by a neutral and objective magistrate, not a police officer.  Pp.  437 U. S. 394-395.
2. Due process requires that the statements obtained from petitioner in the hospital not be used in any way against him at his trial where it is apparent from the record that they were not ""the product of his free and rational choice,"" Greenwald v. Wisconsin, 390 U. S. 519,  390 U. S. 521, but, to the contrary, that he wanted not to answer his interrogator, and that, while he was weakened by pain and shock, isolated from family, friends, and legal counsel, and barely conscious, his will was simply overborne.  While statements made by a defendant in circumstances violating the strictures of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, are admissible for impeachment if their ""trustworthiness . . . satisfies legal standards,"" Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222,  401 U. S. 224; Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714,  420 U. S. 722, any criminal trial use against a defendant of his involuntary statement is a denial of due process of law.  Pp.  437 U. S. 396-402.

Respondent union, which represents persons hired to perform writing functions for motion picture and television films (hereinafter respondent), had collective bargaining contracts with a producers association (petitioner in No. 76-1153) and three television networks (petitioners in No. 76-1121).  Among respondent's members are a large number of persons (so-called ""hyphenates"") who are engaged by petitioners primarily to perform executive and supervisory functions.  Though the hyphenates, who include various categories of producers, directors, and story editors, have minor writing tasks, these are not covered in the collective bargaining contracts; only if the hyphenates are employed to perform additional writing services are the rates therefor governed by those contracts.  In connection with their regular, primary duties, many of the hyphenates are represented by unions other than respondent.  In anticipation of an economic strike upon expiration of its contracts with petitioners, respondent distributed strike rules to its members, including the hyphenates (to whom the rules were made expressly applicable).  The rules included a prohibition against crossing a picket line established by respondent at any entrance of a struck premise.  After the strike began, petitioners informed the hyphenates that they were expected to continue their regular supervisory functions, though they would not be asked to perform writing duties covered by the union contract.  Thereafter, respondent notified a large number of the hyphenates who had returned to work that they had violated one or more of the strike rules, including, in many instances, the ban on crossing a picket line.  After ensuing disciplinary proceedings (at which there was no proof that hyphenates had performed any work covered by the recently expired 
Page 437 U. S. 412
 contracts) respondent imposed various penalties on the hyphenates.  Meanwhile, the association and network petitioners filed charges against respondent for allegedly violating  8(b)(1)(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to restrain or coerce an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.  After extensive hearings, the Administrative Law Judge made findings that the hyphenates' regular supervisory duties included the performance of grievance adjustment; that the employer insisted that hyphenates return to work, but only to perform supervisory, not rank-and-file, duties; and that the hyphenates who reported did only supervisory work and had the authority to adjust grievances, which they did when the occasion arose.  He found that  8(b)(1)(b) had been violated because, by keeping hyphenates from work, the union had deprived the employer of fully effective  8(b)(1)(b) representatives.  The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) adopted these findings and conclusions, found that the union's disciplinary action was an unfair labor practice under that provision, and issued a remedial order against respondent.  The Court of Appeals denied enforcement.
Held:  Respondent's actions against the hyphenates violated  8(b)(1)(b).  Pp.  437 U. S. 429-438.
(a) In ruling upon a  8(b)(1)(b) charge growing out of union discipline of a supervisory member who elects to work during a strike, the NLRB must inquire whether the sanction may adversely affect the supervisor's performance of his collective bargaining or grievance adjustment tasks, and thereby coerce or restrain the employer contrary to that provision.  See Florida Power & Light Co. v. Electrical Workers, 417 U. S. 790. Pp. 42431.
(b) The NLRB's findings were based on substantial evidence that the hyphenates were coerced or restrained from reporting to work; that the employer was thereby deprived of the opportunity to choose particular supervisors as his collective bargaining or his grievance adjustment representatives during the strike; and that, as to the hyphenates who reported to work, there was adequate basis for concluding that the discipline would adversely affect the performance of their grievance adjustment duties either during or after the strike.  Moreover, since, as the evidence showed, the union's policy was not to permit a member to resign during a strike and for six months thereafter, the employer could not free a supervisor from further threats of union discipline by requiring him to leave the union.

Thereafter, respondent notified a large number of the hyphenates who had returned to work that they had violated one or more of the strike rules, including, in many instances, the ban on crossing a picket line.  After ensuing disciplinary proceedings (at which there was no proof that hyphenates had performed any work covered by the recently expired 
Page 437 U. S. 412
 contracts) respondent imposed various penalties on the hyphenates.  Meanwhile, the association and network petitioners filed charges against respondent for allegedly violating  8(b)(1)(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to restrain or coerce an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.  After extensive hearings, the Administrative Law Judge made findings that the hyphenates' regular supervisory duties included the performance of grievance adjustment; that the employer insisted that hyphenates return to work, but only to perform supervisory, not rank-and-file, duties; and that the hyphenates who reported did only supervisory work and had the authority to adjust grievances, which they did when the occasion arose.  He found that  8(b)(1)(b) had been violated because, by keeping hyphenates from work, the union had deprived the employer of fully effective  8(b)(1)(b) representatives.  The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) adopted these findings and conclusions, found that the union's disciplinary action was an unfair labor practice under that provision, and issued a remedial order against respondent.  The Court of Appeals denied enforcement.
Held:  Respondent's actions against the hyphenates violated  8(b)(1)(b).  Pp.  437 U. S. 429-438.
(a) In ruling upon a  8(b)(1)(b) charge growing out of union discipline of a supervisory member who elects to work during a strike, the NLRB must inquire whether the sanction may adversely affect the supervisor's performance of his collective bargaining or grievance adjustment tasks, and thereby coerce or restrain the employer contrary to that provision.  See Florida Power & Light Co. v. Electrical Workers, 417 U. S. 790. Pp. 42431.
(b) The NLRB's findings were based on substantial evidence that the hyphenates were coerced or restrained from reporting to work; that the employer was thereby deprived of the opportunity to choose particular supervisors as his collective bargaining or his grievance adjustment representatives during the strike; and that, as to the hyphenates who reported to work, there was adequate basis for concluding that the discipline would adversely affect the performance of their grievance adjustment duties either during or after the strike.  Moreover, since, as the evidence showed, the union's policy was not to permit a member to resign during a strike and for six months thereafter, the employer could not free a supervisor from further threats of union discipline by requiring him to leave the union.  Pp.  437 U. S. 431-437.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an American manufacturer of consumer electronic products, filed a petition with the Commissioner of Customs, requesting assessment under  303 of the Tariff Act of 1930 of countervailing duties on various consumer electronic products exported from Japan to this country.  Petitioner contended that the products benefited from bounties or grants paid or conferred by Japan because Japan imposes a commodity tax (an ""indirect"" tax) on those products when they are sold in that country, but ""remits"" the tax when the products are exported, any tax paid on the shipment of a product being refunded upon the subsequent exportation.  Section 303 provides that, whenever a foreign country pays a ""bounty or grant"" upon the exportation of a product from that country, the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) must levy a countervailing duty ""equal to the net amount of such bounty or grant"" upon the importation of the product into the United States.  After rejection of its request, petitioner filed suit in the Customs Court, claiming that the Treasury Department had erred in concluding that remission of the Japanese tax was not a bounty or grant within the purview of  303.  The Secretary contended that, since the remission of the tax was ""nonexcessive"" (i.e., not above the amount of the tax paid or otherwise due),  303 did not require assessment of a countervailing duty.  Relying on Downs v. United States, 187 U. S. 496, the Customs Court ruled in petitioner's favor.  The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed.
Held:  Japan does not confer a ""bounty or grant"" within the meaning of  303 on the consumer electronic products by failing to impose a commodity tax on those products when they are exported to this country, while imposing the tax on the products when they are sold in Japan.  Downs v. United States, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  437 U. S. 450-462.
(a) The Secretary's statutory interpretation that was followed in this case has been consistently maintained since the basic countervailing duty statute was enacted in 1897, and that administrative interpretation is entitled to great weight.  See Udall v. Tallman, 380 U. S. 1,  380 U. S. 16.  Pp.  437 U. S. 450-451.
(b) The legislative history of the statute suggests that the term 
Page 437 U. S. 444
 ""bounty"" was not intended to encompass the nonexcessive remission of an indirect tax.  Pp.  437 U. S. 451-455.
(c) The Secretary's interpretation was reasonable in light of the statutory purpose of the countervailing duty, viz., offsetting the unfair competitive advantage that foreign products would otherwise enjoy from export subsidies paid by their governments.  In deciding in 1898 that a nonexcessive remission of indirect taxes did not give the exporter an unfair competitive advantage, the Secretary permissibly viewed the remission as a reasonable measure for avoiding double taxation of exports -- once by the foreign country and once upon sale in this country.  Pp.  437 U. S. 455-457.
(d) The Secretary's interpretation is as permissible today as it was in 1898.  The statute has been reenacted five times with no modification of the relevant language, and the Secretary's position has been incorporated into an international agreement followed by every major trading nation in the world.  It is not for the judiciary to substitute its views as to the fairness and economic effect of remitting indirect taxes.  Pp.  437 U. S. 457-459.
(e) Downs v. United States, supra, did not involve the issue of whether a nonexcessive remission of taxes, standing alone, would have constituted a bounty on exportation, and is not dispositive of this case.  Pp.  437 U. S. 459-462.

Syllabus 
Respondents, who had purchased securities in reliance on a prospectus, brought this action on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated purchasers, alleging that petitioner accounting firm had violated the federal securities laws.  The District Court first certified the action as a class action under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23, and then, after further proceedings, decertified the class.  Respondents then filed a notice of appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1291, under which courts of appeals have jurisdiction of appeals from all ""final decisions"" of the district courts except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.  After examining the amount of respondents' claims in relation to their financial resources and the probable cost of the litigation, the Court of Appeals concluded that they would not pursue their claims individually.  On the basis of the ""death knell"" doctrine (which assumes that, without the incentive of a possible group recovery, the individual plaintiff may find it economically imprudent to pursue his lawsuit to a final judgment and then seek appellate review of an adverse class determination), the Court of Appeals held that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and reversed the District Court's order decertifying the class.  Respondents contend in this Court that an order denying class certification is appealable under both the ""death knell"" doctrine and the ""collateral order"" exception articulated in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541.
Held:
1. The ""collateral order"" exception does not apply to a prejudgment order denying class certification because such an order is subject to revision in the District Court, Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(c)(1); involves considerations that are ""enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff's cause of action,"" Mercantile Nat. Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U. S. 555,  371 U. S. 558; and is subject to effective review after final judgment at the behest of the named plaintiff or intervening class members.  United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U. S. 385.  Pp.  437 U. S. 468-469.
2. Nor does the ""death knell"" doctrine support appellate jurisdiction of a prejudgment order denying class certification.  Pp.  437 U. S. 469-476.
(a) The formulation of an appealability rule that turns on the 
Page 437 U. S. 464
 amount of the plaintiff's claim is plainly a legislative, not a judicial, function.  Pp.  437 U. S. 472-473.
(b) The alternative approach to the ""death knell"" rule that is based on a thorough study of the possible impact of the class order on the fate of the litigation would have a seriously debilitating effect on the administration of justice.  The district court would have to take evidence, entertain argument, and make findings, which the court of appeals would have to review simply to determine whether a discretionary class determination is subject to appellate review, with the possibility of remand for further factual development.  Further appeals from adverse rulings on other grounds could likewise be anticipated.  Pp.  437 U. S. 473-474.
(c) Perhaps the principal vice of the doctrine is that it authorizes indiscriminate interlocutory review of the trial judge's decisions, circumventing restrictions imposed by the Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958.  Pp.  437 U. S. 474-475
(d) The doctrine favors only plaintiffs, even though the class issue will often be critically important to defendants as well.  P.  437 U. S. 476.
(e) Allowing appeals as a matter of right from nonfinal orders that turn on the facts of a particular case thrusts appellate courts indiscriminately into the trial process, thus defeating a vital purpose of the final judgment rule of maintaining the appropriate relationship between the respective courts.

Petitioner special agent of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in the process of investigating a taxpayer's tax liability, issued summonses to respondent bank under authority of  7602 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (which permits use of a summons ""[f]or the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, . . . determining the Liability of any person for any internal revenue tax . . or collecting any such liability"") to appear before the agent and produce files of certain land trusts, created for the benefit of the taxpayer.  When respondent bank official appeared in response to the summonses but refused to produce the files, the United States and the agent petitioned the District Court for enforcement of the summonses.  That court denied enforcement, finding that the summonses were not issued in good faith because they were issued ""solely for the purpose of unearthing evidence of criminal conduct"" by the taxpayer.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court erred in refusing to enforce the summonses, since its finding that the agent was investigating the taxpayer ""solely for the purpose of unearthing evidence of criminal conduct"" does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the summonses were not issued in good faith pursuit of the congressionally authorized purposes of  7602.

Pp.  437 U. S. 308-311.
(b) To enforce a summons under  7602, the primary requirement is that it be issued before the IRS recommends to the Department of Justice the initiation of a criminal prosecution relating to the subject matter of the summons.  This is a prophylactic rule designed to protect the standards of criminal litigation discovery and the role of the grand jury as a principal tool of criminal accusation.  Pp.  437 U. S. 311-313.
(c) Enforcement of a summons is also conditioned upon the good faith use of the summons authority by the IRS, which must not abandon its

 institutional responsibility to determine and to collect taxes and civil fraud penalties.  That a single special agent intends only to gather evidence for a criminal investigation is not dispositive of the good faith of the IRS as an institution.

On October 7, 1964, respondent motor carrier instituted a proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission in which it asked the ICC to reopen proceedings in which the ICC, over respondent's opposition, had approved petitioner's acquisition of several bus companies, alleging that petitioner had not lived up to representations that the acquisitions would not adversely affect respondent.  On December 14, 1964, the United States petitioned for leave (and later was allowed) to intervene in the ICC proceeding, stating that respondent's allegations made ""a serious charge,"" but that it did not know whether they were ""true or false.""  After extensive hearings, the ICC decided against petitioner.  In the meantime, on July 5, 1968, respondent filed an action in District Court alleging, inter alia, violations of the federal antitrust laws, and the jury found violations of the Sherman Act and fraudulent concealment of such violations.  The court held that the Government's petition to intervene in the ICC proceeding served to toll the statute of limitations under  5(i) of the Clayton Act (which provides that ""[w]henever any civil or criminal proceeding is instituted by the United States to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of any of the antitrust laws, . . . the running of the statute of limitations in respect of every private . . . right of action arising under said laws and based in whole or in part on any matter complained of in said proceeding shall be suspended during the pendency thereof and for one year thereafter""), with the result that the Act's four-year period of limitations extended back to December 14, 1960, when it was combined with fraudulent concealment to create a 20-year damages period.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the literal wording of  5(i) was not controlling and that  5(i)'s purpose in furthering effective enforcement of the antitrust laws by permitting private litigants to benefit from governmental antitrust enforcement efforts would be advanced by treating the United States' petition to intervene as the ""functional equivalent of a direct action"" by the United States.
Held:  The Clayton Act's statute of limitations was

 not tolled under  5(i) by the filing of the Government's petition to intervene in the ICC proceeding.  Pp.  437 U. S. 330-337.
(a) The ICC proceeding was plainly not ""instituted by the United States"" within the meaning of  5(i).  It strains accepted usage to argue that a part.y who intervenes in a proceeding instituted by someone else has also ""instituted that proceeding.""  In fact, the United States not only did not institute the ICC proceeding but was not in a position to do so, since, in view of its statement that it did not know whether respondent's allegations were ""true or false,"" it could not in good faith have made the charging allegations necessary to institute the proceeding.  Pp.  437 U. S. 330-331.
(b) Neither had the United States, within the meaning of  5(i), ""complained of"" anything on which the District Court action was based, since in the ICC proceeding its petition to intervene charged petitioner with no wrongdoing, took no position on the merits, sought no relief, and disclaimed any knowledge of the relevant facts, seeking only an opportunity for respondent to establish its allegations.  Pp.  437 U. S. 331-332.
(c) What is now  5(i) was enacted to ensure that private litigants would have the benefit of prior Government antitrust efforts, and this purpose would not be served by construing  5(i) as applicable to the facts of this case, where respondent is seeking to benefit not from a Government antitrust action, but from an ICC proceeding respondent itself instituted.  Pp.  437 U. S. 332-334.
(d) Application of  5(i) to this case would also fail to give weight to Congress' purpose in amending the Clayton Act to provide a uniform four-year period of limitations, and thus eliminate the prior confusion caused by determining the period of limitations by state law.  P.  437 U. S. 334.

Syllabus 
On October 7, 1964, respondent motor carrier instituted a proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission in which it asked the ICC to reopen proceedings in which the ICC, over respondent's opposition, had approved petitioner's acquisition of several bus companies, alleging that petitioner had not lived up to representations that the acquisitions would not adversely affect respondent.  On December 14, 1964, the United States petitioned for leave (and later was allowed) to intervene in the ICC proceeding, stating that respondent's allegations made ""a serious charge,"" but that it did not know whether they were ""true or false.""  After extensive hearings, the ICC decided against petitioner.  In the meantime, on July 5, 1968, respondent filed an action in District Court alleging, inter alia, violations of the federal antitrust laws, and the jury found violations of the Sherman Act and fraudulent concealment of such violations.

No. 77-335
Argued February 28-March 1, 1978
Decided June 19, 1978
437 U.S. 340

Syllabus 
Respondents brought a class action under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(b)(3) on behalf of themselves and a class of purchasers against petitioners (including an open-end investment fund, its management corporation, and a brokerage firm), seeking to recover the amount by which the allegedly artificially inflated price respondents paid for fund shares exceeded their value.  Respondents sought to require petitioners to help compile a list of the names and addresses of the members of the plaintiff class from records kept by the fund's transfer agent so that the individual notice required by Rule 23(c)(2) could be sent.  The class proposed by respondents numbered about 121,000 persons, of whom about 103,000 still held shares, and, since 171,000 persons currently held shares, approximately 68,000 were not members of the class.  To compile a list of the class members' names and addresses, the transfer agent's employees would have had to sort manually through many records, keypunch 150,000 to 300,000 computer cards, and create several new computer programs, all for an estimated cost of over $16,000.  Respondents' proposed redefinition of the plaintiff class, opposed by petitioners, to include only those persons who bought fund shares during a specified period and who still held shares was rejected by the District Court as involving an arbitrary reduction in the class, but the court held that the cost of sorting out the list of class members was the petitioners' responsibility, while also rejecting respondents' proposal, opposed by petitioners, that the class notice be included in a regular fund mailing, because it would reach the 68,000 shareholders who were not class members.  On petitioners' appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the federal discovery rules authorized the District Court to order petitioners to assist in compiling the class list and to bear the $16,000 expense incident thereto.
Held:
1. Federal Rule Civ.Proc. 23(d), which empowers district courts to enter appropriate orders in the handling of class actions, not the discovery rules, is the appropriate source of authority for the District Court's order directing petitioners to help compile the list of class members.  The information as to such members is sought to facilitate the sending of notice, rather than to define or clarify issues in the case, 
Page 437 U. S. 341
 as is the function of the discovery rules, and thus cannot be forced into the concept of relevancy reflected in Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 26(b)(1), which permits discovery ""regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.""  Pp.  437 U. S. 350-356.
2. Where a defendant in a class action can perform one of the tasks necessary to send notice, such as identification, more efficiently than the representative plaintiff, the district court has discretion to order him to perform the task under Rule 23(d), and also has some discretion in allocating the cost of complying with such an order, although, as a general rule, the representative plaintiff should bear all costs relating to the sending of notice, because it is he who seeks to maintain the suit as a class action.  See Eisen. v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156.  Pp.  437 U. S. 356-359.
3. Here, however, the District Court abused its discretion in requiring petitioners to bear the expense of identifying class members and in not requiring respondents to pay the transfer agent, where respondents can obtain the information sought by paying the transfer agent the same amount that petitioners would have to pay, the information must be obtained to comply with respondents' obligation to provide notice to their class, and no special circumstances have been shown to warrant requiring petitioners to bear the expense.  Pp.  437 U. S. 359-364.
(a) Petitioners' opposition to respondents' proposed redefinition of the class and to the method of sending notice is an insufficient reason for requiring petitioners to pay the transfer agent, because it is neither fair nor good policy to penalize a defendant for prevailing on an argument against a representative plaintiff's proposals.  Pp.  437 U. S. 360-361.
(b) Nor is the fact that $16,000 is a ""relatively modest"" sum in comparison to the fund's assets a sufficient reason for requiring petitioners to bear the expenses, since the proper test is normally whether the cost is substantial, not whether it is ""modest"" in relation to ability to pay.  Pp.  437 U. S. 361-362.
(c) The District Court's order cannot be justified on the ground that part of the records in question were kept on computer tapes, rather than in less modern forms.  P.  437 U. S. 362.
(d) And petitioners should not be required to bear the identification expense simply because they are alleged to have breached a fiduciary duty to respondents and their class, since a bare allegation of wrongdoing, whether by breach of fiduciary duty or otherwise, is not a fair reason for requiring a defendant to undertake financial burdens and risks to further a plaintiff's case.  P.  437 U. S. 363.

|437 u.s. 153|"Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill
No. 76-1701
Argued April 18, 1978
Decided June 15, 1978
437 U.S. 153

Syllabus 
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) in  4 to declare a species of life ""endangered.""  Section 7 specifies that all
""Federal departments and agencies shall, . . . with the assistance of the Secretary, utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of [the] Act by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered species . . . and by taking such action necessary to insure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of such endangered species and threatened species or result in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary . . . to be critical.""
Shortly after the Act's passage, the Secretary was petitioned to list a small fish popularly known as the snail darter as an endangered species under the Act.  Thereafter, the Secretary made the designation.  Having determined that the snail darter apparently lives only in that portion of the Little Tennessee River that would be completely inundated by the impoundment of the reservoir created as a consequence of the completion of the Tellico Dam, he declared that area as the snail darter's ""critical habitat.""  Notwithstanding the near completion of the multimillion dollar dam, the Secretary issued a regulation in which it was declared that, pursuant to  7,
""all Federal agencies must take such action as is necessary to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not result in the destruction or modification of this critical habitat area.""
Respondents brought this suit to enjoin completion of the dam and impoundment of the reservoir, claiming that those actions would violate the Act by causing the snail darter's extinction.  The District Court, after trial, denied relief and dismissed the complaint.  Though finding that the impoundment of the reservoir would probably jeopardize the snail darter's continued existence, the court noted that Congress, though fully aware of the snail darter problem, had continued Tellico's appropriations, and concluded that,
""[a]t some point in time, a federal project becomes so near completion and so incapable of modification that a court of equity should not apply a statute enacted long after inception of the project to produce an unreasonable result. . . .""
The Court of Appeals reversed. and 
Page 437 U. S. 154
 ordered the, District Court permanently to enjoin completion of the project
""until Congress, by appropriate legislation, exempts Tellico from compliance with the Act or the snail darter has been deleted from the list of endangered species or its critical habitat materially redefined.""
The court held that the record revealed a prima facie violation of  7 in that the Tennessee Valley Authority had failed to take necessary action to avoid jeopardizing the snail darter's critical habitat by its ""actions.""  The court thus rejected the contention that the word ""actions,"" as used in  7, was not intended by Congress to encompass the terminal phases of ongoing projects.  At various times before, during, and after the foregoing judicial proceedings, TVA represented to congressional Appropriations Committees that the Act did not prohibit completion of the Tellico Project. and described its efforts to transplant the snail darter.  The Committees consistently recommended appropriations for the dam, sometimes stating their views that the Act did not prohibit completion of the dam at its advanced stage, and Congress each time approved TVA's general budget, which contained funds for the dam's continued construction.
Held:
1. The Endangered Species Act prohibits impoundment of the Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam.  Pp.  437 U. S. 172-193.
(a) The language of  7 is plain, and makes no exception such as that urged by petitioner whereby the Act would not apply to a project like Tellico that was well under way when Congress passed the Act.  Pp.  437 U. S. 172-174.
(b) It is clear from the Act's legislative history that Congress intended to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction -- whatever the cost.  The pointed omission of the type of qualified language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious congressional design to give endangered species priority over the ""primary missions"" of federal agencies.  Congress, moreover, foresaw that  7 would, on occasion, require agencies to alter ongoing projects in order to fulfill the Act's goals.  Pp.  437 U. S. 174-187.
(c) None of the limited ""hardship exemptions"" provided in the Act would even remotely apply to the Tellico Project.  P.  437 U. S. 188.
(d) Though statements in Appropriations Committee Reports reflected the view of the Committees either that the Act did not apply to Tellico or that the dam should be completed regardless of the Act's provisions, nothing in the TVA appropriations measures passed by Congress stated that the Tellico Project was to be completed regardless of the Act's requirements.  To find a repeal under these circumstances, as petitioner has urged, would violate the ""cardinal rule . . . that repeals by implication are not favored.'""  Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535,  417 U. S. 549.  The 
Page 437 U. S. 155
 doctrine disfavoring repeals by implication applies with full vigor when the subsequent legislation is an appropriations measure.  When voting on appropriations measures, legislators are entitled to assume that the funds will be devoted to purposes that are lawful, and not for any purpose forbidden.  A contrary policy would violate the express rules of both Houses of Congress, which provide that appropriations measures may not change existing substantive law.  An appropriations committee's expression does not operate to repeal or modify substantive legislation.  Pp.  437 U. S. 189-193.
2. The Court of Appeals did not err in ordering that completion of the Tellico Dam, which would have violated the Act, be enjoined.  Congress has spoken in the plainest words, making it clear that endangered species are to be accorded the highest priorities.  Since that legislative power has been exercised, it is up to the Executive Branch to administer the law, and for the Judiciary to enforce it when, as here, enforcement has been sought.  Pp.  437 U.

			"|"Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill
No. 76-1701
Argued April 18, 1978
Decided June 15, 1978
437 U.S. 153

Syllabus 
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) in  4 to declare a species of life ""endangered.""  Section 7 specifies that all
""Federal departments and agencies shall, . . . with the assistance of the Secretary, utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of [the] Act by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered species . . . and by taking such action necessary to insure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of such endangered species and threatened species or result in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary . . . to be critical.""
Shortly after the Act's passage, the Secretary was petitioned to list a small fish popularly known as the snail darter as an endangered species under the Act.  Thereafter, the Secretary made the designation.  Having determined that the snail darter apparently lives only in that portion of the Little Tennessee River that would be completely inundated by the impoundment of the reservoir created as a consequence of the completion of the Tellico Dam, he declared that area as the snail darter's ""critical habitat.""  Notwithstanding the near completion of the multimillion dollar dam, the Secretary issued a regulation in which it was declared that, pursuant to  7,
""all Federal agencies must take such action as is necessary to ensure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not result in the destruction or modification of this critical habitat area.""
Respondents brought this suit to enjoin completion of the dam and impoundment of the reservoir, claiming that those actions would violate the Act by causing the snail darter's extinction.  The District Court, after trial, denied relief and dismissed the complaint.  Though finding that the impoundment of the reservoir would probably jeopardize the snail darter's continued existence, the court noted that Congress, though fully aware of the snail darter problem, had continued Tellico's appropriations, and concluded that,
""[a]t some point in time, a federal project becomes so near completion and so incapable of modification that a court of equity should not apply a statute enacted long after inception of the project to produce an unreasonable result. . . .""
The Court of Appeals reversed. and 
Page 437 U. S. 154
 ordered the, District Court permanently to enjoin completion of the project
""until Congress, by appropriate legislation, exempts Tellico from compliance with the Act or the snail darter has been deleted from the list of endangered species or its critical habitat materially redefined.""
The court held that the record revealed a prima facie violation of  7 in that the Tennessee Valley Authority had failed to take necessary action to avoid jeopardizing the snail darter's critical habitat by its ""actions.""  The court thus rejected the contention that the word ""actions,"" as used in  7, was not intended by Congress to encompass the terminal phases of ongoing projects.  At various times before, during, and after the foregoing judicial proceedings, TVA represented to congressional Appropriations Committees that the Act did not prohibit completion of the Tellico Project. and described its efforts to transplant the snail darter.  The Committees consistently recommended appropriations for the dam, sometimes stating their views that the Act did not prohibit completion of the dam at its advanced stage, and Congress each time approved TVA's general budget, which contained funds for the dam's continued construction.
Held:
1. The Endangered Species Act prohibits impoundment of the Little Tennessee River by the Tellico Dam.  Pp.  437 U. S. 172-193.
(a) The language of  7 is plain, and makes no exception such as that urged by petitioner whereby the Act would not apply to a project like Tellico that was well under way when Congress passed the Act.  Pp.  437 U. S. 172-174.
(b) It is clear from the Act's legislative history that Congress intended to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction -- whatever the cost.  The pointed omission of the type of qualified language previously included in endangered species legislation reveals a conscious congressional design to give endangered species priority over the ""primary missions"" of federal agencies.  Congress, moreover, foresaw that  7 would, on occasion, require agencies to alter ongoing projects in order to fulfill the Act's goals.  Pp.  437 U. S. 174-187.
(c) None of the limited ""hardship exemptions"" provided in the Act would even remotely apply to the Tellico Project.  P.  437 U. S. 188.
(d) Though statements in Appropriations Committee Reports reflected the view of the Committees either that the Act did not apply to Tellico or that the dam should be completed regardless of the Act's provisions, nothing in the TVA appropriations measures passed by Congress stated that the Tellico Project was to be completed regardless of the Act's requirements.  To find a repeal under these circumstances, as petitioner has urged, would violate the ""cardinal rule . . . that repeals by implication are not favored.'""  Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535,  417 U. S. 549.  The 
Page 437 U. S. 155
 doctrine disfavoring repeals by implication applies with full vigor when the subsequent legislation is an appropriations measure.  When voting on appropriations measures, legislators are entitled to assume that the funds will be devoted to purposes that are lawful, and not for any purpose forbidden.  A contrary policy would violate the express rules of both Houses of Congress, which provide that appropriations measures may not change existing substantive law.  An appropriations committee's expression does not operate to repeal or modify substantive legislation.  Pp.  437 U. S. 189-193.
2. The Court of Appeals did not err in ordering that completion of the Tellico Dam, which would have violated the Act, be enjoined.  Congress has spoken in the plainest words, making it clear that endangered species are to be accorded the highest priorities.  Since that legislative power has been exercised, it is up to the Executive Branch to administer the law, and for the Judiciary to enforce it when, as here, enforcement has been sought.  Pp.  437 U. S. 193-194.
549 F.2d 1064, affirmed.

No. 77-911
Argued April 26, 1978
Decided June 15, 1978
437 U.S. 214

Syllabus 
After the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed an unfair labor practice complaint against respondent employer, respondent requested, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), that the NLRB make available prior to the hearing copies of all potential witnesses' statements collected during the NLRB's investigation.  This request was denied on the ground that the statements were exempt from disclosure under, inter alia, Exemption 7(A) of the FOIA, which provides that disclosure is not required of
""investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records . . . would interfere with enforcement proceedings.""
Respondent then filed an action in District Court seeking disclosure of the statements and injunctive relief.  That court held that Exemption 7(A) did not apply because the NLRB did not claim that release of the statements would pose any unique or unusual danger of interference with the particular enforcement proceeding, and hence directed the NLRB to provide the statements for copying prior to any hearing.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the NLRB had failed to sustain its burden of demonstrating the availability of Exemption 7(A) because it had introduced no evidence that interference with the unfair labor practice proceeding in the form of witness intimidation was likely to occur in this particular case.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the NLRB was not entitled to withhold the witness statements under Exemption 7(A).  Pp.  437 U. S. 220-243.
(a) Exemption 7(A)'s language does not support an interpretation that determination of ""interference"" under the Exemption can be made only on an individual, case-by-case basis, and, indeed, the language of Exemption 7 as a whole tends to suggest the contrary.  Nor is such an interpretation supported by other portions of the FOIA providing for disclosure of segregable portions of records and for in camera review of documents, and placing the burden of justifying nondisclosure on the Government.  Pp.  437 U. S. 223-224.
(b) Exemption 7(A)'s legislative history indicates that Congress did not intend to prevent federal courts from determining that, with respect 
Page 437 U. S. 215
 to particular kinds of enforcement proceedings, disclosure of particular kinds of investigatory records while a case is pending would generally ""interfere with enforcement proceedings,"" and, more particularly, did not intend to overturn the NLRB's longstanding rule against prehearing disclosure of witnesses' statements.  Pp.  437 U. S. 224-236.
(c) Witness statements in pending unfair labor practice proceedings are exempt from FOIA disclosure at least until completion of the NLRB's hearing, since the release of such statements necessarily would involve the kind of harm that Congress believed would constitute an ""interference"" with NLRB enforcement proceedings -- that of giving a party litigant earlier and greater access to the NLRB's case than he would otherwise have.  Thus, here, the NLRB met its burden of demonstrating that disclosure of the witnesses' statements in question ""would interfere with enforcement proceedings,"" since the dangers posed by premature release of the statements would involve precisely the kind of ""interference with enforcement proceedings"" that Exemption 7(A) was designed to avoid, the most obvious risk of such ""interference"" being that employers or, in some cases, unions will coerce or intimidate employees and others who have given statements, in an effort to make them change their testimony or not testify at all.

No. 77-334
Argued March 21, 1978
Decided June 15, 1978
437 U.S. 255

Syllabus 
Appellants brought suit in a Massachusetts court challenging the State's power to impose an excise tax on federal savings and loan associations as measured by their net operating income, claiming that the tax violates  5(h) of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, which provides that no tax on a federal savings and loan association shall be ""greater than that imposed"" by the State on similar local thrift and home financing institutions.  Appellants claimed that the state tax on their net operating income exceeds that imposed on similar local institutions because the deduction available under the state tax statute for ""minimum additions to its guaranty fund or surplus required by law or the appropriate federal and state supervisory authorities"" is generally lower for federal savings and loan associations than for similar state savings institutions.  Appellants also contended that, because the Massachusetts tax does not apply to credit unions, which, appellants maintained, are ""similar"" to federal savings and loan associations, the associations are entitled to the credit unions' exemptions.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld the statute.
Held:
1. The Massachusetts tax is not discriminatory on its face.  The amount of the deduction depends on varying regulatory practices as to the reserves that must be maintained, but a tax is not invalid because it recognizes that state and federal regulations may differ.  Nor does the record show any discrimination in fact, or in statutory purpose (federal reserve requirements were as high as the State's when the tax was enacted).  Pp.  437 U. S. 257-260.
2. Credit unions are not ""similar"" to federal savings and loan associations within the meaning of  5(h), as is clear not only from distinctions between the two under both federal and state law but also from the fact that Massachusetts savings banks and cooperative banks are more competitive with federal associations than credit unions are.  Congress recognized that States might classify their own institutions in various ways, as Massachusetts has done in excluding credit unions from a large

Syllabus 
An Iowa statute prescribes a so-called single factor sales formula for apportioning an interstate corporation's income for state income tax purposes.  Under this formula, the part of income from such a corporation's sale of tangible personal property attributable to business within the State, and hence subject to the state income tax, is deemed to be in that proportion which the corporation's gross sales made within the State bear to its total gross sales.  Appellant, an Illinois corporation that sells animal feed it manufactures in Illinois to Iowa customers through Iowa salesmen and warehouses, brought an action in an Iowa court challenging the constitutionality of the single factor formula.  The trial court held the formula invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause, but the Iowa Supreme Court reversed.
Held:
1. Iowa's single factor formula is not invalid under the Due Process Clause.  Pp.  437 U. S. 271-275.
(a) Any assumption that at least some portion of appellant's income from Iowa sales was generated by Illinois activities is too speculative to support a claim that Iowa in fact taxed profits not attributable to activities within the State.  P.  437 U. S. 272.
(b) An apportionment formula, such as the single factor formula, that is necessarily employed as a rough approximation of a corporation's income reasonably related to the activities conducted within the taxing State will only be disturbed when the taxpayer has proved by ""clear and cogent evidence"" that the income attributed to the State is in fact ""out of all reasonable proportion to the business transacted . . . in that State,"" Hans Rees' Sons v.

Here, the Iowa statute afforded appellant an opportunity to demonstrate that the single factor formula produced an arbitrary result in its case, but the record contains no such showing.  Pp.  437 U.

2. Nor is Iowa's single factor formula invalid under the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  437 U. S. 276-281.

(a) On this record, the existence of duplicative taxation as between Iowa and Illinois (which uses the so-called three factor -- property, payroll, and sales -- formula) is speculative, but even then assuming some overlap, appellant's argument that Iowa, rather than Illinois, was necessarily at fault in a constitutional sense cannot be accepted.  Where the record does not reveal the sources of appellant's profits, its Commerce Clause claim cannot rest on the premise that profits earned in Illinois were included in its Iowa taxable income, and therefore the Iowa formula was at fault for whatever overlap may have existed.

(b) The Commerce Clause itself, without implementing legislation by Congress, does not require, as appellant urges, that Iowa compute corporate net income under the Illinois three factor formula.

No. 76-6528
Argued November 28, 1977
Decided June 14, 1978
437 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Petitioner, in support of his insanity defense to a bank robbery charge, offered expert testimony, and the Government offered expert and lay testimony in rebuttal.  Before the case was submitted to the jury, the District Court denied a motion for acquittal.  The jury found petitioner guilty as charged, and thereafter his motion for a new trial on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict was denied.  The Court of Appeals, holding that the Government had failed to rebut petitioner's proof as to insanity, reversed and remanded to the District Court to determine whether a directed verdict of acquittal should be entered or a new trial ordered, citing, inter alia, as authority for such a remand, 28 U.S.C.  2106, which authorizes federal appellate courts to remand a cause and
""direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.""
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment precludes a second trial once the reviewing court has found the evidence insufficient to sustain the jury's verdict of guilty, and the only ""just"" remedy available for that court under 28 U.S.C.  2106 is the entry of a judgment of acquittal.  Pp.  437 U. S. 5-18.
(a) For the purposes of determining whether the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a second trial after the reversal of a conviction, a reversal based on insufficiency of evidence is to be distinguished from a reversal for trial error.  In holding the evidence insufficient to sustain 
Page 437 U. S. 2

No. 76-6528

Decided June 14, 1978
437 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Petitioner, in support of his insanity defense to a bank robbery charge, offered expert testimony, and the Government offered expert and lay testimony in rebuttal.  Before the case was submitted to the jury, the District Court denied a motion for acquittal.  The jury found petitioner guilty as charged, and thereafter his motion for a new trial on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict was denied.  The Court of Appeals, holding that the Government had failed to rebut petitioner's proof as to insanity, reversed and remanded to the District Court to determine whether a directed verdict of acquittal should be entered or a new trial ordered, citing, inter alia, as authority for such a remand, 28 U.S.C.  2106, which authorizes federal appellate courts to remand a cause and
""direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.""
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment precludes a second trial once the reviewing court has found the evidence insufficient to sustain the jury's verdict of guilty, and the only ""just"" remedy available for that court under 28 U.S.C.  2106 is the entry of a judgment of acquittal.  Pp.  437 U. S. 5-18.
(a) For the purposes of determining whether the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a second trial after the reversal of a conviction, a reversal based on insufficiency of evidence is to be distinguished from a reversal for trial error.  In holding the evidence insufficient to sustain

 guilt, an appellate court determines that the prosecution has failed to prove guilt beyond  reasonable doubt.  Given the requirements for entry of a judgment of acquittal, to permit a second trial would negate the purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause to forbid a second trial in which the prosecution would be afforded another opportunity to supply evidence that it failed to muster in the first trial.

Syllabus 
On appeal of the first-degree murder convictions of petitioner and another, the Florida Supreme Court reversed by a per curiam opinion and ordered a new trial.  That opinion, which a majority of four justices joined, stated that ""the evidence was definitely lacking in establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants committed murder in the first degree,"" and that the ""interests of justice require a new trial.""  Three justices dissented without opinion.  Three of the justices who had joined the per curiam also filed a ""special concurrence,"" which, though concerned only with trial error, concluded that, ""[f]or the reasons stated, the judgments should be reversed and remanded for a new trial, so we have agreed to the Per curiam order doing so.""  Before the second trial, defendants unsuccessfully contended in the state courts that the per curiam opinion was tantamount to a finding that the trial court should have directed a verdict of not guilty, and that a second trial for first-degree murder would constitute double jeopardy; and the defendants were retried and convicted of first-degree murder.  Petitioner and his codefendant, by appeal in the state courts and petitioner by application for habeas corpus in the District Court and Court of Appeals, unavailingly pressed their double jeopardy claims.
Held: Burks v. United States, ante 437 U. S.  1, precludes a second trial once a reviewing court has determined that the evidence introduced at trial is insufficient to sustain the verdict.  Standing by itself, the per curiam would therefore clearly compel the conclusion that petitioner's second trial violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.  But the special concurrence leaves open the possibility that three of the justices who joined the per curiam were concerned simply with trial error, and joined in the remand solely to give the defendants an error-free trial -- even though they were satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.  So that the ambiguity can be resolved, the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of the Court's opinion and Burks, supra.  Pp.  437 U. S. 24-27.

437 U.S. 54

Syllabus 
Title 18 U.S.C.  1955 (1976 ed.) makes it a federal offense for five or more persons to conduct an ""illegal gambling business"" in violation of the law of the place where the business is located.  Petitioner, along with several others, was indicted for violating  1955 in a single count charging that the defendants' gambling business involved numbers betting and betting on horse races in violation of a specified Massachusetts statute.  The Government's evidence at trial in the District Court showed that the defendants had been engaged in both horse betting and numbers betting.  At the close of the Government's case, defense counsel argued that the Government had failed to prove a violation of the Massachusetts statute because that statute did not prohibit numbers betting, but only horse betting.  After the defendants had rested, the trial judge granted their motion to exclude all evidence of numbers betting, and then granted a motion to acquit petitioner because of lack of evidence of his connection with the horse betting business.  The case against the remaining defendants went to the jury, and they were all convicted.  The Government appealed under 18 U.S.C.  3731 (1976 ed.) from the order excluding the numbers betting evidence and from the judgment acquitting petitioner, and sought a new trial on the portion of the indictment relating to numbers betting.  The Court of Appeals held that it had jurisdiction of the appeal, taking the view that, although  3731, by its terms, authorizes the Government to appeal only from orders ""dismissing an indictment . . . as to any one or more counts,"" the word ""counts"" refers to any discrete basis for imposing criminal liability, that, since the horse betting and numbers allegations were discrete bases for liability duplicitously joined in a single count, the District Court's action constituted a ""dismissal"" of the numbers ""charge"" and an acquittal for insufficient evidence on the horse betting charge, and that therefore  3731 authorized an appeal from the ""dismissal"" of the numbers charge.  The court went on to hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment did not bar a retrial, because petitioner had voluntarily terminated the proceedings on the numbers portion of the count by moving, in effect, to dismiss it.  The court vacated the judgment of acquittal, and remanded for a new trial on the numbers charge.
Held:

1. A retrial on the numbers theory of liability is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.  437 U. S. 63-74.
(a) The Court of Appeals erroneously characterized the District Court's action as a ""dismissal"" of the numbers theory.  There was only one count charged, the District Court did not order language in the indictment stricken, and the indictment was not amended, but the judgment of acquittal was entered on the entire count, and found petitioner not guilty of violating  1955 without specifying that it did so only with respect to one theory of liability.  Pp.  437 U. S. 65-68.
(b) To the extent that the District Court found the indictment's description of the offense too narrow to warrant admission of certain evidence, the court's ruling was an erroneous evidentiary ruling, which led to an acquittal for insufficient evidence, and that judgment of acquittal, however erroneous, bars further prosecution on any aspect of the count, and hence bars appellate review of the trial court's error.  Pp.  437 U. S. 68-69.
(c) Even if it could be said that the District Court ""dismissed"" the numbers allegation, a retrial on that theory would subject petitioner to a second trial on the ""same offense"" of which he was acquitted.  Under  1955 participation in a single gambling business is but a single offense, no matter how many state statutes the enterprise violated, and, with regard to this single gambling business, petitioner was acquitted.  The Government having charged only a single gambling business, the discrete violations of state law that that business may have committed are not severable in order to avoid the Double Jeopardy Clause's bar of retrials for the ""same offense.""  Pp.  437 U. S. 69-74.
2. Once the defendant has been acquitted, no matter how ""egregiously erroneous"" the legal rulings leading to the judgment of acquittal might be, there is no exception to the constitutional rule forbidding successive trials for the same offense.  Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141.  Thus, here, while the numbers evidence was erroneously excluded, the judgment of acquittal produced thereby is final and unreviewable.  Lee v.

No. 76-1382
Argued February 21, 1978
Decided June 14, 1978
437 U.S. 82

Syllabus 
Respondent, indicted for federal drug offenses, moved before trial and twice during trial for dismissal of two counts of the indictment on the ground that his defense had been prejudiced by preindictment delay.  At the close of all the evidence, the trial court granted respondent's motion.  The Government sought to appeal the dismissals under 18 U.S.C.  3731 (1976 ed.), which allows the United States to appeal from a district court's dismissal of an indictment except where the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits further prosecution.  The Court of Appeals, concluding that that Clause barred further prosecution, dismissed the appeal, relying on United States v. Jenkins, 420 U. S. 358.  In that case the Court, following the principle underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause that the Government, with all its resources and power, should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, held that, whether or not a dismissal of an indictment after jeopardy had attached amounted to an acquittal on the merits, the Government had no right to appeal, because
""further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged, would have been required upon reversal and remand.""
Held:  Where a defendant himself seeks to have his trial terminated without any submission to either judge or jury as to his guilt or innocence, an appeal by the Government from his successful effort to do so does not offend the Double Jeopardy Clause, and hence is not barred by 18 U.S.C.  3731 (1976 ed.).  United States v. Jerkins, supra, overruled.  Pp.  437 U. S. 87-101.
(a) The successful appeal of a judgment of conviction, except on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, Burks v. United States, ante, 437 U. S.  1, does not bar further prosecution on the same charge.  A judgment of acquittal, whether based on a jury verdict of not guilty or on a ruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to convict, may not be appealed, and terminates the prosecution when a second trial would be necessitated by a reversal.  Pp.  437 U. S. 87-92.
(b) Where no final determination of guilt or innocence has been made, a trial judge may declare a mistrial on the motion of the prosecution or 
Page 437 U. S. 83
 upon his own initiative only if ""there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated,"" United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579,  22 U. S. 580, but where a defendant successfully seeks to avoid his trial prior to its conclusion by a motion for a mistrial, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not offended by a second prosecution.  Such a motion by the defendant is deemed to be a deliberate election on his part to forgo his valued right to have his guilt or innocence determined by the first trier of fact.  United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600,  424 U. S. 609.  Pp.  437 U. S. 92-94.
(c) At least in some cases, the dismissal of an indictment after jeopardy has ""attached"" may be treated on the same basis as the declaration of a mistrial, even though a successful Government appeal would require further trial court proceedings leading to the factual resolution of the issue of guilt or innocence, see Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23; and the Court's growing experience with Government appeals calls for a reexamination of the rationale in Jenkins in light of Lee; United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, and other recent expositions of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.  437 U. S. 94-95.
(d) In a situation such as the instant one, where a defendant chooses to avoid conviction not because of his assertion that the Government has failed to make out a case against him, but because of a legal claim that the Government's case against him must fail even though it might satisfy the trier of fact that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant, by deliberately choosing to seek termination of the trial, suffers no injury cognizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause if the Government is permitted to appeal from such a trial court ruling favoring the defendant.  The Double Jeopardy Clause, which guards against Government oppression, does not relieve a defendant of the consequences of his voluntary choice.  Pp.  437 U. S. 95-101.  544 F.2d 903, reversed and remanded.

A judgment of acquittal, whether based on a jury verdict of not guilty or on a ruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to convict, may not be appealed, and terminates the prosecution when a second trial would be necessitated by a reversal.  Pp.  437 U. S. 87-92.
(b) Where no final determination of guilt or innocence has been made, a trial judge may declare a mistrial on the motion of the prosecution or 
Page 437 U. S. 83
 upon his own initiative only if ""there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated,"" United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579,  22 U. S. 580, but where a defendant successfully seeks to avoid his trial prior to its conclusion by a motion for a mistrial, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not offended by a second prosecution.  Such a motion by the defendant is deemed to be a deliberate election on his part to forgo his valued right to have his guilt or innocence determined by the first trier of fact.  United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600,  424 U. S. 609.  Pp.  437 U. S. 92-94.
(c) At least in some cases, the dismissal of an indictment after jeopardy has ""attached"" may be treated on the same basis as the declaration of a mistrial, even though a successful Government appeal would require further trial court proceedings leading to the factual resolution of the issue of guilt or innocence, see Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23; and the Court's growing experience with Government appeals calls for a reexamination of the rationale in Jenkins in light of Lee; United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, and other recent expositions of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.  437 U. S. 94-95.
(d) In a situation such as the instant one, where a defendant chooses to avoid conviction not because of his assertion that the Government has failed to make out a case against him, but because of a legal claim that the Government's case against him must fail even though it might satisfy the trier of fact that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant, by deliberately choosing to seek termination of the trial, suffers no injury cognizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause if the Government is permitted to appeal from such a trial court ruling favoring the defendant.  The Double Jeopardy Clause, which guards against Government oppression, does not relieve a defendant of the consequences of his voluntary choice.  Pp.  437 U. S. 95-101.  544 F.2d 903, reversed and remanded.

No. 77-10
Argued February 28, 1978
Decided June 14, 1978*
437 U.S. 117

Syllabus 
Responding to evidence that, during the 1973 petroleum shortage, oil producers or refiners were favoring company-operated gasoline stations, Maryland enacted a statute prohibiting producers or refiners from operating retail service stations within the State, and requiring them to extend all ""voluntary allowances"" (temporary price reductions granted to independent dealers injured by local competitive price reductions) uniformly to all stations they supply.  In actions by several oil companies challenging the validity of the statute on various grounds, the Maryland trial court held the statute invalid primarily on substantive due process grounds, but the Maryland Court of Appeals reversed, upholding the validity of the statute against contentions, inter alia, that it violated the Commerce and Due Process Clauses and conflicted with  2(b) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, which prohibits price discrimination, with the proviso that a seller can price in good faith to meet a competitor's equally low price.
Held:
1. The Maryland statute does not violate the Due Process Clause, since, regardless of the ultimate efficacy of the statute, it bears a reasonable relation to the State's legitimate purpose in controlling the gasoline retail market.  Pp. 124-125.
2. The divestiture provisions of the statute do not violate the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  437 U. S. 125-129.
(a) That the burden of such provisions falls solely on interstate companies does not, by itself, establish a claim of discrimination against interstate commerce.  The statute creates no barrier against interstate independent dealers, nor does it prohibit the flow of interstate goods, place added costs upon them, or distinguish between in-state and out-of-state companies in the retail market.  Hunt v. Washington Apple 
Page 437 U. S. 118
 Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333; and Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340 U. S. 349, distinguished.  Pp.  437 U. S. 125-126.
(b) Nor does the fact that the burden of state regulation falls on interstate companies show that the statute impermissibly burdens interstate commerce, even if some refiners were to stop selling in the State because of the divestiture requirement and even if the elimination of company-operated stations were to deprive consumers of certain special services.  Interstate commerce is not subjected to an impermissible burden simply because an otherwise valid regulation causes some business to shift from one interstate supplier to another.  The Commerce Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations.  Pp.  437 U. S. 127-128.
(c) The Commerce Clause does not, by its own force, preempt the field of retail gasoline marketing, but, absent a relevant congressional declaration of policy, or a showing of a specific discrimination against, or burdening of, interstate commerce, the States have the power to regulate in this area.  Pp.  437 U. S. 128-129.
3. The ""voluntary allowances"" requirement of the Maryland statute is not preempted by  2(b) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, or the Sherman Act.  Pp.  437 U. S. 129-134.
(a) Any hypothetical ""conflict"" arising from the possibility that the Maryland statute may require uniformity in some situations in which the Robinson-Patman Act would permit localized price discrimination is not sufficient to warrant preemption.  Pp.  437 U. S. 130-131.
(b) Neither  2(b) nor the federal policy favoring competition establishes a federal right to engage in discriminatory pricing in certain situations.  Section 2(b)'s proviso is merely an exception to that statute's broad prohibition against discriminatory pricing, and does not create any new federal right, but rather defines a specific, limited defense.  Pp.  437 U. S. 131-133.
(c) While, in the sense that the Maryland statute might have an anticompetitive effect, there is a conflict between that statute and the Sherman Act's central policy of ""economic liberty,"" nevertheless this sort of conflict cannot, by itself, constitute a sufficient reason for invalidating the Maryland statute, for if an adverse effect on competition were, in and of itself, enough to invalidate a state statute, the States' power to engage in economic regulation would be effectively destroyed.

Decided June 12, 1978
436 U.S. 816

Syllabus 
The United States brought an antitrust suit against petitioner, a nonprofit cooperative association the members of which are integrated producers of broiler chickens.  The complaint alleged that petitioner, which performs various marketing and purchasing functions for its members, had conspired with others, including its members, in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  Petitioner asserted that its activities with its members were sheltered from suit under  1 of the Capper-Volstead Act, which permits ""[p]ersons engaged in the production of agricultural products as farmers"" to join in cooperative associations.  The District Court concluded that the activities of petitioner's members justified their classification as farmers, and that the Capper-Volstead protection claimed was therefore available.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that petitioner's members were not all ""farmers"" in the ordinary meaning of that word as it was used at the time the Capper-Volstead Act was passed.
Held:  Because not all of petitioner's members qualify as farmers under the Capper-Volstead Act, it is not entitled to the protection from the antitrust laws afforded by that Act.  Case-Swayne Co. v. Sunkist Growers, Inc., 389 U. S. 384 (1967).  Pp.  436 U. S. 822-829.

(b) The legislative history of the Act reveals that Congress did not intend the protection of the Act to extend to the processors and packers to whom farmers sold their goods, even when the relationship was such that the processors and packers bore a part of the risks of a fluctuating agricultural market.  Pp.  436 U. S. 824-827.
(c) Those among petitioner's members who own neither a breeder flock nor a hatchery and who maintain no ""grow-out"" facility at which broiler flocks are raised and whose economic roles are essentially those of packers or processors, are not ""farmers"" within the meaning of the Capper-Volstead Act.

|436 u.s. 631|"Trans Alaska Pipeline Rate Cases 
Nos. 77-452, 77-457 and 77-602
Argued March 28, 1978
Decided June 6, 1978
436 U.S. 631

Syllabus 
Anticipating completion of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) in mid-1977, seven of its eight owners filed tariffs for the transportation of oil over TAPS with the Interstate Commerce Commission, which at that time had jurisdiction over oil pipelines.  Four protestants, respondents here, immediately asked the ICC to suspend the proposed rates, which were claimed to be prima facie unlawful for a number of reasons.  Rejecting the carriers' argument that it had no authority under  15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act (Act) (which provides that ""[w]henever there shall be filed . . . any schedule stating a new individual or joint rate, . . . the Commission . . . may . . . suspend the operation of such schedule"") to suspend TAPS's initial rates, the ICC concluded that the rates should be suspended.  It then went on to hold that the TAPS carriers could submit interim tariffs, to be effective on one day's notice, which would be allowed to go into effect during the suspension period if the rates proposed in such tariffs were lower than levels summarily fixed by the ICC and if the TAPS carriers would agree to refund any amounts collected under either the interim or initially proposed tariffs which might subsequently (after full hearing) be held to be unlawful.  The TAPS carriers petitioned for review of the ICC's order in the Court of Appeals, which affirmed all aspects of the order.
Held:
1. Pursuant to  15(7), the ICC is authorized to suspend initial tariff schedules of an interstate carrier subject to Part I of the Act, as it did here.  As against the contention that the word ""new"" as used in  15(7) was intended to refer only to increased or changed rates (i.e., rates which replace other rates previously in effect), such word must be given its literal interpretation as applying to services which have never before been offered to the public, thus embracing the initial rates in question in these cases.  Pp.  436 U. S. 642-652.
2. The ICC has power ancillary to its suspension authority under 
Page 436 U. S. 632
  15(7) to establish, without an adjudicatory hearing, maximum interim rates which it would allow to go into effect during the suspension period.  By so establishing such interim rates here, the ICC did not exceed its suspension power but, to the contrary, performed an intelligent and practical exercise of its suspension power in accord with Congress' goal in  15(7) to strike a fair balance between the needs of the public and the needs of regulated carriers.  Pp.  436 U. S. 651-654.
3. The ICC, as part of such ancillary power to establish maximum interim rates, has authority, which it properly exercised here, to condition its decision not to suspend tariffs on a requirement that the carriers refund any amounts collected under either interim or initially proposed rates that might later be determined to exceed lawful rates, notwithstanding the absence of express authority in the statute for such refunds.  United States v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 426 U. S. 500.  If the ICC's approximations of what would be lawful rates are to be used to meet the carriers' needs, such refund provisions are a necessary and ""directly related,"" id. at  426 U. S. 514, means of discharging the ICC's mandate to protect the public pending a more complete determination of the reasonableness of the rates, and thus are a ""legitimate, reasonable, and direct adjunct to the Commission's explicit statutory power to suspend rates pending investigation,"" ibid., in that they allow the ICC, in exercising its suspension power, to pursue ""a more measured course"" and to ""offe[r] an alternative tailored far more precisely to the particular circumstances"" of these cases.  Ibid.  Pp.  436 U. S. 654-657.

			"|"Trans Alaska Pipeline Rate Cases 
Nos. 77-452, 77-457 and 77-602
Argued March 28, 1978
Decided June 6, 1978
436 U.S. 631

Syllabus 
Anticipating completion of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) in mid-1977, seven of its eight owners filed tariffs for the transportation of oil over TAPS with the Interstate Commerce Commission, which at that time had jurisdiction over oil pipelines.  Four protestants, respondents here, immediately asked the ICC to suspend the proposed rates, which were claimed to be prima facie unlawful for a number of reasons.  Rejecting the carriers' argument that it had no authority under  15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act (Act) (which provides that ""[w]henever there shall be filed . . . any schedule stating a new individual or joint rate, . . . the Commission . . . may . . . suspend the operation of such schedule"") to suspend TAPS's initial rates, the ICC concluded that the rates should be suspended.  It then went on to hold that the TAPS carriers could submit interim tariffs, to be effective on one day's notice, which would be allowed to go into effect during the suspension period if the rates proposed in such tariffs were lower than levels summarily fixed by the ICC and if the TAPS carriers would agree to refund any amounts collected under either the interim or initially proposed tariffs which might subsequently (after full hearing) be held to be unlawful.  The TAPS carriers petitioned for review of the ICC's order in the Court of Appeals, which affirmed all aspects of the order.
Held:
1. Pursuant to  15(7), the ICC is authorized to suspend initial tariff schedules of an interstate carrier subject to Part I of the Act, as it did here.  As against the contention that the word ""new"" as used in  15(7) was intended to refer only to increased or changed rates (i.e., rates which replace other rates previously in effect), such word must be given its literal interpretation as applying to services which have never before been offered to the public, thus embracing the initial rates in question in these cases.  Pp.  436 U. S. 642-652.
2. The ICC has power ancillary to its suspension authority under 
Page 436 U. S. 632
  15(7) to establish, without an adjudicatory hearing, maximum interim rates which it would allow to go into effect during the suspension period.  By so establishing such interim rates here, the ICC did not exceed its suspension power but, to the contrary, performed an intelligent and practical exercise of its suspension power in accord with Congress' goal in  15(7) to strike a fair balance between the needs of the public and the needs of regulated carriers.  Pp.  436 U. S. 651-654.
3. The ICC, as part of such ancillary power to establish maximum interim rates, has authority, which it properly exercised here, to condition its decision not to suspend tariffs on a requirement that the carriers refund any amounts collected under either interim or initially proposed rates that might later be determined to exceed lawful rates, notwithstanding the absence of express authority in the statute for such refunds.  United States v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 426 U. S. 500.  If the ICC's approximations of what would be lawful rates are to be used to meet the carriers' needs, such refund provisions are a necessary and ""directly related,"" id. at  426 U. S. 514, means of discharging the ICC's mandate to protect the public pending a more complete determination of the reasonableness of the rates, and thus are a ""legitimate, reasonable, and direct adjunct to the Commission's explicit statutory power to suspend rates pending investigation,"" ibid., in that they allow the ICC, in exercising its suspension power, to pursue ""a more measured course"" and to ""offe[r] an alternative tailored far more precisely to the particular circumstances"" of these cases.  Ibid.  Pp.  436 U. S. 654-657.
557 F.2d 775, affirmed.

No. 75-1914
Argued November 2, 1977
Decided June 6, 1978
436 U.S. 658

Syllabus 
Petitioners, female employees of the Department of Social Services and the Board of Education of the city of New York, brought this class action against the Department and its Commissioner, the Board and its Chancellor, and the city of New York and its Mayor under 42 U.S.C.  19&3, which provides that every ""person"" who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State subjects, or ""causes to be subjected,"" any person to the deprivation of any federally protected rights, privileges, or immunities shall be civilly liable to the injured party.  In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities.  The gravamen of the complaint was that the Board and the Department had, as a matter of official policy, compelled pregnant employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before such leaves were required for medical reasons.  The District Court found that petitioners' constitutional rights had been violated, but held that petitioners' claims for injunctive relief were mooted by a supervening change in the official maternity leave policy.  That court further held that Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, barred recovery of backpay from the Department, the Board, and the city.  In addition, to avoid circumvention of the immunity conferred by Monroe, the District Court held that natural persons sued in their official capacities as officers of a local government also enjoy the immunity conferred on local governments by that decision.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on a similar theory.
Held:
1. In Monroe v. Pape, supra, after examining the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, now codified as 42 U.S.C.  1983, and particularly the rejection of the so-called Sherman amendment, the Court held that Congress, in 1871, doubted its constitutional authority to impose civil liability on municipalities, and therefore could not have intended to include municipal bodies within the class of ""persons"" subject to the Act.  Reexamination of this legislative history compels the conclusion that Congress, in 1871, would not have thought  1983 constitutionally infirm if it applied to local governments.  In addition, that history confirms that local governments were intended to be included 
Page 436 U. S. 659
 among the ""persons"" to which  1983 applies.  Accordingly, Monroe v. Pape is overruled insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under  1983.  Pp.  436 U. S. 664-689.
2. Local governing bodies (and local officials sued in their official capacities) can, therefore, be sued directly under  1983 for monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief in those situations where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted or promulgated by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.  In addition, local governments, like every other  1983 ""person,"" may be sued for constitutional deprivations visited pursuant to governmental ""custom"" even though such custom has not received formal approval through the government's official decisionmaking channels.  Pp.  436 U. S. 690-691.
3. On the other hand, the language and legislative history of  1983 compel the conclusion that Congress did not intend a local government to be held liable solely because it employs a tortfeasor -- in other words, a local government cannot be held liable under  1983 on a respondeat superior theory.  Pp.  436 U. S. 691-695.
4. Considerations of stare decisis do not counsel against overruling Monroe v. Pape insofar as it is inconsistent with this opinion.  Pp.  436 U. S. 695-701.
(a) Monroe v. Pape departed from prior practice insofar as it completely immunized municipalities from suit under  1983.  Moreover, since the reasoning of Monroe does not allow a distinction to be drawn between municipalities and school boards, this Court's many cases holding school boards liable in  1983 actions are inconsistent with Monroe, especially as the principle of that case was extended to suits for injunctive relief in City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507.  Pp.  436 U. S. 695-696.
(b) Similarly, extending absolute immunity to school boards would be inconsistent with several instances in which Congress has refused to immunize school boards from federal jurisdiction under  1983.  Pp.  436 U. S. 696-699.
(c) In addition, municipalities cannot have arranged their affairs on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights for an indefinite period; accordingly, municipalities have no reliance interest that would support an absolute immunity.  Pp.  436 U. S. 699-700.
(d) Finally, it appears beyond doubt from the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 that Monroe misapprehended the meaning of the Act.  Were  1983 unconstitutional as to local governments, it would have been equally unconstitutional as to state or local officers, 
Page 436 U. S. 660
 yet the 1871 Congress clearly intended  1983 to apply to such officers and all agreed that such officers could constitutionally be subjected to liability under  1983.  The Act also unquestionably was intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights.  Therefore, without a clear statement in the legislative history, which is not present, there is no justification for excluding municipalities from the ""persons"" covered by  1983.  Pp  436 U. S. 700-701.
5. Local governments sued under  1983 cannot be entitled to an absolute immunity, lest today's decision ""be drained of meaning,"" Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232,  416 U. S. 248.  P.  436 U. S. 701.
532 F.2d 259, reversed.

436 U.S. 725

Syllabus 
This litigation originated as a challenge to the validity of Illinois' Emergency Assistance to Needy Families with Children (EA) program under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act (SSA).  The Court of Appeals, reversing the District Court, first held that the program was invalid because it limited eligibility for such assistance more narrowly than  406(e)(1) of the SSA, which makes federal matching funds available under a state EA program for emergency aid to intact families with children if threatened with destitution, regardless of the cause of the need.  In a later appeal involving the validity of a proposed alternative to the EA program, the Court of Appeals held that  403(a)(5) of the SSA, which authorizes federal funding of a state EA program, is the exclusive source of federal funds for a state program of emergency assistance, and that therefore a new ""special needs"" program that Illinois proposed to operate under its Title IV-A Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, funded under  403(a)(1) of the SSA, in place of its withdrawn EA program, must, as a de facto EA program, extend aid to all persons eligible under  406(e)(1).
Held:
1. There is nothing in the policies or history of the EA statute to indicate that Illinois' proposed ""special needs"" program should not be judged solely under the requirements for an AFDC program funded under  403(a)(1) without regard to the EA requirements of  406(e) and 403(a)(5).  Pp.  436 U. S. 735-736.
2. The proposed ""special needs"" program is permissible as part of an AFDC program alone.  A plan to meet certain emergency needs of AFDC recipients -- specifically actual or threatened loss of shelter due to damage or eviction -- is not necessarily improper as an AFDC ""special needs"" program simply because it addresses a nonrecurring need that could alternatively be provided for under an EA program.  Pp.  436 U. S. 737-739.
3. Neither  402(a)(10) of the SSA, which makes AFDC, not EA, eligibility criteria mandatory, nor  406(e), which defines the permissible 
Page 436 U. S. 726
 scope of an EA program for purpose of federal funding, imposes mandatory eligibility standards on States that elect to participate in the EA program, and therefore Illinois is not precluded from receiving matching federal funds for either an EA or a ""special needs"" program simply because it limits eligibility for aid under that program more narrowly than  406(e).

|436 u.s. 748|"Agosto v. Immigration and Naturalization Service
No. 76-1410
Argued February 28, 1978
Decided June 6, 1978
436 U.S. 748

Syllabus 
The Immigration and Naturalization Service brought proceedings to deport petitioner as an alien who had unlawfully entered the United States.  At a series of hearings before an Immigration Judge, the INS presented documentary evidence that petitioner was born in Italy in 1927 of unknown parents, was placed in a foundling home there, and ultimately was adopted by an Italian couple.  Petitioner and several other witnesses testified that he was born in Ohio of an Italian mother and sent to Italy at an early age to reside with the above couple.  Rejecting petitioner's evidence, the Immigration Judge issued a deportation order, and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed.  Petitioner then petitioned the Court of Appeals for review of the Board's decision, claiming that he was entitled to a de novo hearing in District Court pursuant to  106(a)(5)(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides that, whenever a petitioner seeking review of a deportation order claims to be a United States citizen and makes a showing that his claim is not frivolous, the court of appeals, if it finds that ""a genuine issue of material fact as to the petitioner's nationality is presented,"" must transfer the proceedings to the district court for a hearing de novo of the nationality claim.  The Court of Appeals refused to transfer the case to the District Court for a de novo hearing and affirmed the deportation order, apparently holding that, in order to obtain a de novo hearing, petitioner was required by Kessler v. Strecker, 307 U. S. 22, to present ""substantial evidence"" in support of his citizenship claim and that he had failed to do so.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals' decision, to the extent that it holds de novo review to be required only where the petitioner presents substantial evidence in support of his claim to citizenship, is contrary to the plain language and clear meaning of  106(a)(5)(B), and there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that Congress intended to require de novo judicial determination of citizenship claims only when such determinations would be compelled by the Kessler ""substantial evidence"" standard.  Pp.  436 U. S. 752-757. 
Page 436 U. S. 749

(a) Although  16(a)(5)(b) was intended to satisfy any constitutional requirements relating to de novo judicial determination of citizenship claims, the statute clearly does not restrict de novo review to cases in which the ""substantial evidence"" test is met.  Rather than incorporating the language of Kessler in the statute, Congress chose to require hearings where there is ""a genuine issue of material fact,"" thus incorporating the same standard as governs summary judgment motions under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 56.  Pp.  436 U. S. 753-755.
(b) Since summary judgment principles control, it follow that a court of appeals cannot refuse to allow a de novo review of a citizenship claim if the supporting evidence would suffice to entitle a litigant to trial were such evidence presented in opposition to a motion for summary judgment.  Pp.  436 U. S. 756-757.
2. Applying the appropriate standard to the record in this case, it is apparent that the Court of Appeals erred when it failed to transfer he case to the District Court for a de novo hearing.  While the INS's documentary evidence would suffice, if uncontradicted, to establish petitioner's birth in Italy, such evidence would be refuted by petitioner's witnesses' testimony if that testimony were accepted by the trier of fact.  Hence, there is a genuine issue of material fact for the District Court on the question of petitioner's citizenship.  Pp.  436 U. S. 757-761.

2. Applying the appropriate standard to the record in this case, it is apparent that the Court of Appeals erred when it failed to transfer he case to the District Court for a de novo hearing.  While the INS's documentary evidence would suffice, if uncontradicted, to establish petitioner's birth in Italy, such evidence would be refuted by petitioner's witnesses' testimony if that testimony were accepted by the trier of fact.  Hence, there is a genuine issue of material fact for the District Court on the question of petitioner's citizenship.  Pp.  436 U. S. 757-761.

436 U.S. 499

Syllabus 
Shortly before midnight on January 21, 1970, a fire broke out in respondents' furniture store, to which the local fire department responded.  When the fire chief arrived at about 2 am., as the smoldering embers were being doused, the discovery of plastic containers of flammable liquid was reported to him, and after he had entered the building to examine the containers, he summoned a police detective to investigate possible arson.  The detective took several pictures but ceased further investigation because of the smoke and steam.  By 4 a.m., the fire had been extinguished, and the firefighters departed.  The fire chief and detective removed the containers and left.  At 8 a.m., the chief and his assistant returned for a cursory examination of the building.  About an hour later, the assistant and the detective made another examination and removed pieces of evidence.  On February 16, a member of the state police arson section took photographs at the store and made an inspection, which was followed by several other visits, at which time additional evidence and information were obtained.  Respondents were subsequently charged with conspiracy to burn real property and other offenses.  Evidence secured from the building and the testimony of the arson specialist were used at respondents' trial, which resulted in their convictions, notwithstanding their objections that no warrants or consent had been obtained for entries and inspection of the building and seizure of evidentiary items.  The State Supreme Court reversed respondents' convictions and remanded the case for a new trial, concluding that
""[once] the blaze [has been] extinguished and the firefighters have left the premises, a warrant is required to reenter and search the premises, unless there is consent or the premises have been abandoned.""
Held:
1. Official entries to investigate the cause of a fire must adhere to the warrant procedures of the Fourth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Since all the entries in this case were ""without proper consent"" and were not ""authorized by a valid search warrant,"" each one is illegal unless it falls within one of the ""certain carefully defined classes of cases"" for which warrants are not mandatory.  Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523,  387 U. S. 528-529.  Pp.  436 U. S. 504-509.
(a) There is no diminution in a person's reasonable expectation of privacy or in the protection of the Fourth Amendment simply because 
Page 436 U. S. 500
 the official conducting the search is a firefighter, rather than a policeman, or because his purpose is to ascertain the cause of a fire, rather than to look for evidence of a crime.  Searches for administrative purposes, like searches for evidence of crime, are encompassed by the Fourth Amendment.  The showing of probable cause necessary to secure a warrant may vary with the object and intrusiveness of the search, but the necessity for the warrant persists.  Pp.  436 U. S. 505-506.
(b) To secure a warrant to investigate the cause of a fire, an official must show more than the bare fact that a fire occurred.  The magistrate's duty is to assure that the proposed search will be reasonable, a determination that requires inquiry into the need for the intrusion, on the one hand, and the threat of disruption to the occupant, on the other.  Pp.  436 U. S. 506-508.
2. A burning building clearly presents an exigency of sufficient proportions to render a warrantless entry ""reasonable,"" and, once in the building to extinguish a blaze, and for a reasonable time thereafter, firefighters may seize evidence of arson that is in plain view and investigate the causes of the fire.  Thus, no Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations were committed by the firemen's entry to extinguish the blaze at respondents' store, nor by the fire chief's removal of the plastic containers.  P.  436 U. S. 509.
3. On the facts of this case, moreover, no warrant was necessary for the morning reentries of the building and seizure of evidence on January 22 after the 4 a.m. departure of the fire chief and other personnel, since these were a continuation of the first entry, which was temporarily interrupted by poor visibility.  Pp.  436 U. S. 510-511.
4. The post-January 22 entries were clearly detached from the initial exigency, and since these entries were made without warrants and without consent, they violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Evidence obtained from such entries must be excluded at respondents' retrial.  P.  436 U. S. 511.

Syllabus 
In 1925, Gulf Oil Corp. executed a lease under which it paid royalties for the exclusive right to produce and market oil and gas from certain land for 50 years.  Thereafter, the lessors sold their mineral fee interest to respondents.  In 1951, Gulf contracted to sell casinghead gas from the leased property to petitioner El Paso Natural Gas Co., an interstate pipeline.  Subsequently, Gulf obtained from the Federal Power Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity of unlimited duration authorizing the service to El Paso.  When Gulf's original lease expired in 1975, its interest as lessee in the remaining gas reserves terminated and reverted to respondents.  Just before the lease expired, respondents arranged to sell the remaining casinghead gas to an intrastate purchaser.  El Paso, in order to preserve one of its sources of supply, petitioned the FPC for a determination that the remaining gas reserves could not be diverted to the intrastate market without abandonment authorization pursuant to  7(b) of the Natural Gas Act (Act).  The FPC agreed, holding that, once gas began to flow in interstate commerce from a field subject to a certificate of unlimited duration, such flow could not be terminated unless the FPC authorized abandonment of service.  On respondents' petition for review, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Gulf, as a tenant for a term of years, could not legally dedicate that portion of the gas that respondents might own upon the lease's expiration.
Held:  The FPC acted within its statutory powers in requiring that respondents obtain permission to abandon interstate service.  The issuance of the certificate of unlimited duration created a federal obligation to serve the interstate market until abandonment authorization had been obtained, and the FPC reasonably concluded that, under the Act, the obligation to continue service attached to the 
Page 436 U. S. 520
 gas, not as a matter of contract but as a matter of law, and bound all those with dominion and power of sale over the gas, including the lessors to whom it reverted.  The service obligation imposed by the FPC survived the expiration of the private agreement that gave rise to the FPC's jurisdiction.  Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Co. v. FPC, 364 U. S. 137.  Pp.  436 U.

Syllabus 
Respondents, a student newspaper that had published articles and photographs of a clash between demonstrators and police at a hospital, and staff members, brought this action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against, among others, petitioners, law enforcement and district attorney personnel, claiming that a search pursuant to a warrant issued on a judge's finding of probable cause that the newspaper (which was not involved in the unlawful acts) possessed photographs and negatives revealing the identities of demonstrators who had assaulted police officers at the hospital had deprived respondents of their constitutional rights.  The District Court granted declaratory relief, holding that the Fourth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth forbade the issuance of a warrant to search for materials in possession of one not suspected of crime unless there is probable cause, based on facts presented in a sworn affidavit, to believe that a subpoena duces tecum would be impracticable.  Failure to honor the subpoena would not, alone, justify issuance of a warrant; it would also have to appear that the possessor of the objects sought would disregard a court order not to remove or destroy them.  The court also held that, where the innocent object of the search is a newspaper, First Amendment interests make the search constitutionally permissible
""only in the rare circumstance where there is a clear showing that (1) important materials will be destroyed or removed from the jurisdiction; and (2) a restraining order would be futile.""
The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. A State is not prevented by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments from issuing a warrant to search for evidence simply because the owner or possessor of the place to be searched is not reasonably suspected of criminal involvement.  The critical element in a reasonable search is not that the property owner is suspected of crime, but that there is reasonable cause to believe that the ""things"" to be searched for and seized are located on the property to which entry is sought.  Pp.  436 U. S. 553-560.
2. The District Court's new rule denying search warrants against third 
Page 436 U. S. 548
 parties and insisting on subpoenas would undermine law enforcement efforts, since search warrants are often used early in an investigation before all the perpetrators of a crime have been identified, and the seemingly blameless third party may be implicated.  The delay in employing a subpoena duces tecum could easily result in disappearance of the evidence.  Nor would the cause of privacy be served, since search warrants are more difficult to obtain than subpoenas.  Pp.  436 U. S. 560-563.
3. Properly administered, the preconditions for a search warrant (probable cause, specificity with respect to the place to be searched and the things to be seized, and overall reasonableness), which must be applied with particular exactitude when First Amendment interests would be endangered by the search, are adequate safeguards against the interference with the press' ability to gather, analyze, and disseminate news that respondents claim would ensue from use of warrants for third-party searches of newspaper offices.

No. 77-178

436 U.S. 584

Syllabus 
One Shaw filed an action for damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioner and others, claiming that they had deprived him of his constitutional rights.  Upon the death of Shaw before trial, respondent executor of his estate was substituted as plaintiff.  Petitioner and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that Shaw's death abated the action.  The District Court denied the motion.  The court held that the applicable survivorship rule was governed by 42 U.S.C.  1988, which provides that the jurisdiction conferred on district courts for the protection of civil rights shall be exercised conformably with federal laws so far as such laws are suitable,
""but in all cases where they . . . are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies . . . the common law, as modified and changed by the constitution and statutes of the [forum] State""
shall apply as long as they are ""not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.""  The court found the federal civil rights laws to be ""deficient in not providing for survival,"" and then held that, under Louisiana law, an action like Shaw's would survive only in favor of a spouse, children, parents, or siblings, none of whom was alive at the time of Shaw's death, but refused to apply the state law, finding it inconsistent with federal law.  In place of the state law, the court created ""a federal common law of survival in civil rights actions in favor of the personal representative of the deceased.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court should have adopted the Louisiana survivorship law, which would have caused Shaw's action to abate.  Pp.  436 U. S. 590-595.
(a) There is nothing in  1983, despite its broad sweep, to indicate that a state law causing abatement of a particular action should invariably be ignored in favor of a rule of absolute survivorship.  No claim is made that Louisiana's survivorship laws do not in general comport with the underlying policies of  1983, or that Louisiana's decision to restrict certain survivorship rights to the relations specified above is unreasonable.

No. 77-178
Argued March 21, 1978
Decided May 31, 1978
436 U.S. 584

Syllabus 
One Shaw filed an action for damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioner and others, claiming that they had deprived him of his constitutional rights.  Upon the death of Shaw before trial, respondent executor of his estate was substituted as plaintiff.  Petitioner and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that Shaw's death abated the action.  The District Court denied the motion.  The court held that the applicable survivorship rule was governed by 42 U.S.C.  1988, which provides that the jurisdiction conferred on district courts for the protection of civil rights shall be exercised conformably with federal laws so far as such laws are suitable,
""but in all cases where they . . . are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies . . . the common law, as modified and changed by the constitution and statutes of the [forum] State""
shall apply as long as they are ""not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.""  The court found the federal civil rights laws to be ""deficient in not providing for survival,"" and then held that, under Louisiana law, an action like Shaw's would survive only in favor of a spouse, children, parents, or siblings, none of whom was alive at the time of Shaw's death, but refused to apply the state law, finding it inconsistent with federal law.  In place of the state law, the court created ""a federal common law of survival in civil rights actions in favor of the personal representative of the deceased.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court should have adopted the Louisiana survivorship law, which would have caused Shaw's action to abate.  Pp.  436 U. S. 590-595.
(a) There is nothing in  1983, despite its broad sweep, to indicate that a state law causing abatement of a particular action should invariably be ignored in favor of a rule of absolute survivorship.  No claim is made that Louisiana's survivorship laws do not in general comport with the underlying policies of  1983, or that Louisiana's decision to restrict certain survivorship rights to the relations specified above is unreasonable.  Pp.  436 U. S. 590-592.
(b) The goal of compensating those injured by a deprivation of rights provides no basis for requiring compensation of one who is merely suing

The basic federal mining statute, 30 U.S.C.  22, which derives from an 1872 law, provides that ""all valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States . . . shall be free and open to exploration and purchase.""  Respondent, after purchasing a. number of mining claims, discovered water on one of them (Claim 22) and used the water to prepare for commercial sale the sand and gravel removed from the claims.  On review of unfavorable administrative decisions against respondent's claims in proceedings challenging their validity, the District Court held, inter alia, that respondent was entitled to access to Claim 22's water, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, adding sua sponte that Claim 22 itself is valid because of the water thereon.
Held:  Water is not a ""valuable mineral"" within the meaning of 30 U.S.C.  22, and hence is not a locatable mineral thereunder.  Pp.  436 U. S. 610-617.
(a) The fact that water may be a ""mineral"" in the broadest sense of that word is not sufficient for a holding that a claimant has located a ""valuable mineral deposit"" under  22; nor is the fact that water may be valuable or marketable enough to support a mining claim's validity based on the presence of water.  In order for a claim to be valid, the substance discovered must not only be a ""valuable mineral"" within the dictionary definition of those words, it must also be the type of valuable mineral that the 1872 Congress intended to make the basis of a valid claim.  Pp.  436 U. S. 610-611.
(b) The relevant statutory provisions, which reflect the view that water is not a locatable mineral under the mining statutes and that private water rights on federal lands are to be governed by state and local law and custom; the history out of which such statutes arose; the decisions of the Department of the Interior construing the statutes in line with such view; and the practical problems that would arise if two overlapping systems for acquisition of private water rights were permitted, all support the conclusion that Congress did not intend water to be locatable under the federal mining law.

Syllabus 
Appellant, a practicing lawyer in South Carolina who was also a cooperating lawyer with a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), after advising a gathering of women of their legal rights resulting from their having been sterilized as a condition of receiving public medical assistance, informed one of the women in a subsequent letter that free legal assistance was available from the ACLU.  Thereafter, the disciplinary Board of the South Carolina Supreme Court charged and determined that appellant, by sending such letter, had engaged in soliciting a client in violation of certain Disciplinary Rules of the State Supreme Court, and issued a private reprimand.  The court adopted the Board's findings and increased the sanction to a public reprimand.
Held:  South Carolina's application of its Disciplinary Rules to appellant's solicitation by letter on the ACLU's behalf violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, followed; Ohralik v. Ohio Bar Assn., post, p.  436 U. S. 447, distinguished.  Pp.  436 U. S. 421-439.
(a) Solicitation of prospective litigants by nonprofit organizations that engage in litigation as ""a form of political expression"" and ""political association"" constitutes expressive and associational conduct entitled to First Amendment protection, as to which government may regulate only ""with narrow specificity,"" Button, supra at  371 U. S. 429,  371 U. S. 431,  371 U. S. 433.  Pp.  436 U. S. 422-425.
(b) Subsequent decisions have interpreted Button as establishing the principle that ""collective activity undertaken to obtain meaningful access to the courts is a fundamental right within the protection of the First Amendment,"" United Transportation Union v. Michigan Bar, 401 U. S. 576,  401 U. S. 585, and have required that ""broad rules framed to protect the public and to preserve respect for the administration of justice"" must not work a significant impairment of ""the value of associational freedoms,"" Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn., 389 U. S. 217,  389 U. S. 222.  P.  436 U. S. 426.
(c) Appellant's activity in this case comes within the generous zone of protection reserved for associational freedoms because she engaged in solicitation by mail on behalf of a bona fide, nonprofit organization that pursues litigation as a vehicle for effective political expression and association, as well as a means of communicating useful information to the public.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that the ACLU

Pp.  436 U. S. 426-432.
(d) The Disciplinary Rules in question, which sweep broadly, rather than regulating with the degree of precision required in the context of political expression and association, have a distinct potential for dampening the kind of ""cooperative activity that would make advocacy of litigation meaningful,"" Button, supra at  371 U. S. 438, as well as for permitting discretionary enforcement against unpopular causes.  P.  436 U. S. 433.
(e) Although a showing of potential danger may suffice in the context of in-person solicitation for pecuniary gain under the decision today in Ohralik, appellant may not be disciplined unless her activity in fact involved the type of misconduct at which South Carolina's broad prohibition is said to be directed.  P.  436 U. S. 434.
(f) The record does not support appellee's contention that undue influence, overreaching, misrepresentation, invasion of privacy, conflict of interest, or lay interference actually occurred in this case.  And the State's interests in preventing the ""stirring up"" of frivolous or vexatious litigation and minimizing commercialization of the legal profession offer no further justification for the discipline administered to appellant.

Appellant, an Ohio lawyer, contacted the parents of one of the drivers injured in an automobile accident after hearing about the accident from another source, and learned that the 18-year-old daughter was hospitalized.  He then approached the daughter at the hospital and offered to represent her.  After another visit with her parents, he again visited the accident victim in her hospital room, where she signed a contingent fee agreement.  In the meantime, appellant approached the driver's 18-year-old female passenger -- who also had been injured -- at her home on the day she was released from the hospital; she agreed orally to a contingent fee arrangement.  Eventually, both young women discharged appellant as their lawyer, but he succeeded in obtaining a share of the driver's insurance recovery in settlement of his lawsuit against her for breach of contract.  As a result of complaints filed against appellant by the two young women with a bar grievance committee, appellee filed a formal complaint with the disciplinary Board of the Ohio Supreme Court.  The Board found that appellant solicited clients in violation of certain Disciplinary Rules, and rejected appellant's defense that his conduct was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Ohio Supreme Court adopted the Board's findings, and increased the Board's recommended sanction of a public reprimand to indefinite suspension.
Held:  The Bar, acting with state authorization, constitutionally may discipline a lawyer for soliciting clients in person, for pecuniary gain, under circumstances likely to pose dangers that the State has a right to prevent, and thus the application of the Disciplinary Rules in question to appellant does not offend the Constitution.

Syllabus 
At petitioner's Kentucky state robbery trial, which resulted in his conviction, the trial court instructed the jury as to the prosecutor's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt but refused, inter alia, petitioner's requested instruction on the presumption of innocence.  The robbery victim was the prosecution's only witness, and petitioner was the sole defense witness.  The prosecutor, in his opening statement, related the circumstances of petitioner's arrest and indictment.  In his closing statement, the prosecutor made observations suggesting that petitioner's status as a defendant tended to establish his guilt.  The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, rejecting petitioner's argument that he was entitled to the requested instruction as a matter of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:  On the facts, the trial court's refusal to give petitioner's requested instruction on the presumption of innocence resulted in a violation of his right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the Due Process  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Howard v. Fleming, 191 U. S. 126, distinguished.  Pp.  436 U. S. 483-490.
(a) While the legal scholar may understand that the presumption of innocence and the prosecution's burden of proof are logically similar, the ordinary citizen may draw significant additional guidance from an instruction on the presumption of innocence.  Pp.  436 U. S. 483-485.
(b) An instruction on the presumption is one way of impressing upon the jury the importance of an accused's right to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the basis of evidence introduced at trial and not on grounds of official suspicion, indictment, continued custody, or other circumstances not adduced as proof at trial.

			"|"Taylor v. Kentucky
No. 77-5549
Argued March 27, 1978
Decided May 30, 1978
436 U.S. 478

Syllabus 
At petitioner's Kentucky state robbery trial, which resulted in his conviction, the trial court instructed the jury as to the prosecutor's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt but refused, inter alia, petitioner's requested instruction on the presumption of innocence.  The robbery victim was the prosecution's only witness, and petitioner was the sole defense witness.  The prosecutor, in his opening statement, related the circumstances of petitioner's arrest and indictment.  In his closing statement, the prosecutor made observations suggesting that petitioner's status as a defendant tended to establish his guilt.  The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, rejecting petitioner's argument that he was entitled to the requested instruction as a matter of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:  On the facts, the trial court's refusal to give petitioner's requested instruction on the presumption of innocence resulted in a violation of his right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the Due Process  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Howard v. Fleming, 191 U. S. 126, distinguished.  Pp.  436 U. S. 483-490.
(a) While the legal scholar may understand that the presumption of innocence and the prosecution's burden of proof are logically similar, the ordinary citizen may draw significant additional guidance from an instruction on the presumption of innocence.  Pp.  436 U. S. 483-485.
(b) An instruction on the presumption is one way of impressing upon the jury the importance of an accused's right to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the basis of evidence introduced at trial and not on grounds of official suspicion, indictment, continued custody, or other circumstances not adduced as proof at trial.  Pp.  436 U. S. 485-486.
(c) The prosecutor's remarks during his opening and closing statements, together with the skeletal instructions of the trial court, gave rise to a genuine risk that the jury would convict petitioner on the basis of extraneous considerations, rather than on the proof adduced at the trial, a risk heightened by the fact that the trial was essentially a swearing contest between victim and accused.  Pp.  436 U. S. 486-488.
(d) That the trial court instructed as to the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt did not obviate the necessity for a presumption of innocence instruction in view of both the special purpose of such an instruction and the particular need for it in this case.  P.  436 U. S. 488.

Syllabus 
In General Atomic Co. v. Felter, 434 U. S. 12, it was held that a New Mexico state court, under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, lacked power to enjoin petitioner from filing and prosecuting in personam actions in federal court relating to the subject matter of the state suit or to interfere with petitioner's efforts to obtain arbitration in federal forums on the ground that petitioner is not entitled to arbitration or for any reason whatsoever.  Nevertheless, the New Mexico court, on remand, issued orders staying federal arbitration proceedings demanded by petitioner on the ground, inter alia, that petitioner had waived any right to arbitration because its demand therefor was untimely.
Held:  Under this Court's prior judgment, petitioner has an absolute right to present its claims to federal forums, and therefore its motion for leave to file a petition for writ of mandamus directing the New Mexico court to vacate its orders staying federal arbitration proceedings is granted because of that court's refusal or failure to comply with this Court's mandate.

No. 77-39
Argued February 28, 1978

436 U.S. 293

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of mailing obscene materials and advertising brochures for such materials in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1461 (1976 ed.), and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Since the materials were mailed prior to 1973, he was tried under the standards of Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, and Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413, rather than under those of Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15.  He claims that the trial court's instructions to the jury were improper because they included children and sensitive persons within the definition of the community by whose standards obscenity was to be judged; charged that members of deviant sexual groups could be considered in determining whether the materials appealed to prurient interest in sex; and also charged that pandering could be considered in determining whether the materials were obscene.
Held:
1. Children are not to be included as part of the ""community"" as that term relates to the ""obscene materials"" proscribed by  1461, and hence it was error to instruct the jury that children are part of the relevant community.  A jury conscientiously striving to define such community, the ""average person,"" by whose standards obscenity is to be judged, might very well reach a much lower ""average"" when children are part of the equation than it would if it restricted its consideration to the effect of allegedly obscene materials on adults.  Pp.  436 U. S. 296-298.
2. However, inclusion of ""sensitive persons"" in the charge advising the jury of whom the community consists was not error.  In the context of this case, the community includes all adults who compose it, and a jury can consider them all in determining the relevant community standards, the vice being in focusing upon the most susceptible or sensitive members, rather than in merely including them, as the trial court did, along with all others in the community.  Pp.  436 U. S. 298-301.
3. Nor was the instruction as to deviant groups improper.  Nothing prevents a court from giving an instruction on prurient appeal to such groups as part of an instruction pertaining to appeal to the average person when the evidence, as here, would support such a charge.  Pp.  436 U. S. 301-303. 
Page 436 U. S. 294

4. The pandering instruction, which permitted the jury to consider the touting descriptions in the advertising brochures, along with the materials themselves, to determine whether the materials were intended to appeal to the recipient's prurient interest in sex, i.e., whether they were ""commercial exploitation of erotica solely for the sake of their prurient appeal,"" Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U. S. 463,  383 U. S. 466, was proper in light of the evidence.

No. 76-1596
Argued February 27, 1978
Decided May 23, 1978*
436 U.S. 340

Syllabus 
After respondents in No. 76-1596, who at the time were serving state sentences in New York, were indicted on federal charges in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, that court issued writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum directing the state prison wardens to produce respondents in court.  Subsequently, following their arraignments, respondents were retained in federal custody in New York City, but after trial dates had been set, they were returned to state prison.  Respondents then moved for dismissal of their indictments on the ground that the United States, by returning them to state custody without first trying them on the federal charges, violated Art IV(e) of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (Agreement), which requires the dismissal of an indictment against a prisoner who is obtained by a receiving State (""State"" being defined by Art. II(a) to include the United States) if he is returned to his original place of imprisonment without first being tried on the indictment underlying the detainer and request by which custody of the prisoner was secured.  The District Court granted the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  In No. 77-52, after being arrested in Illinois on federal charges and being turned over to Illinois authorities for extradition to Massachusetts on unrelated state charges, respondent requested a speedy trial on the federal charges.  After he was transferred to Massachusetts, federal officials lodged a detainer against him with state prison authorities.  Subsequently, following his conviction on the state charges, respondent was indicted on the federal charges in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and was produced from Massachusetts for arraignment before that court pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum.  Thereafter, at his own request respondent was returned to the Massachusetts prison to await the federal trial, which was subsequently postponed several times.  When the Government moved to postpone the trial for the third time, respondent moved for dismissal of the indictment on the ground that he had been denied his right to a 
Page 436 U. S. 341
 speedy trial, alleging that the detainer was causing him to be denied certain privileges at the state prison.  Respondent's motion was denied, and the Government secured his presence for trial from the state prison by means of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum.  At the beginning of his trial, respondent again moved unsuccessfully for dismissal of the indictment on speedy trial grounds, and thereafter was convicted.  On appeal, he argued that his indictment should have been dismissed because, inter alia, he was not tried within 120 days of his initial arrival in the Southern District of New York in violation of Art. IV(c) of the Agreement.  The Court of Appeals agreed that Art. IV(c) had been violated and reversed and remanded for dismissal of the indictment as required by Art. V(c), holding that the writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum utilized to bring respondent to federal court was a ""written request for temporary custody"" within the meaning of Art. IV(a) of the Agreement required to be filed by the receiving State with the sending State in order to obtain temporary custody of a prisoner.
Held:
1. As indicated by the statute itself as well as its legislative history, the United States is a party to the Agreement as both a sending and a receiving State, and the fact that the United States already had the writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum as a means of obtaining prisoners at the time the Agreement was enacted does not show that Congress could not have intended to join the United States as a receiving State.  Pp.  436 U. S. 353-356.
2. A writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum issued by a federal court to state authorities, directing the production of a state prisoner for trial on federal criminal charges, is not a detainer within the meaning of the Agreement, and thus does not trigger the application of the Agreement.  Therefore, because in No. 76-1596 the Government never filed a detainer against respondents, the Agreement never became applicable so as to bind the Government to its provisions, and the indictments should not have been dismissed.  Pp.  436 U. S. 357-361.
(a) The role and functioning of the writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum to secure the presence, for purposes of trial, of defendants in federal criminal cases, including defendants then in state custody, are rooted in history and bear little resemblance to the typical detainer that activates the Agreement.  Unlike such a writ issued by a federal district court, a detainer may be lodged against a prisoner on the initiative of a prosecutor or law enforcement officer, and, rather than requiring the prisoner's immediate presence, as does such a writ, merely puts the officials of the prison in which the prisoner is incarcerated on notice that he is wanted in another jurisdiction for trial, further action being 
Page 436 U. S. 342
 necessary by the receiving State in order to obtain the prisoner.  Pp.  436 U. S. 357-359.
(b) The concerns expressed by the drafters of the Agreement and by the Congress that enacted it demonstrate that a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum was not intended to be included within the definition of ""detainer"" as used in the Agreement.  Pp.  436 U. S. 359-361.
3. The United States is bound by the Agreement when it activates its provisions by filing a detainer against a state prisoner and then obtains his custody by means of a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, and hence. in No. 77-52. the indictment was properly dismissed because the Government violated Art. IV(c) by not trying respondent within 120 days of his arrival in federal court.  Pp.  436 U. S. 361-365.
(a) A writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum constitutes a ""written request for temporary custody"" within the meaning of Art. IV(a) of the Agreement.  Because, at the point when a detainer is lodged, the policies underlying the Agreement to encourage the expeditious disposition of charges against a prisoner subject to a detainer and to provide cooperative procedures among member States to facilitate such disposition are fully implicated, there is no reason to give an unduly restrictive meaning to the term ""written request for temporary custody.""  Whether the Government presents the prison authorities in the sending State with a piece of paper labeled ""request for temporary custody"" or with a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum demanding the prisoner's presence in federal court, the United States is able to obtain temporary custody of the prisoner, and the fact that the prisoner is brought before the court pursuant to such a writ in no way reduces the need for prompt disposition of the charges underlying the detainer.  Pp.  436 U. S. 361-364.
(b) The failure of the respondent in No. 77-52 to invoke the Agreement in specific terms in his speedy trial motions before the District Court did not result in a waiver of his claim that the Government violated Art. IV(c), since the record shows that from the time he as arrested respondent persistently requested that he be given a speedy trial, such requests being sufficient to put the Government and the District Court on notice of the substance of his claim.  Pp.  436 U. S. 364-365.
No. 76-1596, 544 F.2d 588, reversed and remanded; No. 77-52, 550 F.2d 732, affirmed.

436 U.S. 371

Syllabus 
Appellants brought this action for declaratory and other relief claiming that the Montana statutory elk hunting license scheme, which imposes substantially higher (at least 7 1/2 times) license fees on nonresidents of the State than on residents, and which requires nonresidents (but not residents) to purchase a ""combination"" license in order to be able to obtain a single elk, denies nonresidents their constitutional rights guaranteed by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV,  2, and by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  A three-judge District Court denied all relief to appellants.
Held:
1. Access by nonresidents to recreational big game hunting in Montana does not fall within the category of rights protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause.  Only with respect to those ""privileges"" and ""immunities"" bearing upon the vitality of the Nation as a single entity must a State treat all citizens, resident and nonresident, equally, and here equality in access to Montana elk is not basic to the maintenance or wellbeing of the Union.  Pp.  436 U. S. 378-388.
2. The statutory scheme is an economic means not unreasonably related to the preservation of a finite resource, elk, and a substantial regulatory interest of that State, and hence does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  In view of the fact that residents contribute to the costs of maintaining the elk hunting program, the great increase in nonresident hunters in recent years, the limit in the elk supply, and the difficulties in supervising hunting practices, it cannot be said that either the license fee differentials or the required combination license for nonresidents is irrational.

No. 76-1835
Argued February 22, 1978
Decided May 22, 1978
436 U.S. 238

Syllabus 
Petitioner assumed control of three corporations at a time when a delinquency existed for unpaid federal taxes withheld from employees' wages, while the specific funds withheld but not paid had been dissipated by predecessor officers and when the corporations had no liquid assets with which to pay the overdue taxes.  During the six-month period of petitioner's control, the corporations acquired funds sufficient to pay the taxes, but petitioner used the funds to pay employees' wages, rent, suppliers and other creditors, and to meet current business expenses.  On petitioner's withdrawal from the corporations' business, he instituted a bankruptcy proceeding, in which the Internal Revenue Service filed a claim, including the delinquent back taxes, under  6672 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which imposes personal liability for taxes on
""[a]ny person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect such tax, or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof. . . .""
The Court of Appeals held that petitioner was personally liable for the unpaid taxes under  6672.  While petitioner concedes liability for the collection, accounting, and payment of taxes required to be withheld during the period of his control, he disclaims responsibility with respect to taxes withheld prior thereto, arguing that its conjunctive phrasing made  6672 inapplicable to him, since he was clearly under no duty to collect and account for taxes incurred before that period.  The Government maintains that the statutory language could be construed as describing in terms of their general responsibilities the persons potentially liable under the statute without regard to the fulfillment of all the duties with respect to specific tax dollars, and that  6672 imposed liability on petitioner as a ""responsible person"" because sums received during the period of his control were impressed with a trust in favor of the Government for the satisfaction of the overdue taxes and petitioner's willful use of such sums to pay other creditors violated the statute's ""pay over"" obligation.  Though relying primarily on  6672 for its trust theory of liability, the Government suggests as also applicable  7501, which

 provides that,
""[w]henever a person is required to collect or withhold any internal revenue tax from any other person and to pay over such tax to the United States, the amount of the tax . . . shall be held to be a special fund in trust for the United States [which] shall be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations (including penalties) as are applicable with respect to the taxes from which such fund arose.""
Held:
1. The phrase ""[a]ny person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title"" was meant to limit  6672 to persons responsible for paying over taxes that require collection (third-party taxes), and not to limit it to persons in a position to perform all three functions with respect to the specific taxes as to which the employer is delinquent.  Petitioner's construction could lead to ready evasion of responsibility under  6672, and is thus at odds with the statute's purpose of assuring payment by third parties of withheld taxes.  Pp.  436 U. S. 246-250.
2. Neither  6672 nor  7501 impresses a trust on the after-acquired funds of an employer for payment of overdue withholding taxes absent tracing of those funds to taxes collected, and petitioner therefore was not liable under  6672 for using those funds for purposes other than payment of the overdue withholding taxes.  Pp.  436 U. S. 253-259.
(a) Section 6672 was not intended to impose an absolute liability without personal fault for failure to ""pay over"" amounts that should have been collected and paid over so that petitioner could not be liable unless he failed to pay funds held in trust for the United States.  Pp.  436 U. S. 253-254.
(b) Nothing in the language or legislative history of  6672 suggests that the effect of the ""pay over"" requirement was to impress a trust on the corporations' after-acquired cash, and the history of  7501 makes clear that it was not.  Since the very reason for adding  7501 to the Code was that, under existing law, the liability of the person collecting and withholding the taxes was merely a debt,  6672, whose predecessor was enacted while the debt concept of liability prevailed, hardly could have been intended to impose a trust on after-acquired cash.  Although the trust concept of  7501 may inform the scope of the duty imposed by  6672, the language of  7501 makes clear that there must be a nexus between the funds collected and the trust created.  Pp.  436 U. S. 254-256.
(c) A construction of  7501 and 6672 as imposing a trust on all after-acquired property without regard to the interests of others in those funds would conflict with the priority rules applicable to the collection

			"|"Slodov v. United States
No. 76-1835
Argued February 22, 1978
Decided May 22, 1978
436 U.S. 238

Syllabus 
Petitioner assumed control of three corporations at a time when a delinquency existed for unpaid federal taxes withheld from employees' wages, while the specific funds withheld but not paid had been dissipated by predecessor officers and when the corporations had no liquid assets with which to pay the overdue taxes.  During the six-month period of petitioner's control, the corporations acquired funds sufficient to pay the taxes, but petitioner used the funds to pay employees' wages, rent, suppliers and other creditors, and to meet current business expenses.  On petitioner's withdrawal from the corporations' business, he instituted a bankruptcy proceeding, in which the Internal Revenue Service filed a claim, including the delinquent back taxes, under  6672 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which imposes personal liability for taxes on
""[a]ny person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect such tax, or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof. . . .""
The Court of Appeals held that petitioner was personally liable for the unpaid taxes under  6672.  While petitioner concedes liability for the collection, accounting, and payment of taxes required to be withheld during the period of his control, he disclaims responsibility with respect to taxes withheld prior thereto, arguing that its conjunctive phrasing made  6672 inapplicable to him, since he was clearly under no duty to collect and account for taxes incurred before that period.  The Government maintains that the statutory language could be construed as describing in terms of their general responsibilities the persons potentially liable under the statute without regard to the fulfillment of all the duties with respect to specific tax dollars, and that  6672 imposed liability on petitioner as a ""responsible person"" because sums received during the period of his control were impressed with a trust in favor of the Government for the satisfaction of the overdue taxes and petitioner's willful use of such sums to pay other creditors violated the statute's ""pay over"" obligation.  Though relying primarily on  6672 for its trust theory of liability, the Government suggests as also applicable  7501, which 
Page 436 U. S. 239
 provides that,
""[w]henever a person is required to collect or withhold any internal revenue tax from any other person and to pay over such tax to the United States, the amount of the tax . . . shall be held to be a special fund in trust for the United States [which] shall be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations (including penalties) as are applicable with respect to the taxes from which such fund arose.""
Held:
1. The phrase ""[a]ny person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title"" was meant to limit  6672 to persons responsible for paying over taxes that require collection (third-party taxes), and not to limit it to persons in a position to perform all three functions with respect to the specific taxes as to which the employer is delinquent.  Petitioner's construction could lead to ready evasion of responsibility under  6672, and is thus at odds with the statute's purpose of assuring payment by third parties of withheld taxes.

2. Neither  6672 nor  7501 impresses a trust on the after-acquired funds of an employer for payment of overdue withholding taxes absent tracing of those funds to taxes collected, and petitioner therefore was not liable under  6672 for using those funds for purposes other than payment of the overdue withholding taxes.  Pp.  436 U. S. 253-259.
(a) Section 6672 was not intended to impose an absolute liability without personal fault for failure to ""pay over"" amounts that should have been collected and paid over so that petitioner could not be liable unless he failed to pay funds held in trust for the United States.  Pp.  436 U. S. 253-254.
(b) Nothing in the language or legislative history of  6672 suggests that the effect of the ""pay over"" requirement was to impress a trust on the corporations' after-acquired cash, and the history of  7501 makes clear that it was not.

Syllabus 
Section 6672 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides that ""[a]ny person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over"" federal taxes who ""willfully fails"" to do so, shall be liable to a ""penalty"" equal to the amount of the taxes in question.  Section 17a(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy Act makes nondischargeable in bankruptcy ""taxes . . . which the bankrupt has collected or withheld from others . . . but has not paid over.""  Respondents, husband and wife, were adjudicated bankrupt, as was a corporation in which he was the principal officer and majority stockholder.  The bankruptcy court found respondent husband (hereafter respondent) personally liable to the Government under  6672 for his failure to pay over taxes withheld from employees of the corporation.  Subsequently, in proceedings by the Government to collect from respondent on his  6672 liability, the bankruptcy judge, rejecting respondent's contention that such liability was a ""penalty,"" and, as such, had been discharged, reasoned that, although  6672 liability was denominated a ""penalty,"" it was, in substance, a tax, and thus was nondischargeable under  17a(1), and more particularly  17a(1)(e).  The District Court affirmed.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Though recognizing respondent's  6672 liability, the court held that  17a(1)(e) was inapplicable because it was not respondent himself, but his corporation, that was obligated to collect and withhold the taxes, and because, in any event, the money involved constituted a ""penalty,"" whereas  17a(1)(e) renders only ""taxes"" nondischargeable.
Held:  Respondent's liability under  6672 is nondischargeable in bankruptcy under  17a(1)(e).  Pp.  436 U. S. 273-282.
(a) That respondent was found liable under  6672 necessarily means that he was ""required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over"" the withholding taxes, and that he willfully failed to meet one or more of these obligations.  P.  436 U. S. 274.
(b) Since the taxes in question were ""collected or withheld"" from the corporation's employees and have not been ""paid over"" to the Government, respondent's  6672 liability was imposed not for his failure to collect taxes, but for his failure to pay over taxes that he was required both to collect and to pay over, and therefore he ""collected or withheld"" the taxes within the meaning of  17a(1)(e).  P.  436 U. S. 275. 
Page 436 U. S. 269

(c) The ""penalty"" language of  6672 is not dispositive of the status of respondent's debt under  17a(1)(e), since the funds involved were unquestionably ""taxes"" at the time they were ""collected or withheld from others,"" and it is this time period that  17a(1)(e), with its modification of ""taxes"" by the phrase ""collected or withheld,"" treats as the relevant one.  That the funds due are referred to as  ""penalty"" when the Government later seeks to recover them does not alter their essential character as taxes for purposes of the Bankruptcy Act, at least where, as here, the  6672 liability is predicated on a failure to pay over, rather than a failure initially to collect, the taxes.  P.  436 U. S. 275.
(d) The legislative history of  17a(1)(e) indicates not only that Congress intended to make nondischargeable the withholding tax obligations of persons in respondent's situation, but also that it meant to ensure post-bankruptcy liability for such taxes in corporate bankruptcy situations (where a corporation's tax liabilities are rendered uncollectible because of it dissolution).  Pp.  436 U. S. 275-279.
(e) The overall policy of the Bankruptcy Act of giving a bankrupt a ""fresh start"" cannot override Congress' specific intent in  17a(1)(e) to make a liability like respondent's nondischargeable, especially since the contrary result would create an inequity between corporate officers and individual entrepreneurs.

California, and not the United States, has dominion over the submerged lands and waters within the one-mile belts surrounding Santa Barbara and Anacapa Islands within the Channel Islands National Monument.  When, by Presidential Proclamation in 1949, the Monument was enlarged to encompass areas within one nautical mile of the shorelines of these islands, the submerged lands and waters within the one-mile belts were under federal dominion as a result of this Court's decision two years earlier in United States v. California, 332 U. S. 19.  But, assuming that the Proclamation intended to reserve such submerged lands and waters, dominion over them was subsequently transferred to California by the Submerged Lands Act, whose very purpose was to undo that decision.  The  5(a) ""claim of right"" exemption from the Act's broad grant, relied on by the Government, clearly does not apply to claims based on the 1947 California decision.  The reservation for a national monument made by the 1949 Proclamation could not enhance the Government's claim to the submerged lands and waters in dispute, since the statutory authority under which such monuments are created merely authorizes land to be shifted from one federal use to another.

No. 76-682
Argued November 29, 1977
Decided May 15, 1978
436 U.S. 49

Syllabus 
Respondents, a female member of the Santa Clara Pueblo and her daughter, brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief against petitioners, the Pueblo and its Governor, alleging that a Pueblo ordinance that denies tribal membership to the children of female members who marry outside the tribe, but not to similarly situated children of men of that tribe, violates Title I of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 (ICRA), 25 U.S.C.  1301-1303, which, in relevant part, provides that ""[n]o Indian tribe in exercising powers of self-government shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws.""  25 U.S.C.  1302(8).  The ICRA's only express remedial provision, 25 U.S.C.  1303, extends the writ of habeas corpus to any person, in a federal court, ""to test the legality of his detention by order of an Indian tribe.""  The District Court held that jurisdiction was conferred by 28 U.S.C.  1343(4) and 25 U.S.C.  1302(8), apparently concluding that the substantive provisions of Title I impliedly authorized civil actions for declaratory and injunctive relief, and also that the tribe was not immune from such a suit.  Subsequently, the court found for petitioners on the merits.  The Court of Appeals, while agreeing on the jurisdictional issue, reversed on the merits.
Held:
1. Suits against the tribe under the ICRA are barred by the tribe's sovereign immunity from suit, since nothing on the face of the ICRA purports to subject tribes to the jurisdiction of federal courts in civil actions for declaratory or injunctive relief.  Pp.  436 U. S. 58-59.
2. Nor does  1302 impliedly authorize a private cause of action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Pueblo's Governor.  Congress' failure to provide remedies other than habeas corpus for enforcement of the ICRA was deliberate, as is manifest from the structure of the statutory scheme and the legislative history of Title I.  Pp.  436 U. S. 59-72.
(a) Congress was committed to the goal of tribal self-determination, as is evidenced by the provisions of Title I itself.  Section 1302 selectively incorporated and in some instances modified the safeguards of the Bill of Rights to fit the unique needs of tribal governments, and other parts of the ICRA similarly manifest a congressional purpose to protect tribal sovereignty from undue interference.  Creation of a federal cause 
Page 436 U. S. 50
 of action for the enforcement of  1302 rights would not comport with the congressional goal of protecting tribal self-government.  Pp.  436 U. S. 62-65.
(b) Tribal courts, which have repeatedly been recognized as appropriate forums for adjudicating disputes involving important interests of both Indians and non-Indians, are available to vindicate rights created by the ICRA.  Pp.  436 U. S. 65-66.
(c) After considering numerous alternatives for review of tribal criminal convictions, Congress apparently decided that review by way of habeas corpus would adequately protect the individual interests at stake while avoiding unnecessary intrusions on tribal governments.  Similarly, Congress considered and rejected proposals for federal review of alleged violations of the ICRA arising in a civil context.  It is thus clear that only the limited review mechanism of  1303 was contemplated.  Pp.  436 U. S. 66-70.
(d) By not exposing tribal officials to the full array of federal remedies available to redress actions of federal and state officials, Congress may also have considered that resolution of statutory issues under  1302, and particularly those issues likely to arise in a civil context, will frequently depend on questions of tribal tradition and custom that tribal forums may be in a better position to evaluate than federal courts.

(d) By not exposing tribal officials to the full array of federal remedies available to redress actions of federal and state officials, Congress may also have considered that resolution of statutory issues under  1302, and particularly those issues likely to arise in a civil context, will frequently depend on questions of tribal tradition and custom that tribal forums may be in a better position to evaluate than federal courts.

Syllabus 
Appellant and appellee, both then New York domiciliaries, were married in 1959 in California during appellant's three-day stopover while he was en route to overseas military duty.  After the marriage, appellee returned to New York, as did appellant following his tour of duty and a 24-hour stopover in California.  In 1961 and 1962, a son and daughter were born to them in New York, where the family resided together until March, 1972, when appellant and appellee separated.  Appellee then moved to California.  Under a separation agreement, executed by both parties in New York, the children were to remain with appellant father during the school year, but during specified vacations with appellee mother, whom appellant agreed to pay $3,000 per year in child support for the periods when the children were in her custody.  Appellee, after obtaining a divorce in Haiti, which incorporated the terms of the separation agreement, returned to California.  In December, 1973, the daughter, at her request and with her father's consent, joined her mother in California, and remained there during the school year, spending vacations with her father.  Appellee, without appellant's consent, arranged for the son to join her in California about two years later.  Appellee then brought this action against appellant in California to establish the Haitian divorce decree as a California judgment, to modify the judgment so as to award her full custody of the children, and to increase appellant's child support obligations.  Appellant, resisting the claim for increased support, appeared specially, claiming that he lacked sufficient ""minimum contacts"" with that State under International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310,  326 U. S. 316, to warrant the State's assertion of personal jurisdiction over him.  The California Supreme Court, upholding lower court determinations adverse to appellant, concluded that, where a nonresident defendant has caused an ""effect"" in the State by an act or omission outside the State, personal jurisdiction over the defendant arising from the effect may be exercised whenever ""reasonable,"" and that such exercise was ""reasonable"" here because appellant had ""purposely availed himself of the benefits and protections of California"" by sending the daughter to 
Page 436 U. S. 85
 live with her mother there, and that it was ""fair and reasonable"" for the defendant to be subject to personal jurisdiction for the support of both children.
Held:  The exercise of in personam jurisdiction by the California courts over appellant, a New York domiciliary, would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The mere act of sending a child to California to live with her mother connotes no intent to obtain nor expectancy of receiving a corresponding benefit in that State that would make fair the assertion of that State's judicial jurisdiction over appellant.  Pp.  436 U. S. 91-101.
(a) A defendant to be bound by a judgment against him must
""have certain minimum contacts with [the forum State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'""
International Shoe Co. v. Washington, supra, at  326 U. S. 316, quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457,  311 U. S. 463.  P.  436 U. S. 92.
(b) The acquiescence of appellant in his daughter's desire to live with her mother in California was not enough to confer jurisdiction over appellant in the California courts.  See Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186,  433 U. S. 216.  P.  436 U. S. 94.
(c) Exercise of in personam jurisdiction over appellant was not warranted by the financial benefit appellant derived from his daughter's presence in California for nine months of the year, since any diminution in appellant's household costs resulted not from the child's presence in California, but from her absence from appellant's home, and from appellee's failure to seek an increase in support payments in New York.  Pp.  436 U. S. 94-96.
(d) The ""effects"" rule that the California courts applied is intended to reach wrongful activity outside of the forum State causing injury within the State where such application would not be ""unreasonable,"" but here, where there is no claim that appellant visited physical injury on either property or persons in California; where the cause of action arises from appellant's personal, domestic relations; and where the controversy arises from a separation that occurred in New York, and modification is sought of a contract negotiated and signed in New York that had virtually no connection with the forum State, it is ""unreasonable"" for California to assert personal jurisdiction over appellant.  P.  436 U. S. 96-97.
(e) Since appellant remained in the State of marital domicile and did no more than acquiesce in the stated preference of his daughter to live with her mother in California, basic considerations of fairness point decisively to appellant's State of domicile as the proper forum for adjudicating this case, whatever be the merits of appellee's underlying claim.  Pp.  436 U. S. 97-98. 
Page 436 U. S. 86

(f) California's legitimate interest in ensuring the support of children residing in California without unduly disrupting the children's lives is already being served by the State's participation in the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act of 1968, which permits a California resident claiming support from a nonresident to file a petition in California and have its merits adjudicated in the State of the alleged obligor's residence, without either party's having to leave his or her own State.  New York is a signatory to a similar statute.  Those statutes appear to provide appellee with means to vindicate her claimed right to additional child support from appellant and collection of any support payments found to be owed to her by appellant.

No. 76-1607
Argued March 27-28, 1978
Decided May 15, 1978
436 U.S. 103

Syllabus 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) has the authority under  12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Act) ""summarily to suspend trading in any security . . . for a period not exceeding ten days"" if ""in its opinion the public interest and the protection of investors so require.""  Acting pursuant to  12(k) and its predecessor, the Commission issued a series of summary 10-day orders continuously suspending trading in the common stock of a certain corporation for over a year.  Respondent, who owned 13 shares of the stock and who had engaged in substantial purchases and short sales of shares of the stock, filed a petition pursuant to the Act in the Court of Appeals for a review of the orders, contending, inter alia, that the ""tacking"" of the 10-day summary suspension orders exceeded the Commission's authority under  12(k).  Because shortly after the suit was brought no suspension order remained in effect and the Commission asserted that it had no plans to issue such orders in the foreseeable future, the Commission claimed that the case was moot.  The court rejected that claim and upheld respondent's position on the merits.  In this Court, the Commission contends that the facts on the record are inadequate to allow a proper resolution of the mootness issue, and that, in any event, it has the authority to issue consecutive 10-day summary suspension orders.
Held:
1. The case is not moot, since it is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review,"" Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498,  219 U. S. 515.  Effective judicial review is precluded during the life of the orders because a series of consecutive suspension orders may last no more than 20 days.  In view of the numerous violations ascribed to the corporation involved, there is a reasonable probability that its stock will again be subjected to consecutive summary suspension orders; thus, there is a ""reasonable expectation that the same complaining party"" will be subjected to the same action again.  Cf. Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147.  Pp. 108-110.
2. The Commission does not have the authority under  12(k), based upon a single set of circumstances, to issue a series of summary orders that would suspend trading in a stock beyond the initial 10-day period, 
Page 436 U. S. 104
 even though the Commission periodically redetermines that such action is required by ""the public interest"" and for ""the protection of investors.""  Pp.  436 U. S. 110-123.
(a) The language of the statute establishes the 10-day period as the maximum time during which stock trading can be suspended for any single set of circumstances.  Pp.  436 U. S. 111-112.
(b) In view of congressional recognition in other sections of the Act that any long-term sanctions or continuation of summary restrictions must be accompanied by notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the absence of any provision in  12(k) for extending summary suspensions beyond the initial 10-day period must be taken as a clear indication that extended summary restrictions are not authorized under  12(k).  Pp.  436 U. S. 112-114.
(c) The statutory pattern leaves little doubt that  12(k) is designed to empower the Commission to prepare to deploy such other remedies as injunctive relief or a suspension or revocation of security registration, not to empower the Commission to reissue a summary order absent the discovery of a new manipulative scheme.  Pp.  436 U. S. 114-115.
(d) Those other remedies are not as unavailable as the Commission claims, as is evidenced by this very case, where the Commission during the first series of suspension orders actually sought an injunction against the corporation involved and certain of its principals, and, during the second series of suspensions, approved the filing of an injunction action against its management.  Moreover, though the Commission contends that the suspension of trading is necessary for the dissemination in the marketplace of information about manipulative schemes, the Commission is at liberty to reveal such information at the end of the 10-day period and let investors make their own judgments.  And in any event, the mere claim that a broad summary suspension power is necessary cannot persuade the Court to read  12(k) more broadly than its language and the statutory scheme reasonably permit.  Pp.  436 U. S. 115-117.
(e) Though the Commission's view that the Act authorizes successive suspension orders may be entitled to deference, that consideration cannot overcome the clear contrary indications of the statute itself, especially when the Commission has not accompanied its administrative construction with a contemporaneous well reasoned explanation of its action.  Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, 434 U. S. 275,  434 U. S. 287-288, n. 5.  Pp.  436 U. S. 117-119.

436 U.S. 128

Syllabus 
Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 requires that wiretapping or electronic surveillance ""be conducted in such a way as to minimize"" the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under that Title.  18 U.S.C.  2518(5) (1976 ed.).  Pursuant to a court wiretap authorization order requiring such minimization, Government agents intercepted for a one-month period virtually all conversations over a particular telephone suspected of being used in furtherance of a conspiracy to import and distribute narcotics.  Forty percent of the calls were clearly narcotics related, and the remaining calls were for the most part very short, such as wrong-number calls, and calls to persons unavailable to come to the phone, or were ambiguous in nature, and in a few instances were between the person to whom the telephone was registered and her mother.  After the interceptions were terminated, petitioners, among others, were indicted for various narcotics offenses.  The District Court, on petitioners' pretrial motion, ordered suppression of all the intercepted conversations and derivative evidence, on the ground that the agents had failed to comply with the wiretap order's minimization requirement, primarily because only 40% of the conversations were shown to be narcotics related.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, stating that the District Court should not have based its determination upon a general comparison of the number of narcotics-related calls with the total number of calls intercepted, but rather should have engaged in a particularized assessment of the reasonableness of the agents' attempts to minimize in light of the purpose of the wiretap and information available to the agents at the time of interception.  On remand, the District Court again ordered suppression, relying largely on the fact that the agents were aware of the minimization requirement ""but made no attempt to comply therewith.""  The Court of Appeals again reversed, holding that the District Court had yet to apply the correct standard, that the decision on the suppression motion ultimately had to be based on the reasonableness of the actual interceptions, and not on whether the agents subjectively intended to minimize their interceptions, and that suppression in this case was not 
Page 436 U. S. 129
 appropriate.  Petitioners were eventually convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The proper approach for evaluating compliance with the minimization requirement, like evaluation of all alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment, is objectively to assess the agent's or officer's actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time, without regard to his underlying intent or motive.  Pp.  436 U. S. 135-138.
2. Even if the agents fail to make good faith efforts at minimization, that is not itself a violation of the statute requiring suppression, since the use of the word ""conducted"" in  2518(5) makes it clear that the focus was to be on the agents' actions, not their motives, and since the legislative history shows that the statute was not intended to extend the scope of suppression beyond search and seizure law under the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  436 U. S. 138-139.
3. The Court of Appeals did not err in rejecting petitioners' minimization claim, but properly analyzed the reasonableness of the wiretap.  Pp.  436 U. S. 139-143.
(a) Blind reliance on the percentage of nonpertinent calls intercepted is not a sure guide to the correct answer.  While such percentages may provide assistance, there are cases, like this one, where the percentage of nonpertinent calls is relatively high and yet their interception was still reasonable.  P.  436 U. S. 140.
(b) It is also important to consider the circumstances of the wiretap, such as whether more extensive surveillance may be justified because of a suspected widespread conspiracy, or the type of use to which the wiretapped telephone is normally put.  P.  436 U. S. 140.
(c) Other factors, such as the exact point during the authorized period at which the interception was made, may be significant in a particular case.  P.  436 U. S. 141.
(d) As to most of the calls here that were not narcotics-related, such calls did not give the agents an opportunity to develop a category of innocent calls that should not have been intercepted, and hence their interception cannot be viewed as a violation of the minimization requirement.  As to the calls between the telephone registrant and her mother, it cannot be said that, even though they turned out not to be relevant to the investigation, the Court of Appeals was incorrect in concluding that the agents did not act unreasonably at the time they made these interceptions.  Pp.  436 U. S. 142-143.

Pursuant to a court wiretap authorization order requiring such minimization, Government agents intercepted for a one-month period virtually all conversations over a particular telephone suspected of being used in furtherance of a conspiracy to import and distribute narcotics.  Forty percent of the calls were clearly narcotics related, and the remaining calls were for the most part very short, such as wrong-number calls, and calls to persons unavailable to come to the phone, or were ambiguous in nature, and in a few instances were between the person to whom the telephone was registered and her mother.  After the interceptions were terminated, petitioners, among others, were indicted for various narcotics offenses.  The District Court, on petitioners' pretrial motion, ordered suppression of all the intercepted conversations and derivative evidence, on the ground that the agents had failed to comply with the wiretap order's minimization requirement, primarily because only 40% of the conversations were shown to be narcotics related.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, stating that the District Court should not have based its determination upon a general comparison of the number of narcotics-related calls with the total number of calls intercepted, but rather should have engaged in a particularized assessment of the reasonableness of the agents' attempts to minimize in light of the purpose of the wiretap and information available to the agents at the time of interception.  On remand, the District Court again ordered suppression, relying largely on the fact that the agents were aware of the minimization requirement ""but made no attempt to comply therewith.""  The Court of Appeals again reversed, holding that the District Court had yet to apply the correct standard, that the decision on the suppression motion ultimately had to be based on the reasonableness of the actual interceptions, and not on whether the agents subjectively intended to minimize their interceptions, and that suppression in this case was not 
Page 436 U. S. 129
 appropriate.  Petitioners were eventually convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The proper approach for evaluating compliance with the minimization requirement, like evaluation of all alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment, is objectively to assess the agent's or officer's actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time, without regard to his underlying intent or motive.  Pp.  436 U. S. 135-138.
2. Even if the agents fail to make good faith efforts at minimization, that is not itself a violation of the statute requiring suppression, since the use of the word ""conducted"" in  2518(5) makes it clear that the focus was to be on the agents' actions, not their motives, and since the legislative history shows that the statute was not intended to extend the scope of suppression beyond search and seizure law under the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  436 U. S. 138-139.
3. The Court of Appeals did not err in rejecting petitioners' minimization claim, but properly analyzed the reasonableness of the wiretap.  Pp.  436 U. S. 139-143.
(a) Blind reliance on the percentage of nonpertinent calls intercepted is not a sure guide to the correct answer.  While such percentages may provide assistance, there are cases, like this one, where the percentage of nonpertinent calls is relatively high and yet their interception was still reasonable.  P.  436 U. S. 140.
(b) It is also important to consider the circumstances of the wiretap, such as whether more extensive surveillance may be justified because of a suspected widespread conspiracy, or the type of use to which the wiretapped telephone is normally put.  P.  436 U. S. 140.
(c) Other factors, such as the exact point during the authorized period at which the interception was made, may be significant in a particular case.  P.  436 U. S. 141.
(d) As to most of the calls here that were not narcotics-related, such calls did not give the agents an opportunity to develop a category of innocent calls that should not have been intercepted, and hence their interception cannot be viewed as a violation of the minimization requirement.  As to the calls between the telephone registrant and her mother, it cannot be said that, even though they turned out not to be relevant to the investigation, the Court of Appeals was incorrect in concluding that the agents did not act unreasonably at the time they made these interceptions.  Pp.  436 U. S. 142-143.

436 U.S. 149

Syllabus 
After respondent Brooks and her family had been evicted from their apartment and their belongings had been stored by petitioner storage company, Brooks was threatened with sale of her belongings pursuant to New York Uniform Commercial Code  7-210 unless she paid her storage account.  She thereupon brought this class action under 42 U.S.C.  1983, seeking damages and injunctive relief and a declaration that the sale pursuant to  7-210 (which provides a procedure whereby a warehouseman conforming to the provisions of the statute may convert his lien into good title) would violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Subsequent interventions by respondent Jones as plaintiff and petitioners warehouse associations and the New York State Attorney General as defendants were permitted.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief under  1983 which provides, inter alia, that every person who under color of any state statute subjects any citizen to the deprivation of any rights secured by the Constitution and federal laws shall be liable to the injured party.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that state action might be found in the exercise by a private party of ""some power delegated to it by the State which is traditionally associated with sovereignty,"" and that,
""by enacting  7-210, New York not only delegated to the warehouseman a portion of its sovereign monopoly power over binding conflict resolution . . . , but also let him, by selling stored goods, execute a lien and thus perform a function which has traditionally been that of the sheriff.""
Held:  A warehouseman's proposed sale of goods entrusted to him for storage, as permitted by  7-210, is not ""state action,"" and since the allegations of the complaint failed to establish that any violation of respondents' Fourteenth Amendment rights was committed by either the storage company or the State of New York, 
Page 436 U. S. 150
 the District Court properly concluded that no claim for relief was stated by respondents under 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Pp.  436 U. S. 155-166.
(a) Respondents' failure to allege the participation of any public officials in the proposed sale plainly distinguishes this litigation from decisions such as North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U. S. 601; Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U. S. 67; and Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U. S. 337, which imposed procedural restrictions on creditors' remedies.  P.  436 U. S. 157.
(b) The challenged statute does not delegate to the storage company an exclusive prerogative of the sovereign.  Other remedies for the settlement of disputes between debtors and creditors (which is not traditionally a public function) remain available to the parties.  Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461; Smith v.

(c) Though respondents contend that the State authorized and encouraged the storage company's action by enacting  7-10, a State's mere acquiescence in a private action does not convert such action into that of the State.  Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U. S. 163.  Pp.  436 U. S. 164-166.

District Council of Carpenters
No. 76-750
Argued November 7, 1977
Decided May 15, 1978
436 U.S. 180

Syllabus 
Upon determining that certain carpentry work in petitioner's department store was being done by men who had not been dispatched from its hiring hall, respondent Union established picket lines on petitioner's property.  When the Union refused petitioner's demand to remove the pickets, petitioner filed suit in the California Superior Court and obtained a preliminary injunction against the continuing trespass, and the Court of Appeal affirmed.  The California Supreme Court reversed, holding that, because the picketing was both arguably protected by  7 of the National Labor Relations Act and arguably prohibited by  8, state jurisdiction was preempted under the guidelines of San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236.
Held:
1. The reasons why preemption of state jurisdiction is normally appropriate when union activity is arguably prohibited by federal law do not apply to this case, and therefore they are insufficient to preclude the State from exercising jurisdiction limited to the trespassory aspects of the Union's picketing.  Pp.  436 U. S. 190-198.
(a) The critical inquiry is not whether the State is enforcing a law relating specifically to labor relations or one of general application, but whether the controversy presented to the state court is identical to or different from that which could have been, but was not, presented to the National Labor Relations Board, for it is only in the former situation that a state court's exercise of jurisdiction necessarily involves a risk of interference with the NLRB's unfair labor practice jurisdiction that the arguably prohibited branch of the Garmon doctrine was designed to avoid.  Pp.  436 U. S. 190-197.
(b) Here the controversy that petitioner might have presented to the NLRB is not the same as the controversy presented to the state court.  Had petitioner filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB, the issue would have been whether the picketing had a recognitional or work reassignment objective, whereas, in the state court, petitioner only challenged the location of the picketing.  Accordingly, permitting the state court to adjudicate petitioner's trespass claim creates 
Page 436 U. S. 181
 no realistic risk of interference with the NLRB's primary jurisdiction to enforce the statutory prohibition against unfair labor practices.  P.  436 U. S. 198.
2. Nor does the arguably protected character of the Union's picketing provide a sufficient justification for preemption of the state court's jurisdiction over petitioner's trespass claim.  Pp.  436 U. S. 199-207.
(a) The ""primary jurisdiction"" rationale of Garmon, requiring that, when the same controversy may be presented to the state court or the NLRB, it must be presented to the NLRB, does not provide a sufficient justification for preempting state jurisdiction over arguably protected conduct when, as in this case, the party who could have presented the protection issue to the NLRB has not done so, and the other party to the dispute has no acceptable means of doing so.  Pp.  436 U. S. 202-203.
(b) While it cannot be said with certainty that, if the Union had filed an unfair labor practice charge against petitioner, the NLRB would have fixed the locus of the accommodation of petitioner's property rights and the Union's  7 rights at the unprotected end of the spectrum, it is ""arguable"" that the Union's peaceful picketing, though trespassory, was protected, but, nevertheless, permitting state courts to evaluate the merits of an argument that certain trespassory activity is protected does not create an unacceptable risk of interference with conduct that the NLRB, and a court reviewing the NLRB's decision, would find protected.

436 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Because of two separate sets of gas and electric meters in their newly purchased house, respondents, for about a year after moving in, received separate monthly bills for each set of meters from a municipal utility.  During this period, respondents' utility service was terminated five times for nonpayment of bills.  Despite respondent wife's good faith efforts to determine the cause of the ""double billing,"" she was unable to obtain a satisfactory explanation or any suggestion for further recourse from the utility's employees.  Each bill contained a ""final notice"" stating that payment was overdue and that service would be discontinued if payment was not made by a certain date, but did not apprise respondents of the availability of a procedure for discussing their dispute with designated personnel who were authorized to review disputed bills and to correct any errors.  Respondents brought a class action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages against the utility and several of its officers and employees for terminations of utility service allegedly without due process of law.  After refusing to certify the action as a class action, the District Court determined that respondents' claim of entitlement to continued 
Page 436 U. S. 2
 utility service did not implicate a ""property"" interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, and that, in any event, the utility's termination procedures comported with due process.  While affirming the District Court's refusal to certify a class action, the Court of Appeals held that the procedures accorded to respondents did not comport with due process.
Held:
1. Although respondents, as the only remaining plaintiffs, apparently no longer desire a hearing to resolve a continuing dispute over their bills, the double-billing problem having been clarified during this litigation, and do not aver that there is a present threat of termination of service, their claim for actual and punitive damages arising from the terminations of service saves their cause from the bar of mootness.  Pp.  436 U. S. 7-9.
2. Under applicable Tennessee decisional law, which draws a line between utility bills that are the subject of a bona fide dispute and those that are not, a utility may not terminate service ""at will"" but only ""for cause,"" and hence respondents assert a ""legitimate claim of entitlement"" within the protection of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  436 U. S. 9-12.
3. Petitioners deprived respondents of an interest in property without due process of law.  Pp.  436 U. S. 12-22.
(a) Notice in a case of this kind does not comport with constitutional requirements when it does not advise the customer of the availability of an administrative procedure for protesting a threatened termination of utility services as unjustified, and since no such notice was given respondents, despite ""good faith efforts"" on their part, they were not accorded due notice.  Pp.  436 U. S. 13-15.
(b) Due process requires, at a minimum, the provision of an opportunity for presenting to designated personnel empowered to rectify error a customer's complaint that he is being overcharged or charged for services not rendered, and here such a procedure was not made available to respondents.  The customer's interest in not having services terminated is self-evident, the risk of erroneous deprivation of services is not insubstantial, and the utility's interests are not incompatible with affording the notice and procedure described above.

(c) The available common law remedies of a pre-termination injunction, a post-termination suit for damages, and a post-payment action for a refund do not suffice to cure the inadequacy in petitioner utility's procedures.

No. 76-1450
Argued January 11, 1978
Decided May 1, 1978
435 U.S. 829

Syllabus 
A Virginia statute makes it a crime to divulge information regarding proceedings before a state judicial review commission that is authorized to hear complaints about judges' disability or misconduct.  For printing in its newspaper an article accurately reporting on a pending inquiry by the commission and identifying the judge whose conduct was being investigated, appellant publisher was convicted of violating the statute.  Rejecting appellant's contention that the statute violated the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The First Amendment does not permit the criminal punishment of third persons who are strangers to proceedings before such a commission for divulging or publishing truthful information regarding confidential proceedings of the commission.  Pp.  435 U. S. 837-845.
(a) A major purpose of the First Amendment is to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs, which includes discussion of the operations of the courts and judicial conduct, and the article published by appellant's newspaper served the interests of public scrutiny of such matters.  Pp.  435 U. S. 838-839.
(b) The question is not whether the confidentiality of commission proceedings serves legitimate state interests, but whether those interests are sufficient to justify encroaching on First Amendment guarantees that the imposition of criminal sanctions entails.  Injury to the reputation of judges or the institutional reputation of courts is not sufficient to justify ""repressing speech that would otherwise be free.""  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254,  376 U. S. 272-273.  Pp.  435 U. S. 839-842.
(c) The mere fact that the legislature found a clear and present danger to the orderly administration of justice justifying enactment of the challenged statute did not preclude the necessity of proof that such danger existed.  This Court has consistently rejected the argument that out-of-court comments on pending cases or grand jury investigations constituted a clear and present danger to the administration of justice.  See Bridges v. California, 314 U. S. 252; Pennekamp v. Florida, 328 U. S. 331; Craig v. Harney, 331 U. S. 367; Wood v. Georgia, 370 U. S. 375.  If the ""clear and present danger"" test could not be satisfied in those cases, a fortiori it could not be satisfied here.  Pp.  435 U. S. 842-845.

(d) Much of the risk to the orderly administration of justice can be eliminated through careful internal procedures to protect the confidentiality of commission proceedings.  P.  435 U. S. 845.

 State of MARYLANDv. Victor Dennis MARZULLONo. 77-784 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 1, 1978
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting. 
 This petition presents a question of fundamental importance to the administration of criminal justice in both the state and federal courts: what minimum standard of competence must be displayed by an attorney for a criminal defendant in order to satisfy the requirement of the Sixth Amendment that the defendant receive the effective assistance of counsel? 
 Despite the clear significance of this question, the federal courts of appeals are in disarray. Three Circuits subscribe to the view that the representation of a defendant will be deemed adequate as a matter of constitutional law unless it was ""such as to make a mockery, a sham or a farce of the trial."" United States v. Madrid Ramirez, 535 F.2d 125, 129 ( C.A. [Footnote 1] 1976); Rickenbacker v. Warden, 550 F.2d 62, 65 (C.A. [Footnote 2] 1976); Gillihan v. Rodriguez, 551 F.2d 1182, 1187 (C.A. [Footnote 10] 1977). Four Circuits require, however, that defense counsel render ""reasonably competent"" assistance. United States v. De Coster, 159 U.S.App.D.C. 326, 487 F.2d 1197, 1202 (1973); United States v. Fessel, 531 F.2d 1275, 1278 (C.A. [Footnote 5] 1976) (""reasonably effective assistance""); United States v. Easter, 539 F.2d 663, 665-666 (C.A. [Footnote 8] 1976) (""customary skills and diligence that a reasonably competent attorney would perform under similar circumstances""). The Third and Seventh Circuits have developed their own, apparently different, standards for determining whether effective assistance of counsel has been rendered to a defendant. Moore v. United States, 432 F. 2d 
Page 435 U.S. 1011 , 1012
 730, 736 (C.A. [Footnote 3] 1970) (""the exercise of the customary skill and knowledge which normally prevails at the time and place""); United States ex rel. Williams v. Twomey, 510 F.2d 635, 641 (C.A. [Footnote 7] 1975) (""assistance which meets a minimum standard of professional representation""). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is internally divided. Compare Saunders v. Eyman, 600 F.2d 728 (C.A. [Footnote 9] 1977) (""farce or a mockery of justice"") with Cooper v. Fitzharris, 551 F.2d 1162 (C.A. 9 1977) (""reasonably effective assistance""), rehearing en banc granted. 
 This case presents an appropriate occasion for addressing this issue. The District Court, following an earlier decision of the Fourth Circuit which held that ""one is deprived of effective assistance of counsel only in those extreme instances where the representation is so transparently inadequate as to make a farce of the trial,"" Root v. Cunningham, 344 F.2d 1, 3 (C.A. [Footnote 4] 1965), found that the representation which had been provided to defendant was adequate for constitutional purposes. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit expressly disavowed the test used in Root, adopted a new test requiring ""representation within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases,"" and applied this new standard to reverse the District Court. Thus, the choice of standard was determinative of the outcome of this case. Moreover, the Court of Appeals focused on a relatively discrete problem in the conduct of the trial, so that analysis of the adequacy of representation will not require inquiry into all aspects of the preparation and handling of the case. 
 The decisions of this Court recognize that the right to counsel is fundamental to a fair trial. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 68-69 (1932); and, in the last analysis, it is this Court's responsibility to determine what level of competence satisfies the constitutional imperative. It also follows that we should attempt to eliminate disparities in the minimum quality of representa- [435 U.S. 1011 , 1013]

 David S. HUFFMAN v. State of FLORIDANo. 77-6025 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 1, 1978
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, a Negro male, was convicted by an all-white jury of raping a white woman, and was sentence to life imprisonment. [Footnote 1] In a post- conviction proceeding, he moved for a new trial on the ground that racial bias in the jury selection process deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and his Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and due process. The trial court denied the motion, and the Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed without opinion, 336 So.2d 612 ( 1976). With three Justices dissenting, a four-man majority of the Florida Supreme Court dismissed petitioner's certiorari petition for lack of jurisdiction, without explanation. 350 So.2d 5 (1977). 
 There can be no dispute that Negroes were systematically excluded from petitioner's jury in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The all- white jury was selected from an all-white venire, drawn from the same master jury list which the Florida District Court of Appeal held, in Jordan v. State, 293 So.2d 131 (1974), to have been composed in a racially discriminatory fashion. As the District Court of Appeal noted in Jordan, the jury list was derived by a method rife with opportunity for racial discrimination, and reflected a substantial statistical disparity between the proportion of Negroes included and those who were eligible. [Footnote 2] The State was unable 
Page 435 U.S. 1014 , 1015
 in Jordan to rebut the prima facie case of discrimination thus demonstrated, see, e. g., Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 494-495 (1977); Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625, 630-631 (1972), and the State does not here contest that the jury which convicted petitioner was selected in an unconstitutional manner. 
 The State argues, instead, that we are foreclosed from reaching the merits of petitioner's claim by virtue of his failure to raise the issue by written motion prior to selection of the individual jurors, as required by Fla.Rule Crim.Proc. 3.290.3 But petitioner did present a timely oral motion, and, under the circumstances of this case, adherence to the requirement of a written motion would serve only ""to force resort to an arid ritual of meaningless form.""

|435 u.s. 734|"Department of Revenue of Washington v.
Association of Washington Stevedoring Companies
No. 76-1706
Argued January 16-17, 1978
Decided April 26, 1978
435 U.S. 734

Syllabus 
1. The State of Washington's business and occupation tax does not violate the Commerce Clause by taxing the interstate commerce activity of stevedoring within the State.  Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, followed; Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm'n, 302 U. S. 90, and Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., 330 U. S. 422, overruled.  Pp.  435 U. S. 743-751.
(a) A State, under appropriate conditions, may tax directly the privilege of conducting interstate business.  Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra.  P.  435 U. S. 745.
(b) When a general business tax levies only on the value of services performed within the State, the tax is properly apportioned, and multiple burdens on interstate commerce cannot occur.  Pp.  435 U. S. 746-747.
(c) All state tax burdens do not impermissibly impede interstate commerce, and the Commerce Clause balance tips against the state tax only when it unfairly burdens commerce by exacting from the interstate activity more than its just share of the cost of state government.  Pp.  435 U. S. 747-748.
(d) State taxes are valid under the Commerce Clause where they are applied to activity having a substantial nexus with the State, are fairly apportioned, do not discriminate against interstate commerce, and are fairly related to the services provided by the State; and here, the Washington tax in question meets this standard, since the stevedoring operations are entirely conducted within the State, the tax is levied solely on the value of the loading and unloading occurring in the State, the tax rate is applied to stevedoring as well as generally to businesses rendering services, and there is nothing in the record to show that the tax is not fairly related to services and protection provided by the State.  Pp.  435 U. S. 750-751.
2. Nor is the Washington business and occupation tax, as applied to stevedoring so as to reach services provided wholly within the State to imports, exports, and other goods, among the ""Imposts or Duties"" 
Page 435 U. S. 735
 prohibited by the Import-Export Clause.  Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276.  Pp.  435 U. S. 751-761.
(a) The application of the tax to stevedoring threatens none of the Import-Export Clause's policies of precluding state disruption of United States foreign policy, protecting federal revenues, and avoiding friction and trade barriers among the States.  The tax, as so applied, does not restrain the Federal Government's ability to conduct foreign policy.  Its effect on federal import revenue is merely to compensate the State for services and protection extended to the stevedoring business.  The policy against interstate friction and rivalry is vindicated, as is the Commerce Clause's similar policy, if the tax falls upon a taxpayer with reasonable nexus to the State, is properly apportioned, does not discriminate, and relates reasonably to services provided by the State.  Pp.  435 U. S. 751-755.
(b) While, as distinguished from Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, supra, where the goods taxed were no longer in transit, the activity taxed here occurs while imports and exports are in transit, nevertheless the tax does not fall on the goods themselves, but reaches only the business of loading and unloading ships, i.e., the business of transporting cargo, within the State, and hence the tax is not a prohibited ""Impost or Duty"" when it violates none of the policies of the Import-Export Clause.  Pp.  435 U. S. 755-757.
(c) While here the stevedores load and unload imports and exports, whereas, in Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, supra, the state tax in question touched only imports, nevertheless the Michelin approach of analyzing the nature of the tax to determine whether it is a prohibited ""Impost or Duty"" should apply to taxation involving exports as well as imports.  Any tax relating to exports can be tested for its conformity to the Import-Export Clause's policies of precluding state disruption of United States foreign policy and avoiding friction and trade barriers among the States, although the tax does not serve the Clause's policy of protecting federal revenues in view of the fact that the Constitution forbids federal taxation of exports.  Pp.  435 U. S. 757-758.
(d) The Import-Export Clause does not effect an absolute ban on all state taxation of imports and exports, but only on ""Imposts or Duties.""  Pp.  435 U. S. 759-760.
(e) To say that the Washington tax violates the Import-Export Clause because it taxes the imports themselves while they remain a part of commerce would be to resurrect the now rejected ""original package"" analysis, whereby goods enjoyed immunity from state taxation as long as they retained their status as imports by remaining in their import packages.  P.  435 U. S. 760.

(f) The Washington tax is not invalid under the Import-Export. Clause as constituting the imposition of a transit fee upon inland customers, since, as is the case in Commerce Clause jurisprudence, interstate friction will not chafe when commerce pays for the state services it enjoys.  Fair taxation will he assured by the prohibition on discrimination and the requirements of apportionment, nexus, and reasonable relationship between tax and benefits.  Pp.  435 U. S. 760-761.

Association of Washington Stevedoring Companies
No. 76-1706
Argued January 16-17, 1978
Decided April 26, 1978
435 U.S. 734

Syllabus 
1. The State of Washington's business and occupation tax does not violate the Commerce Clause by taxing the interstate commerce activity of stevedoring within the State.  Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, followed; Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm'n, 302 U. S. 90, and Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., 330 U. S. 422, overruled.  Pp.  435 U. S. 743-751.
(a) A State, under appropriate conditions, may tax directly the privilege of conducting interstate business.  Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra.  P.  435 U. S. 745.
(b) When a general business tax levies only on the value of services performed within the State, the tax is properly apportioned, and multiple burdens on interstate commerce cannot occur.  Pp.  435 U. S. 746-747.
(c) All state tax burdens do not impermissibly impede interstate commerce, and the Commerce Clause balance tips against the state tax only when it unfairly burdens commerce by exacting from the interstate activity more than its just share of the cost of state government.  Pp.  435 U. S. 747-748.
(d) State taxes are valid under the Commerce Clause where they are applied to activity having a substantial nexus with the State, are fairly apportioned, do not discriminate against interstate commerce, and are fairly related to the services provided by the State; and here, the Washington tax in question meets this standard, since the stevedoring operations are entirely conducted within the State, the tax is levied solely on the value of the loading and unloading occurring in the State, the tax rate is applied to stevedoring as well as generally to businesses rendering services, and there is nothing in the record to show that the tax is not fairly related to services and protection provided by the State.  Pp.  435 U. S. 750-751.
2. Nor is the Washington business and occupation tax, as applied to stevedoring so as to reach services provided wholly within the State to imports, exports, and other goods, among the ""Imposts or Duties"" 
Page 435 U. S. 735
 prohibited by the Import-Export Clause.  Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276.  Pp.  435 U. S. 751-761.
(a) The application of the tax to stevedoring threatens none of the Import-Export Clause's policies of precluding state disruption of United States foreign policy, protecting federal revenues, and avoiding friction and trade barriers among the States.  The tax, as so applied, does not restrain the Federal Government's ability to conduct foreign policy.  Its effect on federal import revenue is merely to compensate the State for services and protection extended to the stevedoring business.  The policy against interstate friction and rivalry is vindicated, as is the Commerce Clause's similar policy, if the tax falls upon a taxpayer with reasonable nexus to the State, is properly apportioned, does not discriminate, and relates reasonably to services provided by the State.  Pp.  435 U. S. 751-755.
(b) While, as distinguished from Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, supra, where the goods taxed were no longer in transit, the activity taxed here occurs while imports and exports are in transit, nevertheless the tax does not fall on the goods themselves, but reaches only the business of loading and unloading ships, i.e., the business of transporting cargo, within the State, and hence the tax is not a prohibited ""Impost or Duty"" when it violates none of the policies of the Import-Export Clause.

(d) The Import-Export Clause does not effect an absolute ban on all state taxation of imports and exports, but only on ""Imposts or Duties.""  Pp.  435 U. S. 759-760.

||"First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti
No. 76-1172
Argued November 9, 1977
Decided April 26, 1978
435 U.S. 765

Syllabus 
Appellants, national banking associations and business corporations, wanted to spend money to publicize their views opposing a referendum proposal to amend the Massachusetts Constitution to authorize the legislature to enact a graduated personal income tax.  They brought this action challenging the constitutionality of a Massachusetts criminal statute that prohibited them and other specified business corporations from making contributions or expenditures
""for the purpose of . . . influencing or affecting the vote on any question submitted to the voters, other than one materially affecting any of the property, business or assets of the corporation.""
The statute specified that
""[n]o question submitted to the voters solely concerning the taxation of the income, property or transactions of individuals shall be deemed materially to affect the property, business or assets of the corporation.""
On April 26, 1976, the case was submitted to a single Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts on an expedited basis and upon agreed facts.  Judgment was reserved, and the case was referred to the full court.  On September 22, 1976, the court directed entry of a judgment for appellee and issued its opinion upholding the constitutionality of the statute after the referendum, at which the proposal was rejected.
Held:
1. The case is not rendered moot by the fact that the 1976 referendum has been held and the proposal for a constitutional amendment defeated.  The 18-month interval between legislative authorization of placement of the proposal on the ballot and its submission to the voters was too short for appellants to obtain complete judicial review, and likely would be too short in any future challenge to the statute; and in view of the number of times that such a proposal has been submitted to the electorate, there is reasonable expectation that appellants again will be subjected to the threat of prosecution under the statute.  Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U. S. 147,  423 U. S. 149.  Pp.  435 U. S. 774-775.
2. The portion of the Massachusetts statute at issue violates the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.  Pp.  435 U. S. 775-795. 
Page 435 U. S. 766

(a) The expression proposed by appellants, namely, the expression of views on an issue of public importance, is at the heart of the First Amendment's concern.  There is no support in the First or Fourteenth Amendment, or in this Court's decisions, for the proposition that such speech loses the protection otherwise afforded it by the First Amendment simply because its source is a corporation that cannot prove, to a court's satisfaction, a material effect on its business.  Although appellee suggests that this Court's decisions generally have extended First Amendment rights only to corporations in the business of communications or which foster the self-expression of individuals, those decisions were not based on the rationale that the challenged communication materially affected the company's business.  They were based, at least in part, on the Amendment's protection of public discussion and the dissemination of information and ideas.  Similarly, commercial speech is accorded some constitutional protection not so much because it pertains to the seller's business as because it furthers the societal interest in the ""free flow of commercial information.""  Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U. S. 748,  425 U. S. 764.  Pp.  435 U. S. 776-783.
(b) The asserted justifications for the challenged statute cannot survive the exacting scrutiny required when the legislative prohibition is directed at speech itself and speech on a public issue.  This statute cannot be justified by the State's asserted interest in sustaining the active role of the individual citizen in the electoral process and preventing diminution of his confidence in government.  Even if it were permissible to silence one segment of society upon a sufficient showing of imminent danger, there has been no showing that the relative voice of corporations has been overwhelming or even significant in influencing referenda in Massachusetts, or that there has been any threat to the confidence of the citizenry in government.  And the risk of corruption perceived in this Court's decisions involving candidate elections is not present in a popular vote on a public issue.  Nor can the statute be justified on the asserted ground that it protects the rights of shareholders whose views differ from those expressed by management on behalf of the corporation.  The statute is both underinclusive and overinclusive in serving this purpose, and therefore could not be sustained even if the purpose itself were deemed compelling.  Pp.  435 U. S. 788-795.

No. 76-1767
Argued January 18, 1978
Decided April 25, 1978
435 U.S. 679

Syllabus 
The United States brought this civil antitrust suit against petitioner, the National Society of Professional Engineers, alleging that petitioner's canon of ethics prohibiting its members from submitting competitive bids for engineering services suppressed competition in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  Petitioner defended on the ground, inter alia, that, under the Rule of Reason, the canon was justified because it was adopted by members of a learned profession for the purpose of minimizing the risk that competition would produce inferior engineering work endangering the public safety.  The District Court, granting an injunction against the canon, rejected this justification, holding that the canon on its face violated  1 of the Sherman Act, thus making it unnecessary to make findings on the likelihood that competition would produce the dire consequences envisaged by petitioner.  The Court. of Appeals affirmed, although modifying the District Court's injunction in certain respects so that, as modified, it prohibits petitioner from adopting any official opinion, policy statement, or guideline stating or implying that competitive bidding is unethical.
Held:
1. On its face, the canon in question restrains trade within the meaning of  1 of the Sherman Act, and the Rule of Reason, under which the proper inquiry is whether the challenged agreement is one that promotes, or one that suppresses, competition, does not support a defense based on the assumption that competition itself is unreasonable.  Pp.  435 U. S. 686-696.
(a) The canon amounts to an agreement among competitors to refuse to discuss prices with potential customers until after negotiations have resulted in the initial selection of an engineer, and, while it is not price-fixing as such, it operates as an absolute ban on competitive bidding, applying with equal force to both complicated and simple projects and to both inexperienced and sophisticated customers.  Pp.  435 U. S. 692-693.
(b) Petitioner's affirmative defense confirms rather than refutes the anticompetitive purpose and effect of its canon, and its attempt to justify, under the Rule of Reason, the restraint on competition imposed by the canon on the basis of the potential threat that competition poses 
Page 435 U. S. 680
 to the public safety and the ethics of the engineering profession is nothing less than a frontal assault on the basic policy of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  435 U. S. 693-695.
(c) That engineers are often involved in large-scale projects significantly affecting the public safety does not justify any exception to the Sherman Act.  Pp.  435 U. S. 695-696.
(d) While ethical norms may serve to regulate and promote competition in professional services, and thus fall within the Rule of Reason, petitioner's argument here is a far cry from such a position; and, although competition may not be entirely conducive to ethical behavior, that is not a reason, cognizable under the Sherman Act, for doing away with competition.  P.  435 U. S. 696.
2. The District Court's injunction, as modified by the Court of Appeals, does not abridge First Amendment rights.  Pp.  435 U. S. 696-699.
(a) The First Amendment does not ""make it . . . impossible ever to enforce laws against agreements in restraint of trade,"" Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490,  336 U. S. 502, and, although the District Court may consider the fact that its injunction may impinge upon rights that would otherwise be constitutionally protected, those protections do not prevent it from remedying the antitrust violations.  Pp.  435 U. S. 697-698.
(b) The standard against which the injunction must be judged is whether the relief represents a reasonable method of eliminating the consequences of the illegal conduct, and the injunction meets this standard.  P.  435 U. S. 698.
(c) If petitioner wishes to adopt some other ethical guideline more closely confined to the legitimate objective of preventing deceptively low bids, it may move the District Court to modify its injunction.  Pp.  435 U. S. 698-699.

|435 u.s. 702|"City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power v. Manhart
No. 76-1810
Argued January 18, 1978
Decided April 25, 1978
435 U.S. 702

Syllabus 
This suit was filed as a class action on behalf of present or former female employees of petitioner Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, alleging that the Department's requirement that female employees make larger contributions to its pension fund than male employees violated  703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, inter alia, makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual because of such individual's sex.  The Department's pension plan was based on mortality tables and its own experience showing that female employees had greater longevity than male employees, and that the cost of a pension for the average female retiree was greater than for the average male retiree because more monthly payments had to be made to the female.  The District Court held that the contribution differential violated  703(a)(1), and ordered a refund of all excess contributions antedating an amendment to the Department's pension plan, made while this suit was pending, that eliminated sexual distinctions in the plan's contributions and benefits.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The challenged differential in the Department's former pension plan violated  703(a)(1).  Pp.  435 U. S. 707-718.

			"|"City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power v. Manhart
No. 76-1810
Argued January 18, 1978
Decided April 25, 1978
435 U.S. 702

Syllabus 
This suit was filed as a class action on behalf of present or former female employees of petitioner Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, alleging that the Department's requirement that female employees make larger contributions to its pension fund than male employees violated  703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, inter alia, makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual because of such individual's sex.  The Department's pension plan was based on mortality tables and its own experience showing that female employees had greater longevity than male employees, and that the cost of a pension for the average female retiree was greater than for the average male retiree because more monthly payments had to be made to the female.  The District Court held that the contribution differential violated  703(a)(1), and ordered a refund of all excess contributions antedating an amendment to the Department's pension plan, made while this suit was pending, that eliminated sexual distinctions in the plan's contributions and benefits.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The challenged differential in the Department's former pension plan violated  703(a)(1).  Pp.  435 U. S. 707-718.
(a) The differential was discriminatory in its ""treatment of a person in a manner which, but for that person's sex, would be different.""

 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
Page 435 U.S. 989 , 990
 In this Court, appellant presents constitutional questions identical to those in Sewell v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 982, which are set out in my dissent there. See id., at 982 . For the reasons stated in that dissent, I would set this case for argument on the scienter and void-for-vagueness issues.* 

 Mr. Justice STEWART, dissenting. 
 This case is in all relevant respects identical to Sewell v. Georgia, ante. For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in that case, I would reverse the judgment of the Georgia Court of Appeals, or, alternatively, note probable jurisdiction and hear argument on the scienter issue. 
[Footnote *] A review of the record in this case shows that, as in Sewell v. Georgia, ante, at 982, 98 S.Ct. at 1636 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), the scienter requirement does not save Ga.Code 26-2101(c) from vagueness. Although a police officer testified here that, in the course of viewing adult movies, he had seen some of the devices used to stimulate human genitals and, in addition, that he had seen a catalog which marketed the devices for such a use, there was no showing that appellant had seen or should have seen the indicated movies nor that appellant was familiar with any such catalog. Indeed, the trial judge refused to admit the catalog into evidence because it had no relation to the constructive scienter issue. Thus the conclusion that the seized devices were ""useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs,"" here as in Sewell, was reached solely from an inference to be drawn from the shape of the devices and the arresting officers' guesses and assumptions.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I dissent from the denial of certiorari. Petitioner was 16 years old at the time of his arrest in connection with three homicides. [Footnote 1] After being held for an hour and a half in a police car at the cemetery where the bodies were found, petitioner was taken to the police station, where his shoes, trousers, and shirt were removed 2 and he was given a blanket and placed in a cell. An hour or two later, after being advised 
Page 435 U.S. 1000 , 1001
 of his constitutional rights to remain silent and consult with an attorney, petitioner asked to speak to his father, who had come to the police station when he learned of his son's arrest; 3 this request was ignored by the police. Petitioner then confessed to the crimes, and later that evening repeated the confession to a prosecuting attorney, without having consulted with the parent whom he had asked to see or with any other friendly adult. The confession was introduced over objection at petitioner's trial, which led to his conviction for murder and to sentences of 75 to 225 years. [Footnote 4] 

 The Illinois courts considered and rejected petitioner's argument, made initially in support of his motion to suppress the confession, that "" the request of a juvenile defendant to see a parent is tantamount to an adult's request for an attorney"" and should terminate police interrogation . 49 Ill.App.3d 304, 308, 7 Ill.Dec. 145, 148, 364 N.E.2d 306, 309 (1977). 5 It is this argument that petitioner presses here. 
 I have recently expressed my view that this Court should decide whether a juvenile's waiver of rights is valid in the absence of "" competent advice from an adult who does not have significant conflicts of interest."" Little v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 957, at 1591, 55 L. Ed.2d 809 (1978) (opinion dissenting from denial of certiorari).

No. 76-1427
Argued December 5, 1977
Decided April 19, 1978
435 U.S. 618

Syllabus 
Appellee Paty, a candidate for delegate to a Tennessee constitutional convention, sued in the State Chancery Court for a declaratory judgment that appellant, an opponent who was a Baptist minister, was disqualified from serving as delegate by a Tennessee statutory provision establishing the qualifications of constitutional convention delegates to be the same as those for membership in the State House of Representatives, thus invoking a Tennessee constitutional provision barring ""[m]inister[s] of the Gospel, or priest[s] of any denomination whatever.""  That court held that the statutory provision violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Tennessee Supreme Court reversed, holding that the clergy disqualification imposed no burden on ""religious belief,"" and restricted
""religious action . . . [only] in the law making process of government -- where religious action is absolutely prohibited by the establishment clause. . . .""
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  435 U. S. 625-629;  435 U. S. 629-642;  435 U. S. 642-643;  435 U. S. 643-646.
547 S.W.2d 897, reversed and remanded.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE POWELL, MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded:
1. The Tennessee disqualification is directed primarily not at religious belief, but at the status, acts, and conduct of the clergy.  Therefore, the Free Exercise Clause's absolute prohibition against infringements on the ""freedom to believe"" is inapposite here.  Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488 (which invalidated a state requirement that an appointee to public office declare his belief in the existence of God), distinguished.  Pp.  435 U. S. 626-627.
2. Nevertheless, the challenged provision violates appellant's First Amendment right to the free exercise of his religion made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, because it conditions his right to the free exercise of his religion on the surrender of his right to seek office.  Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398,  374 U. S. 406.  Though justification is asserted under the Establishment Clause for the statutory restriction on the ground that, if elected to public office members of the clergy will necessarily promote the interests of one sect or thwart those of another contrary to the anti-establishment principle of neutrality, Tennessee has failed to demonstrate that its views of the dangers of 
Page 435 U. S. 619
 clergy participation in the political process have not lost whatever validity they may once have enjoyed.  Accordingly, there is no need to inquire whether the State's legislative goal is permissible.  Pp.  435 U. S. 626;  435 U. S. 627-629.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded:
1. The Free Exercise Clause is violated by the challenged provision.  Pp.  435 U. S. 630-635.
(a) Freedom of belief protected by that Clause embraces freedom to profess or practice that belief, even including doing so for a livelihood.  The Tennessee disqualification establishes as a condition of office the willingness to eschew certain protected religious practices.  The provision therefore establishes a religious classification governing eligibility for office that is absolutely prohibited.  Torcaso v. Watkins, supra.  Pp.  435 U. S. 631-633.
(b) The fact that the law does not directly prohibit religious exercise, but merely conditions eligibility for office on its abandonment, does not alter the protection afforded by the Free Exercise Clause.  ""Governmental imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine . . . ,"" Sherbert v. Verner, supra at  374 U. S. 404, and Tennessee's disqualification provision therefore imposed an unconstitutional penalty on appellant's free exercise.  Moreover,
""[t]he fact . . . that a person is not compelled to hold public office cannot possibly be an excuse for barring him from office by state-imposed criteria forbidden by the Constitution.""
Torcaso v. Watkins, supra, at  367 U. S. 495-496.  Pp.  435 U. S. 633-634.
2. The Tennessee disqualification also violates the Establishment Clause.  Government generally may not use religion as a basis of classification for the imposition of duties, penalties, privileges, or benefits.  Specifically, government may not fence out from political participation people such as ministers whom it regards as overinvolved in religion.  The disqualification provision employed by Tennessee here establishes a religious classification that has the primary effect of inhibiting religion.  Pp.  435 U. S. 636-642.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART concluded that Torcaso v. Watkins, supra, controls this case.  Except for the fact that Tennessee bases its disqualification, not on a person's statement of belief, but on his decision to pursue a religious vocation as directed by his belief, the situation in Torcaso is indistinguishable from the one here.  Pp.  435 U. S. 642-643.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE concluded that the Tennessee disqualification, while not interfering with appellant's right to exercise his religion as he desires, denies him equal protection.  Though that disqualification is based on the State's asserted interest in maintaining the required separation 
Page 435 U. S. 620
 of church and state, it is not reasonably necessary for that objective, which all States except Tennessee have been able to realize without burdening ministers' rights to candidacy.  In addition, the statute is both underinclusive and overinclusive.  Pp.  435 U. S. 643-646.
BURGER, C.J., announced the Court's judgment, and delivered an opinion, in which POWELL, REHNQUIST, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.  BRENNAN, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which MARSHALL, J., joined, post, p.  435 U. S. 629.  STEWART, J., post, p.  435 U. S. 642, and WHITE, J., post, p.  435 U. S. 643, filed opinions concurring in the judgment.  BLACKMUN, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

""religious action . . . [only] in the law making process of government -- where religious action is absolutely prohibited by the establishment clause. . . .""
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  435 U. S. 625-629;  435 U. S. 629-642;  435 U. S. 642-643;  435 U. S. 643-646.
547 S.W.2d 897, reversed and remanded.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by MR. JUSTICE POWELL, MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded:
1. The Tennessee disqualification is directed primarily not at religious belief, but at the status, acts, and conduct of the clergy.  Therefore, the Free Exercise Clause's absolute prohibition against infringements on the ""freedom to believe"" is inapposite here.  Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488 (which invalidated a state requirement that an appointee to public office declare his belief in the existence of God), distinguished.  Pp.  435 U. S. 626-627.
2. Nevertheless, the challenged provision violates appellant's First Amendment right to the free exercise of his religion made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, because it conditions his right to the free exercise of his religion on the surrender of his right to seek office.  Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398,  374 U. S. 406.  Though justification is asserted under the Establishment Clause for the statutory restriction on the ground that, if elected to public office members of the clergy will necessarily promote the interests of one sect or thwart those of another contrary to the anti-establishment principle of neutrality, Tennessee has failed to demonstrate that its views of the dangers of 
Page 435 U. S. 619
 clergy participation in the political process have not lost whatever validity they may once have enjoyed.  Accordingly, there is no need to inquire whether the State's legislative goal is permissible.  Pp.  435 U. S. 626;  435 U. S. 627-629.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded:
1. The Free Exercise Clause is violated by the challenged provision.  Pp.  435 U. S. 630-635.
(a) Freedom of belief protected by that Clause embraces freedom to profess or practice that belief, even including doing so for a livelihood.  The Tennessee disqualification establishes as a condition of office the willingness to eschew certain protected religious practices.  The provision therefore establishes a religious classification governing eligibility for office that is absolutely prohibited.  Torcaso v. Watkins, supra.  Pp.  435 U. S. 631-633.
(b) The fact that the law does not directly prohibit religious exercise, but merely conditions eligibility for office on its abandonment, does not alter the protection afforded by the Free Exercise Clause.  ""Governmental imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine . . . ,"" Sherbert v. Verner, supra at  374 U. S. 404, and Tennessee's disqualification provision therefore imposed an unconstitutional penalty on appellant's free exercise.  Moreover,
""[t]he fact . . . that a person is not compelled to hold public office cannot possibly be an excuse for barring him from office by state-imposed criteria forbidden by the Constitution.""
Torcaso v. Watkins, supra, at  367 U. S. 495-496.  Pp.  435 U. S. 633-634.
2. The Tennessee disqualification also violates the Establishment Clause.  Government generally may not use religion as a basis of classification for the imposition of duties, penalties, privileges, or benefits.  Specifically, government may not fence out from political participation people such as ministers whom it regards as overinvolved in religion.  The disqualification provision employed by Tennessee here establishes a religious classification that has the primary effect of inhibiting religion.  Pp.  435 U. S. 636-642.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART concluded that Torcaso v. Watkins, supra, controls this case.  Except for the fact that Tennessee bases its disqualification, not on a person's statement of belief, but on his decision to pursue a religious vocation as directed by his belief, the situation in Torcaso is indistinguishable from the one here.  Pp.  435 U. S. 642-643.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE concluded that the Tennessee disqualification, while not interfering with appellant's right to exercise his religion as he desires, denies him equal protection.  Though that disqualification is based on the State's asserted interest in maintaining the required separation 
Page 435 U. S. 620
 of church and state, it is not reasonably necessary for that objective, which all States except Tennessee have been able to realize without burdening ministers' rights to candidacy.  In addition, the statute is both underinclusive and overinclusive.  Pp.  435 U. S. 643-646.

BRENNAN, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which MARSHALL, J., joined, post, p.  435 U. S. 629.  STEWART, J., post, p.  435 U. S. 642, and WHITE, J., post, p.  435 U.

Syllabus 
It is the policy of the University of Maryland to grant ""in-state"" status for admission, tuition, and charge-differential purposes only to students who are domiciled in Maryland or, if a student is financially dependent on his parents, whose parents are domiciled in Maryland.  In addition, the University may in some cases deny in-state status to students who do not pay the full spectrum of Maryland state taxes.  Pursuant to this policy, the University refused to grant in-state status to respondent nonimmigrant alien students, each of whom was dependent on a parent who held a ""G-4 visa"" (a nonimmigrant visa granted to officers or employees of international treaty organizations and members of their immediate families) and each of whom was named in that visa, on the ground that the holder of a G-4 visa cannot acquire Maryland domicile because such a visa holder is incapable of demonstrating an essential element of domicile -- the intent to live permanently or indefinitely in Maryland.  After unsuccessful appeals through University channels, respondents brought a class action in the Federal District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief against the University and its President (petitioner), alleging that the University's refusal to grant them in-state status violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court granted relief, but limited it to a declaration and injunction restraining the President from denying respondents the opportunity to establish in-state status solely because of an ""irrebuttable presumption of non-domicile.""  The court held that such an irrebuttable presumption violated the Due Process Clause, finding that reasonable alternative procedures were available to make the crucial domicile determination and rejecting the University's claim that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and Maryland common law precluded G-4 aliens from forming the intent necessary to acquire domicile.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Although the University may consider factors other than domicile in granting in-state status, the record shows that respondents were denied such status because of the University's determination that G-4 
Page 435 U. S. 648
 aliens could not form the intent needed to acquire Maryland domicile.  Therefore, this case is controlled by principles announced in Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U. S. 441, as limited by Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749,  422 U. S. 771, to those situations in which a State
""purport[s] to be concerned with [domicile, but] at the same time den[ies] to one seeking to meet its test of [domicile] the opportunity to show factors clearly bearing on that issue.""
Pp.  435 U. S. 658-660.
2. Before considering whether Vlandis, supra, should be overruled or further limited, proper concern for stare decisis as well as the Court's longstanding policy of avoiding unnecessary constitutional decisions requires that the necessity of a constitutional decision be shown, and no such showing has been made here, because a potentially dispositive issue, the determination whether the University's irrebuttable presumption is universally true, turns on federal statutory law and state common law as to which there are no controlling precedents.  Pp.  435 U. S. 660-662.
3. Under federal law, G-4 aliens have the legal capacity to change domicile.  Pp.  435 U. S. 663-668.
(a) In the Immigration and Nationality Act, which was intended to be a comprehensive and complete code governing all aspects of admission of aliens to the United States, Congress expressly required that an immigrant seeking admission under certain nonimmigrant classifications maintain a permanent residence abroad which he has no intention of abandoning.  Congress did not impose this restriction on G-4 aliens, and, given the comprehensive nature of the Act, the conclusion is inescapable that Congress' failure to impose such restrictions was deliberate and manifests a willingness to allow G-4 aliens to adopt the United States as their domicile (a willingness confirmed by Immigration and Naturalization Service regulations).  But whether such an adoption would confer domicile in a State is a question to be decided by the State.  Pp.  435 U. S. 663-666.
(b) Under present federal law, therefore, a G-4 alien will not violate the Act, INS regulations, or the terms of his visa if he develops a subjective intent to st-ay in the United States indefinitely.  Moreover, although a G-4 visa lapses on termination of employment with an international treaty organization, a G-4 alien would not necessarily have to leave the United States.  There being no indication that the named respondents are subject to any adverse factor, such as fraudulent entry into, or commission of crime in, the United States, and given each named respondent's alleged length of residence (ranging from 5 to 15 years) in the country, it would appear that the status of each of them 
Page 435 U. S. 649
 could be adjusted to that of a permanent resident without difficulty.  Pp.  435 U. S. 666-668.
4. Because of the Court's conclusions with respect to federal law, the question whether G-4 aliens can become domiciliaries of Maryland is potentially dispositive of this case and, since such question is purely a matter of state law on which there is no controlling precedent, the question is certified to the Maryland Court of Appeals for determination.  Pp.  435 U. S. 668-669.

Syllabus 
A state bank, which was a member of the Federal Reserve System, upon realizing that it was not feasible, because of various state and federal regulations, for it to finance by conventional mortgage and other financing a building under construction for its headquarters and principal banking facility, entered into sale and lease-back agreements by which petitioner took title to the building and leased it back to the hank for long-term use, petitioner obtaining both a construction loan and permanent mortgage financing.  The bank is obligated to pay rent equal to the principal and interest payments on petitioner's mortgage, and has an option to repurchase the building at various times at prices equal to the then unpaid balance of petitioner's mortgage and initial $500,000 investment.  On its federal income tax return for the year in which the building was completed and the bank took possession, petitioner accrued rent from the bank and claimed as deductions depreciation on the building, interest on its construction loan and mortgage, and other expenses related to the sale and lease-back transaction.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deductions on the ground that petitioner was not the owner of the building for tax purposes, but that the sale and lease-back arrangement was a financing transaction in which petitioner loaned the bank $500,000 and acted as a conduit for the transmission of principal and interest to petitioner's mortgagee.  This resulted in a deficiency in petitioner's income tax, which it paid.  After its claim for a refund was denied, it brought suit in the District Court to recover the amount so paid.  That court held that the claimed deductions were allowable, but the Court of Appeals reversed, agreeing with the Commissioner.
Held:  Petitioner is entitled to the claimed deductions.  Pp.  435 U. S. 572-584.
(a) Although the rent agreed to be paid by the bank equaled the amounts due from the petitioner to its mortgagee, the sale and lease-back transaction is not a simple sham by which petitioner was but a conduit used to forward the mortgage payments made under the guise of rent paid by the bank to petitioner, on to the mortgagee, but the construction loan and mortgage note obligations on which petitioner paid interest are its obligations alone, and, accordingly, it is entitled to claim deductions

(b) While it is clear that none of the parties to the sale and lease-back agreements is the owner of the building in any simple sense, it is equally clear that petitioner is the one whose capital was invested in the building, and is therefore the party entitled to claim depreciation for the consumption of that capital under  167 of the Code.  P.  435 U. S. 581.
(c) Where, as here, there is a genuine multiple-party transaction with economic substance that is compelled or encouraged by business or regulatory realities, that is imbued with tax-independent considerations, and that is not shaped solely by tax-avoidance features to which meaningless labels are attached, the Government should honor the allocation of rights and duties effectuated by the parties; so long as the lessor retains significant and genuine attributes of the traditional lessor status, the form of the transaction adopted by the parties governs for tax purposes.

Syllabus 
During the criminal trial of several of petitioner ex-President's former advisers on charges, inter alia, of conspiring to obstruct justice in connection with the so-called Watergate investigation, some 22 hours of tape recordings made of conversations in petitioner's offices in the White House and Executive Office Building were played to the jury and the public in the courtroom, and the reels of the tapes were admitted into evidence.  The District Court furnished the jurors, reporters, and members of the public in attendance with transcripts, which were not admitted as evidence but were widely reprinted in the press.  At the close of the trial, in which four of the defendants were convicted, and after an earlier unsuccessful attempt over petitioner's objections to obtain court permission to copy, broadcast, and sell to the public portions of the tapes, respondent broadcasters petitioned for immediate access to the tapes.  The District Court denied the petitions on the grounds that, since the convicted defendants had filed notices of appeal, their rights would be prejudiced if respondents' petitions were granted, and that, since the transcripts had apprised the public of the tapes' contents, the public's ""right to know"" did not overcome the need to safeguard the defendants' rights on appeal.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the mere possibility of prejudice to defendants' rights did not outweigh the public's right of access, that the common law right of access to judicial records required the District Court to release the tapes in its custody, and that therefore the District Court abused its discretion in refusing immediate access.
Held:
1. Considering all the circumstances, the common law right of access to judicial records does not authorize release of the tapes in question from the District Court's custody.  Pp.  435 U. S. 597-608.
(a) The common law right to inspect and copy judicial records is not absolute, but the decision whether to permit access is best left to the sound discretion of the trial court, a discretion to be exercised in light of the relevant facts and circumstances of the particular case.  Pp.  435 U. S. 597-599.
(b) Because of the congressionally prescribed avenue of public access to the tapes provided by the Presidential Recordings and Materials 
Page 435 U. S. 590
 Preservation Act, whose existence is a decisive element in the proper exercise of discretion with respect to release of the tapes, it is not necessary to weigh the parties' competing arguments for and against release as though the District Court were the only potential source of information regarding these historical materials, and the presence of an alternative means of public access tips the scales in favor of denying release.  Pp.  435 U. S. 599-608.
2. The release of the tapes is not required by the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press.  The question here is not whether the press must be permitted access to public information to which the public generally has access, but whether the tapes, to which the public has never had physical access, must be made available for copying.  There is in this case no question of a truncated flow of information to the public, as the contents of the tapes were given wide publicity by all elements of the media, Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, distinguished, and under the First Amendment, the press has no right to information about a trial superior to that of the general public.  Pp.  435 U. S. 608-610.
3. Nor is release of the tapes required by the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a public trial.  While public understanding of the highly publicized trial may remain incomplete in the absence of the ability to listen to the tapes and form judgments as to their meaning, the same could be said of a live witness' testimony, yet there is no constitutional right to have such testimony recorded and broadcast.  The guarantee of a public trial confers no special benefit on the press, nor does it require that the trial, or any part of it, be broadcast live or on tape to the public, but such guarantee is satisfied by the opportunity of the public and the press to attend the trial and to report what they have observed.  P.  435 U. S. 610.

Held:
1. Considering all the circumstances, the common law right of access to judicial records does not authorize release of the tapes in question from the District Court's custody.  Pp.  435 U. S. 597-608.
(a) The common law right to inspect and copy judicial records is not absolute, but the decision whether to permit access is best left to the sound discretion of the trial court, a discretion to be exercised in light of the relevant facts and circumstances of the particular case.  Pp.  435 U. S. 597-599.
(b) Because of the congressionally prescribed avenue of public access to the tapes provided by the Presidential Recordings and Materials 
Page 435 U. S. 590
 Preservation Act, whose existence is a decisive element in the proper exercise of discretion with respect to release of the tapes, it is not necessary to weigh the parties' competing arguments for and against release as though the District Court were the only potential source of information regarding these historical materials, and the presence of an alternative means of public access tips the scales in favor of denying release.  Pp.  435 U. S. 599-608.
2. The release of the tapes is not required by the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press.  The question here is not whether the press must be permitted access to public information to which the public generally has access, but whether the tapes, to which the public has never had physical access, must be made available for copying.  There is in this case no question of a truncated flow of information to the public, as the contents of the tapes were given wide publicity by all elements of the media, Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, distinguished, and under the First Amendment, the press has no right to information about a trial superior to that of the general public.  Pp.  435 U. S. 608-610.
3. Nor is release of the tapes required by the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a public trial.  While public understanding of the highly publicized trial may remain incomplete in the absence of the ability to listen to the tapes and form judgments as to their meaning, the same could be said of a live witness' testimony, yet there is no constitutional right to have such testimony recorded and broadcast.  The guarantee of a public trial confers no special benefit on the press, nor does it require that the trial, or any part of it, be broadcast live or on tape to the public, but such guarantee is satisfied by the opportunity of the public and the press to attend the trial and to report what they have observed.  P.  435 U. S. 610.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 17, 1978
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 The Court's action today lets stand the ruling by a panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals that attorneys' fees are awardable to intervenors in union election challenges processed under Title IV of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), 29 U.S.C. 481 et seq. (1970). The issues presented in this case are of serious importance to the proper enforcement of the LMRDA, and also to the prosecution generally of private claims that benefit a broad class of persons. 
 The decision below rested on two necessary foundations: that the scheme of Title IV of the LMRDA did not foreclose the awarding of attorneys' fees to intervenors, and that the ""common benefit"" exception to the American rule against awarding attorneys' fees could fairly be applied to a case of intervention under Title IV such as occurred here. 
 In Trbovich v. United Mine Workers, 404 U.S. 528, 30 L. Ed.2d 686 (1972), this Court held that intervention by an individual union member whose initial complaint commenced the challenge to the election was not inimical to the LMRDA. Title IV anticipates that objections to the conduct of union elections be initiated by union members filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor after exhausting union remedies. Thereupon, however, it is the exclusive province of the Secretary to commence a civil action in federal district court. 29 U.S.C. 482(b). Trbovich held that the union member who initiated the challenge might still intervene in the federal suit, ""so long as that intervention is limited to the claims of illegality presented 
Page 435 U.S. 977 , 978
 by the Secretary's complaint."" Trbovich, supra, 404 U.S., at 537. This conclusion represented a very careful balance between Title IV's commitment of enforcement authority to the Secretary's sole discre ion, and a recognition that the union member who originally raised the complaint might wish to see his claims pressed in some manner different from the Secretary. 
 The opinion below threatens to upset that delicate compromise. Intervention by union members in support of the Secretary's grounds of complaint was upheld in Trbovich only because it would make the union liable ""to relatively little additional burden,"" and would ""not subject the union to burdensome multiple litigation, nor will it compel the union to respond to a new and potentially groundless suit."" Trbovich, supra, 404 U.S., at 536. Once attorneys' fees are assessable against a union on behalf of intervenors, however, the union has indeed become liable to an ""additional burden"" that could be quite costly. And the adjudication of whether an intervenor has contributed significantly to the common benefit of all union members could well involve the ""burdensome multiple litigation"" that the restrictions on intervention imposed by Trbovich were intended to avoid. 
 Although not controlling, the Secretary of Labor's views should also be considered in any matter concerning the proper enforcement of the Act he is to administer. It is significant, therefore, that the Secretary has in this case broken his silence on the attorneys' fees question for the first time. It is the position of the Secretary that the awarding of attorneys' fees to intervenors ""significantly impedes the enforcement of Title IV."" *

435 U.S. 475

Syllabus 
Petitioners, three codefendants at a state criminal trial in Arkansas, made timely motions, both a few weeks before the trial and before the jury was empaneled, for appointment of separate counsel, based on their appointed counsel's representations that, because of confidential information received from the codefendants, he was confronted with the risk of representing conflicting interests and could not, therefore, provide effective assistance for each client.  The trial court denied these motions, and petitioners were subsequently convicted.  The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that the record showed no actual conflict of interests or prejudice to petitioners.
Held:
1. The trial judge's failure either to appoint separate counsel or to take adequate steps to ascertain whether the risk of a conflict of interests was too remote to warrant separate counsel, in the face of the representations made by counsel before trial and again before the jury was empaneled, deprived petitioners of the guarantee of ""assistance of counsel"" under the Sixth Amendment.  Pp.  435 U. S. 481-487.
(a) The trial court has a duty to refrain from embarrassing counsel for multiple defendants by insisting or even suggesting that counsel undertake to concurrently represent interests that might conflict, when the possibility of inconsistent interests is brought home to the court by formal objections, motions, and counsel's representations.  Glasser v. United States, 315 U. S. 60,  315 U. S. 76.  Pp.  435 U. S. 484-485.
(b) An attorney's request for the appointment of separate counsel, based on his representations regarding a conflict of interests, should be granted, considering that he is in the best position professionally and ethically to determine when such a conflict exists or will probably develop at trial; that he has the obligation, upon discovering such a conflict, to advise the court at once; and, that as an officer of the court, he so advises the court virtually under oath.  Pp.  435 U. S. 485-486.
(c) Here no prospect of dilatory practices by the attorney was present to justify the trial court's failure to take adequate steps in response to the repeated motions for appointment of separate counsel.  Pp.  435 U. S. 486-487.
2. Whenever a trial court improperly requires joint representation over timely objection, reversal is automatic, and prejudice is presumed regardless

(b) That an attorney representing multiple defendants with conflicting interests is physically present at pretrial proceedings, during trial, and at sentencing does not warrant departure from the general rule requiring automatic reversal.  Pp.  435 U. S. 489-490.
(c) A rule requiring a defendant to show that a conflict of interests -- which he and his counsel tried to avoid by timely objections to the joint representation -- prejudiced him in some specific fashion would not be susceptible of intelligent, evenhanded application.  Pp.  435 U. S. 490-491.

Syllabus 
The 1971 version of a pension plan negotiated by appellee company and the union representing its employees provided that pensions were to be payable only from a fund established under the plan.  Funding of the pension plan was in part to be on a deferred basis; the excess of accrued liability of the fund's assets was to be met through contributions from the employer's continuing operations.  Though the company had the right to terminate the plan, it guaranteed to pay benefits amounting to $7 million above the fund's assets.  A few weeks before appellee, on May 1, 1974, exercised its termination right, Minnesota's Private Pension Benefits Protection Act (Pension Act) was enacted, which imposed ""a pension funding charge"" directly against any employer who ceased to operate a place of employment or a pension plan.  After appellant state official had certified that appellee, by application of the Pension Act, owed a pension funding charge of over $19 million, appellee brought this suit in District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the Pension Act, inter alia, on the ground that it interfered with the process of collective bargaining sanctioned by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and therefore was preempted by the NLRA.  Section 10(b) of the federal Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act (Disclosure Act) provided that the Disclosure Act shall not exempt any person from liability provided by any present or future federal or state law affecting the operation of pension plans.  Section 10(a) provided that the Disclosure Act shall not be construed to prevent any State from obtaining additional information relating to a pension plan ""or from otherwise regulating such plan.""  The District Court, having taken note of the  10(b) disclaimer, found sufficient evidence of congressional intent that the Pension Act was not preempted by federal law, and ruled in favor of appellant.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, by purporting to override the existing pension plan in several respects, the Pension Act encroached upon subjects that Congress had committed for determination to the collective bargaining process.  The court also concluded that  10(b) of the Disclosure Act related only to state 
Page 435 U. S. 498
 statutes governing those obligations of trust undertaken by persons managing employment benefit funds, the violation of which gives rise to criminal or civil penalties, and that therefore there was no basis for construing the Disclosure Act as leaving a State with power to change the substantive terms of pension plan agreements.
Held:
1. The NLRA neither expressly nor by implication forecloses state regulatory power over pension plans that may be the subject of collective bargaining.  Sections 10(b) and 10(a) of the Disclosure Act, together with the legislative history of that statute, indicate Congress' intention to preserve state regulatory authority over pension plans, including those resulting from collective bargaining.  Congress was concerned not only with corrupt pension plans, but also with the possibility that those that were honestly managed would be prematurely terminated by the employer, leaving employees without funded pensions at retirement age; and the Disclosure Act clearly anticipated a broad regulatory role for the States.  Pp.  435 U. S. 504-514.
2. That the Pension Act applies to preexisting collective bargaining agreements does not render it preempted, since it does not render it more or less consistent with congressional policy.  Appellee's claim of unfair retroactive impact may be considered in the context of appellee's due process and impairment of contract claims, which are not before the Court and which the District Court will consider on remand.  Pp.  435 U. S. 514-515.

A few weeks before appellee, on May 1, 1974, exercised its termination right, Minnesota's Private Pension Benefits Protection Act (Pension Act) was enacted, which imposed ""a pension funding charge"" directly against any employer who ceased to operate a place of employment or a pension plan.  After appellant state official had certified that appellee, by application of the Pension Act, owed a pension funding charge of over $19 million, appellee brought this suit in District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the Pension Act, inter alia, on the ground that it interfered with the process of collective bargaining sanctioned by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and therefore was preempted by the NLRA.  Section 10(b) of the federal Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act (Disclosure Act) provided that the Disclosure Act shall not exempt any person from liability provided by any present or future federal or state law affecting the operation of pension plans.  Section 10(a) provided that the Disclosure Act shall not be construed to prevent any State from obtaining additional information relating to a pension plan ""or from otherwise regulating such plan.""  The District Court, having taken note of the  10(b) disclaimer, found sufficient evidence of congressional intent that the Pension Act was not preempted by federal law, and ruled in favor of appellant.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, by purporting to override the existing pension plan in several respects, the Pension Act encroached upon subjects that Congress had committed for determination to the collective bargaining process.  The court also concluded that  10(b) of the Disclosure Act related only to state 
Page 435 U. S. 498
 statutes governing those obligations of trust undertaken by persons managing employment benefit funds, the violation of which gives rise to criminal or civil penalties, and that therefore there was no basis for construing the Disclosure Act as leaving a State with power to change the substantive terms of pension plan agreements.
Held:
1. The NLRA neither expressly nor by implication forecloses state regulatory power over pension plans that may be the subject of collective bargaining.  Sections 10(b) and 10(a) of the Disclosure Act, together with the legislative history of that statute, indicate Congress' intention to preserve state regulatory authority over pension plans, including those resulting from collective bargaining.  Congress was concerned not only with corrupt pension plans, but also with the possibility that those that were honestly managed would be prematurely terminated by the employer, leaving employees without funded pensions at retirement age; and the Disclosure Act clearly anticipated a broad regulatory role for the States.  Pp.  435 U. S. 504-514.
2. That the Pension Act applies to preexisting collective bargaining agreements does not render it preempted, since it does not render it more or less consistent with congressional policy.  Appellee's claim of unfair retroactive impact may be considered in the context of appellee's due process and impairment of contract claims, which are not before the Court and which the District Court will consider on remand.  Pp.  435 U. S. 514-515.

No. 76-419
Argued November 28, 1977
Decided April 3, 1978*
435 U.S. 519

Syllabus 
In No. 76-419, after extensive hearings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (Licensing Board) and over respondents' objections, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) granted petitioner Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. a license to operate a nuclear power plant, and this ruling was affirmed by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board (Appeal Board).  Subsequently, the AEC, specifically referring to the Appeal Board's decision, instituted rulemaking proceedings to deal with the question of considering environmental effects associated with the uranium fuel cycle in the individual cost-benefit analyses for light-watercooled nuclear power reactors.  In these proceedings, the Licensing Board was not to use full formal adjudicatory procedures.  Eventually, as a result of these rulemaking proceedings, the AEC issued a so-called fuel cycle rule.  At the same time, the AEC approved the procedures used at the hearing; indicated that the record, including the Environmental Survey, provided an adequate data base for the rule adopted; and ruled that, to the extent the rule differed from the Appeal Board's decision, such decision had no further precedential significance, but that, since the environmental effects of the uranium fuel cycle had been shown to be relatively insignificant, it was unnecessary to apply the rule to Vermont Yankee's environmental reports submitted prior to the rule's effective date or to the environmental statements circulated for comment prior to such date.  Respondents appealed from both the AEC's adoption of the fuel cycle rule and its decision to grant Vermont Yankee's license.  With respect to the license, the Court of Appeals first ruled that, in the absence of effective rulemaking proceedings, the AEC must deal with the environmental impact of fuel reprocessing and disposal in individual licensing proceedings, and went on to hold that, despite the fact that it appeared that the AEC employed all the procedures required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in 5 U.S.C.  553 (1976 ed.) and more, 
Page 435 U. S. 520
 the rulemaking proceedings were inadequate, and overturned the rule, and, accordingly, the AEC's determination with respect to the license was also remanded for further proceedings.  In No. 76-528, after examination of a report of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) and extensive hearings, and over respondent intervenors' objections, the AEC granted petitioner Consumers Power Co. a permit to construct two nuclear reactors, and this ruling was affirmed by the Appeal Board.  At about this time, the Council on Environmental Quality revised its regulations governing the preparation of environmental impact statements so as to mention for the first time the necessity for considering energy conservation as one of the alternatives to a proposed project.  In view of this development and a subsequent AEC ruling indicating that all evidence of energy conservation should not necessarily be barred at the threshold of AEC proceedings, one of the intervenors moved to reopen the permit proceedings so that energy conservation could be considered, but the AEC declined to reopen the proceedings.  Respondents appealed from the granting of the construction permit.  The Court of Appeals held that the environmental impact statement for the construction of the reactors was fatally defective for failure to examine energy conservation as an alternative to plants of this size, and that the ACRS report was inadequate, and should have been returned to the ACRS for further elucidation, understandable to a layman, and remanded the case for appropriate consideration of waste disposal and other unaddressed issues.
Held:
1. Generally speaking, 5 U.S.C.  553 (1976 ed.) establishes the maximum procedural requirements that Congress was willing to have the courts impose upon federal agencies in conducting rulemaking proceedings, and while agencies are free to grant additional procedural rights in the exercise of their discretion, reviewing courts are generally not free to impose them if the agencies have not chosen to grant them.  And, even apart from the APA, the formulation of procedures should basically be left within the discretion of the agencies to which Congress has confided the responsibility for substantive judgments.  Pp.  435 U. S. 523-525.
2. The Court of Appeals in these cases has seriously misread or misapplied such statutory and decisional law cautioning reviewing courts against engrafting their own notions of proper procedures upon agencies entrusted with substantive functions by Congress, and moreover, as to the Court of Appeals' decision with respect to agency action taken after full adjudicatory hearings, it improperly intruded into the agency's decisionmaking process.  Pp.  435 U. S. 535-558.
(a) In No. 76-419, the AEC acted well within its statutory authority 
Page 435 U. S. 521
 when it considered the environmental impact of the fuel processes when licensing nuclear reactors.  Pp.  435 U. S. 538-539.
(b) Nothing in the APA, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the circumstances of the case in No. 76-419, the nature of the issues being considered, past agency practice, or the statutory mandate under which the AEC operates permitted the Court of Appeals to review and overturn the rulemaking proceeding on the basis of the procedural devices employed (or not employed) by the AEC, so long as the AEC used at least the statutory minima, a matter about which there is no doubt.  Pp.  435 U. S. 539-548.
(c) As to whether the challenged rule in No. 76-419 finds sufficient justification in the administrative proceedings that it should be upheld by the reviewing court, the case is remanded so that the Court of Appeals may review the rule as the APA provides.  The court should engage in this kind of review, and not stray beyond the judicial province to explore the procedural format or to impose upon the agency its own notion of which procedures are ""best"" or most likely to further some vague, undefined public good.  P.  435 U. S. 549.
(d) In No. 76-528, the Court of Appeals was wrong in holding that rejection of energy conservation on the basis of the ""threshold test"" was capricious and arbitrary as being inconsistent with the NEPA's basic mandate to the AEC, since the court's rationale basically misconceives not only the scope of the agency's Statutory responsibility, but also the nature of the administrative process, the thrust of the agency's decision, and the type of issues the intervenors were trying to raise.  The court seriously mischaracterized the AEC's ""threshold test"" as placing ""heavy substantive burdens on intervenors.""  On the contrary, the AEC's stated procedure as requiring a showing sufficient to require reasonable minds to inquire further is a procedure well within the agency's discretion.  Pp.  435 U.

(e) The Court of Appeals' holding in No. 76-528 that the Licensing Board should have returned the ACRS report to the ACRS for further elaboration is erroneous as being an unjustifiable intrusion into the administrative process, and there is nothing in the relevant statutes to justify what the court did.

 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I would grant certiorari to resolve the question whether, before a juvenile waives her constitutional rights to remain silent and consult with an attorney, she is entitled to competent advice from an adult who does not have significant conflicts of interest. 
 Petitioner, a girl of ""low dull normal"" intelligence,1 has been sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime that occurred when she was 13 years old. [Footnote 2] Her convict on for the murder of her father was based in large part on incriminating statements that she made on three occasions. The most important of these statements was a lengthy confession given at the county juvenile home on the day of the murder, in the presence of her mother, a probation officer, a prosecuting attorney, and two sheriff's deputies. 
 Prior to making this confession, petitioner spent 10-15 minutes alone with her mother, who had earlier been questioned by the police concerning the murder and who believed that she was herself a suspect. 261 Ark. 859, 866-867, 554 S.W.2d 312, 314-315 (1977). The mother emerged from this meeting, ""look[ing] as if she had been crying,"" and stated

 that petitioner wanted to confess. Id., at 867, 554 S.W.2d at 315. Petitioner then was advised of her rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, pursuant to Miranda v.

|435 u.s. 389|"City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co.
No. 76-864
Argued October 4, 1977
Decided March 29, 1978
435 U.S. 389

Syllabus 
Petitioner cities, which own and operate electric utility systems both within and beyond their respective city limits as authorized by Louisiana law, brought an action in District Court against respondent investor-owned electric utility with which petitioners compete, alleging that it committed various federal antitrust offenses that injured petitioners in the operation of their electric utility systems.  Respondent counterclaimed, alleging that petitioners had committed various antitrust offenses that injured respondent in its business and property.  Petitioners moved to dismiss the counterclaim on the ground that, as cities and subdivisions of the State, the ""state action"" doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, rendered federal antitrust laws inapplicable to them.  The District Court granted the motion, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.
Held:  Apart from whether petitioners are exempt from the antitrust laws as agents of the State under the Parker doctrine, there are insufficient grounds for inferring that Congress did not intend to subject cities to antitrust liability.  Pp.  435 U. S. 394-408.
(a) The definition of ""person"" or ""persons"" covered by the antitrust laws clearly includes cities, whether as municipal utility operators suing as plaintiffs seeking damages for antitrust violations or as such operators being sued as defendants.  Chattanooga Foundry & Pipe Works v. Atlanta, 203 U. S. 390; Georgia v. Evans, 316 U. S. 159.  Pp.  435 U. S. 394-397.
(b) Petitioners have failed to show the existence of any overriding public policy inconsistent with a construction of coverage of the antitrust laws.  The presumption against implied exclusion from such laws cannot be negated either on the ground that it would be anomalous to subject municipalities to antitrust liability or on the ground that the antitrust laws are intended to protect the public only from abuses of private power, and not from action of municipalities that exist to serve the public weal.  Pp.  435 U. S. 400-408.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded:
1. Parker v. Brown does not automatically exempt from the antitrust 
Page 435 U. S. 390
 laws all governmental entities, whether state agencies or subdivisions of a State, simply by reason of their status as such, but exempts only anticompetitive conduct engaged in as an act of government by the State as sovereign, or by its subdivisions, pursuant to state policy to displace competition with regulation or monopoly public service.  Pp.  435 U. S. 408-413.
2. The Court of Appeals did not err in holding that further inquiry should be made to determine whether petitioners' actions were directed by the State, since, when the State itself has not directed or authorized an anticompetitive practice, the State's subdivisions, in exercising their delegated power, must obey the antitrust laws.  While a subordinate governmental unit's claim to Parker immunity is not as readily established as the same claim by a state government, sued as such, an adequate state mandate for anticompetitive activities of cities and other subordinate governmental units exists when it is found,

			"|"City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co.
No. 76-864
Argued October 4, 1977
Decided March 29, 1978
435 U.S. 389

Syllabus 
Petitioner cities, which own and operate electric utility systems both within and beyond their respective city limits as authorized by Louisiana law, brought an action in District Court against respondent investor-owned electric utility with which petitioners compete, alleging that it committed various federal antitrust offenses that injured petitioners in the operation of their electric utility systems.  Respondent counterclaimed, alleging that petitioners had committed various antitrust offenses that injured respondent in its business and property.  Petitioners moved to dismiss the counterclaim on the ground that, as cities and subdivisions of the State, the ""state action"" doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, rendered federal antitrust laws inapplicable to them.  The District Court granted the motion, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.
Held:  Apart from whether petitioners are exempt from the antitrust laws as agents of the State under the Parker doctrine, there are insufficient grounds for inferring that Congress did not intend to subject cities to antitrust liability.  Pp.  435 U. S. 394-408.
(a) The definition of ""person"" or ""persons"" covered by the antitrust laws clearly includes cities, whether as municipal utility operators suing as plaintiffs seeking damages for antitrust violations or as such operators being sued as defendants.  Chattanooga Foundry & Pipe Works v. Atlanta, 203 U. S. 390; Georgia v. Evans, 316 U. S. 159.  Pp.  435 U. S. 394-397.
(b) Petitioners have failed to show the existence of any overriding public policy inconsistent with a construction of coverage of the antitrust laws.  The presumption against implied exclusion from such laws cannot be negated either on the ground that it would be anomalous to subject municipalities to antitrust liability or on the ground that the antitrust laws are intended to protect the public only from abuses of private power, and not from action of municipalities that exist to serve the public weal.  Pp.  435 U. S. 400-408.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded:
1. Parker v. Brown does not automatically exempt from the antitrust 
Page 435 U. S. 390
 laws all governmental entities, whether state agencies or subdivisions of a State, simply by reason of their status as such, but exempts only anticompetitive conduct engaged in as an act of government by the State as sovereign, or by its subdivisions, pursuant to state policy to displace competition with regulation or monopoly public service.  Pp.  435 U. S. 408-413.
2. The Court of Appeals did not err in holding that further inquiry should be made to determine whether petitioners' actions were directed by the State, since, when the State itself has not directed or authorized an anticompetitive practice, the State's subdivisions, in exercising their delegated power, must obey the antitrust laws.  While a subordinate governmental unit's claim to Parker immunity is not as readily established as the same claim by a state government, sued as such, an adequate state mandate for anticompetitive activities of cities and other subordinate governmental units exists when it is found,
""from the authority given a governmental entity to operate in a particular area, that the legislature contemplated the kind of action complained of.""

No. 76-1750
Argued January 10, 1978
Decided March 28, 1978
435 U.S. 349

Syllabus 
A mother filed a petition in affidavit form in an Indiana Circuit Court, a court of general jurisdiction under an Indiana statute, for authority to have her ""somewhat retarded"" 15-year-old daughter (a respondent here) sterilized, and petitioner Circuit Judge approved the petition the same day in an ex parte proceeding without a hearing and without notice to the daughter or appointment of a guardian ad litem.  The operation was performed shortly thereafter, the daughter having been told that she was to have her appendix removed.  About two years later, she was married, and her inability to become pregnant led her to discover that she had been sterilized.  As a result, she and her husband (also a respondent here) filed suit in Federal District Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983 against her mother, the mother's attorney, the Circuit Judge, the doctors who performed or assisted in the sterilization, and the hospital where it was performed, seeking damages for the alleged violation of her constitutional rights.  Holding that the constitutional claims required a showing of state action and that the only state action alleged was the Circuit Judge's approval of the sterilization petition, the District Court held that no federal action would lie against any of the defendants because the Circuit Judge, the only state agent, was absolutely immune from suit under the doctrine of judicial immunity.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the ""crucial issue"" was whether the Circuit Judge acted within his jurisdiction, that he had not, that, accordingly, he was not immune from damages liability, and that, in any event, he had forfeited his immunity ""because of his failure to comply with elementary principles of procedural due process.""
Held:  The Indiana law vested in the Circuit Judge the power to entertain and act upon the petition for sterilization, and he is, therefore, immune from damages liability even if his approval of the petition was in error.  Pp.  435 U. S. 355-364.
(a) A judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority, but, rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the ""clear absence of all jurisdiction,"" Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335,  80 U. S. 351.  Pp.  435 U. S. 355-357. 
Page 435 U. S. 350

(b) Here, there was not ""clear absence of all jurisdiction"" in the Circuit Court to consider the sterilization petition.  That court had jurisdiction under the Indiana statute granting it broad general jurisdiction, it appearing that neither by statute nor by case law had such jurisdiction been circumscribed to foreclose consideration of the petition.  Pp.  435 U. S. 357-358.
(c) Because the Circuit Court is a court of general jurisdiction, neither the procedural errors the Circuit Judge may have committed nor the lack of a specific statute authorizing his approval of the petition in question rendered him liable in damages for the consequences of his actions.  Pp.  435 U. S. 358-360.
(d) The factors determining whether an act by a judge is ""judicial"" relate to the nature of the act itself (whether it is a function normally performed by a judge) and the expectation of the parties (whether they dealt with the judge in his judicial capacity), and here, both of these elements indicate that the Circuit Judge's approval of the sterilization petition was a judicial act, even though he may have proceeded with informality.  Pp.  435 U. S. 360-363.
(e) Disagreement with the action taken by a judge does not justify depriving him of his immunity, and, thus, the fact that, in this case, tragic consequences ensued from the judge's action does not deprive him of his immunity; moreover, the fact that the issue before the judge is a controversial one, as here, is all the more reason that he should be able to act without fear of suit.  Pp.  435 U. S. 363-364.

In dismissing respondents' action against petitioner under  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the District Court failed to set forth the judgment in a separate document as required by Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 58.

1. Under the circumstances, the parties should be deemed to have waived Rule 58's separate judgment requirement, and hence the Court of Appeals properly assumed appellate jurisdiction under  1291.

Syllabus 
Respondent, a member of the Navajo Tribe, pleaded guilty in Tribal Court to a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and was sentenced.  Subsequently, he was indicted by a federal grand jury for statutory rape arising out of the same incident.  He moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that, since the tribal offense of contributing to the delinquency of a minor was a lesser included offense of statutory rape, the Tribal Court proceeding barred the subsequent federal prosecution.  The District Court granted the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, since tribal courts and federal district courts are not ""arms of separate sovereigns,"" the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment barred respondent's federal trial.
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the federal prosecution.  Pp.  435 U. S. 316-332.
(a) The controlling question is the source of an Indian tribe's power to punish tribal offenders, i.e., whether it is a part of inherent tribal sovereignty or an aspect of the sovereignty of the Federal Government that has been delegated to the tribes by Congress.  Pp.  435 U. S. 316-322.
(b) Indian tribes still possess those aspects of sovereignty not withdrawn by treaty or statute, or by implication as a necessary result of their dependent status.  Pp.  435 U. S. 322-323.
(c) Here, it is evident from the treaties between the Navajo Tribe and the United States and from the various statutes establishing federal criminal jurisdiction over crimes involving Indians, that the Navajo Tribe has never given up its sovereign power to punish tribal offenders, nor has that power implicitly been lost by virtue of the Indians' dependent status; thus, tribal exercise of that power is presently the continued exercise of retained tribal sovereignty.

No. 76-1629
Argued January 11, 1978
Decided March 22, 1978
435 U.S. 313

Syllabus 
Respondent, a member of the Navajo Tribe, pleaded guilty in Tribal Court to a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and was sentenced.  Subsequently, he was indicted by a federal grand jury for statutory rape arising out of the same incident.  He moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that, since the tribal offense of contributing to the delinquency of a minor was a lesser included offense of statutory rape, the Tribal Court proceeding barred the subsequent federal prosecution.  The District Court granted the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, since tribal courts and federal district courts are not ""arms of separate sovereigns,"" the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment barred respondent's federal trial.
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the federal prosecution.  Pp.  435 U. S. 316-332.
(a) The controlling question is the source of an Indian tribe's power to punish tribal offenders, i.e., whether it is a part of inherent tribal sovereignty or an aspect of the sovereignty of the Federal Government that has been delegated to the tribes by Congress.  Pp.  435 U. S. 316-322.
(b) Indian tribes still possess those aspects of sovereignty not withdrawn by treaty or statute, or by implication as a necessary result of their dependent status.  Pp.  435 U. S. 322-323.
(c) Here, it is evident from the treaties between the Navajo Tribe and the United States and from the various statutes establishing federal criminal jurisdiction over crimes involving Indians, that the Navajo Tribe has never given up its sovereign power to punish tribal offenders, nor has that power implicitly been lost by virtue of the Indians' dependent status; thus, tribal exercise of that power is presently the continued exercise of retained tribal sovereignty.  Pp.  435 U. S. 323-326.
(d) Moreover, such power is not attributable to any delegation of federal authority.  Pp.  435 U. S. 326-328.
(e) When an Indian tribe criminally punishes a tribe member for violating tribal law, the tribe acts as an independent sovereign, and not as an arm of the Federal Government, Talton v. Mayes, 163 U. S. 376, and since tribal and federal prosecutions are brought by separate sovereigns,

Syllabus 
1. The giving by a state trial judge, over a criminal defendant's objection, of a cautionary instruction that the jury is not to draw any adverse inference from the defendant's decision not to testify in his behalf does not violate the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  435 U. S. 336-341.
(a) Though in Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, the Court stated that ""comment on the refusal to testify"" violates the constitutional privilege, the Court was there concerned only with adverse comment, whereas here the very purpose of the instruction is to remove from the jury's deliberations any influence of unspoken adverse inferences.  Pp.  435 U. S. 338-339.
(b) Petitioner's contention that such an instruction may encourage adverse inferences in a trial like his, where the defense was presented through several witnesses, would require indulgence, on which federal constitutional law cannot rest, in the dubious speculative assumptions (1) that the jurors have not noticed defendant's failure to testify and will not therefore draw adverse inferences on their own; and (2) that the jurors will totally disregard the trial judge's instruction.  Pp.  435 U. S. 339-340.
2. The challenged instruction does not deprive the objecting defendant of his right to counsel by interfering with his attorney's trial strategy.

Decided March 21, 1978
435 U.S. 223

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who was charged with committing a misdemeanor, was tried before a five-person jury pursuant to Georgia law, and convicted.  Though a criminal trial by a six-person jury is permissible under Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, petitioner maintains that a trial before a jury of less than six is unconstitutional, a contention that the Georgia courts rejected.
Held:  The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.  Pp.  435 U. S. 229-245;  435 U. S. 245;  435 U. S. 245-246.
138 Ga.App. 530, 227 S.E.2d 65, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that a criminal trial to a jury of less than six persons substantially threatens Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees.  Georgia has presented no persuasive argument to the contrary.  Neither the financial benefit nor the more dubious time-saving benefit claimed is a factor of sufficient significance to offset the substantial threat to the constitutional guarantees that reducing the jury from six to five would create.  Pp.  435 U. S. 229-245.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE concluded that a jury of less than six would not satisfy the fair cross-section requirement of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  P.  435 U. S. 245.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST joined, concluded that, though the line between five- and six-member juries is difficult to justify, a line has to be drawn somewhere if the substance of jury trial in criminal cases is to be preserved.

Syllabus 
In actions by public school students under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against school officials, wherein the students were found to have been suspended from school without procedural due process, the students, absent proof of actual injury, are entitled to recover only nominal damages.  Pp.  435 U. S. 253-267.
(a) The basic purpose of a  1983 damages award is to compensate persons for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights.  Pp.  435 U. S. 254-257.
(b) To further the purpose of  1983, the rules governing compensation for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights should be tailored to the interests protected by the particular right in question, just as the common law rules of damages were defined by the interests protected in the various branches of tort law.  Pp.  435 U. S. 257-259.
(c) Mental and emotional distress caused by the denial of procedural due process cannot be presumed to occur, as in the case of presumed damages in the common law of defamation per se, but, although such distress is compensable, neither the likelihood of such injury nor the difficulty of proving it is so great as to justify awarding compensatory damages without proof that such injury actually was caused.  Pp.  435 U. S. 259-264.
(d) The issues of what elements and prerequisites for recovery of damages are appropriate to compensate for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights must be considered with reference to the nature of the interests protected by the particular right in question.  Therefore, cases dealing with awards of damages for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights other than the right to procedural due process, are not controlling in this case.  Pp.  435 U. S. 264-265.
(e) Because the right to procedural due process is ""absolute"" in the sense that it does not depend upon the merits of a claimant's substantive assertions, and because of the importance to organized society that procedural due process be observed, the denial of procedural due process should be actionable for nominal damages without proof of actual injury, and therefore, if it is determined that the suspensions of the students in

Syllabus 
A police officer (Biro), while taking a break in respondent's flower shop and conversing with an employee of the shop (Hennessey), noticed an envelope with money protruding therefrom lying on the cash register.  Upon examination, he found it contained not only money, but policy slips.  Biro then placed the envelope back on the register and, without telling Hennessey what he had found, asked her to whom the envelope belonged.  She told him it belonged to respondent.  Biro's finding was reported to local detectives and to the FBI, who interviewed Hennessey some four months later without referring to the incident involving Biro.  About six months after that incident, respondent was summoned before a federal grand jury, where he testified that he had never taken policy bets at his shop, but Hennessey testified to the contrary, and, shortly thereafter, respondent was indicted for perjury.  Hennessey testified against respondent at his trial, but, after a finding of guilt, the District Court granted respondent's motion to suppress Hennessey's testimony and set aside that finding.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, noting that the ""road"" to that testimony from the concededly unconstitutional search was ""both straight and uninterrupted.""
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the degree of attenuation between Biro's search of the envelope and Hennessey's testimony at the trial was not sufficient to dissipate the connection between the illegality of the search and challenged testimony.  Pp.  435 U. S. 273-280.
(a) In determining whether the exclusionary rule, with its deterrent purpose, should be applied, its benefits should be balanced against its costs, and, in evaluating the standards for application of the rule to live witness testimony in light of this balance, material factors to be considered are the length of the ""road"" between the Fourth Amendment violation and the witness' testimony; the degree of free will exercised by the witness; and the fact that exclusion of the witness' testimony would perpetually disable the witness from testifying about relevant and material facts regardless of how unrelated such testimony might be to the purpose of the originally illegal search or the evidence discovered thereby. Pp.  435 U. S. 273-279.
(b) Here, where the evidence indicates overwhelmingly that Hennessey's 
Page 435 U. S. 269
 testimony was an act of her own free will in no way coerced or induced by official authority as a result of Biro's discovery of the policy slips where substantial time elapsed between the illegal search and the initial contact with the witness and between the latter and her trial testimony, and where both Hennessey's identity and her relationship with respondent were well known to the investigating officers, and there is no evidence that Biro entered the shop or picked up the envelope with the intent of finding evidence of an illicit gambling operation, application of the exclusionary rule could not have the slightest deterrent effect on the behavior of an officer such as Biro, and the cost of permanently silencing Hennessey is too great for an evenhanded system of law enforcement to bear in order to secure such a speculative and very likely negligible deterrent effect.  Pp.  435 U. S. 279-280.

Provisions of the GI Bill requiring the Administrator of the Veterans' Administration to disapprove the application of a veteran seeking educational assistance benefits if the veteran enrolls in a course in which more than 85% of the students are receiving financial assistance from the educational institution, the VA, or other federal agency (85-15 requirement), or if the course has been offered for less than two years, held not to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Experience with administration of the veterans' educational assistance program since World War II having revealed to Congress a need for legislation that would minimize the risk that veterans' benefits would be wasted on educational programs of little value, it was rational for Congress to conclude that established courses with a substantial enrollment of nonsubsidized students were more likely to be quality courses, and thus the 85-15 and two-year requirements both satisfy the constitutional test normally applied in cases like this.  Such requirements are not made irrational by virtue of their absence from other federal educational assistance programs.

Syllabus 
Provisions of the GI Bill requiring the Administrator of the Veterans' Administration to disapprove the application of a veteran seeking educational assistance benefits if the veteran enrolls in a course in which more than 85% of the students are receiving financial assistance from the educational institution, the VA, or other federal agency (85-15 requirement), or if the course has been offered for less than two years, held not to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Experience with administration of the veterans' educational assistance program since World War II having revealed to Congress a need for legislation that would minimize the risk that veterans' benefits would be wasted on educational programs of little value, it was rational for Congress to conclude that established courses with a substantial enrollment of nonsubsidized students were more likely to be quality courses, and thus the 85-15 and two-year requirements both satisfy the constitutional test normally applied in cases like this.  Such requirements are not made irrational by virtue of their absence from other federal educational assistance programs.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 In denying certiorari in this case, the Court allows the Second Circuit's ""but for"" corollary to the exclusionary rule to pass unreviewed, at least for the present. As applied in this case, the Second Circuit rule allows into evidence the fruits of an arrest involving serious constitutional questions, because the court below could envision a set of circumstances in which the arrest might have been carried out constitutionally. 
 Petitioner was arrested on April 20, 1976, on the authority of a "" John Doe"" bench warrant. The arre ting agents broke down the door of petitioner's home and arrested him in his bed. The trial court approved the arrest on the basis of extrinsic evidence which supplemented the nameless and descriptionless warrant. However, the Second Circuit found the ""John Doe"" warrant to be invalid, and went on to consider whether the 
Page 435 U.S. 934 , 935
 arrest might otherwise be defended under 18 U.S.C. 3052, which grants FBI agents authority to make felony arrests based on reasonable suspicion. Observing that United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 46 L. Ed.2d 598 (1976), left unresolved the constitutionality of probable-cause arrests pursuant to statutory authority effected in a private home without a warrant, the Second Circuit concluded that the facts of this case raised "" serious question whether the forcible entry into Jarvis' home without a valid warrant and in the absence of exigent circumstances meets the requirement of the statute or fourth amendment standards of reasonableness ."" 560 F.2d 494, 498 (C.A. [Footnote 2] 1977). 
 Nevertheless, the Second Circuit affirmed the admissibility of photographs, fingerprints, and identifications resulting therefrom, all of which followed petitioner's arrest. Its reasoning was that the agents could have legally arrested petitioner on probable cause as he emerged from his home, and, had they done so, all the evidence complained of would then have materialized anyway. ""The illegal arrest thus was not a 'but for' cause for the introduction of the evidence appellant seeks to suppress."" Id., at 498-499. 
 This ""but for"" test presents a substantial question for the proper enforcement of the exclusionary rule. Its origin is dubious,1 and its use has not been explicitly sanctioned outside of the Second Circuit. 2 Most importantly, it sanctions a post [435 U.S. 934 , 936]

Syllabus 
As part of a comprehensive program to recoup the costs of federal aviation programs from those who use the national airsystem, Congress enacted the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, which imposes an annual ""flat fee"" registration tax on all civil aircraft, including those owned by the States and by the Federal Government, that fly in the navigable airspace of the United States.  The Act also imposes a 7 cent per gallon tax on aircraft fuel, which, together with a 5 cent per pound aircraft tire and 10 cent per pound tube tax and the registration tax, was intended to reflect the cost of benefits from the programs to noncommercial general aircraft, but States were exempted from the fuel, tire, and tube taxes.  After the registration tax was collected under protest from it with respect to a helicopter it used exclusively for police functions, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts instituted this refund action, contending that the United States may not constitutionally impose a tax that directly affects the essential and traditional state function of operating a police force.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground, inter alia, that the registration tax was a user fee which did not implicate the constitutional doctrine of implied immunity of state government from federal taxation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The registration tax does not violate the implied immunity of a state government from federal taxation.  Pp  435 U. S. 453-470
(a) A State enjoys no constitutional immunity from a nondiscriminatory federal revenue measure which operates only to ensure that each member of a class of special beneficiaries of a federal program pays a reasonable approximation of its fair share of the cost of the program to the Federal Government.  Pp.  435 U. S. 454-463.
(b) Even if it were feasible for the Federal Government to recover all costs of a program through charges for measurable amounts of use of its facilities, rather than by imposing a flat fee, so long as the federal taxes imposed do not discriminate against state functions, are based on a fair approximation of the State's use of the facilities, and are structured to produce revenues that will not exceed the total cost to the Federal Government of the benefits supplied, there can be no substantial basis for a claim that the Federal Government may be using its

 taxing powers to control, unduly interfere with, or destroy a State's ability to perform essential services.  Pp.  435 U. S. 463-467.
(c) Here, the registration tax (1) is nondiscriminatory, since it applies not only to private users of the airways, but also to civil aircraft operated by the United States; (2) is, together with the 7 cent per gallon fuel tax and the 5 cent per pound tire and 1 cent per pound tube tax, a fair approximation of the cost of the benefits civil aircraft receive from the federal programs, since, even though the taxes do not give weight to every factor affecting appropriate compensation for airport and airway use, the fuel tax and tire and tube tax are geared directly to use, whereas the registration tax is designed to give weight to factors affecting the level of use of the navigational facilities; and (3) is not excessive in relation to the cost of the Government benefits supplied, since not only have the user fees proved to be insufficient to cover the annual civil aviation outlays, but the States, being exempt from the fuel tax, pay far less than private noncommercial users of the airways.

No. 76-1662
Argued October 11, 1977

435 U.S. 110

Syllabus 
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 provides that, whenever ""a State or political subdivision with respect to which""  4 of the Act is in effect shall enact any voting qualification or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force on November 1, 1964, the change has no effect as law unless such State or subdivision obtains, as specified in the statute, a declaratory judgment that the change does not have a racially discriminatory purpose or effect.  Alternatively, the change may be enforced if it is submitted to the Attorney General and he has interposed no objection to it within 60 days after the submission, or has advised that objection will not be made.  The city of Sheffield, Ala., on November 1, 1964, had a commission form of government.  Some months later, it sought to put to a referendum the question whether the city should adopt a mayor-council form of government, and respondent Board of Commissioners for the city gave the Attorney General written notice of the referendum proposal, Alabama being a State covered under  4 of the Act.  The referendum was held and the voters approved the change.  Thereafter, the Attorney General replied that he did not object to the holding of the referendum, but that, since the voters had elected to adopt the mayor-council form of government, ""the change is also subject to the preclearance requirement of Section 5,"" and that detailed information should be submitted if preclearance was sought through the Attorney General.  Following his receipt of such information, the Attorney General made objection to a phase of the change that involved the at-large election of city councilmen.  After the city nevertheless scheduled an at-large council election, the United States brought this suit to enforce the  5 objection.  The District Court denied relief, holding that Sheffield was not covered by  5 because it was not a ""political subdivision"" as that term is defined in  14(c)(2) of the Act, which provides that
""'political subdivision' shall mean any county or parish, except that where registration for voting is not conducted under the supervision of a county or parish, the term shall include any other subdivision of a State which conducts registration for voting,""
and that therefore Sheffield was not a 
Page 435 U. S. 111
 political subdivision because, in Alabama, registration is conducted by the counties.  The court also held that, by approving the referendum, the Attorney General had approved the mayor-council form of government in which councilmen were elected at large, notwithstanding his statement regarding preclearance.
Held:
1. Section 5 of the Act applies to all entities having power over any aspect of the electoral process within designated jurisdictions, not only to counties or other units of state government that perform the function of registering voters, and the District Court therefore erred in holding that Sheffield is not subject to  5.  Pp.  435 U. S. 117-135.
(a) The District Court's interpretation of the Act does not comport with the Act's structure, makes  5 coverage depend upon a factor completely irrelevant to the Act's purposes, and thereby permits precisely the kind of circumvention of congressional policy that  5 was designed to prevent.  Section 5 ""was structured to assure the effectiveness of the dramatic step Congress [took] in  4,"" and ""is clearly designed to march in lock-step with  4.""  Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U. S. 544,  393 U. S. 54 (Harlan, J., concurring and dissenting).  Since jurisdictions may be designated under  4(b) by reason of the actions of election officials who do not register voters, and since  4(a) imposes duties on all election officials, whether or not they are involved in voter registration, it follows from the very structure of the Act that  5 must apply to all entities exercising control over the electoral process within the covered States or subdivisions.  The Act's terms and decisions of this Court clearly indicate that  5 was not intended to apply only to voting changes occurring within the registration process or only to the changes of specific entities.  Pp.  435 U. S. 118-125.
(b) The Act's language does not require such a crippling construction as that given by the District Court.  In view of the explicit relationship between  4 and  5 and the critical role that  5 is to play in securing the promise of  4(a), it is wholly logical to interpret ""State . . . with respect to which""  4(a) is in effect as referring to all political units within it.  Pp.  435 U. S. 126-129.
(c) The contemporaneous administrative construction of  5 by the Attorney General and the legislative history of the enactment and reenactments of the Act compel the conclusion that Congress always understood that  5 covers all political units within designated jurisdictions like Alabama.  Pp.  435 U. S. 129-135.
2. The Attorney General's failure to object to the holding of the referendum did not constitute clearance under  5 of the method of electing city councilmen under the new government.  Since Sheffield sought approval only for the holding of the referendum, not for preclearance 
Page 435 U. S. 112
 of the change in the city's form of government, and the Attorney General had warned the city that the change itself required prior federal scrutiny and advised what detailed information would be necessary for that purpose, it is irrelevant that he might have been on notice that, if the referendum passed, Sheffield would, under state law, have had to adopt an at-large system of councilmanic elections.

Syllabus 
Appellees challenge the constitutionality of the Washington Tanker Law, which regulates the design, size, and movement of oil tankers in Puget Sound, both enrolled (those engaged in domestic or coastwise trade) and registered (those engaged in foreign trade).  Three operative provisions are involved:  (1) a requirement ( 88.16.180) that both enrolled and registered oil tankers of at least 50,000 deadweight tons (DWT) carry a Washington-licensed pilot while navigating the Sound; (2) a requirement ( 88.16.190(2)) that enrolled and registered oil tankers of from 40,000 to 125,000 DWT satisfy certain design or safety standards, or else use tug escorts while operating in the Sound; and (3) a ban on the operation in the Sound of any tanker exceeding 125,000 DWT ( 88.16.190(1)).  A three-judge District Court adjudged the statute void in its entirety, upholding appellees' contentions that all the Tanker Law's operative provisions were preempted by federal law particularly the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 (PWSA), which is designed to insure vessel safety and the protection of navigable waters and adjacent shore areas from tanker oil spillage.  Title I of the PWSA empowers the Secretary of Transportation to establish, operate, and require compliance with ""vessel traffic services and systems"" for ports subject to congested traffic and to control vessel traffic in especially hazardous areas by, among other things, establishing vessel size limitations.  Pursuant to this Title, the Secretary, through his delegate, has promulgated the Puget Sound Vessel Traffic System, which contains general and communication rules, vessel movement reporting requirements, a traffic separation scheme, special ship movement rules applying to Rosario Strait (where, under a local Coast Guard rule, the passage of more than one 70,000 DWT vessel -- in bad weather, 40,000 DWT -- in either direction at a given time is prohibited), and other requirements.  A State, though permitted to impose higher equipment or safety standards, may do so ""for structures only.""  Title II, whose goals are to provide vessel safety and protect the marine environment, provides that the Secretary shall issue such rules and regulations as may be necessary with respect to the design, construction, and operation of oil tankers; provides for inspection of vessels for 
Page 435 U. S. 152
 compliance with the Secretary's safety and environmental regulations; and prohibits the carrying of specified cargoes absent issuance of a certificate of inspection evidencing compliance with the regulations.  Title 46 U.S.C.  364 provides that every coastwise seagoing steam vessel subject to federal navigation laws not sailing under register shall, when under way, be under the control and direction of pilots licensed by the Coast Guard.  Title 46 U.S.C.  215 adds that no state government shall impose upon steam vessel pilots any obligation to procure a state license in addition to the federal license, though it is specified that the provision does not affect state requirements for carrying pilots on other than coastwise vessels.
Held:
1. To the extent that  88.16.180 requires enrolled tankers to carry state-licensed pilots, the State is precluded by 46 U.S.C.  215, 364 from imposing its own pilotage requirements and to that extent the state law is invalid.  The District Court's judgment was overly broad, however, in invalidating the pilot provision in its entirety, since under both 46 U.S.C.  215 and the PWSA States are free to impose pilotage requirements on registered vessels entering and leaving their ports.  Pp  435 U. S. 158-160.
2. Congress in Title II intended uniform national standards for design and construction of tankers that would foreclose the imposition of different or more stringent state requirements, and since the federal scheme aims at precisely the same ends as  88.16.190(2) of the Tanker Law, the different and higher design requirements of that provision, standing alone, are invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S. 440; Kelly v. Washington, 302 U. S. 1, distinguished.  Pp.  435 U. S. 160-168.
3. The District Court erred in holding that the alternative tug requirement of  88.16.190(2) was invalid as conflicting with the PWSA, for the Secretary has not as yet promulgated his own tug requirement for Puget Sound tanker navigation or decided that there should be no such requirement.  Unless and until he issues such rules, the State's tug escort requirement is not preempted by the federal scheme.  Pp.  435 U. S. 168-173.
4. The exclusion from Puget Sound of any tanker exceeding 125,000 DWT pursuant to  88.16.190(1) is invalid under the Supremacy Clause in light of Title I and the Secretary's actions thereunder, a conclusion confirmed by the legislative history of Title I, which shows that Congress intended that there be a single federal decisionmaker to promulgate limitations on tanker size.  Pp.  435 U. S. 173-178.
5. The tug escort requirement does not violate the Commerce Clause.  This requirement, like a local pilotage requirement, is not the type of regulation demanding a uniform national rule, See Cooley v. Board of 
Page 435 U. S. 153
 Wardens, 12 How. 299, nor does it impede the free flow of interstate and foreign commerce, the tug escort charges not being large enough to interfere with the production of oil.  Pp.  435 U. S. 179-180.
6. Nor does the tug escort provision, which does not interfere with the Government's attempt to achieve international agreement on the regulation of tanker design, interfere with the Government's authority to conduct foreign affairs.  P.  435 U. S. 180.

No. 76-930
Argued October 31, 1977
Decided March 6, 1978
435 U.S. 151

Syllabus 
Appellees challenge the constitutionality of the Washington Tanker Law, which regulates the design, size, and movement of oil tankers in Puget Sound, both enrolled (those engaged in domestic or coastwise trade) and registered (those engaged in foreign trade).  Three operative provisions are involved:  (1) a requirement ( 88.16.180) that both enrolled and registered oil tankers of at least 50,000 deadweight tons (DWT) carry a Washington-licensed pilot while navigating the Sound; (2) a requirement ( 88.16.190(2)) that enrolled and registered oil tankers of from 40,000 to 125,000 DWT satisfy certain design or safety standards, or else use tug escorts while operating in the Sound; and (3) a ban on the operation in the Sound of any tanker exceeding 125,000 DWT ( 88.16.190(1)).  A three-judge District Court adjudged the statute void in its entirety, upholding appellees' contentions that all the Tanker Law's operative provisions were preempted by federal law particularly the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 (PWSA), which is designed to insure vessel safety and the protection of navigable waters and adjacent shore areas from tanker oil spillage.  Title I of the PWSA empowers the Secretary of Transportation to establish, operate, and require compliance with ""vessel traffic services and systems"" for ports subject to congested traffic and to control vessel traffic in especially hazardous areas by, among other things, establishing vessel size limitations.  Pursuant to this Title, the Secretary, through his delegate, has promulgated the Puget Sound Vessel Traffic System, which contains general and communication rules, vessel movement reporting requirements, a traffic separation scheme, special ship movement rules applying to Rosario Strait (where, under a local Coast Guard rule, the passage of more than one 70,000 DWT vessel -- in bad weather, 40,000 DWT -- in either direction at a given time is prohibited), and other requirements.  A State, though permitted to impose higher equipment or safety standards, may do so ""for structures only.""  Title II, whose goals are to provide vessel safety and protect the marine environment, provides that the Secretary shall issue such rules and regulations as may be necessary with respect to the design, construction, and operation of oil tankers; provides for inspection of vessels for 
Page 435 U. S. 152
 compliance with the Secretary's safety and environmental regulations; and prohibits the carrying of specified cargoes absent issuance of a certificate of inspection evidencing compliance with the regulations.  Title 46 U.S.C.  364 provides that every coastwise seagoing steam vessel subject to federal navigation laws not sailing under register shall, when under way, be under the control and direction of pilots licensed by the Coast Guard.

No. 76-938
Argued December 7, 1977
Decided March 1, 1978
435 U.S. 40

Syllabus 
Respondent Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), a collective bargaining agent for a multiemployer bargaining unit composed of various employers of Pacific coast dockworkers, entered into a collective bargaining agreement with respondent Union regarding nonmember use of dockworkers jointly registered and dispatched through PMA-Union hiring halls whereby the nonmembers would participate in all fringe benefit programs, pay the same dues and assessments as PMA members, use ""steady"" men in the same way as members, and be treated as members during work stoppages.  Various nonmember public ports, which had previously competitively made separate (and assertedly in several respects more advantageous) agreements with the Union and the PMA, filed a petition with petitioner Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) asserting that the collective bargaining agreement was subject to filing and approval under  15 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (Act), which requires the filing of agreements between a common carrier by water (or ""other person"" furnishing facilities in connection with such a carrier) and another such carrier or person, including those agreements ""controlling, regulating, preventing, or destroying competition.""  The FMC is empowered to ""disapprove, cancel, or modify"" any such agreement that it finds to be unjustly discriminatory or to be detrimental to commerce or the public interest.  Before FMC approval or after disapproval, agreements subject to filing are unlawful, and may not be implemented.  Lawful agreements are excepted from the antitrust laws.  The FMC severed for initial determination the issues of its jurisdiction over the challenged agreement and whether there were considerations in the national labor policy that would nevertheless exempt the agreement from the filing and approval requirements of  15.  The FMC found that the purpose of the agreement was to place nonmembers on the same basis as members of the PMA, and that its effect was to control or affect competition between members and nonmembers.  Applying the standards articulated in United Stevedoring Corp. v. Boston Shipping Assn., 16 F.M.C. 7, the FMC found the agreement to be outside the protection of an FMC-recognized labor exemption, and therefore subject to filing 
Page 435 U. S. 41
 under  15.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that any collective bargaining agreement, regardless of its impact on competition, was exempt from the  15 filing requirements.  Though recognizing that its holding precluded for collective bargaining agreements the antitrust immunity that  15 approval provides, even in cases where shipping considerations would support an exemption, the court felt its holding necessary to implement the collective bargaining system established by the federal statutes dealing with labor-management relations, including those in the shipping industry.  Alternatively, the court held that, if its per se rule was infirm, the FMC had erred in refusing to exempt the challenged agreement.
Held:
1. Collective bargaining agreements, as a class, are not categorically exempt from  15's filing requirements.  Pp.  435 U. S. 53-60.
(a) Because  15 provides that an approved agreement will not be subject to the antitrust laws, it is clear that Congress (1) assigned to the FMC, not the courts, the task of initially determining which anticompetitive restraints are to be approved and which are to be disapproved under the general statutory guidelines, and (2) anticipated that various anticompetitive restraints, forbidden by the antitrust laws in other contexts, would be acceptable in the shipping industry.  Pp.  435 U. S. 53-56.
(b) The Court of Appeals' conclusion that prompt implementation of lawful collective bargaining agreements could not be realized under the  15 procedure overlooked the fact that, under the Act's terms, the vast majority of collective bargaining arrangements would not be candidates for disapproval under  15, and would be routinely approved even if filed.  The FMC has determined that it will recognize a ""labor exemption"" from  15 filing requirements for collective bargaining contracts falling within the boundaries of the exemption defined by announced criteria like those applicable to the labor exemption from the antitrust laws.  Pp.  435 U. S. 56-58.
(c) The FMC's procedure for conditional approval of filed agreements pending a final decision as to their legality is adequate to overcome the Court of Appeals' concern that the  15 procedures would prevent ""the maintenance or prompt restoration of industrial peace.""  Pp.  435 U. S. 59-60.
2. The Court of Appeals also erred in its alternative ground of decision that, even under a balancing test weighing Shipping Act and labor relations considerations, the challenged agreement should be exempt from filing, in support of which view the court suggested that the FMC had failed to realize that the agreement was an effort to force the public ports into a multiemployer bargaining unit against their will, an issue exclusively within the domain of the National Labor Relations Board.  Here,

Syllabus 
The academic performance of students at the University of Missouri-Kansas City Medical School is periodically assessed by the Council of Evaluation, a faculty-student body that can recommend various actions, including probation and dismissal; its recommendations are reviewed by the faculty Coordinating Committee, with ultimate approval by the Dean.  After several faculty members had expressed dissatisfaction with the clinical performance of respondent medical student during a pediatrics rotation, the Council recommended that she be advanced to her final year on a probationary basis.  Following further faculty dissatisfaction with respondent's clinical performance that year, the Council, in the middle of the year, again evaluated her academic progress, and concluded that she should not be considered for graduation in June of that year, and that, absent ""radical improvement,"" she be dropped as a student.  As an ""appeal"" of that decision, respondent was allowed to take examinations under the supervision of seven practicing physicians, only two of whom thereafter recommended that respondent be allowed to graduate on schedule.  Two others recommended that she be dropped from the school immediately; and three recommended that she not be allowed to graduate as scheduled, but that she be continued on probation.  The Council then reaffirmed its prior position.  At a subsequent meeting, having noted that respondent's recent surgery rotation had been rated ""low-satisfactory,"" the Council concluded that, barring reports of radical improvement, respondent should not be allowed to reenroll; and when a report on another rotation turned out to be negative, the Council recommended that respondent be dropped.  When notified of that decision, which the Coordinating Committee and Dean had approved, respondent appealed to the Provost, who, after review, sustained the decision.  Respondent thereafter brought this action against petitioner officials under 42 U.S.C.  1983, contending, inter alia, that she had not been accorded due process prior to her dismissal.  The District Court, after a full trial, concluded that respondent had been afforded all rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held: 
Page 435 U. S. 79

1. The procedures leading to respondent's dismissal for academic deficiencies, under which respondent was fully informed of faculty dissatisfaction with her clinical progress and the consequent threat to respondent's graduation and continued enrollment, did not violate the Due Process  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Dismissals for academic (as opposed to disciplinary) cause do not necessitate a hearing before the school's decisionmaking body.  Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565, distinguished.  Pp.  435 U. S. 84-91.
2. Though respondent contends that the case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals for consideration of her claim of deprivation of substantive due process, this case, as the District Court correctly concluded, reveals no showing of arbitrariness or capriciousness that would warrant such a disposition, even if it were deemed appropriate for courts to review under an arbitrariness standard an academic decision of a public educational institution.

As an ""appeal"" of that decision, respondent was allowed to take examinations under the supervision of seven practicing physicians, only two of whom thereafter recommended that respondent be allowed to graduate on schedule.  Two others recommended that she be dropped from the school immediately; and three recommended that she not be allowed to graduate as scheduled, but that she be continued on probation.  The Council then reaffirmed its prior position.  At a subsequent meeting, having noted that respondent's recent surgery rotation had been rated ""low-satisfactory,"" the Council concluded that, barring reports of radical improvement, respondent should not be allowed to reenroll; and when a report on another rotation turned out to be negative, the Council recommended that respondent be dropped.  When notified of that decision, which the Coordinating Committee and Dean had approved, respondent appealed to the Provost, who, after review, sustained the decision.  Respondent thereafter brought this action against petitioner officials under 42 U.S.C.  1983, contending, inter alia, that she had not been accorded due process prior to her dismissal.  The District Court, after a full trial, concluded that respondent had been afforded all rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:

1. The procedures leading to respondent's dismissal for academic deficiencies, under which respondent was fully informed of faculty dissatisfaction with her clinical progress and the consequent threat to respondent's graduation and continued enrollment, did not violate the Due Process  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Dismissals for academic (as opposed to disciplinary) cause do not necessitate a hearing before the school's decisionmaking body.  Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565, distinguished.  Pp.  435 U. S. 84-91.
2. Though respondent contends that the case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals for consideration of her claim of deprivation of substantive due process, this case, as the District Court correctly concluded, reveals no showing of arbitrariness or capriciousness that would warrant such a disposition, even if it were deemed appropriate for courts to review under an arbitrariness standard an academic decision of a public educational institution.

Syllabus 
The punishment for bank robbery under 18 U.S.C.  2113(a) may be enhanced under  2113(d) when the robbery is committed ""by the use of a dangerous weapon or device.""  Title 18 U.S.C.  924(c) provides that whoever ""uses a firearm to commit any felony for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States,"" shall be subject to a penalty in addition to the punishment provided for the commission of such felony.  Petitioners were convicted of two separate aggravated bank robberies and of using firearms to commit the robberies, in violation of  2113(a) and (d) and 924(c), and were sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment on the robbery and firearms counts, the District Court rejecting their contention that the imposition of the cumulative penalties for the two crimes was impermissible because the  2113(d) charges merged with the firearms offenses for purposes of sentencing.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  In a prosecution growing out of a single transaction of bank robbery with firearms, a defendant may not be sentenced under both  2113(d) and  924(c).  This construction of those provisions is supported not only by  924(c)'s legislative history, but also by the established rules of statutory construction that ""ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity,"" United States v.

Syllabus 
Petitioners, youth offenders, pleaded guilty to various federal offenses and, under  5010(a) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act (YCA), were given suspended sentences and placed on probation, which was conditioned on payment of fines and, in one instance, on making restitution.  Their convictions were affirmed in the courts below.  While now conceding that restitution is a permissible condition of probation under the YCA, petitioners contend that a sentence of probation under  5010(a) is a substitute for any other penalty provision, and that, since  5010(a) does not expressly authorize fines, the authority to impose them cannot be imputed from any other penalty provision.  They argue, moreover, that a fine is necessarily punitive and contrary to the rehabilitative goals of the YCA.
Held:  When a youth offender is placed on probation under  5010(a), restitution may be required, and, when the otherwise applicable penalty provision permits, a fine may be imposed as a condition of probation.  Pp.  434 U. S. 549-554.
(a) Though the language of  5010(a) neither grants nor withholds the authority to impose a fine or to order restitution,  5023(a) of the YCA incorporates by reference the authority conferred under the general probation statute, 18 U.S.C.  3651 (1976 ed.), to permit such an exaction, and it is clear from the YCA's legislative history that Congress' purpose in adopting  5023(a) was to assure that a sentence under  5010(a) would not displace the authority under  3651 to impose a fine and order restitution as conditions of probation.  Pp.  434 U. S. 549-553.

The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that prisoners are entitled to First and Fourteenth Amendment protection for their outgoing mail, that the claim in question stated a cause of action under  1983, and that summary judgment for petitioners was improper because, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to respondent, petitioners were not entitled to prevail as a matter of law.

434 U.S. 575

Syllabus 
In a private civil action for lost wages under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), a trial by jury is available where sought by one of the parties, since, although the ADEA contains no provision expressly granting a right to jury trial in such cases, the ADEA's structure demonstrates a congressional intent to grant such a right.  Pp.  434 U. S. 577-585.
(a) The directive of  7(b) of the ADEA that the Act be enforced in accordance with the ""powers, remedies, and procedures"" of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a significant indication of Congress' intent.  Long before the ADEA was enacted, courts had uniformly interpreted the FLSA to afford a right to jury trial in private actions pursuant to that Act.  Congress can be presumed to have been aware of that interpretation, and, by incorporating certain remedial and procedural provisions of the FLSA into the ADEA, Congress demonstrated its intention to afford a right to jury trial.  Pp.  434 U. S. 581-582.
(b) By directing in  7(b) of the ADEA that actions for lost wages be treated as actions for unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation under the FLSA, Congress dictated that the jury trial right then available to enforce that FLSA liability would also be available in private actions under the ADEA.  This conclusion is supported by the language of  7(b) empowering a court to grant ""legal or equitable relief"" and of  7(c) authorizing individuals to bring actions for ""legal or equitable relief.""  It can be inferred that Congress knew the significance of the term ""legal,"" and that, by providing specifically for ""legal"" relief, it intended that there would be a jury trial on demand to enforce liability for amounts deemed to be unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation.  Pp.  434 U. S. 582-583.
(c) A contrary congressional intent cannot be found by comparing the ADEA with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Assuming, arguendo, that Congress did not intend that there be jury trials in private actions under Title VII, there is a material difference between the ADEA and Title VII.  In contrast to the ADEA, Title VII does not, in so many words, authorize ""legal"" relief, and the availability of 
Page 434 U. S. 576

			"|"Lorillard v. Pons
No. 76-1346
Argued December 6, 1977
Decided February 22, 1978
434 U.S. 575

Syllabus 
In a private civil action for lost wages under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), a trial by jury is available where sought by one of the parties, since, although the ADEA contains no provision expressly granting a right to jury trial in such cases, the ADEA's structure demonstrates a congressional intent to grant such a right.  Pp.  434 U. S. 577-585.
(a) The directive of  7(b) of the ADEA that the Act be enforced in accordance with the ""powers, remedies, and procedures"" of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a significant indication of Congress' intent.  Long before the ADEA was enacted, courts had uniformly interpreted the FLSA to afford a right to jury trial in private actions pursuant to that Act.  Congress can be presumed to have been aware of that interpretation, and, by incorporating certain remedial and procedural provisions of the FLSA into the ADEA, Congress demonstrated its intention to afford a right to jury trial.  Pp.  434 U. S. 581-582.
(b) By directing in  7(b) of the ADEA that actions for lost wages be treated as actions for unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation under the FLSA, Congress dictated that the jury trial right then available to enforce that FLSA liability would also be available in private actions under the ADEA.  This conclusion is supported by the language of  7(b) empowering a court to grant ""legal or equitable relief"" and of  7(c) authorizing individuals to bring actions for ""legal or equitable relief.""  It can be inferred that Congress knew the significance of the term ""legal,"" and that, by providing specifically for ""legal"" relief, it intended that there would be a jury trial on demand to enforce liability for amounts deemed to be unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation.  Pp.  434 U. S. 582-583.
(c) A contrary congressional intent cannot be found by comparing the ADEA with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Assuming, arguendo, that Congress did not intend that there be jury trials in private actions under Title VII, there is a material difference between the ADEA and Title VII.  In contrast to the ADEA, Title VII does not, in so many words, authorize ""legal"" relief, and the availability of 
Page 434 U. S. 576
 backpay is a matter of equitable discretion.  It appears, moreover, that Congress rejected the course of adopting Title VII procedures for ADEA actions in favor of incorporating the FLSA procedures.  Pp.  434 U. S. 583-585.

Syllabus 
Wisconsin statutes, as a general rule, do not allow trucks longer than 55 feet or pulling more than one other vehicle to be operated on highways within that State without a permit.  Implementing regulations set forth the conditions under which ""trailer train"" and other classes of permits will be issued, and contain a great number of exceptions to the general rule.  Appellant motor carriers were denied permits to operate 65-foot double trailer units on certain interstate highways in Wisconsin on the ground that their proposed operations were not within the narrow scope of the regulations specifying when ""trailer train"" permits will be issued.  Appellants then filed suit in Federal District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the regulations barring their operation of 65-foot doubles burdened and discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  At the trial, appellants presented extensive, uncontradicted evidence that the 65-foot doubles are as safe as, if not safer than, 55-foot singles when operated on limited-access, four-lane divided highways, and also presented uncontradicted evidence that their operations are disrupted, their costs raised, and their service slowed by the challenged regulations because they are forced to haul doubles across the State separately or around the State or to incur delays caused by using singles, instead of doubles, to pick up and deliver goods, and are prevented from accepting interline transfers of 65-foot doubles.  In addition, appellants' evidence showed that Wisconsin routinely allows a great number and variety of vehicles over 55 feet long to operate on state highways.  A three-judge court ruled against appellants.
Held:  On the record, the challenged regulations violate the Commerce Clause because they place a substantial burden on interstate commerce and make no more than the most speculative contribution to highway safety.  The great number of exceptions to the general 55-foot rule, and especially those that discriminate in favor of local industry, weaken the presumption of validity in favor of the general limit because they undermine the assumption that the State's

No. 76-635
Argued October 11, 1977
Decided February 21, 1978
434 U.S. 452

Syllabus 
The Multistate Tax Compact was entered into by a number of States for the stated purposes of (1) facilitating proper determination of state and local tax liability of multistate taxpayers; (2) promoting uniformity and compatibility in state tax systems; (3) facilitating taxpayer convenience and compliance in the filing of tax returns and in other phases of tax administration; and (4) avoiding duplicative taxation.  To these ends, the Compact created the appellee Multistate Tax Commission.  Each member State is authorized to request that the Commission perform an audit on its behalf, and the Commission may seek compulsory process in aid of its auditing power in the courts of any State specifically permitting such procedure.  Individual States retain complete control over all legislative and administrative action affecting tax rates, the composition of the tax base, and the means and methods of determining tax liability and collecting any taxes due.  Each member State is free to adopt or reject the Commission's rules and regulations, and to withdraw from the Compact at any time.  Appellants, on behalf of themselves and all other multistate taxpayers threatened with Commission audits, brought this action in District Court against appellees (the Commission, its members, and its Executive Director) challenging the constitutionality of the Compact on the grounds, inter alia, that (1) it is invalid under the Compact Clause of the Constitution (which provides:  ""No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State""); (2) it unreasonably burdens interstate commerce; and (3) it violates the rights of multistate taxpayers under the Fourteenth Amendment.  A three-judge court granted summary judgment for appellees.
Held:
1. The Multistate Tax Compact is not invalid under the rule of Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U. S. 503,  148 U. S. 519, that the application of the Compact Clause is limited to agreements that are
""directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States.""
Pp.  434 U. S. 459-478.
(a) The Compact's multilateral nature and its establishment of 
Page 434 U. S. 453
 an ongoing administrative body do not, standing alone, present significant potential for conflict with the principles underlying the Compact Clause.  The number of parties to an agreement is irrelevant if it does not impermissibly enhance state power at the expense of federal supremacy, and the powers delegated to the administrative body must also be judged in terms of such enhancement.  P.  434 U. S. 472.
(b) Under the test of whether the particular compact enhances state power quoad the Federal Government, this Compact does not purport to authorize member States to exercise any powers they could not exercise in its absence, nor is there any delegation of sovereign power to the Commission, each State being free to adopt or reject the Commission's rules and regulations and to withdraw from the Compact at any time.  Pp.  434 U. S. 472-473.
(c) Appellants' various contentions that certain procedures and requirements of the Commission encroach upon federal supremacy with respect to interstate commerce and foreign relations and impair the sovereign rights of nonmember States, are without merit, primarily because each member State could adopt similar procedures and requirements individually without regard to the Compact.  Even if state power is enhanced to some degree, it is not at the expense of federal supremacy.  Pp.  434 U. S. 473-478.
2. Appellants' allegations that the Commission has abused its powers by harassing members of the plaintiff class in that it induced several States to issue burdensome requests for production of documents and to deviate from state law by issuing arbitrary assessments against taxpayers who refuse to comply with such orders, do not establish that the Compact violates the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment.  But even if such allegations were supported by the record, they are irrelevant to the facial validity of the Compact, it being only the individual State, not the Commission, that has the power to issue an assessment, whether arbitrary or not.

Argued October 31, 1977
Decided February 21, 1978
434 U.S. 497

Syllabus 
After respondent was found guilty of murder, the Arizona trial court granted a new trial because the prosecution had withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense.  At the beginning of the new trial, the trial judge, after extended argument, granted the prosecutor's motion for a mistrial predicated on improper and prejudicial comment during defense counsel's opening statement that evidence had been hidden from respondent at the first trial, but the judge did not expressly find that there was ""manifest necessity"" for a mistrial or expressly state that he had considered alternative solutions.  The Arizona Supreme Court refused to review the mistrial ruling, and respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court.  While agreeing that defense counsel's opening statement was improper, that court held that respondent could not be placed in further jeopardy and granted the writ because the state trial judge had failed to find ""manifest necessity"" for a mistrial.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Although the extent of the possible juror bias cannot be measured and some trial judges might have proceeded with the trial after giving the jury appropriate cautionary instructions, nevertheless the overriding interest in the evenhanded administration of justice requires that the highest degree of respect be accorded to the trial judge's decision to declare a mistrial based on his assessment of the prejudicial impact of defense counsel's opening statement.  Pp.  434 U. S. 503-514.
2. The record supports the conclusion that the trial judge exercised ""sound discretion"" in declaring a mistrial, it appearing that he acted responsibly and deliberately and accorded careful consideration to respondent's interest in having the trial concluded in a single proceeding, and therefore the mistrial order is supported by the ""high degree"" of necessity required in a case of this kind.  Pp.  434 U. S. 514-516.
3. Since the record provides sufficient justification for the trial judge's mistrial ruling, that ruling is not subject to collateral attack in a federal court simply because the judge failed to make an explicit finding of ""manifest necessity"" for a mistrial that would avoid a valid double jeopardy plea or to articulate on the record all the factors that informed the deliberate exercise of his discretion.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 21, 1978
 The judgment is affirmed.
 Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting. 
 Appellants seek to appeal to this Court a decision of a three-judge District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1253. That section provides for a direct appeal from any ""suit or proceeding required by any Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges."" If no Act of Congress required a three-judge District Court to hear this suit, the decision cannot be appealed directly to this Court pursuant to 1253 even though a three-judge court may have been in fact convened. Appeal lies instead to the United States Court of Appeals. Under such circumstances we do not have jurisdiction to consider the appeal. Board of Regents v. New Left Education Project, 404 U.S. 541, 30 L. Ed.2d 697 (1972);

 It is the second clause of 2281 that is relevant here since appellees challenge no state statute. The District Court based its jurisdiction on a presumed challenge to various regulations promulgated and issued by the Director of the Department of Corrections of the State of California.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 21, 1978
 The judgment is affirmed.
 Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting. 
 Appellants seek to appeal to this Court a decision of a three-judge District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1253. That section provides for a direct appeal from any ""suit or proceeding required by any Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges."" If no Act of Congress required a three-judge District Court to hear this suit, the decision cannot be appealed directly to this Court pursuant to 1253 even though a three-judge court may have been in fact convened. Appeal lies instead to the United States Court of Appeals. Under such circumstances we do not have jurisdiction to consider the appeal. Board of Regents v.

Denied.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.
There is a natural tendency on the part of any conscientious court to avoid embroiling itself in a controversial area of social policy unless absolutely required to do so.  I therefore completely understand, if I do not agree with, the Court's decision to deny certiorari in this case.  In quick summary, the University of Missouri, exercising the traditional authority granted to it by the State to regulate what student organizations will have access to campus facilities, denied recognition to respondent Gay Lib.  The denial stemmed from a finding by a University-appointed hearing officer that formal University 
Page 434 U. S. 1081
 recognition would ""tend to expand homosexual behavior which will cause increased violations of [the State's sodomy statute].""  Respondents, choosing to remove the dispute from its traditional University setting to the federal courts, sued in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, claiming that the denial infringed their constitutional rights to free speech and freedom of association.  The District Court held that the University had not violated respondents' constitutional rights.  Gay Lib v. University of Missouri, 416 F.Supp. 1350 (1976).  Respondents, continuing to pursue a judicial solution to their problem, persuaded two judges of a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to reverse the District Court.  558 F.2d 848 (1977).  A petition for rehearing en banc was denied by an equally divided court.  The University now seeks certiorari here to review that decision.

No. 76-1383
Argued November 28-29, 1977
Decided January 23, 1978
434 U.S. 412

Syllabus 
Two years after a racial discrimination charge under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had been filed against petitioner company, respondent, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), notified the complainant that its conciliation efforts had failed and that she had the right to sue the company, which she did not do.  Almost two years later,  14 of the 1972 amendments to Title VII authorized the EEOC to sue in its own name on charges ""pending"" with the EEOC on the effective date of the amendments.  The EEOC then sued petitioner on complainant's charge, and the District Court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the charge had not been ""pending"" at the time of the 1972 amendments.  The company then petitioned for the allowance of attorney's fees against the EEOC pursuant to  706(k) of Title VII, which authorizes a district court, in its discretion, to allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney's fee.  Finding that the EEOC's action in bringing the suit was not ""unreasonable or meritless,"" and that its statutory interpretation of  14 was not ""frivolous,"" the District Court ruled that an award to petitioner of attorney's fees was not justified.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Although a prevailing plaintiff in a Title VII proceeding is ordinarily to be awarded attorney's fees by the district court in all but special circumstances, a prevailing defendant is to be awarded such fees only when the court, in the exercise of its discretion, has found that the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.  Pp.  434 U. S. 415-422.
(a) There are at least two strong equitable considerations favoring an attorney's fee award to a prevailing Title VII plaintiff that are wholly absent in the case of a Title VII defendant, viz., the plaintiff is Congress' chosen instrument to vindicate ""a policy that Congress considered of the highest priority,"" Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, 390 U. S. 400,  390 U. S. 402, and when a district court awards counsel fees to a prevailing plaintiff, it is awarding them against a violator of federal law.  Pp.  434 U. S. 418-419. 
Page 434 U. S. 413

(b) No statutory provision would have been necessary had an award of attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant been based only on the plaintiff's bad faith in bringing the action, for even under the American common law rule (which ordinarily dos not allow attorney's fees to the prevailing party), such fees can be awarded against a party who has proceeded in bad faith.  P.  434 U. S. 419.

(a) Since the right to marry is of fundamental importance, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.

(b) The state interests assertedly served by the challenged statute unnecessarily impinge on the right to marry.  If the statute is designed to furnish an opportunity to counsel persons with prior child support obligations before further such obligations are incurred, it neither expressly requires counseling nor provides for automatic approval after counseling is completed.  The statute cannot be justified as encouraging an applicant to support his children.  By the proceeding, the State, which already possesses numerous other means for exacting compliance with support obligations, merely prevents the applicant from getting married, without ensuring support of the applicant's prior children.  Though it is suggested that the statute protects the ability of marriage applicants to meet prior support obligations before new ones are incurred, the statute is both underinclusive (as it does not limit new financial commitments other than those arising out of the contemplated marriage) and overinclusive (since the new spouse may better the applicant's financial situation).

An employer in the construction business made an agreement with respondent union under  8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act, which provides that it shall not be an unfair labor practice for unions and employers in the construction, industry to enter into ""prehire"" agreements before the majority status of the union has been established.  The contract contained no union security clause requiring employees to become union members within a specified period of time.  After the employer later undertook construction projects with nonunion labor, the union picketed those projects (one for more than 30 days) with signs stating that the employer was violating the agreement with the union, though the union did not represent a majority of the employees at the jobsites and had not petitioned for a representation election.  The employer then filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that the union was violating  8(b)(7)(C) of the Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for an uncertified union to picket for the purpose of forcing an employer to recognize the union as a bargaining representative of his employees, for more than 30 days, unless a petition for an election has been filed within that period.  The NLRB issued a cease and desist order in favor of the employer, concluding that an object of the picketing was to force the employer to bargain with a union that was not currently certified as the representative of the employees working for the employer.  The Court of Appeals, denying enforcement of the NLRB's order, held that the validity of a  8(f) prehire contract conferred the right to enforce the contract by picketing as well as the right, upon a contract breach, to file and prevail on an unfair labor practice charge against the employer for failure to bargain.
Held:  Respondent's picketing was for recognitional purposes, and constituted an unfair labor practice under  8(b)(7)(C).  An uncertified union like respondent, which does not represent a majority of the employees, may not under that provision engage in picketing in an effort to enforce a prehire agreement with the employer.

(a) Section 8(f), which contains a proviso clause that a ""prehire"" contract shall not bar a petition for an election under  9(c), was not intended to relieve a union party to a prehire agreement from the obligation to achieve majority support before it can require the employer to honor such an agreement by means of  8(a)(5), or to accord the union the status of bargaining representative that would exempt it from the recognitional picketing prohibition of  8(b)(7).  The NLRB therefore correctly held that, when the union picketed to enforce its prehire agreement, the employer could file and prevail on a  8(b)(7) charge, because the union lacked majority credentials at the picketed projects.  Picketing to enforce the  8(f) contract was tantamount to recognitional picketing, and  8(b)(7)(C) was infringed when the union failed to request an election within 30 days.  Pp.  434 U. S. 342-346.
(b) Because  8(b)(7) was adopted to ensure employees the voluntary, uncoerced selection of a bargaining representative, the NLRB did not err in holding that that provision applies to a minority union's picketing to enforce a prehire contract.  Nor does the NLRB's position, which is entitled to considerable deference, render  8(f) meaningless, since, but for that provision, neither party could execute a prehire agreement without committing an unfair labor practice, and the voluntary observance of an otherwise valid  8(f) contract is left unchallenged.

No. 76-719.
Argued October 31, 1977
Decided January 17, 1978
434 U.S. 335

Syllabus 
An employer in the construction business made an agreement with respondent union under  8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act, which provides that it shall not be an unfair labor practice for unions and employers in the construction, industry to enter into ""prehire"" agreements before the majority status of the union has been established.  The contract contained no union security clause requiring employees to become union members within a specified period of time.  After the employer later undertook construction projects with nonunion labor, the union picketed those projects (one for more than 30 days) with signs stating that the employer was violating the agreement with the union, though the union did not represent a majority of the employees at the jobsites and had not petitioned for a representation election.  The employer then filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that the union was violating  8(b)(7)(C) of the Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for an uncertified union to picket for the purpose of forcing an employer to recognize the union as a bargaining representative of his employees, for more than 30 days, unless a petition for an election has been filed within that period.

Syllabus 
A foreign nation otherwise entitled to sue in the courts of this country held to be a ""person"" within the meaning of  4 of the Clayton Act, and thus to be entitled to sue for treble damages under the federal antitrust laws to the same extent as any other plaintiff.  Pp.  434 U. S. 311-320.
(a) Though no statutory provision or legislative history clearly covers the question whether a foreign nation is a ""person"" as the word is used in  4 (which gives ""any person"" injured by antitrust violations the right to sue in district courts), Congress intended the word to have a broad and inclusive meaning, and in light of the antitrust laws' expansive remedial purpose, the Court has not narrowly construed the term.  Pp  434 U. S. 311-313.
(b) Congress did not intend to make the treble damages remedy available only to consumers in this country, as is manifest from the inclusion of foreign corporations within the statutory definition of ""person"" and the fact that the antitrust laws extend to trade ""with foreign countries.""  Pp.  434 U. S. 313-314.
(c) To deny a foreign plaintiff injured by an antitrust violation the right to sue would defeat the two purposes of  4:  to deter violators and deprive them of the ""fruits of their illegality,'"" and ""to compensate victims of antitrust violations for their injuries.""  Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720,  431 U. S. 746.  Pp.  434 U. S. 314-315.
(d) When a foreign nation enters our commercial markets as a purchaser of goods or services, it can be victimized by anticompetitive practices just as surely as a private person or a domestic State, which, in Georgia v. Evans, 316 U. S. 159, was held to be a ""person"" within the meaning of the antitrust laws; and there is no reason why Congress would have wanted to deprive a foreign nation of the treble damages remedy available to others who suffer through violations of the antitrust laws.  Pp.  434 U. S. 315-318.
(e) Foreign nations are generally entitled to prosecute civil claims in the courts of the United States upon the same basis as domestic corporations or individuals.  To afford foreign nations the protection of the antitrust laws does not involve a judicial encroachment upon foreign policy, since only governments recognized by and at peace with the United States are entitled to access to this country's courts, and it is

434 U.S. 246

Syllabus 
Under Georgia law no adoption of a child born in wedlock is permitted without the consent of each living parent (including divorced or separated parents) who has not voluntarily surrendered rights in the child or been adjudicated an unfit parent.  In contrast,  74-403(3) and 74-203 of the Georgia Code provide that only the mother's consent is required for the adoption of an illegitimate child.  However, the father may acquire veto authority over the adoption if he has legitimated the child pursuant to  74-103 of the Code.  These provisions were applied to deny appellant, the father of an illegitimate child, authority to prevent the adoption of the child by the husband of the child's mother.  Until the adoption petition was filed, appellant had not attempted to legitimate the child, who had always been in the mother's custody and was then living with the mother and her husband, appellees.  In opposing the adoption, appellant, seeking to legitimate the child but not to secure custody, claimed that  74-203 and 74-403(3), as applied to his case, violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The trial court, granting the adoption on the ground that it was in the ""best interests of the child"" and that legitimation by appellant was not, rejected appellant's constitutional claims, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. Under the circumstances, appellant's substantive rights under the Due Process Clause were not violated by application of a ""best interests of the child"" standard.  This is not a case in which the unwed father at any time had, or sought, custody of his child, or in which the proposed adoption would place the child with a new set of parents with whom the child had never lived.  Rather, the result of adoption here is to give full recognition to an existing family unit.  Pp.  434 U. S. 254-255.
2. Equal protection principles do not require that appellant's authority to veto an adoption be measured by the same standard as is applied to a divorced father, from whose interests appellant's interests are readily distinguishable.  The State was not foreclosed from recognizing the difference in the extent of commitment to a child's welfare between that of appellant., an unwed father who has never shouldered any significant responsibility for the child's rearing, and that of a divorced father who

Syllabus 
After unsuccessful efforts to overturn his state court conviction on direct appeal and state collateral attack, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in a Federal District Court, which on October 21, 1975, ordered his release from respondent Corrections Director's custody unless the State retried him within 60 days.  The court held no evidentiary hearing, but based its order on the habeas corpus petition, respondent's ""motion to dismiss,"" and the state court record.  Twenty-eight days after entry of the order, respondent moved for a stay of the conditional release order and for an evidentiary hearing.  The District Court granted the motion, but, after a hearing, ruled, on January 26, 1976, that the writ of habeas corpus was properly issued.

No. 76-5325
Argued October 31, 1977
Decided January 10, 1978
434 U.S. 257

Syllabus 
After unsuccessful efforts to overturn his state court conviction on direct appeal and state collateral attack, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in a Federal District Court, which on October 21, 1975, ordered his release from respondent Corrections Director's custody unless the State retried him within 60 days.  The court held no evidentiary hearing, but based its order on the habeas corpus petition, respondent's ""motion to dismiss,"" and the state court record.  Twenty-eight days after entry of the order, respondent moved for a stay of the conditional release order and for an evidentiary hearing.  The District Court granted the motion, but, after a hearing, ruled, on January 26, 1976, that the writ of habeas corpus was properly issued.  Respondent immediately filed a notice of appeal seeking review of both the October 21 and January 26 orders, and the Court of Appeals reversed.

No. 76-911
Argued October 11, 1977
Decided January 10, 1978
434 U.S. 275

Syllabus 
The Clean Air Act authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate ""emission standards"" for hazardous air pollutants.  The emission of an air pollutant in violation of an applicable emission standard is prohibited by  112(c)(1)(b), the knowing violation of which is made a criminal offense by  113(c)(1)(C).  Section 307(b)(1) provides that a petition for review of the Administrator's action in promulgating an emission standard may be filed only in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and under  307(b)(2) such action is not subject to judicial review in a civil or criminal enforcement proceeding.  Petitioner was indicted for violating  112(c)(1)(b) for allegedly having failed while demolishing a building to comply with an EPA regulation captioned ""National Emission Standard for Asbestos"" and specifying that a certain procedure or ""work practice"" be followed in demolition of buildings containing asbestos but not limiting asbestos emissions that occur during a demolition.  The District Court, finding that the cited regulation was not an ""emission standard"" within the meaning of  112(c), granted petitioner's motion to dismiss the indictment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  307(b) precluded petitioner from questioning in a criminal enforcement proceeding whether a regulation ostensibly promulgated under  112(c) was in fact an emission standard.
Held:
1. A defendant charged with a criminal violation under the Act may assert the defense that the ""emission standard"" with whose violation he is charged is not such a standard as Congress contemplated when it used the term even though that standard has not previously been subjected to a  307(b) review procedure.  Such procedure does not relieve the Government of the duty of proving, in a prosecution under  113(c)(1)(C) that the regulation allegedly violated is an ""emission standard,"" and a federal court in which such a prosecution is brought may determine whether or not the regulation that a defendant is alleged to have violated is an ""emission standard"" within the Act's meaning. From the totality of the statutory scheme, in which Congress dealt more leniently, either in terms of liability, notice, or available 
Page 434 U. S. 276
 defenses, with other infractions of EPA orders, but, in contrast, attached stringent sanctions to the violation of ""emission standards,"" it is clear that Congress intended to limit ""emission standards"" to regulations of a certain type and did not intend to empower the Administrator of EPA to make a regulation an ""emission standard"" by his mere designation.  Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, distinguished.  Pp.  434 U. S. 278-285.
2. The District Court did not err in holding that the regulation that petitioner was charged with violating was not an emission standard.  Section 112 itself distinguishes between emission standards and techniques to be used in achieving those standards, and the language of  11(b)(1)(b) clearly supports the conclusion that an emission standard was intended to be a quantitative limit on emissions, not a work-practice standard.  Recent amendments to the Act fortify that conclusion.  Pp.  434 U. S. 285-289.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Utah. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were convicted following a jury trial in the District Court for Weber County, Utah, for distributing pornographic material in violation of ch. 49, 1 and 4, 1975 Utah Laws (formerly codified at 8 Utah Code Ann. 76-10-1203 and 76-10-1204 (Supp.1975), current version at Utah Crim.Code 76-10-1203 and 76-10-1204 (1977)). The conviction was affirmed by the Utah Supreme Court. 565 P.2d 1112 (1977). 
 Section 76-10-1204 provided in pertinent part at the time of the alleged offense as follows: 
 ""(1) A person is guilty of distributing pornographic material when he knowingly: 
 * * * * * 
 ""(c) Distributes or offers to distribute, exhibits or offers to exhibit, any pornographic material to others . . . ."" 
 As used in 76-10-1204, ""pornographic material"" was defined by 76- 10-1203 as follows: 
 ""(a) The average person, applying contemporary community standards, finds that, taken as a whole, it appeals to prurient interest in sex; ""(b) It is patently offensive in the descr ption or depiction of nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, sadomasochistic abuse, or excretion; and ""(c) Taken as a whole it does not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. 
Page 434 U.S. 1023 , 1024
 ""(2) In any prosecution dealing with an offense relating to pornographic material or performances, or dealing in harmful material, the question whether material or a performance appeals to prurient interest in sex shall be determined with reference to average adults or average minors as the case may be. 
 ""(3) Neither the prosecution nor the defense shall be required to introduce expert witness testimony concerning the pornographic character of the material or performance which is the subject of a prosecution under this part."" 
 I adhere to my view that ""at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents."" Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 113 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). It is clear that, tested by that constitutional standard, 76-10-1204, as it incorporated the definition of ""pornographic material"" of 76-10-1203, was constitutionally overbroad and therefore invalid on its face. For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 47 (1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Utah Supreme Court was rendered after Miller, reverse. In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 483, 494, 495 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).
