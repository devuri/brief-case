No. 78-1183
Argued November 5, 1979
Decided December 10, 1979
444 U.S. 212

Syllabus 
Respondent local labor unions engaged in a number of unauthorized or ""wildcat"" strikes at petitioner employer's coal mines in violation of collective bargaining agreements between petitioner and respondent international union (UMWA).  The efforts of respondent regional subdivision (District 17) of UMWA to persuade the miners not to strike and to return to work were uniformly unsuccessful.  Petitioner subsequently brought suit against respondents in Federal District Court pursuant to  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, seeking injunctive relief and damages, and judgments were rendered against all respondents. The Court of Appeals affirmed in part the judgments against the local unions but vacated the judgments against UMWA and District 17, holding that the question was not whether UMWA or District 17 did everything they might have done to prevent the strikes or bring about their termination, but whether they instigated, supported, ratified, or encouraged the strikes, and that there was no evidence of the latter conduct.
Held:  Neither UMWA nor District 17 can be held liable in damages under the circumstances of this case.  No obligation on their part to use all reasonable means to prevent and end unauthorized strikes can be implied in law either because the collective bargaining agreements contained a provision for arbitration of disputes or because the agreements provided that the parties ""agree and affirm that they will maintain the integrity of this contract.""  Pp.  444 U. S. 216-222.
(a) The legislative history of  301 is clear that Congress limited a union's responsibility for strikes in breach of contract to cases where the union may be found responsible according to the common law rule of agency, and here petitioner failed to prove agency as required by  301(b) and(e).  Pp.  444 U. S. 216-218.
(b) The bargaining history of the collective bargaining agreements clearly shows that, whatever the integrity clause of the agreements may mean, the parties purposely decided not to impose on the union

No. 7738
Argued October 1, 1979
Decided December 4, 1979
444 U.S. 164

Syllabus 
Through dredging and filling operations in developing a marina-style subdivision community, petitioners, the owner and lessee of an area which included Kuapa Pond, a shallow lagoon on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, that was contiguous to a navigable bay and the Pacific Ocean but separated from the bay by a barrier beach, converted the pond into a marina, and thereby connected it to the bay.  The Army Corps of Engineers had advised petitioners that they were not required to obtain permits for the development of and operations in the pond, and petitioners ultimately made improvements that allowed boats access to and from the bay.  Petitioner lessee controls access to and use of the pond, which, under Hawaii law, was private property, and fees are charged for maintaining the pond.  Thereafter, the United States filed suit in Federal District Court against petitioners to resolve a dispute as to whether petitioners were required to obtain the Corps' authorization, in accordance with  10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899, for future improvements in the marina, and whether petitioners could deny the public access to the pond because, as a result of the improvements, it had become a navigable water of the United States.  In examining the scope of Congress' regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause, the District Court held that the pond was ""navigable water of the United States,"" subject to regulation by the Corps, but further held that the Government lacked authority to open the pond to the public without payment of compensation to the owner.  The Court of Appeals agreed that the pond fell within the scope of Congress' regulatory authority, but held, reversing the District Court, that, when petitioners converted the pond into a marina and thereby connected it to the bay, it became subject to the ""navigational servitude"" of the Federal Government, thus giving the public a right of access to what was once petitioners' private pond.
Held:  If the Government wishes to make what was formerly Kuapa Pond into a public aquatic park after petitioners have proceeded as far as they have here, it may not, without invoking its eminent domain power and paying just compensation, require them to allow the public free access to the dredged pond.  Although the dredged pond falls within 
Page 444 U. S. 165
 the definition of ""navigable waters"" as this Court has used that term in delimiting the boundaries of Congress' regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause, this Court has never held that the federal navigational servitude creates a blanket exception to the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment whenever Congress exercises its Commerce Clause authority to promote navigation.  Congress, in light of its extensive Commerce Clause authority over this Nation's waters, which does not depend on a stream's ""navigability,"" may prescribe rules governing petitioners' marina and may assure the public a free right of access to the marina if it so chooses, but whether a statute or regulation that goes so far amounts to a ""taking"" is an entirely separate question.  Here the Government's attempt to create a public right of access to the improved land goes so far beyond ordinary regulation or improvement for navigation involved in typical riparian condemnation cases as to amount to a taking requiring just compensation.

Syllabus 
A Federal District Court, pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, appointed respondent attorney to represent petitioner, an indigent defendant, in a federal criminal trial.  After petitioner was convicted and pending his unsuccessful appeal, he sued respondent in a Pennsylvania state court for alleged malpractice in respondent's conduct of the federal criminal trial.  The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that respondent was immune from liability.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed, resting its decision on federal law and holding that the justification for judicial immunity embraced in the federal system and encompassing prosecutors and grand jurors, as well as judges, was equally applicable to defense counsel as participants in judicial proceedings.
Held:  An attorney appointed by a federal judge to represent an indigent defendant in a federal criminal trial is not, as a matter of federal law, entitled to absolute immunity in a state malpractice suit brought against him by his former client.  Pp.  444 U. S. 199-205.
(a) There is nothing in the language, the legislative history, or the basic purpose of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 in providing compensation for court-appointed attorneys to support the conclusion that Pennsylvania must accept respondent's claim of immunity from liability for a state tort.  The fact that respondent was compensated from federal funds is not a sufficient basis for inferring that Congress intended to grant him immunity from malpractice suits.  Pp.  444 U. S. 199-201.
(b) The primary rationale for granting immunity to judges, prosecutors, and other public officials -- namely, the societal interest in providing such officials with the maximum ability to deal fearlessly and impartially with the public at large -- does not apply to court-appointed defense counsel sued for malpractice by his own client.  In contrast to other officers of the court, the primary office performed by appointed counsel parallels the office of privately retained counsel.  Although appointed counsel serves pursuant to statutory authorization and in furtherance of the federal interest in insuring effective representation of criminal defendants, his duty is not to the public at large, except in that general way.  His principal responsibility is to serve the undivided interests of his client, and, indeed, an indispensable element

 of the effective performance of his responsibilities is the ability to act independently of the Government and to oppose it in adversary litigation.  Pp.  444 U. S. 202-204.

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF LOUISIANA,
THIRD CIRCUIT
Respondent, the lessee of land traversed by man-made navigable canals entering other naturally navigable waterways, filed suit in a Louisiana state court seeking permanent injunctions against petitioners from trespassing on the land and making use of the canals.  Petitioners contended that, notwithstanding respondent's property rights, they were entitled as a matter of federal law -- without obtaining respondent's permission -- to enter the property, travel the canals, and engage in commercial fishing and shrimping activities.  The trial court entered summary judgment for respondent, and the Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed.
Held:  While the public has no general right of use of channels built on private property and with private funds in such a manner that they ultimately join with other navigable waterways, Kaiser Aetna v. United States, ante p.  444 U. S. 164, nevertheless if petitioners prove their allegations that respondent's system of artificial waterways destroyed the navigability of surrounding natural waterways, it cannot be said as a matter of law that such proof would not constitute a defense under federal law to respondent's prayer for injunctive relief.

No. 78-5937
Argued October 9, 1979
Decided November 28, 1979
444 U.S. 85

Syllabus 
On the strength of a complaint for a search warrant based on an informant's statements that he had observed tinfoil packets on the person of a bartender and behind the bar at a certain tavern and that he had been advised by the bartender that the latter would have heroin for sale on a certain date, a judge of an Illinois state court issued a warrant authorizing the search of the tavern and the person of the bartender for ""evidence of the offense of possession of a controlled substance.""  Upon entering the tavern to execute the warrant, police officers announced their purpose and advised those present that they were going to conduct a ""cursory search for weapons.""  The officer who searched the customers felt what he described as ""a cigarette pack with objects in it"" in his first pat-down of appellant, one of the customers.  The officer did not then remove this pack from appellant's pocket but, after patting down other customers, returned to appellant, frisked him again, retrieved the cigarette pack from his pants pocket, and found inside it six tinfoil packets containing heroin.  After appellant was indicted for unlawful possession of a controlled substance, he filed a pretrial motion to suppress the contraband seized from his person at the tavern.  The trial court denied the motion, finding that the search had been conducted under the authority of an Illinois statute which empowers law enforcement officers executing a search warrant to detain and search any person found on the premises in order to protect themselves from attack or to prevent the disposal or concealment of anything described in the warrant.  Appellant was convicted, and the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed, holding that the Illinois statute was not unconstitutional in its application to the facts of this case.
Held:  The searches of appellant and the seizure of what was in his pocket contravened the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  444 U. S. 90-96.
(a) When the search warrant was issued, the authorities had no probable cause to believe that any person found in the tavern, aside from the bartender, would be violating the law.  The complaint for the warrant did not allege that the tavern was frequented by persons illegally purchasing drugs or that the informant had ever seen a patron of the tavern purchase drugs from the bartender or any other person.  
Page 444 U. S. 86
 And probable cause to search appellant was still absent when the police executed the warrant; upon entering the tavern, the police did not recognize appellant and had no reason to believe that he had committed, was committing, or was about to commit any offense.  The police did possess a warrant based on probable cause to search the tavern where appellant happened to be when the warrant was executed, but a person's mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable cause to search that person.  Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40,  392 U. S. 62-63.  Although the warrant gave the officers authority to search the premises and the bartender, it gave them no authority to invade the constitutional protections possessed individually by the tavern's customers.  Pp.  444 U. S. 90-92.
(b) Nor was the action of the police constitutionally permissible on the theory that the first search of appellant constituted a reasonable frisk for weapons under the doctrine of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, and yielded probable cause to believe that appellant was carrying narcotics, thus justifying the second search for which no warrant was required in light of the exigencies of the situation coupled with the ease with which appellant could have disposed of the illegal substance.  A reasonable belief that a person is armed and presently dangerous must form the predicate to a pat-down of the person for weapons.  Here, the State is unable to articulate any specific fact that would have justified a police officer at the scene in even suspecting that appellant was armed and dangerous.  Pp.  444 U. S. 92-93.
(c) The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments will not be construed to permit evidence searches of persons who, at the commencement of the search, are on ""compact"" premises subject to a search warrant, even where the police have a ""reasonable belief"" that such persons ""are connected with"" drug trafficking and ""may be concealing or carrying away the contraband.""

The trial court denied the motion, finding that the search had been conducted under the authority of an Illinois statute which empowers law enforcement officers executing a search warrant to detain and search any person found on the premises in order to protect themselves from attack or to prevent the disposal or concealment of anything described in the warrant.  Appellant was convicted, and the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed, holding that the Illinois statute was not unconstitutional in its application to the facts of this case.
Held:  The searches of appellant and the seizure of what was in his pocket contravened the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  444 U. S. 90-96.
(a) When the search warrant was issued, the authorities had no probable cause to believe that any person found in the tavern, aside from the bartender, would be violating the law.  The complaint for the warrant did not allege that the tavern was frequented by persons illegally purchasing drugs or that the informant had ever seen a patron of the tavern purchase drugs from the bartender or any other person.  
Page 444 U. S. 86
 And probable cause to search appellant was still absent when the police executed the warrant; upon entering the tavern, the police did not recognize appellant and had no reason to believe that he had committed, was committing, or was about to commit any offense.  The police did possess a warrant based on probable cause to search the tavern where appellant happened to be when the warrant was executed, but a person's mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable cause to search that person.  Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40,  392 U. S. 62-63.  Although the warrant gave the officers authority to search the premises and the bartender, it gave them no authority to invade the constitutional protections possessed individually by the tavern's customers.  Pp.  444 U. S. 90-92.
(b) Nor was the action of the police constitutionally permissible on the theory that the first search of appellant constituted a reasonable frisk for weapons under the doctrine of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, and yielded probable cause to believe that appellant was carrying narcotics, thus justifying the second search for which no warrant was required in light of the exigencies of the situation coupled with the ease with which appellant could have disposed of the illegal substance.  A reasonable belief that a person is armed and presently dangerous must form the predicate to a pat-down of the person for weapons.  Here, the State is unable to articulate any specific fact that would have justified a police officer at the scene in even suspecting that appellant was armed and dangerous.  Pp.  444 U. S. 92-93.
(c) The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments will not be construed to permit evidence searches of persons who, at the commencement of the search, are on ""compact"" premises subject to a search warrant, even where the police have a ""reasonable belief"" that such persons ""are connected with"" drug trafficking and ""may be concealing or carrying away the contraband.""  Cf. United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581.  Pp.  444 U. S. 94-96.

Syllabus 
A provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C.  2401(b), bars any tort claim against the United States unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency ""within two years after such claim accrues.""  In 1968, several weeks after having an infected leg treated with neomycin (an antibiotic) at a Veterans' Administration (VA) hospital, respondent suffered a hearing loss, and in January, 1969, was informed by a private physician that it was highly possible that the hearing loss was the result of the neomycin treatment.  Subsequently, in the course of respondent's unsuccessful administrative appeal from the VA's denial of his claim for certain veterans' benefits based on the allegation that the neomycin treatment had caused his deafness, another private physician, in June, 1971, told respondent that the neomycin had caused his injury and should not have been administered.  In 1972, respondent filed suit under the FTCA, alleging that he had been injured by negligent treatment at the VA hospital.  The District Court rendered judgment for respondent, rejecting the Government's defense that respondent's claim was barred by the 2-year statute of limitations because it had accrued in January, 1969, when respondent first learned that his hearing loss had probably resulted from the neomycin, and holding that respondent had no reason to suspect negligence until his conversation with the second physician in June, 1971, less than two years before the action was commenced.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, if a medical malpractice claim does not accrue until a plaintiff is aware of his injury and its cause, neither should it accrue until he knows or should suspect that the doctor who caused the injury was legally blameworthy, and that, here, the limitations period was not triggered until the second physician indicated, in June, 1971, that the neomycin treatment had been improper.
Held:  A claim accrues within the meaning of  2401(b) when the plaintiff knows both the existence and the cause of his injury, and not at a later time when he also knows that the acts inflicting the injury may constitute medical malpractice.  Hence, respondent's claim accrued in 
Page 444 U. S. 112
 January, 1969, when he was aware of his injury and its probable cause, and thus was barred by the 2-year statute of limitations.  Pp.  444 U. S. 117-125.
(a) Section 2401(b) is the balance struck by Congress in the context of tort claims against the Government, and should not be construed so as to defeat its purpose of encouraging the prompt presentation of claims.  Moreover,  2401(b), being a condition of the FTCA's waiver of the United States' immunity from suit, should not be construed to extend such waiver beyond that which Congress intended.  Pp.  444 U. S. 117-118.
(b) There is nothing in the FTCA's language or legislative history that provides a substantial basis for the Court of Appeals' construction of  2401(b).  Nor did the prevailing case law at the time the FTCA was passed lend support to the notion that tort claims in general or malpractice claims in particular do not accrue until a plaintiff learns that his injury was negligently inflicted.  Pp.  444 U. S. 119-120.
(c) For statute of limitations purposes, a plaintiff's ignorance of his legal rights and his ignorance of the fact of his injury or its cause should not receive equal treatment.  P.  444 U. S. 122.
(d) A plaintiff such as respondent, armed with the facts about the harm done to him, can protect himself by seeking advice in the medical and legal community, and to excuse him from promptly doing so by postponing the accrual of his claim would undermine the purpose of the limitations statute.  Whether or not he is competently advised, or even whether he is advised, the putative malpractice plaintiff must determine within the period of limitations whether to sue or not, which is precisely the judgment that other tort plaintiffs must make.

Syllabus 
Section 702(b) of the Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA or Act) states that the Act's purpose is to provide federal financial assistance
""to meet the special needs incident to the elimination of minority group segregation and discrimination among students and faculty in elementary and secondary schools,""
to encourage ""the voluntary elimination, reduction, or prevention of minority group isolation"" in such schools, and to aid schoolchildren ""in overcoming the educational disadvantages of minority group isolation.""  Section 703 pronounces as federal policy that guidelines and criteria established pursuant to the Act should ""be applied uniformly in all regions of the United States.""  And  706(d)(1)(B) declares an educational agency ineligible for assistance if, after the date of the Act, it had in effect any practice ""which results in the disproportionate demotion or dismissal of instructional or other personnel from minority groups"" or ""otherwise engage[s] in discrimination . . . in the hiring, promotion, or assignment of employees.""  Petitioner Board of Education's applications for ESAA assistance were denied by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), based upon statistical evidence flowing from a compliance investigation under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and showing a pattern of racially disproportionate assignments of minority teachers in the school system in relation to the number of minority students enrolled at the respective schools.  No substantive rebuttal or explanation for the statistical disparities was presented.  Petitioner Board then brought suit in District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the racially disproportionate teacher assignments resulted from provisions of state law, provisions of collective bargaining agreements, licensing requirements for particular teaching positions, a bilingual instruction consent decree, and demographic changes in student population.  The District Court concluded that HEW should have considered these proffered justifications for the statistical disparities, and remanded the case to HEW for 
Page 444 U. S. 131
 further consideration.  On remand, HEW determined that such justifications did not adequately rebut the prima facie evidence of discrimination established by the statistics, and the District Court upheld HEW's finding of ineligibility and denied relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner Board's contention that HEW was required to establish that the statistical disparities resulted from purposeful or intentional discrimination in the constitutional sense.
Held:
1. Discriminatory impact is the standard by which ineligibility under ESAA is to be measured, irrespective of whether the discrimination relates to ""demotion or dismissal of instructional or other personnel"" or to ""the hiring, promotion, or assignment of employees.""  The overall structure of the Act, Congress' statements of purpose and policy in  702 and 703, the legislative history, and the text of  706(d)(1)(B) all point in the direction of such a disparate impact test.  To treat as ineligible only an applicant with a past or a conscious present intent to perpetuate racial isolation would defeat the stated objective of ending de facto as well as de jure segregation.  Pp.  444 U. S. 140-150.
2. A prima facie case of discriminatory impact may be made by a proper statistical study.  The burden of rebutting such a statistical case is on the petitioner Board.  P.  444 U. S. 151.

Petitioner, with others, was indicted for violating and conspiring to violate the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C.  1952, which makes it a federal offense to travel or use a facility in interstate commerce to commit, inter alia, ""bribery . . . in violation of the laws of the State in which committed.""  Petitioner and his codefendants were charged with using facilities of interstate commerce to promote a commercial bribery scheme in violation of the laws of Louisiana, i.e., a scheme to exploit geological exploration data stolen from a Louisiana-based company by an employee of the company who was promised a percentage of the profits realized from exploitation of the information.  Petitioner was convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the contention that Congress intended ""bribery"" in the Travel Act to include only bribery of public officials.
Held:  Bribery of private employees prohibited by state criminal statutes violates the Travel Act.  Pp.  444 U. S. 41-50.
(a) By 1961, when the Act was enacted as part of a legislative program directed against ""organized crime,"" the common understanding of ""bribery"" had extended beyond its early common law definitions limiting it to bribery of public officials.  In 42 States and in federal legislation, ""bribery"" included the bribery of individuals acting in a private capacity.  Pp.  444 U. S. 41-45.
(b) The generic definition of bribery, rather than a narrow common law definition limited to public officials, was intended by Congress. References in the legislative history to the purposes and scope of the Travel Act, as well as other bills included in the package of ""organized crime"" legislation aimed at supplementing state enforcement, indicate that Members, Committees, and draftsmen used ""bribery"" to include payments to private individuals to influence their actions.  Congress recognized in 1961 that bribery of private persons was widely used in highly organized criminal efforts to infiltrate and gain control of legitimate businesses, an area of special concern of Congress in enacting the Travel Act.  Cf. United States v. Nardello, 393 U. S. 286.  Pp.  444 U. S. 45-49.
(c) Federalism principles do not dictate a narrow interpretation of ""bribery"" here.  So long as the requisite interstate nexus is present (sufficiency of the nexus no longer being at issue in this case), the statute

Syllabus 
The Eagle Protection Act makes it unlawful to ""take, possess, sell, purchase, barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import"" bald or golden eagles or any part thereof, with the proviso that the prohibition does not apply to ""possession or transportation"" of such eagles or parts thereof taken prior to the effective date of the Act.  Similarly, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act makes it unlawful to engage in such activities with respect to migratory birds and their parts unless they are permitted by regulations promulgated under the Act.  Appellant Secretary of the Interior promulgated regulations prohibiting commercial transactions in parts of birds legally killed before they came under the protection of these Acts.  After two of the appellees who had sold ""preexisting"" Indian artifacts partly composed of feathers of currently protected birds were prosecuted for violations of both Acts, appellees, who are engaged in the trade of such artifacts, brought suit in District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the Acts do not forbid the sale of appellees' artifacts insofar as the constituent bird parts were obtained prior to the effective dates of the Acts, and that, if the Acts and regulations do apply to such property, they violate the Fifth Amendment.  The District Court granted the relief sought, holding that the Acts were to be interpreted as not applicable to preexisting, legally obtained bird parts, and that therefore the regulations were void as unauthorized extensions of the Acts, and were violative of appellees' Fifth Amendment property rights.
Held:
1. Both Acts contemplate regulatory prohibition of commerce in the parts of protected birds, without regard to when those birds were originally taken.  Pp.  444 U. S. 55-64.
(a) In view of the exhaustive and careful enumeration of forbidden acts in the Eagle Protection Act, the narrow limitation of the proviso to ""possession or transportation"" compels the conclusion that, with respect to preexisting artifacts, Congress specifically declined to except any activities other than possession and transportation from the general ban.  The legislative history shows that this precise use of terminology 
Page 444 U. S. 52
 was intentional.  Moreover, the prohibition against the sale of bird parts lawfully taken before the effective date of federal protection is fully consonant with the Act's purpose of preventing evasion of the statutory prohibitions for commercial gain.  Pp.  444 U. S. 56-59.
(b) While the Migratory Bird Treaty Act contains no explicit exception for the possession or transportation of bird parts obtained before the federal protection became effective, nevertheless the text, context, and purpose of that Act support the Secretary's interpretative regulations.  There is nothing in the Act that requires an exception for the sale of preexisting artifacts, and no such statutory exception can be implied.  The Act's structure and context also suggest congressional understanding that regulatory authorities could ban the sale of lawfully taken birds, except where otherwise expressly instructed by the Act.  Pp.  444 U. S. 59-64.
2. The simple prohibition of the sale of lawfully acquired property does not effect a taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  The challenged regulations do not compel the surrender of the artifacts in question, and there is no physical invasion or restraint upon them.  The denial of one traditional property right does not always amount to a taking.  Nor is the fact that the regulations prevent the most profitable use of appellees' property dispositive, since a reduction in the value of property is not necessarily equated with a taking.  Pp.  444 U. S. 64-68.
Reversed.

Appellant Secretary of the Interior promulgated regulations prohibiting commercial transactions in parts of birds legally killed before they came under the protection of these Acts.  After two of the appellees who had sold ""preexisting"" Indian artifacts partly composed of feathers of currently protected birds were prosecuted for violations of both Acts, appellees, who are engaged in the trade of such artifacts, brought suit in District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the Acts do not forbid the sale of appellees' artifacts insofar as the constituent bird parts were obtained prior to the effective dates of the Acts, and that, if the Acts and regulations do apply to such property, they violate the Fifth Amendment.  The District Court granted the relief sought, holding that the Acts were to be interpreted as not applicable to preexisting, legally obtained bird parts, and that therefore the regulations were void as unauthorized extensions of the Acts, and were violative of appellees' Fifth Amendment property rights.
Held:
1. Both Acts contemplate regulatory prohibition of commerce in the parts of protected birds, without regard to when those birds were originally taken.  Pp.  444 U. S. 55-64.
(a) In view of the exhaustive and careful enumeration of forbidden acts in the Eagle Protection Act, the narrow limitation of the proviso to ""possession or transportation"" compels the conclusion that, with respect to preexisting artifacts, Congress specifically declined to except any activities other than possession and transportation from the general ban.  The legislative history shows that this precise use of terminology 
Page 444 U. S. 52
 was intentional.  Moreover, the prohibition against the sale of bird parts lawfully taken before the effective date of federal protection is fully consonant with the Act's purpose of preventing evasion of the statutory prohibitions for commercial gain.  Pp.  444 U. S. 56-59.
(b) While the Migratory Bird Treaty Act contains no explicit exception for the possession or transportation of bird parts obtained before the federal protection became effective, nevertheless the text, context, and purpose of that Act support the Secretary's interpretative regulations.  There is nothing in the Act that requires an exception for the sale of preexisting artifacts, and no such statutory exception can be implied.  The Act's structure and context also suggest congressional understanding that regulatory authorities could ban the sale of lawfully taken birds, except where otherwise expressly instructed by the Act.  Pp.  444 U. S. 59-64.
2. The simple prohibition of the sale of lawfully acquired property does not effect a taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  The challenged regulations do not compel the surrender of the artifacts in question, and there is no physical invasion or restraint upon them.  The denial of one traditional property right does not always amount to a taking.  Nor is the fact that the regulations prevent the most profitable use of appellees' property dispositive, since a reduction in the value of property is not necessarily equated with a taking.  Pp.  444 U. S. 64-68.

Section 2(3) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, as amended in 1972, defines an employee as ""any person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations. . . .""  The question in this case is whether two workers were engaged in ""maritime employment,"" as defined by  2(3), when they sustained injuries for which they sought compensation.  Respondent Ford was injured on a public dock in the Port of Beaumont, Tex., while employed by petitioner P. C. Pfeiffer Co. and while fastening onto railroad flatcars military vehicles that had been delivered to the port by ship, stored, and then loaded the day before the accident onto the flatcars.  Respondent Bryant, while working as a cotton header for petitioner Ayers Steamship Co. in the Port of Galveston, Tex., was injured while unloading a bale of cotton from a dray wagon into a pier warehouse.  Cotton arriving at the port from inland shippers enters storage in cotton compress-warehouses, then goes by dray wagon to pier warehouses, and later is moved by longshoremen from the warehouses onto ships.  Both Ford's and Bryant's claims for coverage were denied by Administrative Law Judges applying the ""point of rest"" doctrine whereby maritime employment would include only the portion of the unloading process that takes place before the stevedoring gang places cargo onto the dock and the portion of the loading process that takes place to the seaside of the last point of rest on the dock.  The Benefits Review Board reversed both decisions, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  On remand for reconsideration in light of this Court's decision in Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, 432 U. S. 249, which rejected the ""point of rest"" theory, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its earlier opinion.
Held:  Ford and Bryant were engaged in maritime employment at the time of their injuries, because they were engaged in intermediate steps of moving cargo between ship and land transportation.  Pp.  444 U. S. 77-84.
(a) Petitioners' position that the Act covers only workers who are working or who may be assigned to work over the water itself is inconsistent with the language and structure of the Act, which contains distinct 
Page 444 U. S. 70
 situs and status requirements.  Section 3(a) of the Act allows recovery for an injury suffered on navigable waters or certain adjoining areas landward of the water's edge, thus defining the broad geographic coverage of the Act, whereas  2(3) defines the Acts occupational requirements, referring to the nature of a worker's activities.  The legislative history also shows that Congress intended the term ""maritime employment"" in  2(3) to refer to status, rather than situs.  In adopting an occupational test that focuses on loading and unloading, Congress anticipated that some persons who work only on land would receive benefits under the Act.  Cf. Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, supra.  Pp.  444 U. S. 77-81.
(b) Ford and Bryant are the kind of land-based employees that Congress intended to encompass within the term ""maritime employment.""  Both men engaged in the type of duties that longshoremen perform in transferring goods between ship and land transportation.  Under  2(3), workers doing tasks traditionally performed by longshoremen are within the purview of the Act.  The crucial factor is the nature of the activity to which a worker may be assigned.  Persons moving cargo directly from ship to land transportation are engaged in maritime employment, and a worker responsible for some portion of that activity is as much an integral part of the process of loading or unloading a ship as a person who participates in the entire process.  Pp.  444 U. S. 81-84.

Syllabus 
Respondent, a shareholder of petitioner Mortgage Trust of America (Trust), brought this suit in Federal District Court as a derivative action on behalf of the Trust and as a class action on behalf of the Trust's shareholders, alleging that several trustees of the Trust, its investment adviser, and two corporations affiliated with the latter, had been guilty of various frauds and breaches of fiduciary duty in violation of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Act).  The complaint sought injunctive relief, rescission of the investment advisers contract between the Trust and the adviser, restitution of fees and other considerations paid by the Trust, an accounting of illegal profits, and an award of damages.  The District Court ruled that the Act confers no private right of action and accordingly dismissed the complaint.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that
""implication of a private right of action for injunctive relief and damages under the Advisers Act in favor of appropriate plaintiffs is necessary to achieve the goals of Congress in enacting the legislation.""
Held:
1. Under  215 of the Act, which provides that contracts whose formation or performance would violate the Act ""shall be void . . . as regards the rights of"" the violator, there exists a limited private remedy to void an investment advisers contract.  The language of  215 itself fairly implies a right to specific and limited relief in a federal court.  When Congress declared in  215 that certain contracts are void, it intended that the customary legal incidents of voidness would follow, including the availability of a suit for rescission or for an injunction against continued operation of the contract, and for restitution.  Pp.  444 U. S. 18-19.
2. Section 206 of the Act -- which makes it unlawful for any investment adviser
""to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud . . . [or] to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client,""
or to engage in specified transactions with clients without making required disclosures -- does not, however, create a private cause of action 
Page 444 U. S. 12
 for damages.  Unlike  215,  26 simply proscribes certain conduct, and does not, in terms, create or alter any civil liabilities.  In view of the express provisions in other sections of the Act for enforcing the duties imposed by  206, it is not possible to infer the existence of an additional private cause of action.  And the mere fact that  206 was designed to protect investment advisers' clients does not require the implication of a private cause of action for damages on their behalf.  Pp.  444 U. S. 19-24.

 Rehearing Denied Nov. 26, 1979. 
 See 444 U.S. 974. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice STEWART join, dissenting. 
 I dissent from the denial of certiorari. The question in this case is whether the requirements of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), apply to police interrogations of persons arrested for motor vehicle violations. 
 At the scene of an automobile accident, petitioner was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor. Petitioner was taken to police headquarters where he was questioned at length before being given Miranda warnings. Petitioner subsequently was charged with the crime of causing death by heedless and careless operation of an automobile. At trial the prosecution introduced into evidence statements made by petitioner before he was given Miranda warnings. Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to a 1-year term in county jail. 
 The Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey affirmed petitioner's conviction. Citing State v. Macuk, 57 N.J. 1, 268 A.2d 1 ( 1970), the court held that ""[t]he law in 
Page 444 U.S. 905 , 906

 Following the New Jersey rule, a number of other courts have held that Miranda warnings need not be given to persons arrested for traffic offenses or other misdemeanors. See, e. g., Clay v. Riddle, 541 F.2d 456 ( CA4 1976); State v. Neal, 476 S.W.2d 547 (Mo.1972); State v. Gabrielson, 192 N.W.2d 792 (Iowa 1971); State v.

Texas, 394 U.S. 324, 327, 89 S. Ct. 1095 (1969), ""that the warnings were required when the person being interrogated was 'in custody at the station or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.' 384 U.S., at 477.""

 Rehearing Denied Nov. 26, 1979. 
 See 444 U.S. 974. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice STEWART join, dissenting. 
 I dissent from the denial of certiorari. The question in this case is whether the requirements of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), apply to police interrogations of persons arrested for motor vehicle violations. 
 At the scene of an automobile accident, petitioner was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor. Petitioner was taken to police headquarters where he was questioned at length before being given Miranda warnings. Petitioner subsequently was charged with the crime of causing death by heedless and careless operation of an automobile. At trial the prosecution introduced into evidence statements made by petitioner before he was given Miranda warnings. Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to a 1-year term in county jail. 
 The Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey affirmed petitioner's conviction. Citing State v. Macuk, 57 N.J. 1, 268 A.2d 1 ( 1970), the court held that ""[t]he law in

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 This case presents the issue whether a state law that requires elected judges to retire at the age of 70, challenged on grounds that it violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, ought to be subjected to strict scrutiny or to the less exacting rational-relationship test employed by the court below. The determination turns on whether the challenged judicial retirement law is properly regarded as a limitation

Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 30, 21 L. Ed.2d 24 (1968). We have held as recently as last Term that a state law limiting access to the ballot ""impairs the voters' ability to express their political preferences,"" and thus could be justified only by a compelling state interest whose presence or absence is determined when a reviewing court subjects the questioned provision to strict scrutiny.

 Because the decision of the court below as to the appropriate standard of review is possibly in conflict with these and other decisions of this Court, I would grant this petition for certiorari and dissent from the Court's unwillingness to do so.

 October 9, 1979
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 In United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967), this Court held that a post-indictment lineup is a critical prosecutive stage in which an accused is entitled to have counsel present under the Sixth Amendment. In reliance on Wade the highest court of the State of New York has held that a pretrial psychiatric examination is also a critical stage in which the accused has a right to have defense counsel present. Lee v. County Court, 27 N.Y.2d 432, 318 N.Y.S.2d 705, 267 N.E.2d 452, cert. denied, 404 U.S. 823 (1971). Accord, State v. Corbin, 15 Or.App. 536, 516 P.2d 1314 (1973); State v. Anderson, 8 Wash.App. 782, 509 P.2d 80 (1973). 
 In the instant case, however, the Supreme Court of Illinois has refused to extend Wade 's Sixth Amendment analysis to pretrial psychiatric examinations and thus has aligned itself with every Federal Court of Appeals that has decided the issue, e. g., United States v. Trapnell, 495 F.2d 22 (CA2 1974); United States v. Greene, 497 F.2d 1068 (CA7 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 909 (1975), and with many other state courts, e. g., People v.

 In view of the conflict among highest state courts over whether a pretrial psychiatric examination constitutes a critical prosecutive stage in which the accused is entitled to have counsel present under the Sixth Amendment, I would grant this petition and accordingly dissent from the Court's refusal to do so.[ Larsen v.

 Joseph C. MILHOLLAN v. UNITED STATESNo. 78-6649 
 Supreme Court of the United States October 9, 1979
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 The Court today denies certiorari in a case which is, in my view, plainly inconsistent with our recent decision in Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U.S. 753 (1979). The facts may be summarized briefly. On September 22, 1977, the petitioner cashed two money orders at a bank in Girard, Pa., after producing identification in the name of John J. Leehy, Jr., the designated payee. On the following day, the petitioner attempted to cash two additional money orders also made out to John J. Leehy, Jr., at a bank in Warren, Pa. Bank officials became suspicious and alerted the police, who asked petitioner for identification. Petitioner responded that he had identification in his car and then began to flee. He was apprehended and taken to the police station, where he was searched. The search uncovered, among other things, a car key on a tag marked ""Gold Capri."" After a short time, an officer located a gold-colored Capri in a municipal parking lot about 100 yards from the place of arrest. Noticing a police scanner and a book of police car numbers in the car, the officer opened the car door with the petitioner's key, and drove the vehicle to the police station. There he conducted a warrantless search of the car. Inside he found various items, including a closed satchel. He opened the satchel and discovered 22 money orders, all payable to John J. Leehy, Jr. 
 Petitioner was convicted on a two-count indictment for transporting stolen money orders in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2314. Although only the Girard transaction was alleged in the indictment, the money orders inside the satchel and other evidence seized during the search of the car were admitted at trial over petitioner's objection. 
 A divided Court of Appeals upheld the warrantless searches 
Page 444 U.S. 909 , 910
 of both the car and the satchel. 599 F.2d 518 (CA3 1979). According to the majority, the search of the car was lawful because it was supported by probable cause and exigent circumstances were present. The majority found the search of the satchel distinguishable from that in United States v. Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1 (1977), where we held that the Fourth Amendment was violated by a warrantless search of a footlocker that had been transported on a train and later loaded into the trunk of an automobile. According to the Court of Appeals, Chadwick did not affect what it regarded as the rule for ""pure"" car searches: ""police entitled to search an automobile . . . could also search [containers] carried in that automobile."" 599 F.2d 526. 
 Even assuming the court's ruling on the search of the car does not warrant review, I believe that the search of the satchel cannot stand. In Arkansas v. Sanders, supra, this Court expressly rejected the reading of Chadwick offered by the court below. Speaking three months after the decision of the Court of Appeals in the present case, we observed that a container such as petitioner's ""is not necessarily attended by any lesser expectation of privacy . . . merely because [it] is to be carried in an automobile rather than transported by other means."" 442 U.S, at 764, 99 S. Ct., at 2593. We therefore held there was no special rule permitting police to search a container whenever the container is found in an automobile. Id., at 766. ""[T]he extent to which the Fourth Amendment applies to containers and other parcels depends not at all upon whether they are seized from an automobile."" Id., at 764-765 n. 13. That holding, of course, represents a square repudiation of the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in this case. 
 I would grant certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and remand for reconsideration in light of Arkansas v. Sanders.* 
[Footnote *] The United States suggests that the case may be distinguishable from Arkansas v. Sanders because the satchel was searched as part of a police inventory after the car's impoundment, and that in any event admission of the satchel's contents was harmless. Neither of these claims was passed on by the Court of Appeals, and I would have that court consider them on remand.

 Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting from denial of stay. 
 In the ordinary case, anything more than the most summary statement of the reasons of an individual Justice for dissenting from the disposition of an application for a stay by the full Court would be both a useless and wasteful consumption of the dissenter's time. I believe, though, that this is not the ordinary case, but the culmination of a sport of fox and hound which was begun by this Court's decision in Weeks v. United 
Page 443 U.S. 916 , 917
 States, 232 U.S. 383 (1914), 65 years ago. So many factors material to that decision, and to Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), which applied it to the States, have occurred after the rendition of these decisions that I think a re- evaluation of the so-called ""exclusionary rule"" enunciated by Weeks is overdue. Because of double jeopardy considerations, I am not prepared to state flatly that this case would not be moot as a result of a verdict of acquittal by the time this Court comes to pass on the State's petition for certiorari, and I am therefore filing this opinion as a dissent from the denial of a stay of the judgment of the Supreme Court of California suppressing evidence, the granting of which could prevent any possibility of mootness. See Fare v. Michael C., 439 U.S. 1310d 19 (1978) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers). 
 The anomalous consequences of the exclusionary rule are readily apparent from an examination of the police conduct in this case. The officers who conducted the search were responding to a report of a robbery that had recently been committed. The robbery took place around 8:30 p. m. on December 19, 1975, at a Safeway Store in Fremont, Cal. It was committed in the presence of several witnesses by two individuals armed with handguns. One of the witnesses followed the two men, observed them get into a car, and trailed the car for several miles until he was able to identify it as a 1968 or 1969 Ford Fairlane and to write down the license number. The witness then went directly to the police station and reported what he had seen. At approximately 9 p. m., the police department broadcast a description of the getaway vehicle and its license number. Shortly thereafter, a Fremont police officer spotted a vehicle matching the description, called for backup units, and stopped the vehicle. The driver, respondent, was ordered out of the car, searched, and advised he was under arrest for robbery. He was the only person in the vehicle and fitted the description of one of the suspects. The officers also searched the passenger compartment of the car, [443 U.S. 916 , 918]

No. 77-1301
Argued November 7, 1978
Decided July 2, 1979
443 U.S. 368

Syllabus 
At a pretrial hearing on a motion to suppress allegedly involuntary confessions and certain physical evidence, respondents Greathouse and Jones, who were defendants in a state prosecution for second-degree murder, robbery, and grand larceny, requested that the public and the press be excluded from the hearing, arguing that the unabated buildup of adverse publicity had jeopardized their ability to receive a fair trial.  The District Attorney did not oppose the motion, and a reporter employed by petitioner, whose newspapers had given extensive coverage of the crime through the defendants' indictment and arraignment, made no objection at the time of the closure motion, though she was present in the courtroom.  Respondent trial judge granted the motion, and, in response to the reporter's letter on the next day asserting a right to cover the hearing and requesting access to the transcript, stated that the suppression hearing had concluded and that any decision on immediate release of the transcript had been reserved.  Petitioner then moved to have the closure order set aside but the trial judge, after a hearing, refused to vacate the order or grant petitioner immediate access to the transcript, ruling that the interest of the press and the public was outweighed by the defendants' right to a fair trial.  Petitioner immediately commenced a proceeding in the nature of prohibition and mandamus in the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, challenging the trial court's orders on First, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment grounds.  The Appellate Division vacated the orders, holding that they transgressed the public's vital interest in open judicial proceedings and further constituted an unlawful prior restraint in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The New York Court of Appeals, although holding that the case was technically moot because, shortly before entry of the Appellate Division's judgment, the defendants had pleaded guilty to lesser included offenses and a transcript of the suppression hearing was made available to petitioner, nevertheless retained jurisdiction in view of the importance of the issues, and upheld the exclusion of the press and the public from the pretrial proceeding.
Held:
1. The controversy is not moot. This Court's jurisdiction is not defeated 
Page 443 U. S. 369

""simply because the order attacked has expired, if the underlying dispute between the parties is one 'capable of repetition, yet evading review.'""
Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S. 539,  427 U. S. 546.  Here, the order closing the pretrial hearing is too short in its duration to permit full review, and it is reasonably to be expected that petitioner will be subjected to similar closure orders in the future.  Pp.  443 U. S. 377-378.
2. The Constitution does not give petitioner an affirmative right of access to the pretrial proceeding, all the participants in the litigation having agreed that it should be closed to protect the fair trial rights of the defendants.  Pp.  443 U. S. 378-394.
(a) To safeguard the due process rights of the accused, a trial judge has an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial publicity, and he may take protective measures even when they are not strictly and inescapably necessary.  Publicity concerning pretrial suppression hearings poses special risks of unfairness because it may influence public opinion against a defendant and inform potential jurors of inculpatory information wholly inadmissible at the actual trial.  Pp.  443 U. S. 378-379.
(b) The Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a public trial is for the benefit of the defendant alone.  The Constitution nowhere mentions any right of access to a criminal trial on the part of the public.  Cf. In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257; Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532.  While there is a strong societal interest in public trials, nevertheless members of the public do not have an enforceable right to a public trial that can be asserted independently of the parties in the litigation.  The adversary system of criminal justice is premised upon the proposition that the public interest is fully protected by the participants in the litigation.  Pp.  443 U. S. 379-384.
(c) The history of the Sixth Amendment's public trial guarantee demonstrates no more than the existence of a common law rule of open civil and criminal proceedings, not a constitutional right of members of the general public to attend a criminal trial.  Even if the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments could properly be viewed as embodying the common law right of the public to attend criminal trials, there is no persuasive evidence that the public had any right at common law to attend pretrial proceedings.  To the contrary, by the time of the adoption of the Constitution, public trials were clearly associated with the protection of the defendant, and pretrial proceedings, precisely because of the same concern for a fair trial, were never characterized by the same degree of openness a were actual trials.  Pp  443 U. S. 384-391.
(d) Even assuming, arguendo, that the First and Fourteenth Amendments may guarantee a right to members of the press and the public 
Page 443 U. S. 370
 to attend criminal trials in some situations, this putative right was given all appropriate deference by the state nisi prius court in the present case.  Even though none of the spectators present in the courtroom, including petitioner's reporter, objected when t.he defendants made the closure motion, petitioner's counsel was given an opportunity to be heard, and the trial court thereafter concluded that the defendants' right to a fair trial outweighed the ""constitutional rights of the press and the public.""  Furthermore, any denial of access was only temporary; once the danger of prejudice .had dissipated, a transcript of the suppression hearing was made available.  Thus, any First and Fourteenth Amendment right of petitioner to attend criminal trials was not violated.  Pp.  443 U. S. 391-393.

No. 78-610
Argued April 24, 1979
Decided July 2, 1979
443 U.S. 449

Syllabus 
This class action was brought in 1973 by students in the Columbus, Ohio, school system, charging that the Columbus Board of Education (Board) and its officials had pursued and were pursuing a course of conduct having the purpose and effect of causing and perpetuating racial segregation in the public schools, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.  The case was ultimately tried in April-June, 1976, final arguments were heard in September, 1976, and in March, 1977, the District Court filed an opinion and order containing its findings of fact and conclusions of law.  It found (1) that in 1954, when Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (Brown I), was decided, the Board was not operating a racially neutral unitary school system, but was conducting ""an enclave of separate, black schools on the near east side of Columbus,"" and that this was ""the direct result of cognitive acts or omissions of those school board members and administrators who had originally intentionally caused and later perpetuated the racial isolation""; (2) that, since the decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294 (Brown II), the Board had been under a continuous constitutional obligation to disestablish its dual system and that it has failed to discharge this duty; and (3) that, in the intervening years since 1954, there had been a series of Board actions and practices that could not ""reasonably be explained without reference to racial concerns"" and that ""intentionally aggravated, rather than alleviated,"" racial separation in the schools.  Ultimately concluding that, at the time of trial, the racial segregation in the Columbus school system ""directly resulted from [the Board's] intentional segregative acts and omissions,"" in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the court, accordingly, enjoined the defendants from continuing to discriminate on the basis of race in operating the public schools and ordered the submission of a systemwide desegregation plan.  Subsequently, following the decision in Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406 (Dayton I), the District Court rejected the Board's argument that that decision required or permitted modification of the court's finding or judgment.  Based on its examination of the record, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgments against the defendants. 
Page 443 U. S. 450

Held:
1. On the record, there is no apparent reason to disturb the findings and conclusions of the District Court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that the Board's conduct at the time of trial and before not only was animated by an unconstitutional, segregative purpose, but also had current segregative impact that was sufficiently systemwide to warrant the remedy ordered by the District Court.  Pp.  443 U. S. 454-463.
(a) Proof of purposeful and effective maintenance of a body of separate black schools in a substantial part of the system is itself prima facie proof of a dual system, and supports a finding to this effect absent sufficient contrary proof by the Board, which was not forthcoming in this case.  Pp.  443 U. S. 455-458.
(b) The Board's continuing affirmative duty to disestablish the dual school system, mandated by Brown II, is beyond question, and there is nothing in the record to show that, at the time of trial, the dual school system in Columbus and its effects had been disestablished.  Pp.  443 U. S. 458-461.
2. There is no indication that the judgments below rested on any misapprehension of the controlling law.  Pp.  443 U. S. 463-468.
(a) Where it appears that the District Court, while recognizing that disparate impact and foreseeable consequences, without more, do not establish a constitutional violation, correctly noted that actions having foreseeable and anticipated disparate impact are relevant evidence to prove the ultimate fact of a forbidden purpose, the court stayed well within the requirements of Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, and Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U. S. 252, that a plaintiff seeking to make out an equal protection violation on the basis of racial discrimination must show purpose.  Pp.  443 U. S. 464-465.
(b) Where the District Court repeatedly emphasized that it had found purposefully segregative practices with current, systemwide impact, there was no failure to observe the requirements of Dayton I, that the remedy imposed by a court of equity should be commensurate with the violation ascertained.  Pp.  443 U. S. 465-467.
(c) Nor was there any misuse of Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver, Colo., 413 U. S. 189, where it was held that purposeful discrimination in a substantial part of a school system furnishes a sufficient basis for an inferential finding of a systemwide discriminatory intent unless otherwise rebutted, and that, given the purpose to operate a dual school system, one could infer a connection between such purpose and racial separation in other parts of the school system.  Pp.  443 U. S. 467-468.

Ultimately concluding that, at the time of trial, the racial segregation in the Columbus school system ""directly resulted from [the Board's] intentional segregative acts and omissions,"" in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the court, accordingly, enjoined the defendants from continuing to discriminate on the basis of race in operating the public schools and ordered the submission of a systemwide desegregation plan.  Subsequently, following the decision in Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406 (Dayton I), the District Court rejected the Board's argument that that decision required or permitted modification of the court's finding or judgment.  Based on its examination of the record, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgments against the defendants. 
Page 443 U. S. 450

Held:
1. On the record, there is no apparent reason to disturb the findings and conclusions of the District Court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that the Board's conduct at the time of trial and before not only was animated by an unconstitutional, segregative purpose, but also had current segregative impact that was sufficiently systemwide to warrant the remedy ordered by the District Court.  Pp.  443 U. S. 454-463.
(a) Proof of purposeful and effective maintenance of a body of separate black schools in a substantial part of the system is itself prima facie proof of a dual system, and supports a finding to this effect absent sufficient contrary proof by the Board, which was not forthcoming in this case.  Pp.  443 U. S. 455-458.
(b) The Board's continuing affirmative duty to disestablish the dual school system, mandated by Brown II, is beyond question, and there is nothing in the record to show that, at the time of trial, the dual school system in Columbus and its effects had been disestablished.  Pp.  443 U. S. 458-461.
2. There is no indication that the judgments below rested on any misapprehension of the controlling law.  Pp.  443 U. S. 463-468.
(a) Where it appears that the District Court, while recognizing that disparate impact and foreseeable consequences, without more, do not establish a constitutional violation, correctly noted that actions having foreseeable and anticipated disparate impact are relevant evidence to prove the ultimate fact of a forbidden purpose, the court stayed well within the requirements of Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, and Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U. S. 252, that a plaintiff seeking to make out an equal protection violation on the basis of racial discrimination must show purpose.  Pp.  443 U. S. 464-465.
(b) Where the District Court repeatedly emphasized that it had found purposefully segregative practices with current, systemwide impact, there was no failure to observe the requirements of Dayton I, that the remedy imposed by a court of equity should be commensurate with the violation ascertained.  Pp.  443 U. S. 465-467.
(c) Nor was there any misuse of Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver, Colo., 413 U. S. 189, where it was held that purposeful discrimination in a substantial part of a school system furnishes a sufficient basis for an inferential finding of a systemwide discriminatory intent unless otherwise rebutted, and that, given the purpose to operate a dual school system, one could infer a connection between such purpose and racial separation in other parts of the school system.  Pp.  443 U. S. 467-468.

Syllabus 
A number of students in the Dayton, Ohio, school system, through their parents, brought this action in District Court in 1972, alleging that the Dayton Board of Education, the State Board of Education, and various local and state officials were operating a racially segregated school system in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  After protracted litigation at both the trial and appellate levels, the District Court dismissed the complaint, ruling that, although the Dayton Schools concededly were highly segregated, the Dayton Board's failure to alleviate this condition was not actionable absent sufficient evidence that the racial separation had been caused by the Board's own purposeful discriminatory conduct.  In the District Court's view, plaintiffs had failed to show either discriminatory purpose or segregative effect, or both, with respect to the Board's challenged practices and policies, which included faculty hiring and assignments, the use of optional attendance zones and transfer policies, the location and construction of new and expanded school facilities, and the rescission of certain prior resolutions recognizing the Board's responsibility to eradicate racial separation in the public schools.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, at the time of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (Brown I), in 1954, the Dayton Board had operated a racially segregated, dual school system, that it was constitutionally required to disestablish that system and its effects, that it had failed to discharge this duty, and that the consequences of the dual system, together with the intentionally segregative impact of various practices since 1954, were of systemwide import, and an appropriate basis for a systemwide remedy.
Held:
1. On the record, there is no basis for disturbing the Court of Appeals' holding that, at the time of Brown I, the Dayton Board was intentionally operating a dual school system in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  443 U. S. 534-537.
2. Given the fact that a dual system existed in 1954, the Court of Appeals also properly held that the Dayton Board was thereafter under a continuing duty to eradicate the effects of that system, and that the 
Page 443 U. S. 527
 systemwide nature of the violation furnished prima facie proof that current segregation in the Dayton schools was caused at least in part by prior intentionally segregative official acts.  Part of the affirmative duty imposed on a school board is the obligation not to take any action that would impede the process of disestablishing the dual system and its effects, Wright v. Council of City of Emporia, 407 U. S. 451, and here the Dayton Board had engaged in many post-Brown I actions that had the effect of increasing or perpetuating segregation.  The measure of a school board's post-Brown I conduct under an unsatisfied duty to liquidate a dual system is the effectiveness, not the purpose, of the actions in decreasing or increasing the segregation caused by the dual system.  The Dayton Board had to do more than abandon its prior discriminatory purpose, Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver, Colo., 413 U. S. 189; Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1.  The Board has had an affirmative responsibility to see that pupil assignment policies and school construction and abandonment practices were not used and did not serve to perpetuate or reestablish the dual system, and has a ""heavy burden"" of showing that actions that increased or continued t,he effects of the dual system serve important and legitimate ends.  Pp.  443 U. S. 537-540.
3. Nor is there any reason to fault the Court of Appeals' finding, after the remand of this case in Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, that a sufficient case of current, systemwide effect had been established.  This was not a misuse of Keyes, supra, where it was held that

Syllabus 
Respondents, who are Negroes, were indicted by a county grand jury in Tennessee for murder.  They filed a plea in abatement seeking dismissal of the indictment on the ground, inter alia, that the foreman of the grand jury had been selected in a racially discriminatory.fashion.  At a hearing on this plea, respondents called as witnesses 3 jury commissioners who testified only as to the selection of the grand jury venire; 2 former foremen who testified that they had never known of a Negro foreman, but were not questioned as to how long they had resided in the county; the current foreman, who stated he had no knowledge as to whether any Negro had ever served; and 11 of the 12 grand jurors (other than the foreman) who served when respondents were indicted, none of whom testified relative to selection of the foreman or the race of past foremen.  The trial court denied the plea.  Subsequently, respondents were convicted, and the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.  Respondents then filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, which dismissed the petition, finding that respondents' prima facie case of discrimination in selecting the grand jury foreman was rebutted by the State.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. Claims of racial discrimination in the selection of members of a state grand jury are cognizable in federal habeas corpus and will support issuance of a writ setting aside a conviction and ordering the indictment quashed, notwithstanding that no constitutional impropriety tainted the selection of the petit jury and guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt at a trial free from constitutional error.  Pp.  443 U. S. 550-564.
(a) Because discrimination on the basis of race in the selection of members of a grand jury strikes at fundamental values of our judicial system and our society as a whole, a criminal defendant's right to equal protection of the laws is denied when he is indicted by a grand jury from which members of a racial group have been purposefully excluded.  Pp.  443 U. S. 551-557.
(b) Such costs as exist in permitting a federal court to hear claims of racial discrimination in the selection of a grand jury when reviewing 
Page 443 U. S. 546
 a state conviction are outweighed by the recognized policy of combatting racial discrimination in the administration of justice.  Even though there are alternative remedies to vindicate the rights of those members of the class denied the chance to serve on grand juries, the fact is that permitting challenges to unconstitutional state action by defendants has been, and is, the main avenue by which Fourteenth Amendment rights are vindicated in this context.  Pp.  443 U. S. 557-559.
(c) The rationale of Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, in which it was held that, where the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim at trial and on direct review, a state prisoner may not be granted federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure was introduced at his trial, will not be extended to a claim of discrimination in the selection of the grand jury that indicts the habeas petitioner.  This latter claim differs fundamentally from application on habeas of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.  Such a claim concerns allegations that the trial court itself violated the Fourteenth Amendment in the operation of the grand jury system, whereas in Fourth Amendment cases, courts are called upon to evaluate the actions of the police in seizing evidence.  Moreover, a claim of grand jury discrimination involves charges that state officials are violating the direct command of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and federal statutes passed thereunder, that ""[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""  Federal habeas review is necessary to ensure that constitutional defects in the state judiciary's grand jury selection procedure are not overlooked by the very state judges who operate that system.  Pp.  443 U. S. 559-564.
2. As a matter of law, respondents failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause with regard to the selection of the grand jury foreman.  Respondents' case rested entirely on the testimony of the two former foremen and the current foreman, since they were the only ones who testified at all about the selection of a foreman, and their testimony was insufficient to establish respondents' case.  Absent evidence as to the total number of foremen appointed by the judges in the county during the critical period of time, it is difficult to say that the number of Negroes appointed foreman, even if zero, is statistically so significant as to make out a case of discrimination under the ""rule of exclusion.""

442 U.S. 595

Syllabus 
This case involves a dispute over the ownership of church property following a schism in a local church affiliated with a hierarchical church organization.  The property of the Vineville Presbyterian Church of Macon, Ga. (local church), is held in the names of the local church or of trustees for the local church.  That church, however, was established as a member of the Augusta-Macon Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS), which has a generally hierarchical form of government.  Under the polity of the PCUS, the government of the local church is committed to its Session in the first instance, but the actions of this ""court"" are subject to the review and control of the higher church courts (the Presbytery, Synod, and General Assembly).  At a congregational meeting attended by a quorum of the local church's members, 164 of them voted to separate from the PCUS, while 94 opposed the resolution.  The majority then united with another denomination, and has retained possession of the local church property.  The Augusta-Macon Presbytery appointed a commission to investigate the dispute, and the commission eventually issued a ruling declaring that the minority faction constituted the ""true congregation"" of the local church, and withdrawing from the majority faction ""all authority to exercise office derived from the [PCUS].""  Representatives of the minority faction brought this class action in state court, seeking declaratory and injunctive orders establishing their right to exclusive possession and use of the local church's property as a member of the PCUS.  The trial court, purporting to apply Georgia's ""neutral principles of law"" approach to church property disputes, granted judgment for the majority.  The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the trial court had correctly stated and applied Georgia law and rejecting the minority's challenge based on the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held:
1. As a means of adjudicating a church property dispute, a State is constitutionally entitled to adopt a ""neutral principles of law"" analysis involving consideration of the deeds, state statutes governing the holding of church property, the local church's charter, and the general church's constitution.  The First Amendment does not require the States to adopt a rule of compulsory deference to religious authority in 
Page 443 U. S. 596
 resolving church property disputes, even where no issue of doctrinal controversy is involved.  Pp.  443 U. S. 602-606.
2. Here, the case must be remanded, since the grounds for the Georgia courts' decision that the majority faction represents the local church were not articulated, both the trial court and the Georgia Supreme Court having applied Georgia's neutral principles analysis as developed in cases involving church property disputes between general churches and entire local congregations, without alluding to the significant complicating factor in the present case that the local congregation was itself divided.  If, in fact, Georgia has adopted a presumptive rule of majority representation, defeasible upon a showing that the identity of the local church is to be determined by some other means, this would be consistent with both the neutral principles analysis and the First Amendment.  However, there are at least some indications that, under Georgia law, the process of identifying the faction that represents a local church involves considerations of religious doctrine and polity, and thus, if Georgia law provides that the identity of the local church here is to be determined according to the laws and regulations of the PCUS, then the First Amendment requires that the Georgia courts give deference to the presbyterial commission's determination that the minority faction represents the ""true congregation.""

Under the polity of the PCUS, the government of the local church is committed to its Session in the first instance, but the actions of this ""court"" are subject to the review and control of the higher church courts (the Presbytery, Synod, and General Assembly).  At a congregational meeting attended by a quorum of the local church's members, 164 of them voted to separate from the PCUS, while 94 opposed the resolution.  The majority then united with another denomination, and has retained possession of the local church property.  The Augusta-Macon Presbytery appointed a commission to investigate the dispute, and the commission eventually issued a ruling declaring that the minority faction constituted the ""true congregation"" of the local church, and withdrawing from the majority faction ""all authority to exercise office derived from the [PCUS].""  Representatives of the minority faction brought this class action in state court, seeking declaratory and injunctive orders establishing their right to exclusive possession and use of the local church's property as a member of the PCUS.  The trial court, purporting to apply Georgia's ""neutral principles of law"" approach to church property disputes, granted judgment for the majority.  The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the trial court had correctly stated and applied Georgia law and rejecting the minority's challenge based on the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held:
1. As a means of adjudicating a church property dispute, a State is constitutionally entitled to adopt a ""neutral principles of law"" analysis involving consideration of the deeds, state statutes governing the holding of church property, the local church's charter, and the general church's constitution.

2. Here, the case must be remanded, since the grounds for the Georgia courts' decision that the majority faction represents the local church were not articulated, both the trial court and the Georgia Supreme Court having applied Georgia's neutral principles analysis as developed in cases involving church property disputes between general churches and entire local congregations, without alluding to the significant complicating factor in the present case that the local congregation was itself divided.  If, in fact, Georgia has adopted a presumptive rule of majority representation, defeasible upon a showing that the identity of the local church is to be determined by some other means, this would be consistent with both the neutral principles analysis and the First Amendment.  However, there are at least some indications that, under Georgia law, the process of identifying the faction that represents a local church involves considerations of religious doctrine and polity, and thus, if Georgia law provides that the identity of the local church here is to be determined according to the laws and regulations of the PCUS, then the First Amendment requires that the Georgia courts give deference to the presbyterial commission's determination that the minority faction represents the ""true congregation.""

Syllabus 
A Massachusetts statute requires parental consent before an abortion can be performed on an unmarried woman under the age of 18.  If one or both parents refuse such consent, however, the abortion may be obtained by order of a judge of the superior court ""for good cause shown.""  In appellees' class action challenging the constitutionality of the statute, a three-judge District Court held it unconstitutional.  Subsequently, this Court vacated the District Court's judgment, Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U. S. 132, holding that the District Court should have abstained and certified to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court appropriate questions concerning the meaning of the statute.  On remand, the District Court certified several questions to the Supreme Judicial Court.  Among the questions certified was whether the statute permits any minors -- mature or immature -- to obtain judicial consent to an abortion without any parental consultation whatsoever.  The Supreme Judicial Court answered that, in general, it does not; that consent must be obtained for every nonemergency abortion unless no parent is available; and that an available parent must be given notice of any judicial proceedings brought by a minor to obtain consent for an abortion.  Another question certified was whether, if the superior court finds that the minor is capable of making, and has, in fact, made and adhered to, an informed and reasonable decision to have an abortion, the court may refuse its consent on a finding that a parent's, or its own, contrary decision is a better one.  The Supreme Judicial Court answered in the affirmative.  Following the Supreme Judicial Court's judgment, the District Court again declared the statute unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  443 U. S. 633-651;  443 U. S. 652-656.
450 F.Supp. 997, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, joined by MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that:
1. There are three reasons justifying the conclusion that the constitutional 
Page 443 U. S. 623
 rights of children cannot be equated with those of adults:  the peculiar vulnerability of children; their inability to make critical decisions in an informed, mature manner; and the importance of the guiding role of parents in the upbringing of their children.  Pp.  443 U. S. 633-639.
2. The abortion decision differs in important ways from other decisions facing minors, and the State is required to act with particular sensitivity when it legislates to foster parental involvement in this matter.  Pp.  443 U. S. 639-642.
3. If a State decides to require a pregnant minor to obtain one or both parents' consent to an abortion, it also must provide an alternative procedure whereby authorization for the abortion can be obtained.  A pregnant minor is entitled in such a proceeding to show either that she is mature enough and well enough informed to make her abortion decision, in consultation with her physician, independently of her parents' wishes, or that, even if she is not able to make this decision independently, the desired abortion would be in her best interests.  Such a procedure must ensure that the provision requiring parental consent does not, in fact, amount to an impermissible ""absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto.""  Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52,  428 U. S. 74.  Pp.  443 U. S. 642-644.
4. The Massachusetts statute, as authoritatively interpreted by the Supreme Judicial Court, unduly burdens the right to seek an abortion.  The statute falls short of constitutional standards in two respects.  First, it permits judicial authorization for an abortion to be withheld from a minor who is found by the superior court to be mature and fully competent to make this decision independently.  Second, it requires parental consultation or notification in every instance, whether or not in the pregnant minor's best interests, without affording her an opportunity to receive an independent judicial determination that she is mature enough to consent or that an abortion would be in her best interests.  Pp.  443 U. S. 644-651.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that the Massachusetts statute is unconstitutional because under the statute, as written and as construed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, no minor, no matter how mature and capable of informed decisionmaking, may receive an abortion without the consent of either both parents or a superior court judge, thus making the minor's abortion decision subject in every instance to an absolute third-party veto.

443 U.S. 658

Syllabus 
In 1854 and 1855, the United States entered into a series of treaties with certain Indian tribes whereby the Indians relinquished their interest in certain lands in what is now the State of Washington in exchange for monetary payments, certain relatively small parcels of land reserved for their exclusive use, and other guarantees, including protection of their ""right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations . . . in common with all citizens of the Territory.""  The principal question in this extensive litigation concerns the character of the treaty right to take fish.  In 1970, the United States, on its own behalf and as trustee for seven Indian tribes, brought suit against the State of Washington in Federal District Court, seeking an interpretation of the treaties and an injunction requiring the State to protect the Indians' share of runs of anadromous fish.  At various stages of the proceedings, additional tribes, the State Departments of Fisheries and Game, and a commercial fishing group were joined as parties.  The District Court held that, under the treaties, the Indians are currently entitled to a 45% to 50% share of the harvestable fish passing through their recognized tribal fishing grounds in the case area, to be calculated on a river-by-river, run-by-run basis, subject to certain adjustments.  With a slight modification of one of the adjustments, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and this Court denied certiorari.  Pursuant to the District Court's injunction, the Department of Fisheries promulgated regulations protecting the Indians' treaty rights, but the State Supreme Court, in two cases (consolidated here in No. 77-983), ruled that the Fisheries Department could not comply with the federal injunction, holding, inter alia, that, as a matter of federal law, the treaties did not give the Indians a right to a share of the fish runs.  
Page 443 U. S. 659
 The District Court then entered a series of orders enabling it directly to supervise those aspects of the State's fisheries necessary to the preservation of treaty fishing rights.  The District Court's power to take such direct action and, in doing so, to enjoin persons who were not parties to the proceedings was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  That court, in a separate opinion, also held that regulations of the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission (IPSFC) posed no impediment to the District Court's interpretation of the treaty language and to its enforcement of that interpretation.
Held:
1. The language of the treaties securing a ""right of taking fish . . . in common with all citizens of the Territory"" was not intended merely to guarantee the Indians access to usual and accustomed fishing sites and an ""equal opportunity"" for individual Indians, along with non-Indians, to try to catch fish, but instead secures to the Indian tribes a right to harvest a share of each run of anadromous fish that passes through tribal fishing areas. This conclusion is mandated by a fair appraisal of the purpose of the treaty negotiations, the language of the treaties, and, particularly, this Court's prior decisions construing the treaties.  United State v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371; Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 391 U. S. 392 (Puyallup I); Washington Game Dept. v. Puyallup Tribe, 414 U. S. 44 (Puyallup II); Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 433 U. S. 165 (Puyallup III).  Pp.  443 U. S. 674-685.
2. An equitable measure of the common right to take fish should initially divide the harvestable portion of each run that passes through a ""usual and accustomed"" place into approximately equal treaty and nontreaty shares, and should then reduce the treaty share if tribal needs may be satisfied by a lesser amount.  Cf. Puyallup III, supra.  Although the District Court's exercise of its discretion, as slightly modified by the Court of Appeals, is in most respects unobjectionable, the District Court erred in excluding fish taken by the Indians on their reservations from their share of the runs, and in excluding fish caught for the Indians' ceremonial and subsistence needs.  Pp.  443 U. S. 685-689.
3. The Convention of May 26, 1930, whereby Canada and the United States agreed that the catch of Fraser River salmon should be equally divided between Canadian and American fishermen, subject to regulations proposed by the IPSFC for approval by both countries, does not preempt the Indians' fishing rights under the treaties with respect to Fraser River salmon runs passing through certain ""usual and accustomed"" places of treaty tribes.  Pp.  443 U. S. 689-692.
4. Any state law prohibition against compliance with the District Court's decree cannot survive the command of the Supremacy Clause, 
Page 443 U. S. 660
 and the State Game and Fisheries Departments, as parties to this litigation, may be ordered to prepare a set of rules that will implement the court's interpretation of the parties' rights even if state law withholds from them the power to do so.  Cf. Puyallup II, supra.  Whether or not the Game and Fisheries Departments may be ordered actually to promulgate regulations having effect as a matter of state law, the District Court may assume direct supervision of the fisheries if state recalcitrance or state law barriers should be continued.  If the spirit of cooperation motivating the State Attorney General's representation to this Court that definitive resolution of the basic federal question of construction of the treaties will allow state compliance with federal court orders is not confirmed by the conduct of state officials, the District Court has the power to undertake the necessary remedial steps and to enlist the aid of appropriate federal law enforcement agents in carrying out those steps.  Pp.  443 U. S. 692-696.

This conclusion is mandated by a fair appraisal of the purpose of the treaty negotiations, the language of the treaties, and, particularly, this Court's prior decisions construing the treaties.  United State v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371; Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 391 U. S. 392 (Puyallup I); Washington Game Dept. v. Puyallup Tribe, 414 U. S. 44 (Puyallup II); Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 433 U. S. 165 (Puyallup III).  Pp.  443 U. S. 674-685.
2. An equitable measure of the common right to take fish should initially divide the harvestable portion of each run that passes through a ""usual and accustomed"" place into approximately equal treaty and nontreaty shares, and should then reduce the treaty share if tribal needs may be satisfied by a lesser amount.  Cf. Puyallup III, supra.  Although the District Court's exercise of its discretion, as slightly modified by the Court of Appeals, is in most respects unobjectionable, the District Court erred in excluding fish taken by the Indians on their reservations from their share of the runs, and in excluding fish caught for the Indians' ceremonial and subsistence needs.  Pp.  443 U. S. 685-689.
3. The Convention of May 26, 1930, whereby Canada and the United States agreed that the catch of Fraser River salmon should be equally divided between Canadian and American fishermen, subject to regulations proposed by the IPSFC for approval by both countries, does not preempt the Indians' fishing rights under the treaties with respect to Fraser River salmon runs passing through certain ""usual and accustomed"" places of treaty tribes.  Pp.  443 U. S. 689-692.
4. Any state law prohibition against compliance with the District Court's decree cannot survive the command of the Supremacy Clause, 
Page 443 U. S. 660
 and the State Game and Fisheries Departments, as parties to this litigation, may be ordered to prepare a set of rules that will implement the court's interpretation of the parties' rights even if state law withholds from them the power to do so.  Cf. Puyallup II, supra.  Whether or not the Game and Fisheries Departments may be ordered actually to promulgate regulations having effect as a matter of state law, the District Court may assume direct supervision of the fisheries if state recalcitrance or state law barriers should be continued.  If the spirit of cooperation motivating the State Attorney General's representation to this Court that definitive resolution of the basic federal question of construction of the treaties will allow state compliance with federal court orders is not confirmed by the conduct of state officials, the District Court has the power to undertake the necessary remedial steps and to enlist the aid of appropriate federal law enforcement agents in carrying out those steps.  Pp.  443 U. S. 692-696.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who, upon a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, was found guilty of second-degree murder by an Indiana jury, sought federal habeas corpus relief after the Indiana Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, claiming, inter alia, that he had been denied due process because he had been convicted upon evidence insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was sane at the time of the killing.  The District Court denied the writ, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence presents a federal due process issue ""only where a state court conviction is totally devoid of evidentiary support.""
Held:  Although a state prisoner is entitled to a determination whether the record evidence could support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, Jackson v. Virginia, ante, p. 307, nevertheless a remand for further consideration in light of Jackson is inappropriate here.  The Court of Appeals properly deferred to a rule of Indiana law permitting sanity to be established by either expert or lay testimony, and although that court applied an improper legal standard in considering the due process claim, it appears that such claim concerned the above Indiana rule, and that the evidence in support of the conviction was constitutionally adequate under the Jackson standard.

No. 78-432
Argued March 28, 1979
Decided June 27, 1979*
443 U.S. 193

Syllabus 
In 1974, petitioners United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and Kaiser Aluminum  Chemical Corp. (Kaiser) entered into a master collective bargaining agreement covering terms and conditions of employment at 15 Kaiser plants.  The agreement included an affirmative action plan designed to eliminate conspicuous racial imbalances in Kaiser's then almost exclusively white craft work forces by reserving for black employees 50% of the openings in in-plant craft training programs until the percentage of black craft workers in a plant is commensurate with the percentage of blacks in the local labor force.  This litigation arose from the operation of the affirmative action plan at one of Kaiser's plants where, prior to 1974, only 1.83% of the skilled craft workers were black, even though the local workforce was approximately 39% black.  Pursuant to the national agreement, Kaiser, rather than continuing its practice of hiring trained outsiders, established a training program to train its production workers to fill craft openings, selecting trainees on the basis of seniority, with the proviso that at least 50% of the trainees were to be black until the percentage of black skilled craft workers in the plant approximated the percentage of blacks in the local labor force.  During the plan's first year of operation, seven black and six white craft trainees were selected from the plant's production workforce, with the most senior black trainee having less seniority than several white production workers whose bids for admission were rejected.  Thereafter, respondent Weber, one of those white production workers, instituted this class action in Federal District Court, alleging that, because the affirmative action program had resulted in junior black employees' receiving training in preference to senior white employees, respondent and other similarly situated white employees had been discriminated against in violation of the provisions of  703(a) and(d) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that make it unlawful to ""discriminate . . . because 
Page 443 U. S. 194
 of . . . race"" in hiring and in the selection of apprentices for training programs.  The District Court held that the affirmative action plan violated Title VII, entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff class, and granted injunctive relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that all employment preferences based upon race, including those preferences incidental to bona fide affirmative action plans, violated Title VII's prohibition against racial discrimination in employment.
Held:
1. Title VII's prohibition in  703(a) and (d) against racial discrimination does not condemn all private, voluntary, race-conscious affirmative action plans.  Pp.  443 U. S. 200-208.
(a) Respondent Weber's reliance upon a literal construction of the statutory provisions and upon McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U. S. 273, which held, in a case not involving affirmative action, that Title VII protects whites as well as blacks from certain forms of racial discrimination, is misplaced, since the Kaiser-USWA plan is an affirmative action plan voluntarily adopted by private parties to eliminate traditional patterns of racial segregation.  ""[A] thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute, because not within its spirit, nor within the intention of its makers,"" Holy Trinity Church v. United States, 143 U. S. 457,  143 U. S. 459, and, thus, the prohibition against racial discrimination in  703(a) and (d) must be read against the background of the legislative history of Title VII and the historical context from which the Act arose.  P.  443 U. S. 201.
(b) Examination of those sources makes clear that an interpretation of  703(a) and (d) that forbids all race-conscious affirmative action would bring about an end completely at variance with the purpose of the statute, and must be rejected.  Congress' primary concern in enacting the prohibition against racial discrimination in Title VII was with the plight of the Negro in our economy, and the prohibition against racial discrimination in employment was primarily addressed to the problem of opening opportunities for Negroes in occupations which have been traditionally closed to them.  In view of the legislative history, the very statutory words intended as a spur or catalyst to cause
""employers and unions to self-examine and to self-evaluate their employment practices and to endeavor to eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestiges of an unfortunate and ignominious page in this country's history,""
Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405,  422 U. S. 418, cannot be interpreted as an absolute prohibition against all private, voluntary, race-conscious affirmative action efforts to hasten the elimination of such vestiges.  Pp.  443 U. S. 201-204. 
Page 443 U. S. 195

(c) This conclusion is further reinforced by examination of the language and legislative history of  703(j) of Title VII, which provides that nothing contained in Title VII
""shall be interpreted to require any employer . . . to grant preferential treatment . . . to any group because of the race . . . of such . . . group on account of""
a de facto racial imbalance in the employer's workforce.  Had Congress meant to prohibit all race-conscious affirmative action, it could have provided that Title VII would not require or permit racially preferential integration efforts.  The legislative record shows that  703(j) was designed to prevent  703 from being interpreted in such a way as to lead to undue federal regulation of private businesses, and thus use of the word ""require,"" rather than the phrase ""require or permit,"" in  703(j) fortifies the conclusion that Congress did not intend to limit traditional business freedom to such a degree as to prohibit all voluntary, race-conscious affirmative action.  Pp.  443 U. S. 204-207.
2. It is not necessary in these cases to define the line of demarcation between permissible and impermissible affirmative action plans; it suffices to hold that the challenged Kaiser-USWA plan falls on the permissible side of the line.  The purposes of the plan mirror those of the statute, being designed to break down old patterns of racial segregation and hierarchy, and being structured to open employment opportunities for Negroes in occupations which have been traditionally closed to them.  At the same time, the plan does not unnecessarily trammel the interests of white employees, neither requiring the discharge of white workers and their replacement with new black hirees, nor creating an absolute bar to the advancement of white employees, since half of those trained in the program will be white.  Moreover, the plan is a temporary measure, not intended to maintain racial balance, but simply to eliminate a manifest racial imbalance.  Pp.  443 U. S. 209-209.

Petitioner also brought this negligence action against respondent in Federal District Court, wherein the jury determined that petitioner was responsible for 10% of the total negligence resulting in his injury, that the stevedore's fault, through a coemployee's negligence, contributed 70%, and that respondent was accountable for 20%.  Following established maritime law, the District Court reduced the award to petitioner by the 10% attributed to his own negligence, but refused further to reduce the award against respondent in proportion to the fault of the stevedore employer.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the 1972 Amendments to the Act had altered the traditional admiralty rule by making the shipowner liable only for that share of the total damages equivalent to the ratio of its fault to the total fault.
Held:
1. Under the 1972 Amendments to the Act, Congress did not intend to change the judicially created admiralty rule that the shipowner can be made to pay all the damages not due to the plaintiff's own negligence by imposing a proportionate fault rule.  Pp.  443 U. S. 263-271.
(a) There is no conflict between the provisions of the Amendments that (1) in the event of injury to a person covered by the Act ""caused by the negligence of a vessel,"" such person may bring an action against the vessel as a third party, and the employer shall not be liable to the vessel for such damages directly or indirectly and any agreements or warranties to the contrary shall be void, and (2) if such person was employed by the vessel to provide stevedoring services, no such action shall be permitted if the injury was ""caused by the negligence of persons engaged in providing stevedoring services to the vessel.""  The first provision addresses the recurring situation, such as in this case, where the party injured by the vessel's negligence is a longshoreman employed by a stevedoring concern, and does not purport to modify the traditional 
Page 443 U. S. 257
 admiralty rule.  The second provision applies only to the less familiar arrangement where the ship is its own stevedore, and is to be construed as permitting a third-party suit against the shipowner stevedore when negligence in its nonstevedoring capacity contributes to the injury.  Pp.  443 U. S. 263-266.
(b) The legislative history does not support the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the statute, which modifies the longshoreman's preexisting rights against the negligent vessel.  Pp.  443 U. S. 266-268.
(c) While some inequity appears inevitable in the present statutory scheme, and while the Court of Appeals' proportionate fault rule may remove some of the inequities, nevertheless it creates others and appears to shift some burdens to the longshoreman.  There is nothing to indicate and it will not be presumed that Congress intended to place the burden of the inequity on the longshoreman whom the Act seeks to protect.  Pp.  443 U. S. 268-271.
2. Nor will this Court change the traditional rule so as to make the vessel liable only for the damages in proportion to its own negligence.  By now changing what Congress understood to be the law and did not itself wish to modify, this Court might knock out of kilter the delicate balance effected by Congress concerning the liability of vessels, as third parties, to pay damages to longshoremen who are injured while engaged in stevedoring operations.  This Court should stay its hand in these circumstances.  Pp.  443 U. S. 271-273.

443 U.S. 282

Syllabus 
Held:  Section 202(g)(1) of the Social Security Act restricting ""mother's insurance benefits"" to widows and divorced wives of wage earners does not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by thus denying such benefits to the mother of an illegitimate child because she was never married to the wage earner who fathered the child.   Pp.  443 U. S. 288-297.
(a) Such denial bears a rational relation to the Government's desire to ease the economic dislocation that occurs when the wage earner dies and the surviving parent is left with the choice to stay home and care for the children or to go to work.  Congress could reasonably conclude that a woman who never married the wage earner is far less likely than one who did to be dependent upon the wage earner at the time of his death.  Pp.  443 U. S. 288-293.
(b) The incidental and, to a large degree, speculative impact of  202(g)(1) on illegitimate children as a class is not sufficient to treat the denial of ""mother's insurance benefits"" to unwed mothers as discrimination against the children.  The focus of these benefits is on the economic dilemma of the surviving spouse or former spouse, whereas the needs, as such, of the minor children of the deceased wage earner are addressed through the separate ""child's insurance benefits"" provided by the Act.

443 U.S. 97

Syllabus 
Respondent newspapers published articles containing the name of a juvenile who had been arrested for allegedly killing another youth.  Respondents learned of the event and the name of the alleged assailant by monitoring the police band radio frequency and by asking various eyewitnesses.  Respondents were indicted for violating a West Virginia statute which makes it a crime for a newspaper to publish, without the written approval of the juvenile court, the name of any youth charged as a juvenile offender.  The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals granted a writ of prohibition against petitioners, the prosecuting attorney and the Circuit Judges of Kanawha County, W.Va., holding that the statute on which the indictment was based violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held:  The State cannot, consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, punish the truthful publication of an alleged juvenile delinquent's name lawfully obtained by a newspaper.  The asserted state interest in protecting the anonymity of the juvenile offender to further his rehabilitation cannot justify the statute's imposition of criminal sanctions for publication of a juvenile's name lawfully obtained.  Pp.  443 U. S. 101-106.
(a) Whether the statute is viewed as a prior restraint by authorizing the juvenile judge to permit publication or as a penal sanction for publishing lawfully obtained, truthful information is not dispositive, because even the latter action requires the highest form of state interest to sustain its validity.  When a state attempts to punish publication after the event, it must demonstrate that its punitive action was necessary to further the state interests asserted.  Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829.  Pp.  443 U. S. 101-104.
(b) Respondents' First Amendment rights prevail over the State's interest in protecting juveniles.  Cf. Davis v. Alaska, 415 U. S. 308.  Even assuming that the statute served a state interest of the highest order, the statute does not accomplish its stated purpose, since it does not restrict the electronic media or any form of publication except ""newspapers.""

Syllabus 
Respondent United States Senator publicizes examples of wasteful governmental spending by awarding his ""Golden Fleece of the Month Award.""  One such award was given to federal agencies that had funded petitioner scientist's study of emotional behavior in which he sought an objective measure of aggression, concentrating upon the behavior patterns of certain animals.  The award was announced in a speech prepared with the help of respondent legislative assistant, the text of which was incorporated in a widely distributed press release.  Subsequently, the award was also referred to in newsletters sent out by the Senator, in a television interview program on which he appeared, and in telephone calls made by the legislative assistant to the sponsoring federal agencies.  Petitioner sued respondents in Federal District Court for defamation, alleging, inter alia, that in making the award and publicizing it nationwide, respondents had damaged him in his professional and academic standing.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, holding that the Speech or Debate Clause afforded absolute immunity for investigating the funding of petitioner's research, for the speech in the Senate, and for the press release, since it fell within the ""informing function"" of Congress.  The court further held that petitioner was a ""public figure"" for purposes of determining respondents' liability; that respondents were protected by the First Amendment, thereby requiring petitioner to prove ""actual malice""; and that, based on the depositions, affidavits, and pleadings, there was no genuine issue of material fact on the issue of actual malice, neither respondents' failure to investigate nor unfair editing and summarizing being sufficient to establish ""actual malice.""  Finally, the court held that, even if petitioner were found to be a ""private person,"" relevant state law required a summary judgment for respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the Speech or Debate Clause protected the statements made in the press release and newsletters and that, although the followup telephone calls and the statements made on television were not protected by that Clause, they were protected by the First Amendment, since petitioner was a ""public figure,"" and that on the record there was no showing of ""actual malice.""

Held:
1. While this Court's practice is to avoid reaching constitutional questions if a dispositive nonconstitutional ground is available, special considerations in this case mandate that the constitutional questions first be resolved.  If respondents have immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause, no other questions need be considered.  And where it appears that the Court of Appeals would not affirm the District Court's state law holding, so that the appeal could not be decided without reaching the First Amendment issue, that issue will also be reached here.  Pp.  443 U. S. 122-123.
2. The Speech or Debate Clause does not protect transmittal of information by individual Members of Congress by press releases and newsletters.  Pp.  443 U. S. 123-133.
(a) There is nothing in the history of the Clause or its language suggesting any intent to create an absolute privilege from liability or suit for defamatory statements made outside the legislative Chambers; precedents support the conclusion that a Member may be held liable for republishing defamatory statements originally made in the Chamber.  Pp.  443 U. S. 127-130.
(b) Neither the newsletters nor the press release here was ""essential to the deliberation of the Senate,"" and neither was part of the deliberative process.  Gravel v. United States, 408 U. S. 606; Doe v. McMillan, 412 U. S. 306.  P.  443 U. S. 130.
(c) The newsletters and press release were not privileged as part of the ""informing function"" of Members of Congress to tell the public about their activities.  Individual Members' transmittal of information about their activities by press releases and newsletters is not part of the legislative function or the deliberations that make up the legislative process; in contrast to voting and preparing committee reports, which are part of Congress' function to inform itself, newsletters and press releases are primarily means of informing those outside t.he legislative forum, and represent the views and will of a single Member.

Neither the fact that local newspapers reported the federal grants to petitioner for his research nor the fact that he had access to the news media as shown by reports of his response to the announcement of the Golden Fleece Award demonstrates that he was a public figure prior to the controversy engendered by that award.  His access, such as it was, came after the alleged libel, and was limited to responding to the announcement of the award.

Syllabus 
Respondent's brother somehow procured a duplicate of respondent's driver's license, except that it bore the brother's picture.  The brother was arrested on narcotics charges, booked in respondent's name, and released on bond.  An arrest warrant intended for the brother was subsequently issued in respondent's name.  Pursuant to that warrant, respondent, over his protest, was taken into custody by the Potter County, Tex., Sheriff's Department and detained in jail for several days before the error was discovered and he was released.  Claiming that his detention in jail had deprived him of liberty without due process of law, respondent brought an action in District Court against petitioner sheriff of Potter County and his surety under 42 U.S.C.  1983, which imposes civil liability on any person who, under color of state law, subjects another to the deprivation of rights ""secured by the Constitution and laws.""  The District Court directed a verdict in favor of petitioner and his surety.  The Court of Appeals, characterizing respondent's cause of action as a ""[] 1983 false imprisonment action,"" reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to have his  1983 claim presented to the jury even though the evidence supported no more than a finding of negligence on petitioner's part.
Held:  Respondent failed to satisfy  1983's threshold requirement that the plaintiff be deprived of a right ""secured by the Constitution and laws,"" and hence had no claim cognizable under  1983.  Pp.  443 U. S. 142-147.
(a) Absent an attack on the validity of the warrant under which he was arrested, respondent's complaint is simply that, despite his protests of mistaken identity, he was detained in jail for three days.  Whatever claim this situation might give rise to under state tort law, it gives rise to no claim under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  While respondent was deprived of his liberty for three days, it was pursuant to a warrant conforming to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.  His detention, therefore, did not amount to a deprivation of liberty without due process of law.  Pp.  443 U. S. 142-145.
(b) Respondent's innocence of the charge contained in the warrant, while relevant to a tort claim of false imprisonment, is largely irrelevant to his claim of deprivation of liberty without due process of law.  
Page 443 U. S. 138
 Given the requirements that an arrest be made only on probable cause and that one detained be accorded a speedy trial, a sheriff executing a valid arrest warrant is not required by the Constitution to investigate independently every claim of innocence, whether the claim is based on mistaken identity or a defense such as lack of requisite intent.  Nor is the official maintaining custody of the person named in the warrant required by the Constitution to perform an error-free investigation of such a claim.  Pp.  443 U. S. 145-146.
(c) The tort of false imprisonment does not become a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment merely because the defendant is a state official.  P.  443 U. S. 146.

Syllabus 
Respondent's brother somehow procured a duplicate of respondent's driver's license, except that it bore the brother's picture.  The brother was arrested on narcotics charges, booked in respondent's name, and released on bond.  An arrest warrant intended for the brother was subsequently issued in respondent's name.  Pursuant to that warrant, respondent, over his protest, was taken into custody by the Potter County, Tex., Sheriff's Department and detained in jail for several days before the error was discovered and he was released.  Claiming that his detention in jail had deprived him of liberty without due process of law, respondent brought an action in District Court against petitioner sheriff of Potter County and his surety under 42 U.S.C.  1983, which imposes civil liability on any person who, under color of state law, subjects another to the deprivation of rights ""secured by the Constitution and laws.""  The District Court directed a verdict in favor of petitioner and his surety.  The Court of Appeals, characterizing respondent's cause of action as a ""[] 1983 false imprisonment action,"" reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to have his  1983 claim presented to the jury even though the evidence supported no more than a finding of negligence on petitioner's part.

Syllabus 
As a result of a grand jury investigation, during 1957 and 1958, of Soviet intelligence agents in the United States, petitioner's aunt and uncle were arrested on, and later pleaded guilty to, espionage charges.  In the ensuing months, petitioner, pursuant to grand jury subpoenas, traveled from his home in the District of Columbia to New York City, where the grand jury was sitting, but on one occasion he failed to respond to a subpoena, having previously attempted unsuccessfully to persuade law enforcement authorities not to require him to travel because of his mental condition.  A Federal District Judge then issued an order to show cause why petitioner should not be adjudged in criminal contempt of court.  Petitioner appeared in court on the return date of this order and offered to testify before the grand jury, but the offer was refused, and thereafter he pleaded guilty to the contempt charge when his pregnant wife became hysterical upon being called to testify as to his mental condition.  Petitioner received a suspended sentence.  These events were reported in a number of stories in the Washington and New York newspapers, but the publicity subsided following petitioner's sentencing, and he succeeded, for the most part, in returning to the private life he had led prior to such events.  In 1974, respondent Reader's Digest Association published a book written by respondent Barron, which describes the Soviet Union's espionage organization and chronicles its activities since World War II.  The book was later published by the other respondent publishers.  In one passage in the book, petitioner is named as ""[a]mong Soviet agents identified in the United States"" and ""convicted of . . . contempt charges following espionage indictments,"" and the index lists petitioner as a ""Soviet agent in U.S.""  Petitioner sued respondents, claiming that the above passages in the book were false and defamatory.  The District Court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment, holding that petitioner was a ""public figure"" because, by failing to appear before the grand jury and subjecting himself to a citation for contempt, he ""became involved in a controversy of a decidedly public nature in a way that invited attention and comment, and 
Page 443 U. S. 158
 thereby created in the public an interest in knowing about his connection with espionage""; that the First Amendment therefore precluded recovery unless petitioner proved that respondents had published a defamatory falsehood with ""actual malice""; and that the evidence raised no genuine issue with respect to the existence of ""actual malice.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Petitioner was not a public figure within the meaning of this Court's defamation cases, and therefore was not required by the First Amendment to meet the ""actual malice"" standard of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, in order to recover from respondents.  Pp.  443 U. S. 163-169.
(a) Contrary to respondents' argument and the lower courts' holdings, petitioner does not fall within the category of those public figures who have ""thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved,"" Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323,  418 U. S. 345.  Neither the mere fact that petitioner voluntarily chose not to appear before the grand jury, knowing that this might be attended by publicity, the citation for contempt, nor the simple fact that his failure to appear and the contempt citation attracted media attention, rendered him such a public figure.  His failure to appear was in no way calculated to draw attention to himself in order to invite public comment or influence the public with respect to any issue, but rather appears simply to have been the result of his poor health.  And there is no evidence that his failure to appear was intended to have, or did in fact have, any effect on any issue of public concern.  Pp.  443 U. S. 165-168.
(b) A person who engages in criminal conduct does not automatically become a public figure for purposes of comment on a limited range of issues relating to his conviction.  Time, Inc. v. Firestone, 424 U. S. 448.  To hold otherwise would create an ""open season"" for all who sought to defame persons convicted of a crime.  Pp.  443 U. S. 168-169.

Syllabus 
After publicly announcing its intent to make a tender offer to purchase shares of stock of a company having substantial assets in Idaho, appellee, a Texas-based corporation which is also engaged in business in New York and Maryland, filed the informational schedule with the Securities and Exchange Commission required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), as amended by the Williams Act, and also filed documents in Idaho in an attempt to satisfy that State's takeover statute.  When Idaho officials objected to the filing and delayed the effective date of the tender offer, appellee brought an action in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas against the officials responsible for enforcing Idaho's takeover law, seeking a declaration that the state law was invalid insofar as it purported to apply to interstate tender offers to purchase securities traded on a national exchange.  The District Court held that personal jurisdiction over the Idaho defendants had been obtained under the Texas long-arm statute, and that venue could be sustained under the special venue provision in  27 of the 1934 Act giving federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction of actions brought to enforce ""any liability or duty created"" by the Act.  The court then went on to hold that the Idaho takeover statute was preempted by the Williams Act and placed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding, inter alia, that venue was authorized by  27 of the 1934 Act, because Idaho's enforcement attempt, by conflicting with the Williams Act, constituted a violation of a ""duty"" imposed by  28(a) of the 1934 Act (which provides that nothing in the Act shall affect a state securities regulatory agency's jurisdiction over any security or person insofar as it does not conflict with the Act), and that venue was also proper under 28 U.S.C.  1391(b) (which permits actions not founded solely on diversity of citizenship to be brought in the district where all defendants reside or ""in which the claim arose"") because the allegedly invalid restraint against appellee occurred in the Northern District of Texas, and that was accordingly the district ""in which the claim arose."" 
Page 443 U. S. 174

Held:
1. There is a sound prudential justification in this case for reversing the normal order of considering personal jurisdiction in advance of venue, since otherwise this Court would have to decide a constitutional law question not previously decided as to whether personal jurisdiction was properly obtained under the Texas long-arm statute.  Pp.  443 U. S. 180-181.
2. Venue was improper under  27 of the 1934 Act because  28(a) of that Act imposed no duty on the Idaho officials.  Pp.  443 U. S. 181-182.
3. Nor was venue available in the Northern District of Texas under 28 U.S.C.  1391(b).  The District of Idaho, where the actions forming the basis for appellee's claim took place, is the only one in which ""the claim arose"" within the meaning of  1391(b).  Pp.  443 U. S. 183-187.

443 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
A Massachusetts statute mandates suspension of a driver's license for refusing to take a breath-analysis test upon arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  The Registrar of Motor Vehicles must order a 90-day suspension upon receipt of the police report of the licensee's refusal to take such test; the licensee, after surrendering his license, is entitled to an immediate hearing before the Registrar.  Appellee, whose license was suspended under the statute, brought a class action in Federal District Court alleging that the Massachusetts statute was unconstitutional on its face and as applied in that it authorized the suspension of his license without affording him a pre-suspension hearing.  The District Court held that appellee was entitled as a matter of due process to some sort of pre-suspension hearing, declared the statute unconstitutional on its face as violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and granted injunctive relief.
Held:  The Massachusetts statute is not void on its face as violative of the Due Process Clause.  Cf. Dixon v. Love, 431 U. S. 105.  Pp.  443 U. S. 10-19.
(a) Suspension of a driver's license for statutorily defined cause implicates a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause.  Resolution of the question of what process is due to protect against an erroneous deprivation of a protectible property interest requires consideration 
Page 443 U. S. 2
 of (i) the nature and weight of the private interest affected by the official action challenged; (ii) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest as a consequence of the summary procedures used; and (iii) the governmental function involved and state interests served by such procedures, as well as the administrative and fiscal burdens, if any, that would result from the substitute procedures sought.  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319.  Pp.  443 U. S. 10-11.
(b) Here, neither the nature of the private interest involved -- the licensee's interest in the continued possession and use of his license pending the outcome of the hearing due him -- nor its weight compels a conclusion that the summary suspension procedures are unconstitutional, particularly in view of the post-suspension hearing immediately available and of the fact that the suspension is for a maximum of only 90 days.  Pp.  443 U. S. 11-12.
(c) Nor is the risk of error inherent in the pre-suspension procedure so substantial in itself as to require a departure from the ""ordinary principle"" that ""something less than an evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action.""  Dixon v. Love, supra, at  431 U. S. 113.  The risk of erroneous observation or deliberate misrepresentation by the reporting police officer of the facts forming the basis for the suspension is insubstantial.  When there are disputed facts, the risk of error inherent in the statute's initial reliance on the reporting officer's representations is not so substantial, in itself, as to require the Commonwealth to stay its hand pending the outcome of any evidentiary hearing necessary to resolve questions of credibility or conflicts in the evidence.  Pp.  443 U. S. 13-17.
(d) Finally, the compelling interest in highway safety justifies Massachusetts in making a summary suspension effective pending the outcome of the available prompt post-suspension hearing.  Such interest is substantially served by the summary suspension because (i) it acts as a deterrent to drunk driving; (ii) provides an inducement to take the breath-analysis test, permitting the Commonwealth to obtain a reliable form of evidence for use in subsequent criminal proceedings; and (iii) summarily removes from the road licensees arrested for drunk driving who refuse to take the test.  Conversely, a pre-suspension hearing would substantially undermine the Commonwealth's interest in public safety by giving drivers an incentive to refuse the breath-analysis test and demand such a hearing as a dilatory tactic, which, in turn, would cause a sharp increase in the number of hearings sought, and thus impose a substantial fiscal and administrative burden on the Commonwealth.  Nor is it any answer to the Commonwealth's interest in public safety 
Page 443 U. S. 3
 promoted by the summary sanction that such interest could be served as well in other ways.  A state has the right to offer incentives for taking tho breath-analysis test and, in exercising its police powers, is not required by the Due Process Clause to adopt an ""all or nothing"" approach to the acute safety hazard posed by drunk driver.  Pp.  443 U. S. 17-19.

Dixon v. Love, supra, at  431 U. S. 113.  The risk of erroneous observation or deliberate misrepresentation by the reporting police officer of the facts forming the basis for the suspension is insubstantial.  When there are disputed facts, the risk of error inherent in the statute's initial reliance on the reporting officer's representations is not so substantial, in itself, as to require the Commonwealth to stay its hand pending the outcome of any evidentiary hearing necessary to resolve questions of credibility or conflicts in the evidence.  Pp.  443 U. S. 13-17.
(d) Finally, the compelling interest in highway safety justifies Massachusetts in making a summary suspension effective pending the outcome of the available prompt post-suspension hearing.  Such interest is substantially served by the summary suspension because (i) it acts as a deterrent to drunk driving; (ii) provides an inducement to take the breath-analysis test, permitting the Commonwealth to obtain a reliable form of evidence for use in subsequent criminal proceedings; and (iii) summarily removes from the road licensees arrested for drunk driving who refuse to take the test.  Conversely, a pre-suspension hearing would substantially undermine the Commonwealth's interest in public safety by giving drivers an incentive to refuse the breath-analysis test and demand such a hearing as a dilatory tactic, which, in turn, would cause a sharp increase in the number of hearings sought, and thus impose a substantial fiscal and administrative burden on the Commonwealth.  Nor is it any answer to the Commonwealth's interest in public safety 
Page 443 U. S. 3
 promoted by the summary sanction that such interest could be served as well in other ways.  A state has the right to offer incentives for taking tho breath-analysis test and, in exercising its police powers, is not required by the Due Process Clause to adopt an ""all or nothing"" approach to the acute safety hazard posed by drunk driver.  Pp.  443 U. S. 17-19.

Syllabus 
At 10 o'clock at night, Detroit police officers found respondent in an alley with a woman who was in the process of lowering her slacks.  When asked for identification, respondent gave inconsistent and evasive responses.  He was then arrested for violation of a Detroit ordinance which provides that a police officer may stop and question an individual if he has reasonable cause to believe that the individual's ""behavior . . . warrants further investigation"" for criminal activity, and further provides that it is unlawful for any person so stopped to refuse to identify himself and produce evidence of his identity.  In a search which followed, the officers discovered drugs on respondent's person, and he was charged with a drug offense but not with violation of the ordinance.  The trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the search.  The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Detroit ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, that both the arrest and search were invalid because respondent had been arrested pursuant to that ordinance, and that the evidence obtained in the search should have been suppressed on federal constitutional grounds even though it was obtained as a result of an arrest pursuant to a presumptively valid ordinance.
Held:  Respondent's arrest, made in good faith reliance on the Detroit ordinance, which at the time had not been declared unconstitutional, was valid regardless of the subsequent judicial determination of its unconstitutionality, and therefore the drugs obtained in the search should not have been suppressed.  Pp.  443 U. S. 350.
(a) Under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, an arresting officer may, without a warrant, search a person validly arrested.  The fact of a lawful arrest, standing alone, authorizes a search.  Pp.  443 U. S. 35-36.
(b) The Constitution permits an officer to arrest a suspect without a warrant if there is probable cause to believe that the suspect has committed or is committing an offense.  Here, the arresting officer had abundant probable cause to believe that respondent's conduct violated the ordinance:  respondent's presence with a woman in the circumstances described clearly was ""behavior warrant[ing] further investigation"" 
Page 443 U. S. 32
 under the ordinance, and respondent's responses to the request for identification constituted a refusal to identify himself as the ordinance required.  Pp.  443 U. S. 36-37.
(c) Under these circumstances, the arresting officer did not lack probable cause simply because he should have known the ordinance was invalid and would be judicially declared unconstitutional.  A prudent officer, in the course of determining whether respondent had committed an offense under such circumstances, should not have been required to anticipate that a court would later hold the ordinance unconstitutional.  Pp.  443 U. S. 37-38.
(d) Since the arrest under the presumptively valid ordinance was valid, the search which followed was valid because it was incidental to that arrest.  Torres v. Puerto Rico, 442 U.

Two police officers, while cruising near noon in a patrol car, observed appellant and another man walking away from one another in an alley in an area with a high incidence of drug traffic.

Syllabus 
The New York State Racing and Wagering Board (Board), which is empowered to license horse trainers participating in harness horse-race meets in New York, has issued regulations specifying the standards of conduct that a trainer must satisfy to retain his license.  The trainer's responsibility rules provide that, when a pos-trace test of a horse reveals the presence of drugs, it is to be presumed -- subject to rebuttal -- that the drug was either administered by the trainer or resulted from his negligence in failing adequately to protect against such occurrence.  Under a New York statute ( 8022), a suspended licensee is entitled to a post-suspension hearing, but the statute specifies no time in which the hearing must be held, affords the Board as long as 30 days after the hearing in which to issue a final order, and ordains that,
""[p]ending such hearing and final determination thereon, the action of the [Board] in . . . suspending a license . . . shall remain in full force and effect.""
Pursuant to the trainer's responsibility rules and the evidentiary presumption created therein, the Board summarily suspended appellee's trainer's license for 15 days on the basis of a pos-trace test that revealed a drug in the system of a horse trained by him.  Without resorting to the  8022 procedures, appellee filed suit in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of  8022 and the evidentiary presumption under the Board's rules.  The court upheld the presumption, but concluded that  8022 was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since it permitted the State to sanction a trainer without either a pre-suspension or a prompt post-suspension hearing, and that  8022 also violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since it prohibited a stay of a license suspension pending administrative review, whereas, under the laws applicable to thoroughbred racing, suspensions could be stayed pending appeal.
Held:
1. Section 8022 does not violate the Due Process Clause by authorizing summary suspensions without a pre-suspension hearing.  Although 
Page 443 U. S. 56
 appellee has.a property interest in his license under state law sufficient to invoke due process protections, and although the magnitude of a trainer's interest in avoiding suspension is substantial, the State also has an important interest in assuring the integrity of racing carried on under its auspices.  In these circumstances, the State is entitled to impose an interim suspension, pending a prompt judicial or administrative hearing that will definitely determine the issues, whenever it has satisfactorily established probable cause to believe that a horse has been drugged and that a trainer has been at least negligent in connection with the drugging.  Here, the State adduced the assertion of its testing official as proof that appellee's horse had been drugged, and, at the interim suspension stage, an expert's affirmance would appear sufficiently reliable to satisfy constitutional requirements.  As for appellee's culpability, in light of the Board's trainer's responsibility rules, the inference, predicated on the fact of drugging, that appellee was at least negligent will be accepted as defensible, and the State will not be put to further pre-suspension proof that appellee had not complied with the applicable rules.  Pp.  443 U. S. 63-66.
2. However, appellee was not assured a sufficiently timely post-suspension hearing, and  8022 was unconstitutionally applied in this respect.  The statutory provision for an administrative hearing, neither on its face nor as applied, assured  prompt proceeding and prompt disposition of the outstanding issues between appellee and the State, it being as likely as not that appellee and others subject to relatively brief suspensions would have no opportunity to put the State to its proof until they have suffered the full penalty imposed.  Once suspension has been imposed, the trainer's interest in a speedy resolution of the controversy becomes paramount, and there is little or no state interest in an appreciable delay in going forward with a full hearing.  P.  443 U. S. 66.
3. The State's prohibition of administrative stays pending a hearing in the harness racing context without a like prohibition in thoroughbred racing does not deny harness racing trainers equal protection of the laws.   The legislative history of  8022 makes clear that it and other provisions applicable to harness racing resulted from a legislative conclusion that harness racing should be subject to strict regulation, and appellee has not demonstrated that the acute problems attending harness racing also plague thoroughbred racing, and that both types of racing should be treated identically.  Also the procedural mechanism selected to mitigate the threats to the public interest arising in the harness racing context is rationally related to the achievement of that goal.  Pp.  443 U.

Syllabus 
Section 407 of the Social Security Act, which governs the Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Unemployed Father (AFDC-UF) program, provides benefits to families whose dependent children have been deprived of parental support because of the unemployment of the father, but does not provide such benefits when the mother becomes unemployed.  This class action was instituted in Federal District Court against the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (Secretary) and the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare (Commissioner) by appellees, two couples (each having an infant son) who satisfy all the requirements for AFDC-UF benefits except for the requirement that the parent who is ""unemployed"" within the meaning of the Act and applicable regulations be the father.  Appellees alleged that  407 and its implementing regulations discriminate on the basis of gender in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court declared  407 unconstitutional insofar as it establishes a classification which discriminates solely on the basis of sex, and determined that extension of the AFDC-UF program to all families with needy children where either parent is unemployed, rather than nullification of the program, was the proper remedial course.  Subsequently, the District Court declined to modify its order so as to permit the Commissioner to pay benefits only to those families where needy children have been deprived of parental support by the unemployment of the family's ""principal wage-earner.""  The Secretary challenges only the holding on the constitutionality of  407, whereas the Commissioner challenges only the relief.
Held:
1. The gender classification of  407 is not substantially related to the attainment of any important and valid statutory goals; it is, rather, 
Page 443 U. S. 77
 part of the ""baggage of sexual stereotypes,"" Orr v. Orr, 440 U. S. 268,  440 U. S. 283, that presumes the father has the ""primary responsibility to provide a home and its essentials,"" Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7,  421 U. S. 10, while the mother is the ""center of home and family life.""  Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522,  419 U. S. 534 n. 15.  Legislation that rests on such presumptions, without more, cannot survive scrutiny under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  443 U. S. 83-89.
(a) The constitutionality of  407 cannot be sustained on the theory that, although it incorporates a gender distinction, it does not discriminate against women as a class because it affects family units, rather than individuals.  Pp.  443 U. S. 83-85.
(b) Nor can  407's gender distinction survive constitutional scrutiny as being substantially related to achievement of an important governmental objective.  It does not serve the statutory goal of providing aid for needy children, nor is it substantially related to achieving the alleged objective of the AFDC-UF program of reducing the incentive for fathers to desert in order to make their families eligible for assistance.  Pp.  443 U. S. 85-89.
2. The District Court's remedial order was proper.  Pp.  443 U. S. 89-93.
(a) Since no party has argued that nullification of the AFDC-UF program is the proper remedial course, this Court would be inclined to consider that issue only if the power to order extension of the program were clearly beyond the constitutional competence of a federal district court.  However, this Court's previous decisions, which routinely have affirmed district court judgments ordering extension of federal welfare programs, suggest strongly that no such remedial incapacity exists. Pp.89-91.
(b) The District Court, in ordering that benefits be paid to families in which either the mother or the father is unemployed within the meaning of the Act, rather than accepting the ""principal wage-earner"" model suggested by the Commissioner, adopted the simplest and most equitable extension possible.  Pp.  443 U. S. 91-93.

The District Court declared  407 unconstitutional insofar as it establishes a classification which discriminates solely on the basis of sex, and determined that extension of the AFDC-UF program to all families with needy children where either parent is unemployed, rather than nullification of the program, was the proper remedial course.  Subsequently, the District Court declined to modify its order so as to permit the Commissioner to pay benefits only to those families where needy children have been deprived of parental support by the unemployment of the family's ""principal wage-earner.""  The Secretary challenges only the holding on the constitutionality of  407, whereas the Commissioner challenges only the relief.
Held:
1. The gender classification of  407 is not substantially related to the attainment of any important and valid statutory goals; it is, rather, 
Page 443 U. S. 77
 part of the ""baggage of sexual stereotypes,"" Orr v. Orr, 440 U. S. 268,  440 U. S. 283, that presumes the father has the ""primary responsibility to provide a home and its essentials,"" Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7,  421 U. S. 10, while the mother is the ""center of home and family life.""  Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522,  419 U. S. 534 n. 15.  Legislation that rests on such presumptions, without more, cannot survive scrutiny under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  443 U. S. 83-89.
(a) The constitutionality of  407 cannot be sustained on the theory that, although it incorporates a gender distinction, it does not discriminate against women as a class because it affects family units, rather than individuals.  Pp.  443 U. S. 83-85.
(b) Nor can  407's gender distinction survive constitutional scrutiny as being substantially related to achievement of an important governmental objective.  It does not serve the statutory goal of providing aid for needy children, nor is it substantially related to achieving the alleged objective of the AFDC-UF program of reducing the incentive for fathers to desert in order to make their families eligible for assistance.  Pp.  443 U. S. 85-89.
2. The District Court's remedial order was proper.  Pp.  443 U. S. 89-93.
(a) Since no party has argued that nullification of the AFDC-UF program is the proper remedial course, this Court would be inclined to consider that issue only if the power to order extension of the program were clearly beyond the constitutional competence of a federal district court.  However, this Court's previous decisions, which routinely have affirmed district court judgments ordering extension of federal welfare programs, suggest strongly that no such remedial incapacity exists. Pp.89-91.
(b) The District Court, in ordering that benefits be paid to families in which either the mother or the father is unemployed within the meaning of the Act, rather than accepting the ""principal wage-earner"" model suggested by the Commissioner, adopted the simplest and most equitable extension possible.  Pp.  443 U. S. 91-93.
460 F.Supp. 737, affirmed.

Syllabus 
Appellees, children being treated in a Georgia state mental hospital, instituted in Federal District Court a class action against Georgia mental health officials.  Appellees sought a declaratory judgment that Georgia's procedures for voluntary commitment of children under the age of 18 to state mental hospitals violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and requested an injunction against their future enforcement.  Under the Georgia statute providing for the voluntary admission of children to state regional hospitals, admission begins with an application for hospitalization signed by a parent or guardian and, upon application, the superintendent of the hospital is authorized to admit temporarily any child for ""observation and diagnosis.""  If, after observation, the superintendent finds ""evidence of mental illness"" and that the child is ""suitable for treatment"" in the hospital, the child may be admitted ""for such period and under such conditions as may be authorized by law.""  Under Georgia's mental health statute, any child who has been hospitalized for more than five days may be discharged at the request of a parent or guardian, and the hospital superintendent, even without a request for discharge, has an affirmative duty to release any child
""who has recovered from his mental illness or who has sufficiently improved that the superintendent determines that hospitalization of the patient is no longer desirable.""
The District Court held that Georgia's statutory scheme was unconstitutional because it failed to protect adequately the appellees' due process rights and that the process due included at least the right after notice to an adversary-type hearing before an impartial tribunal.
Held:  The District Court erred in holding unconstitutional the State's procedures for admitting a child for treatment to a state mental hospital, since, on the record in this case, Georgia's medical factfinding processes are consistent with constitutional guarantees.  Pp.  442 U. S. 598-621.
(a) Testing challenged state procedures under a due process claim requires a balancing of (i) the private interest that will be affected by 
Page 442 U. S. 585
 the official action; (ii) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (iii) the state's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burden that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.  Cf. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319,  424 U. S. 335; Smith v. Organization of Foster Families, 431 U. S. 816,  431 U. S. 848-849.  Pp.  442 U. S. 599-600.
(b) Notwithstanding a child's liberty interest in not being confined unnecessarily for medical treatment, and assuming that a person has a protectible interest in not being erroneously labeled as mentally ill, parents -- who have traditional interests in and responsibility for the upbringing of their child -- retain a substantial, if not the dominant, role in the decision, absent a finding of neglect or abuse.  However, the child's rights and the nature of the commitment decision are such that parents do not always have absolute discretion to institutionalize a child; they retain plenary authority to seek such care for their children, subject to an independent medical judgment.  Cf. Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510; Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205; Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158; Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390.  Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, distinguished.  Pp.  442 U. S. 600-604.
(c) The State has significant interests in confining the use of costly mental health facilities to cases of genuine need, in not imposing unnecessary procedural obstacles that may discourage the mentally ill or their families from seeking needed psychiatric assistance, and in allocating priority to the diagnosis and treatment of patients as soon as they are admitted to a hospital, rather than to time-consuming pre-admission procedures.  Pp.  442 U. S. 604-606.
(d) The risk of error inherent in the parental decision to have a child institutionalized for mental health care is sufficiently great that some kind of inquiry should be made by a ""neutral factfinder"" to determine whether the statutory requirements for admission are satisfied, see Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254,  397 U. S. 271; Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471,  408 U. S. 489, and to probe the child's background.  The decisionmaker must have the authority to refuse to admit any child who does not satisfy the medical standards for admission.  The need for continuing commitment must be reviewed periodically.  Pp.  442 U. S. 606-607.
(e) Due process does not require that the neutral factfinder be law-trained or a judicial or administrative officer; nor is it necessary that the admitting physician conduct a formal or quasi-formal adversary hearing or that the hearing be conducted by someone other than the admitting physician.  While the medical decisionmaking process may 
Page 442 U. S. 586
 not be error-free, nevertheless the independent medical decisionmaking process, which includes a thorough psychiatric investigation followed by additional periodic review of a child's condition, will identify children who should not be admitted; risks of error will not be significantly reduced by a more formal, judicial-type hearing.  Pp.  442 U. S. 607-613.
(f) Georgia's practices, as described in the record, comport with minimum due process requirements.  The state statute envisions a careful diagnostic medical inquiry to be conducted by the admitting physician at each regional hospital.  Georgia's procedures are not ""arbitrary"" in the sense that a single physician or other professional has the ""unbridled discretion"" to commit a child to a regional hospital.  While Georgia's general administrative and statutory scheme for the voluntary commitment of children is not unconstitutional, the District Court, on remand, may consider any individual claims that the initial admissions of particular children did not meet due process standards, and may also consider whether the various hospitals' procedures for periodic review of their patients' need for institutional care are sufficient to justify continuing  a voluntary commitment.  Pp.  442 U. S. 613-617.
(g) The differences between the situation where the child is a ward of the State of Georgia and the State requests his admission to a state mental hospital, and the situation where the child's natural parents request his admission, do not justify requiring different procedures at the time of the child's initial admission to the hospital.  Pp.  442 U. S. 617-620.

Syllabus 
Appellees filed a class action in Federal District Court against the Pennsylvania Secretary of Public Welfare and the directors of three state mental health facilities, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and contending that Pennsylvania's procedures for the voluntary admission of mentally ill and mentally retarded children to a state hospital violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Holding that the State's procedures were insufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause, and that only a formal adversary hearing could suffice to protect children in appellees' class from being needlessly confined in mental hospitals, the District Court concluded that specified procedures were required before any child could be admitted voluntarily to a mental hospital.
Held:
1. The risk of error inherent in the parental decision to have a child institutionalized for mental health care is sufficiently great that some kind of inquiry should be made by a ""neutral factfinder"" to determine whether the statutory requirements for admission are satisfied.  That inquiry must carefully probe the child's background and must also include an interview with the child.  It is also necessary that the decisionmaker have the authority to refuse to admit any child who does not satisfy the medical standards for admission.  Finally, the child's continuing need for commitment must be reviewed periodically.  Parham v. J.R., ante, p.  442 U. S. 584, controlling.  P.  442 U. S. 646.
2. Pennsylvania's procedures comply with these due process requirements.  No child is admitted without at least one and often more psychiatric examinations by an independent team of mental health professionals whose sole concern is whether the child needs and can benefit from institutional care.  The treatment team interviews the child and parents and compiles a full background history. If the treatment team concludes that institutional care is not in the child's best interest, it must refuse the child's admission; every child's condition is reviewed at least every 30 days.

No. 78-160
Argued March 21, 1979
Decided June 20, 1979*
442 U.S. 653

Syllabus 
Pursuant to an 1854 treaty, the reservation of the Omaha Indian Tribe (Tribe) was established in the Territory of Nebraska on the west bank of the Missouri River, with the eastern boundary being fixed as the center of the river's main channel.  In 1867, a General Land Office survey established that certain land was included in the reservation, but since then, the river has changed course several times, leaving most of the survey area on the Iowa side of the river, separated from the rest of the reservation.  Residents of Iowa ultimately settled on and improved this land, and these non-Indian owners and their successors in title occupied the land for many years prior to April 2, 1975, when they were dispossessed by the Tribe, with the assistance of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Three federal actions, consolidated in District Court, were instituted by respondents, the Tribe and the United States as trustee of the reservation lands, against petitioners, including the State of Iowa and several individuals.  Both sides sought to quiet title in their names, respondents arguing that the river's movement had been avulsive, and thus did not affect the reservation's boundary, whereas petitioners argued that the disputed land had been formed by gradual accretion and belonged to the Iowa riparian owners.  The District Court held that state, rather than federal, law should be the basis of decision; that 25 U.S.C.  19 -- which provides that,
""[i]n all trials about the right of property in which an Indian may be a party on one side, and a white person on the other, the burden of proof shall rest upon the white person, whenever the Indian shall make out a presumption of title in himself from the fact of previous possession or ownership""
-- was not applicable, because the Tribe could not make out a prima facie case that it possessed the disputed land in the past without proving its case on the merits; and that, under Nebraska law, the changes in the river had been accretive, and thus the petitioners were the owners of the disputed area.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that federal, rather than state, law was applicable; that the Tribe had made a sufficient showing to invoke 
Page 442 U. S. 654
  194; and that, applying the federal common law of accretion and avulsion to the evidence, the evidence was in equipoise, and thus, under  194, judgment must be entered for the Tribe.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals was partially correct in ruling that  194 is applicable here; by its terms,  194 applies to the private petitioners, but not to petitioner State of Iowa.  In view of the history of  194 and its purpose of protecting Indians from claims made by non-Indian squatters on their lands, it applies even when an Indian tribe is the litigant, rather than one or more individual Indians.  But, while Congress was aware that  194 would be interpreted to cover artificial entities, such as corporations, as well as individuals, there is nothing to indicate that Congress intended the word ""white person"" to include any of the States of the Union.  Here, there seems to be no question that the disputed land was once riparian land lying on the west bank of the Missouri River, and was long occupied by the Tribe as part of the reservation set apart for it in consequence of the 1854 treaty, and this was enough to bring  194 into play.  In view of the purpose of the statute and its use of the term ""presumption"" which the ""white man"" must overcome,  194 contemplates the non-Indian's shouldering the burden of persuasion as well as the burden of producing evidence once the tribe has made out its prima facie case of prior title or possession.  Pp.  442 U. S. 664-669.
2. The Court of Appeals properly concluded that federal law governs the substantive aspects of the dispute, but it erred in arriving at a federal standard, independent of state law, to determine whether there had been an avulsion or an accretion.  Pp.  442 U. S. 669-679.
(a) The general rule that, absent an overriding federal interest, the laws of the several States determine the ownership of the banks and shores of waterways, Oregon e rel. State Land Board v. Corvallis Sand & Gravel Co., 429 U. S. 363, does not oust federal law in this litigation.  Here, the United States has never yielded title or terminated its interest in the property, and, in these circumstances, the Indians' right to the property depends on federal law, ""wholly apart from the application of state law principles which normally and separately protect a valid right of possession.""  Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661,  414 U. S. 677.  Pp. 669-671.
(b) However, state law should be borrowed as the federal rule of decision here.  There is no imperative need to develop a general body of federal common law to decide cases such as this, where an interstate boundary is not in dispute (the location of the boundary between Iowa and Nebraska having been settled by Compact in 1943).  Furthermore, 
Page 442 U. S. 655
 given equitable application of state law, there is little likelihood of injury to federal trust responsibilities or to tribal possessory interests.  And this is also an area in which the States have substantial interest in having their own law resolve controversies such as these; there is considerable merit in not having the reasonable expectations, under state real property law, of private landowners upset by the vagaries of being located adjacent to or across from Indian reservations or other property in which the United States has a substantial interest.

(c) Under the construction of the 1943 Compact in Nebraska v. Iowa, 406 U. S. 117, Nebraska law should be applied in determining whether the changes in the river that moved the disputed land from Nebraska to Iowa were avulsive or accretive.  Pp.  442 U. S. 676-678.

442 U.S. 682

Syllabus 
Section 204(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (Act) authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to recoup erroneous overpayments made to a beneficiary under the old-age, survivors', or disability insurance programs by decreasing future payments to which the overpaid person is entitled.  However,  204(b) commands that
""there shall be no adjustment of payments to, or recovery by the United States from, any person who is without fault if such adjustment would defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity and good conscience.""
Under the Secretary's practice, after an ex parte determination is made under  204(a) that an overpayment has been made, and after the recipient is notified of that determination, the recipient may file a written request seeking reconsideration of the determination or asking the Secretary to waive recovery in accordance with  204(b).  If, upon review of the papers, the decision goes against the recipient, recoupment begins, and the recipient is given an opportunity for an oral hearing only if he thereafter continues to object to recoupment.  The recipient may seek subsequent administrative review, and finally may seek review by a federal court under  205(g) of the Act, which provides that any person, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, may obtain review of the decision by instituting a civil action.  Respondents, who had unsuccessfully sought administrative relief from recoupment determinations, instituted federal actions, alleging that, because they had not been given adequate notice and an opportunity for an oral hearing before recoupment began, the recoupment procedures violated both  204 and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  In each action, class certification was sought, and, in one action, it was requested that the class be nationwide.  The respective District Courts granted class certification, held that the Secretary's recoupment procedures were unconstitutional, and ordered injunctive relief.  The Court of Appeals consolidated the cases on appeal and upheld the certification of the classes.  On the merits, the court, without directly addressing respondents' statutory claims, held, inter alia, that, when waiver of recoupment 
Page 442 U. S. 683
 was requested pursuant to  204(b), the Due Process Clause required that the recipient be given an oral hearing before recoupment began, but that a prior hearing was not required in  204(a) reconsideration cases if the dispute centered on a computational error or a payment problem not demanding an evaluation of credibility.
Held:
1. Recipients who file a written request for waiver under  204(b) are entitled to the opportunity for a pre-recoupment oral hearing, but those who merely request reconsideration under  204(a) are not so entitled.  Pp.  442 U. S. 692-697.
(a) On its face,  204 requires that the Secretary make a pre-recoupment waiver decision, and that the decision, like that concerning the fact of the overpayment, be accurate.  Pp.  442 U. S. 693-695.
(b) Neither  204 nor the standards of the Due Process Clause require pre-recoupment oral hearings as to requests under  204(a) for reconsideration as to whether overpayment occurred.  The rare instance in which a credibility dispute is relevant to a  204(a) claim is not sufficient to require the Secretary to grant a hearing to the few requests that involve credibility.  However, with respect to  204(b) waiver of the Secretary's right to recoup, the nature of the statutory standards involving determinations of ""fault"" and whether recoupment would be ""against equity and good conscience"" makes a pre-recoupment oral hearing essential when a recipient requests waiver.  Pp.  442 U. S. 695-697.
2. Nothing in  205(g) prohibits the pre-recoupment hearing relief awarded in this case.  Pp.  442 U. S. 697-706.
(a) Where a district court has jurisdiction over the claims of the members of the class in accordance with the requirements set out in  205(g), it also has discretion under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23 to certify a class action for the litigation of those claims.  Pp.  442 U. S. 698-701.
(b) There was no abuse of discretion in certifying a nationwide class.  Pp.  442 U. S. 701-703.
(c) While the classes certified here exceed the bounds permitted by  205(g)'s ""final decision"" requirement because they include persons who have not filed requests for reconsideration or waiver in the past and will not do so in the future, nevertheless there is no basis for altering the relief actually granted, as it did not include those who do not meet such requirement.  Pp.  442 U. S. 703-704.
(d) Injunctive relief may be awarded in a  205(g) proceeding, nothing in either the language or the legislative history of the statute indicating that Congress intended to preclude injunctive relief.  Pp.  442 U. S. 704-706.

442 U.S. 707

Syllabus 
Respondent, at the time 16 1/2 years old, was taken into custody by Van Nuys, Cal., police on suspicion of murder.  Before being questioned at the station house, he was fully advised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  At the outset of the questioning, respondent, who was on probation to the Juvenile Court, had served a term in a youth corrections camp, and had a record of prior offenses, asked to see his probation officer.  But when the police denied this request, respondent stated he would talk without consulting an attorney, and he then proceeded to make statements and draw sketches implicating him in the murder.  Upon being charged in Juvenile Court with the murder, he moved to suppress the incriminating statements and sketches on the ground that they had been obtained in violation of Miranda in that his request to see his probation officer constituted an invocation of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, just as if he had requested the assistance of an attorney.  The court denied the motion, holding that the facts showed that respondent had waived his right to remain silent, notwithstanding his request to see his probation officer.  The California Supreme Court reversed, holding that respondent's request for his probation officer was a per se invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights in the same way the request for an attorney was found in Miranda to be, regardless of what the interrogation otherwise might reveal.  This holding was based on the court's view that a probation officer occupies a position as a trusted guardian figure in a juvenile's life that would make it normal for the juvenile to turn to the officer when apprehended by the police, and was also based on the state law requirement that the officer represent the juvenile's interests.
Held:
1. The California Supreme Court erred in finding that respondent's request for his probation officer was a per se invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights under Miranda, and therefore also erred in holding that, because the police did not cease interrogating respondent the statements and sketches made during the interrogation should have been suppressed.  Pp.  442 U. S. 716-724. 
Page 442 U. S. 708

(a) The rule in Miranda that, if an accused indicates in any manner that he wishes to remain silent or to consult an attorney, interrogation must cease, was based on the unique role the lawyer plays in the adversary system of criminal justice.  A probation officer is not in a position to offer the type of legal assistance necessary to protect the Fifth Amendment rights of an accused undergoing custodial interrogation that a lawyer can offer.  Pp.  442 U. S. 719-722.
(b) The fact that a relationship of trust and cooperation might exist between a probation officer and a juvenile does not indicate that the officer is capable of rendering effective legal advice sufficient to protect the juvenile's rights during police interrogation, or of providing the other services rendered by a lawyer.  Similarly, the fact that the probation officer has a statutory duty to protect the juvenile's interests does not make the officer any more capable of rendering legal assistance to the juvenile or of protecting his legal rights, especially where the officer also has a statutory duty to report wrongdoing by the juvenile and serve the ends of the juvenile court system.  Pp.  442 U. S. 722-723.
(c) A juvenile's request to speak with his probation officer does not constitute a per se request to remain silent, nor is it tantamount to a request for an attorney.  Pp.  442 U. S. 723-724.
2. Whether the incriminating statements and sketches were admissible on the basis of waiver was a question to be resolved on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.  On the basis of the record, it is clear that respondent voluntarily and knowingly waived his Fifth Amendment rights and consented to continued interrogation, and that the statements and sketches obtained from him were voluntary, and hence their admission in the Juvenile Court proceeding was correct.  Pp.  442 U. S. 724-727.

(a) The rule in Miranda that, if an accused indicates in any manner that he wishes to remain silent or to consult an attorney, interrogation must cease, was based on the unique role the lawyer plays in the adversary system of criminal justice.  A probation officer is not in a position to offer the type of legal assistance necessary to protect the Fifth Amendment rights of an accused undergoing custodial interrogation that a lawyer can offer.  Pp.  442 U. S. 719-722.
(b) The fact that a relationship of trust and cooperation might exist between a probation officer and a juvenile does not indicate that the officer is capable of rendering effective legal advice sufficient to protect the juvenile's rights during police interrogation, or of providing the other services rendered by a lawyer.  Similarly, the fact that the probation officer has a statutory duty to protect the juvenile's interests does not make the officer any more capable of rendering legal assistance to the juvenile or of protecting his legal rights, especially where the officer also has a statutory duty to report wrongdoing by the juvenile and serve the ends of the juvenile court system.  Pp.  442 U. S. 722-723.
(c) A juvenile's request to speak with his probation officer does not constitute a per se request to remain silent, nor is it tantamount to a request for an attorney.  Pp.  442 U. S. 723-724.
2. Whether the incriminating statements and sketches were admissible on the basis of waiver was a question to be resolved on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.  On the basis of the record, it is clear that respondent voluntarily and knowingly waived his Fifth Amendment rights and consented to continued interrogation, and that the statements and sketches obtained from him were voluntary, and hence their admission in the Juvenile Court proceeding was correct.  Pp.  442 U. S. 724-727.

442 U.S. 735

Syllabus 
The telephone company, at police request, installed at its central offices a pen register to record the numbers dialed from the telephone at petitioner's home.  Prior to his robbery trial, petitioner moved to suppress ""all fruits derived from"" the pen register.  The Maryland trial court denied this motion, holding that the warrantless installation of the pen register did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Petitioner was convicted, and the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The installation and use of the pen register was not a ""search"" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and hence no warrant was required.  Pp.  442 U. S. 739-746.
(a) Application of the Fourth Amendment depends on whether the person invoking its protection can claim a ""legitimate expectation of privacy"" that has been invaded by government action.  This inquiry normally embraces two questions:  first, whether the individual has exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy; and second, whether his expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as ""reasonable.""  Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347.  Pp.  442 U. S. 739-741.
(b) Petitioner in all probability entertained no actual expectation of privacy in the phone numbers he dialed, and even if he did, his expectation was not ""legitimate.""  First, it is doubtful that telephone users in general have any expectation of privacy regarding the numbers they dial, since they typically know that they must convey phone numbers to the telephone company and that the company has facilities for recording this information and does, in fact, record it for various legitimate business purposes.  And petitioner did not demonstrate an expectation of privacy merely by using his home phone, rather than some other phone, since his conduct, although perhaps calculated to keep the contents of his conversation private, was not calculated to preserve the privacy of the number he dialed.  Second, even if petitioner did harbor some subjective expectation of privacy, this expectation was not one that society is prepared to recognize as ""reasonable.""  When petitioner voluntarily conveyed numerical information to the phone company and ""exposed"" that information to its equipment in the normal course of business, he assumed the risk that the company would reveal the information

Syllabus 
Acting on an informant's information that respondent, upon arriving at an airport, would be carrying a green suitcase containing marihuana, Little Rock, Ark., police officers placed the airport under surveillance.  They watched as respondent retrieved a green suitcase from the airline baggage service, placed it into the trunk of a taxi, and entered the vehicle with a companion.  When the taxi drove away, two of the officers gave pursuit and stopped the vehicle several blocks from the airport, requesting the taxi driver to open the vehicle's trunk.  Without asking the permission of respondent or his companion, the police opened the unlocked suitcase and discovered marihuana.  Before trial in state court on a charge of possession of marihuana with intent to deliver, respondent moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the suitcase, contending that the search violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The trial court denied the motion, and respondent was convicted.  The Arkansas Supreme Court reversed, ruling that the marihuana should have been suppressed because it was obtained through an unlawful search of the suitcase.
Held:  In the absence of exigent circumstances, police are required to obtain a warrant before searching luggage taken from an automobile properly stopped and searched for contraband.  Cf. United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1.  Pp.  442 U. S. 757-766.
(a) In the ordinary case, a search of private property must be both reasonable and pursuant to a properly issued search warrant.  The mere reasonableness of a search, assessed in the light of the surrounding circumstances, is not a substitute for the judicial warrant required under the Fourth Amendment.  P.  442 U. S. 758.
(b) The ""automobile exception"" from the warrant requirement, as set forth in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, and its progeny, will not be extended to the warrantless search of one's personal luggage merely because it was located in an automobile lawfully stopped by the police.  Luggage is a common repository for one's personal effects, and therefore is inevitably associated with the expectation of privacy.  Once police have seized a suitcase from an automobile, the extent of its mobility is in no way affected by the place from which it was taken; accordingly, as a general rule, there is no greater need for warrantless searches of luggage taken from automobiles than of luggage taken from

 other places.  Similarly, a suitcase taken from an automobile stopped on the highway is not necessarily attended by any lesser expectation of privacy than is associated with luggage taken from other locations.  Where -- as in the present case -- the police, without endangering themselves or risking loss of the evidence, lawfully have detained one suspected of criminal activity and secured his suitcase, they should delay the search thereof until after judicial approval has been obtained.

Argued April 23, 1979
Decided June 20, 1979
442 U.S. 773

Syllabus 
Intervenor labor union filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board with respect to respondent hospital's rule prohibiting solicitation by its employees at all times ""in any area of the Hospital which is accessible to or utilized by the public,"" including the lobbies, gift shop, cafeteria, and entrances on the first floor, as well as corridors, sitting rooms, and public restrooms on the other floors.  In justification of the rule, respondent offered extensive evidence, through the testimony of doctors and hospital officials, as to the need for the rule to prevent interference with patients' treatment and convalescence, especially as applicable in the corridors and sitting rooms adjoining or accessible to the patients' rooms on the upper floors of the hospital.  After applying its presumption that the no-solicitation rule was invalid except in ""immediate patient care areas,"" the NLRB concluded that respondent had failed to meet the burden placed upon it by such presumption, found that there was no demonstrated likelihood that solicitation outside of ""immediate patient care areas"" would disrupt patient care or disturb patients, and, accordingly, issued an order prohibiting respondent from applying the no-solicitation rule in any area of the hospital other than ""immediate patient care areas.""  The Court of Appeals denied enforcement of the order, holding that respondent had presented sufficient evidence of the ill effects of solicitation on patient care to justify the broad prohibition of solicitation.
Held:
1. Given the definition of ""immediate patient care areas"" as areas ""such as patients' rooms, operating rooms, and places where patients receive treatment,"" the NLRB's order prevents respondent from applying its no-solicitation rule not only to its lobbies, cafeteria, and gift shop but also to the corridors and sitting rooms that adjoin or are accessible to patients' rooms and operating and treatment rooms.  Pp.  442 U. S. 778-781.
2. The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the NLRB lacked substantial evidence in the record to support its order forbidding any prohibition of solicitation in the corridors and sitting rooms on floors of 
Page 442 U. S. 774
 the hospital having either patients' rooms or operating and therapy rooms.  Nothing in the evidence provided any basis, with respect to those areas, for doubting the accuracy of the doctors' testimony for respondent that union solicitation in the presence or within the hearing of patients may have adverse effects on their recovery.  Pp.  442 U. S. 784-786.
3. There was, however, substantial evidence in the record to support t.he NLRB's conclusion that respondent had not justified the prohibition of union solicitation in the cafeteria, gift shop, and lobbies on the first floor of the hospital.  While there was no evidence directly contradicting the expert testimony offered by respondent as to the importance of a tranquil hospital atmosphere to successful patient care, nevertheless, when viewed as a whole, the evidence presented by respondent may be regarded fairly as insufficient to rebut the NLRB's presumption that the needs of essential patient care do not require the banning of all solicitation in such areas.  Pp.  442 U. S. 786-787.
4. This Court does not agree with the apparent view of the Court of Appeals that the NLRB's presumption is irrational in all respects, since experience in such cases as Beth Israel Hospital v. NLRB, 437 U. S. 483, and the present one makes clear that solicitation in at least some of the public areas of hospitals often will not adversely affect patient care or disturb patients.  But the evidence in this case and other similar cases does cast serious doubt on a presumption as to hospitals so sweeping that it embraces solicitation in the corridors and sitting rooms on floors occupied by patients.

Decided June 18, 1979
442 U.S. 465

Syllabus 
When appellant arrived at the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, police officers, without a warrant or probable cause to suspect that appellant was carrying contraband, searched his baggage pursuant to a Puerto Rico statute authorizing the police to search the luggage of any person arriving in Puerto Rico from the United States.  The search revealed marihuana, and appellant was subsequently charged with and convicted of a drug violation under Puerto Rico law.  On appeal, he contended that the search violated the federal constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches; the Puerto Rico Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.
Held:
1. The constitutional requirements of the Fourth Amendment apply to Puerto Rico.  Both Congress' implicit determinations that the Amendment practically and beneficially may be implemented in Puerto Rico and long experience establish that the Amendment's restrictions on searches and seizures may be applied to Puerto Rico without danger to national interests or risk of unfairness.  From 1917 to 1952, Congress by statute afforded equivalent personal rights to Puerto Rico residents, and the Puerto Rico Constitution, which was adopted pursuant to Congress' authority and approved by Congress in 1952, contains the Fourth Amendment's language as well as language reflecting this Court's exegesis of the Amendment.  Pp.  442 U. S. 468-471.
2. The search of appellant's baggage pursuant to statute did not satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment that there be probable cause to believe that incriminating evidence will be found and that there be a warrant unless exigent circumstances make compliance with this requirement impossible.  P.  442 U. S. 471.
3. The requirements of a warrant and probable cause are not subject to any exception that applies generally to persons arriving in Puerto Rico from the United States.  The statute in question cannot be justified by any analogy to customs searches at a functional equivalent of the international border of the United States; Puerto Rico has no sovereign authority to control entry into its territory. Nor can the statute be sustained by analogy to state inspection provisions designed to implement health and safety legislation, the statute having been construed by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court as one enacted for the purpose of 
Page 442 U. S. 466
 enforcing criminal laws; moreover, health and safety inspections are generally subject to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.  Pp.  442 U. S. 472-474.

Syllabus 
During an investigation by several federal grand juries of reported political corruption, including allegations that aliens had paid money for the introduction of private bills in Congress to suspend the application of the immigration laws to allow the aliens to remain in the United States, respondent, then a Member of the House of Representatives, appeared voluntarily before the grand juries on 10 occasions.  He testified as to his practices in introducing private immigration bills, voluntarily produced his files on numerous private bills, and provided copies of many such bills introduced on behalf of various aliens.  Initially, respondent made no claim of privilege under the Fifth Amendment, but eventually invoked that privilege, as well as alluding to his privilege under the Speech or Debate Clause.  Subsequently, respondent was indicted on charges of accepting money in return for being influenced in the performance of official acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  201.  He moved in District Court to dismiss the indictment on the ground, inter alia, that it violated the Speech or Debate Clause.  The District Court denied the motion, holding that the Clause did not require dismissal, but that the Government was precluded from introducing evidence of past legislative acts in any form.  The Court of Appeals affirmed this evidentiary ruling, holding, contrary to the Government's arguments, that legislative acts could not be introduced to show motive, since otherwise the protection of the Speech or Debate Clause would be negated, and that respondent had not waived the protection of that Clause by testifying before the grand juries.
Held: Under the Speech or Debate Clause, evidence of a legislative act of a Member of Congress may not be introduced by the Government in a prosecution under 18 U.S.C.  201.  United States v. Brewster, 408 U. S. 501; United States v. Johnson, 383 U. S. 169.  Pp.  442 U. S. 487-494.
(a) While the exclusion of evidence of past legislative acts undoubtedly will make prosecutions more difficult, nevertheless, the Speech or Debate Clause was designed to preclude prosecution of Members for legislative acts.  References to legislative acts of a Member cannot be admitted without undermining the values protected by that Clause.  Pp.  442 U. S. 488-489. 
Page 442 U. S. 478

(b) As to what restrictions the Clause places on the admission of evidence, the concern is with whether there is evidence of a legislative act; the protection of the Clause extends only to an act that has already been performed.  A promise to deliver a speech, to vote, or to solicit other votes is not ""speech or debate"" within the meaning of the Clause, nor is a promise to introduce a bill at some future date a legislative act.  Pp.  442 U. S. 489-490.
(c) Respondent did not waive the protection of the Clause by testifying before the grand juries and voluntarily producing documentary evidence of legislative acts.  Assuming, without deciding, that a Member of Congress may waive the Clause's protection against being prosecuted for a legislative act, such waiver could be found only after explicit and unequivocal renunciation of the protection.  On this record, respondent's words and conduct did not constitute such a waiver; his exchanges with the attorneys for the United States indicated, at most, a willingness to waive the protection of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  442 U. S. 490-492.
(d) Nor does 18 U.S.C.  201 amount to a congressional waiver of the protection of the Speech or Debate Clause.  Assuming, arguendo, that Congress could constitutionally waive the protection of the Clause for individual Members, such waiver could be shown only by an explicit and unequivocal legislative expression, and there is no evidence of such a waiver.

Syllabus 
During an investigation by several federal grand juries of reported political corruption, including allegations that aliens had paid money for the introduction of private bills in Congress to suspend the application of the immigration laws to allow the aliens to remain in the United States, respondent, then a Member of the House of Representatives, appeared voluntarily before the grand juries on 10 occasions.  He testified as to his practices in introducing private immigration bills, voluntarily produced his files on numerous private bills, and provided copies of many such bills introduced on behalf of various aliens.  Initially, respondent made no claim of privilege under the Fifth Amendment, but eventually invoked that privilege, as well as alluding to his privilege under the Speech or Debate Clause.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, then a Member of Congress, was indicted in 1976 for conspiring to solicit and accept, and for soliciting and accepting, bribes in return for being influenced in the performance of official acts, namely, the introduction of certain private bills in the House of Representatives.  He moved in District Court to dismiss the indictment on the ground, inter alia, that the indictment violated the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution because the grand jury had heard evidence of legislative acts, but the motion was denied.  Thereafter, he petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to dismiss the indictment.  The court declined to issue the writ, holding that the indictment did not violate the Speech or Debate Clause.
Held:  Mandamus was not the appropriate means of challenging the validity of the indictment on the ground that it violated the Speech or Debate Clause.  Direct appeal to the Court of Appeals was available, and was the proper course.  Pp.  442 U. S. 505-508.
(a) Once the motion to dismiss the indictment was denied, there was nothing further petitioner could do under the Speech or Debate Clause in the trial court to prevent the trial, and an appeal of the ruling was clearly available.  Cf. Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651.  Pp.  442 U. S. 506-507.
(b) The Speech or Debate Clause was designed to protect Congressmen ""not only from the consequences of litigation's results, but also from the burden of defending themselves.""  Dombrowski v. Eastland, 387 U. S. 82,  387 U. S. 85.  Pp.  442 U. S. 507-508.
(c) If a Member of Congress

442 U.S. 510

Syllabus 
Based upon a confession and other evidence, petitioner was charged under a Montana statute with ""deliberate homicide,"" in that he ""purposely or knowingly"" caused the victim's death.  At trial, petitioner argued that, although he killed the victim, he did not do so ""purposely or knowingly,"" and therefore was not guilty of deliberate homicide.  The trial court instructed the jury that ""[t]he law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts,"" over petitioner's objection that such instruction had the effect of shifting the burden of proof on the issue of purpose or knowledge.  The jury found petitioner guilty, and the Montana Supreme Court affirmed, holding that although shifting the burden of proof to the defendant by means of a presumption is prohibited, allocation of ""some burden of proof"" to a defendant is permissible.  Finding that under the instruction in question petitioner's sole burden was to produce ""some"" evidence that he did not intend the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts, and not to disprove that he acted ""purposely or knowingly,"" the Montana court held that the instruction did not violate due process standards.
Held:  Because the jury may have interpreted the challenged presumption as conclusive, like the presumptions in Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, and United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, or as shifting the burden of persuasion, like that in Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, and because either interpretation would have violated the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement that the State prove every element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt, the instruction is unconstitutional.  Pp.  442 U. S. 514-527.
(a) The effect of a presumption in a jury instruction is determined by the way in which a reasonable juror could have interpreted it, not by a state court's interpretation of its legal import.  Pp.  442 U. S. 514,  442 U. S. 517.
(b) Conclusive presumptions
""conflict with the overriding presumption of innocence with which t,he law endows the accused and which extends to every element of the crime,""
Morissette, supra at  342 U. S. 275, and they ""invad[e the] factfinding function,"" United States Gypsum Co. supra at  438 U. S. 446, which, in a criminal case, the law assigns to the jury.  The presumption announced to petitioner's jury may well have had exactly 
Page 442 U. S. 511
 these consequences, since upon finding proof of one element of the crime (causing death), and of facts insufficient to establish the second (the voluntariness and ""ordinary consequences"" of petitioner's action), the jury could have reasonably concluded that it was directed to find against petitioner on the element of intent.  The State was thus not forced to prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt . . . every fact necessary to constitute the crime . . . charged,"" In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358,  397 U. S. 364, and petitioner was deprived of his constitutional rights.  Pp.  442 U. S. 521-523.
(c) A presumption which, although not conclusive, had the effect of shifting the burden of persuasion to petitioner, would have suffered from similar infirmities.  If the jury interpreted the presumption in this manner, it could have concluded that, upon proof by the State of the slaying, and of additional facts not themselves establishing the element of intent, the burden was then shifted to petitioner to prove that he lacked the requisite mental state.  Such a presumption was found constitutionally deficient in Mullaney, supra.  P.  442 U. S. 524.
(d) Without merit is the State's argument that, since the jury could have interpreted the word ""intends"" in the instruction as referring only to petitioner's ""purpose,"" and could have convicted petitioner solely for his ""knowledge"" without considering ""purpose,"" it might not have relied upon the tainted presumption at all.  First, it is not clear that a jury would have so interpreted ""intends.""  More significantly, even if a jury could have ignored the presumption, it cannot be certain that this is what it did do, as its verdict was a general one.  Pp.  442 U. S. 525-526.
(e) Since whether the jury's reliance upon the instruction constituted, or could have ever constituted, harmless error are issues that were not considered by the Montana Supreme Court, this Court will not reach them as an initial matter.  Pp.  442 U. S. 526-527.

|442 u.s. 529|"United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. McCombs
No. 78-17
Argued February 22, 1979
Decided June 18, 1979*
442 U.S. 529

Syllabus 
In 1954, the Federal Power Commission, now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the sale to petitioner United Gas Pipe Line Co. (United) of natural gas produced from a leased tract of land.  After the lease had been assigned several times and a replacement certificate issued, the lessee-producer notified United in 1966 that the existing wells were depleted and that no other gas was available at that time.  Despite a warning from the Commission, the lessee never sought the Commission's authorization, pursuant to  7(b) of the Natural Gas Act (Act), for abandoning the service in interstate commerce.  The lease was subsequently assigned to a group headed by respondent McCombs, which group discovered new gas reserves underlying the tract and contracted to sell the gas to respondent E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. for uses in intrastate commerce.  Upon learning of the renewed production, United asserted its contractual right to purchase the newly discovered gas and filed a complaint with the Commission.  The Commission upheld the Administrative Law Judge's determination that the McCombs group could not divert the gas from the interstate market, because the gas had been dedicated to interstate commerce and the agency had never authorized an abandonment of service.  In addition, the Commission refused to grant its approval retroactively, since the supply of gas was not, in fact, depleted.  Accordingly, the Commission ordered delivery to United of all gas derived from the tract.  The Court of Appeals set aside the Commission's order, holding that ""strict compliance"" with  7(b)'s approval requirement was unnecessary in this case, the abandonment having been accomplished
""as a matter of law, when all of the parties recognized that the then known natural gas reserves were depleted in 1966 followed by failure to provide any service . . . for a period of five years.""
Held:
1. Section 7(b) requires producers to continue supplying in interstate 
Page 442 U. S. 530
 commerce all gas produced from a dedicated leasehold until they obtain permission for abandonment from the Commission.  Pp.  442 U. S. 535-539.
(a) Congress could not have been more explicit in establishing Commission approval as a prerequisite for lawful abandonment of service within its jurisdiction.  The statutory language simply does not admit of any exception to the procedure set forth in  7(b), as this Court's previous decisions have recognized.  Pp.  442 U. S. 535-538.
(b) The Commission's control over the continuation of service is a fundamental component of the regulatory scheme, and to deprive the Commission of this authority, even in limited circumstances, would conflict with basic policies underlying the Act.  Requiring Commission approval of abandonment, ""after due hearing,"" permits all interested parties to be heard, and therefore facilitates full presentation of the facts necessary to determine whether  7(b)'s criteria have been met.  Moreover, the obligation to obtain Commission approval promotes certainty and reliability in the regulatory scheme.  Pp.  442 U. S. 538-539.
2. It need not be determined whether  7(b) allows the Commission to approve an abandonment retroactively and disregard evidence of subsequent production, since the Commission did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so here.  Given the potential for retroactive approvals to disrupt the regulatory scheme, it was within the Commission's discretion to reject allegations of good faith in failing to seek Commission approval as a sufficient justification, by itself, for determining whether the evidence available in 1966 warranted granting an abandonment.  Pp.  442 U. S. 539-541.
3. Respondents' contention that the current production of gas is not subject to  7(b)'s requirements is without merit.  The Commission properly found that the certificates of public convenience and necessity cover all reservoirs located on the tract.  And initiation of interstate service pursuant to the certificates dedicated all fields subject to the certificates.  California v. Southland Royalty Co., 436 U. S. 519,  436 U. S. 525.  Once so dedicated, there can be no withdrawal of that supply from the interstate market absent Commission approval.  Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Co. v. FPC, 364 U. S. 137,  364 U. S. 156.  Pp.  442 U. S. 541-543.

In addition, the Commission refused to grant its approval retroactively, since the supply of gas was not, in fact, depleted.  Accordingly, the Commission ordered delivery to United of all gas derived from the tract.  The Court of Appeals set aside the Commission's order, holding that ""strict compliance"" with  7(b)'s approval requirement was unnecessary in this case, the abandonment having been accomplished
""as a matter of law, when all of the parties recognized that the then known natural gas reserves were depleted in 1966 followed by failure to provide any service . . . for a period of five years.""
Held:
1. Section 7(b) requires producers to continue supplying in interstate 
Page 442 U. S. 530
 commerce all gas produced from a dedicated leasehold until they obtain permission for abandonment from the Commission.  Pp.  442 U. S. 535-539.
(a) Congress could not have been more explicit in establishing Commission approval as a prerequisite for lawful abandonment of service within its jurisdiction.  The statutory language simply does not admit of any exception to the procedure set forth in  7(b), as this Court's previous decisions have recognized.  Pp.  442 U. S. 535-538.
(b) The Commission's control over the continuation of service is a fundamental component of the regulatory scheme, and to deprive the Commission of this authority, even in limited circumstances, would conflict with basic policies underlying the Act.  Requiring Commission approval of abandonment, ""after due hearing,"" permits all interested parties to be heard, and therefore facilitates full presentation of the facts necessary to determine whether  7(b)'s criteria have been met.  Moreover, the obligation to obtain Commission approval promotes certainty and reliability in the regulatory scheme.  Pp.  442 U. S. 538-539.
2. It need not be determined whether  7(b) allows the Commission to approve an abandonment retroactively and disregard evidence of subsequent production, since the Commission did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so here.  Given the potential for retroactive approvals to disrupt the regulatory scheme, it was within the Commission's discretion to reject allegations of good faith in failing to seek Commission approval as a sufficient justification, by itself, for determining whether the evidence available in 1966 warranted granting an abandonment.  Pp.  442 U. S. 539-541.
3. Respondents' contention that the current production of gas is not subject to  7(b)'s requirements is without merit.  The Commission properly found that the certificates of public convenience and necessity cover all reservoirs located on the tract.  And initiation of interstate service pursuant to the certificates dedicated all fields subject to the certificates.  California v. Southland Royalty Co., 436 U. S. 519,  436 U. S. 525.  Once so dedicated, there can be no withdrawal of that supply from the interstate market absent Commission approval.  Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Co. v. FPC, 364 U. S. 137,  364 U. S. 156.  Pp.  442 U. S. 541-543.

Syllabus 
Terminally ill cancer patients and their spouses brought this action to enjoin the Government from interfering with the interstate shipment and sale of Laetrile, a drug not approved for distribution under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act).  Section 505 of the Act prohibits interstate distribution of any ""new drug"" unless the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare approves an application supported by substantial evidence of the drug's safety and effectiveness.  Section 201(p)(1) of the Act defines a ""new drug"" to include
""any drug . . . not generally recognized . . . as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.""
Finding t.hat Laetrile, in proper dosages, was nontoxic and effective, the District Court ordered the Government to permit limited purchases of the drug by one of the named plaintiffs.  While not disturbing the injunction, the Court of Appeals instructed the District Court to remand the case to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for determination whether Laetrile was a ""new drug"" under  201(p)(1), and, if so, whether it was exempt from premarketing approval under either of the Act's two grandfather clauses.  After completion of administrative hearings, the Commissioner of the FDA found that Laetrile constituted a ""new drug"" as defined in  201(p)(1) and fell within neither grandfather provision.  On review of the Commissioner's decision, the District Court concluded that Laetrile was entitled to an exemption from premarketing approval under the Act's 1962 grandfather clause and, alternatively, that the Commissioner had infringed constitutionally protected privacy interests by denying cancer patients access to Laetrile.  The Court of Appeals, without addressing either the statutory or constitutional rulings of the District Court, held that the Act's ""safety"" and ""effectiveness"" standards have ""no reasonable application"" to terminally ill cancer patients, and approved intravenous injections of Laetrile for such individuals.
Held:  The Act makes no express exception for drugs used by the terminally ill, and no implied exemption is necessary to attain congressional objectives or to avert an unreasonable reading of the terms ""safe"" and ""effective"" in  201(p)(1).  Pp.  442 U. S. 551-559. 
Page 442 U. S. 545

(a) Nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended protection only for persons suffering from curable diseases.  Moreover, in implementing the statutory scheme, the FDA has never exempted drugs used by the terminally ill.  The construction of a statute by those charged with its administration is entitled to substantial deference, particularly where, as here, an agency's interpretation involves issues of considerable public controversy and Congress has not acted to correct any misperception of its statutory objectives.  Pp.  442 U. S. 552-554.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the safety and effectiveness standards of  201(p)(1) could have ""no reasonable application"" to terminal patients.  For purposes of  201(p)(1), the effectiveness of a drug does not necessarily denote capacity to cure; in the treatment of any illness, terminal or otherwise, a drug is effective if it fulfills, by objective indices, its sponsor's claims of prolonged life, improved physical condition, or reduced pain.  Nor is the concept of safety under  201(p)(1) without meaning for terminal patients; a drug is unsafe for the terminally ill, as for anyone else, if its potential for inflicting death or physical injury is not offset by the possibility of therapeutic benefit.  Finally, construing  201(p)(1) to encompass treatments for terminal diseases does not foreclose all resort to experimental cancer drugs by patients for whom conventional therapy is unavailing.  That  505(i) of the Act makes explicit provision for carefully regulated use of certain drugs not yet demonstrated to be safe and effective reinforces the conclusion that no exception for terminal patients may be judicially implied.  Pp.  442 U. S. 554-559.

No. 78-309
Argued March 26, 1979
Decided June 18, 1979
442 U.S. 560

Syllabus 
Petitioner accounting firm was retained by a securities brokerage firm (Weis) registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a member of the New York Stock Exchange (Exchange), and, in this capacity, audited Weis' books and records and prepared for filing with the SEC the annual reports of financial condition required by  17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act) and implementing regulations.  Subsequently, because of Weis' precarious financial condition, respondent Redington was appointed as trustee in the liquidation of Weis' business pursuant to the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA).  During the liquidation, Weis' cash and securities on hand, as well as a sum of money advanced by respondent Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) to the trustee under the SIPA, proved to be insufficient to make whole those customers who had left assets or deposits with Weis.  The SIPC and the trustee then filed an action for damages against petitioner in District Court, seeking to impose liability upon petitioner by reason of its allegedly improper audit of Weis' financial statements, and alleging that, because of such improper conduct, petitioner breached duties owed to the SIPC, the trustee, and others under the common law,  17(a), and the regulations, and that this misconduct prevented Weis' true financial condition from becoming known until it was too late to forestall liquidation or to lessen the adverse financial consequences to Weis' customers.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that no claim for relief was stated because no private cause of action could be implied from  17(a).  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  17(a) imposes a duty on accountants, that a breach of this duty gives rise to an implied private right of action for damages in favor of a broker-dealer's customers, and that the SIPC and the trustee could assert this implied cause of action on behalf of Weis' customers.
Held:  There is no implied private cause of action for damages under  17(a).  Pp.  442 U. S. 568-579.
(a) In terms,  17(a) simply requires broker-dealers to keep such records and file such reports as the SEC may prescribe, and does not purport to create a private cause of action in favor of anyone.  The 
Page 442 U. S. 561
 section's intent, evident from its face, is to provide the SEC, the Exchange, and other authorities with a sufficiently early warning to enable them to take appropriate action to protect investors before a broker-dealer's financial collapse, and not by any stretch of its language does the section purport to confer private damages rights or any remedy in the event the regulatory authorities are unsuccessful in achieving their objectives and the broker-dealer becomes insolvent before corrective steps can be taken.  Pp.  442 U. S. 568-571.
(b) The conclusion that no private right of action is implicit in  17(a) is reinforced by the fact that the 1934 Act's legislative history is entirely silent on whether or not such a right of action should be available.  This conclusion is also supported by the statutory scheme under which other sections of the Act explicitly grant private causes of action.  More particularly, a cause of action in  17(a) should not be implied that is significantly broader than the one granted in  18(a), which provides the principal express civil remedy for misstatements in reports, but limits it to purchasers and sellers of securities.  Pp.  442 U. S. 571-574.
(c) The inquiry in a case such as this ends when it is determined on the basis of the statutory language and the legislative history that Congress did not intend to create, either expressly or by implication, a private cause of action.  Further inquiries as to the ""necessity"" of implying a private remedy and the proper forum for enforcement of the asserted rights have little relevance to the decision of the case.  Pp.  442 U. S. 575-576.
(d) Section 27 and the remedial purposes of the 1934 Act do not furnish a sufficient ground for holding that the federal courts should provide a damages remedy for petitioner's alleged breach of its duties under  17(a).  Section 27 merely grants jurisdiction to federal district courts over violations of the Act and suits to enforce any liability or duty thereunder, and provides for venue and service of process.  It creates no cause of action of its own force and effect, and imposes no liabilities.  And generalized references to the ""remedial purposes"" of the Act do not justify reading a provision ""more broadly than its language and the statutory scheme reasonably permit.""  SEC v.

Syllabus 
A New York State Police investigator, after purchasing two films from petitioner's ""adult"" bookstore and after viewing them and concluding that they violated state obscenity laws, took the films to a Town Justice, who also viewed the films.  Based on the investigator's affidavit, the justice issued a warrant authorizing the search of the store and the seizure of other copies of the two films.  The investigator's affidavit also asserted that ""similar"" films and printed matter portraying similar activities could be found on the premises, and requested that the justice accompany the investigator in executing the warrant so that the justice might determine independently if any other items at the store were possessed in violation of law and subject to seizure.  The justice included in the warrant a recital that authorized the seizure of ""[t]he following items which the Court independently [on examination] has determined to be possessed in violation"" of law.  However, at the time the justice signed the warrant, no items were listed or described following this statement.  The justice also signed a warrant for the arrest of the store clerk for having sold the two films to the investigator.  Thereafter, the justice, the investigator, and nine other law enforcement officials entered the bookstore, arrested the clerk (the only employee present), and advised him of the search warrant; they conducted a search that lasted nearly six hours, covering various areas of the store, and examined and seized numerous films, projectors, and magazines.  The seized items were inventoried at a State Police barracks, and each item was then listed by the police on the search warrant.  Petitioner was charged with obscenity in the second degree.  The trial court denied petitioner's pretrial motion to suppress the evidence as having been searched for and seized in violation of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments; petitioner then entered a guilty plea.  As permitted by New York law, petitioner appealed the denial of the motion to suppress, and the convictions were affirmed.
Held:
1. The Fourth Amendment does not permit the action taken here, where, except for the specification of copies of the two films previously 
Page 442 U. S. 320
 purchased by the investigator, the warrant did not purport to particularly describe the things to be seized but, instead, left it entirely to the discretion of the officials conducting the search to decide what items were likely obscene and to accomplish their seizure.  The Fourth Amendment does not countenance open-ended warrants to be completed while a search is being conducted and items seized, or after the seizure has been carried out.  Pp.  442 U. S. 325-326.
2. The Town Justice's presence and participation in the search did not ensure that no items would be seized absent probable cause to believe that they were obscene; nor did his presence provide an immediate adversary hearing on the issue.  The justice conducted a generalized search, and was not acting as a neutral and detached judicial officer.  This procedure is not authorized by Heller v. New York, 413 U. S. 483.  Here, the Town Justice undertook to telescope the processes of the application for a warrant, the issuance of the warrant, and its execution.  Pp.  442 U. S. 326-328.
3. The actions involved here cannot be justified on the theory that, because the items at issue were displayed in areas of the store open to the general public, petitioner had no legitimate expectation of privacy against governmental intrusion and warrantless search.  Merely because a retail store invites the public to enter, it does not consent to wholesale searches and seizures that do not conform to Fourth Amendment guarantees.  The actions involved cannot be sustained on the ground that petitioner's clerk consented to the sweeping search.  After the clerk was under arrest and aware of the presumed authority of the search warrant, his conduct complying with official requests cannot, on this record, be considered voluntary.  Pp. 328-329.

Petitioner brought a class action on behalf of herself and all persons in the United States who purchased hearing aids manufactured by respondents, alleging that, because of antitrust violations committed by respondents, she and the class she seeks to represent have been forced to pay illegally fixed higher prices for the hearing aids and related services they purchased from respondents' retail dealers.  Treble damages were sought under  4 of the Clayton Act, which provides that ""[a]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws"" may bring suit and recover treble damages.  Respondents moved to dismiss the damages claim on the ground that petitioner had not been injured in her ""business or property"" within the meaning of  4.  The District Court held that, under  4, a retail purchaser is injured in ""property"" if it can be shown that antitrust violations caused an increase in the price paid for the article purchased; however, it certified the question to the Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that retail purchasers of consumer goods and services who allege no injury of a commercial or business nature are not injured in their ""business or property"" within the meaning of  4, and that the phrase ""business or property"" was intended to limit standing to those engaged in commercial ventures.
Held:  Consumers who pay a higher price for goods purchased for personal use as a result of antitrust violations sustain an injury in their ""property"" within the meaning of  4.  Pp.  442 U. S. 337-345.
(a) Statutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress.  The word ""property"" has a naturally broad and inclusive meaning comprehending, in common usage, anything of material value owned or possessed.  Congress' use of the disjunctive ""or"" in the phrase ""business or property"" indicates ""business"" was not intended to modify ""property,"" nor was ""property"" intended to modify ""business.""  Giving the word ""property"" the independent significance to which it is entitled in this context does not destroy the restrictive significance of the phrase ""business or property"" as a whole.

(c) Nor does petitioner's status as a ""consumer"" who purchased goods at retail for personal use change the nature of the injury she suffered or the intrinsic meaning of ""property"" in  4.  Pp.  442 U. S. 340-342.
(d) The legislative history reflects that the treble damages remedy was designed to protect consumers, and that no one questioned the right of consumers to sue under  4.

Contending that  102(2)(C) requires federal agencies to prepare EIS's to accompany appropriation requests, respondents, three organizations with interests in the preservation of the environment, brought suit in Federal District Court against petitioners, the Secretary of the Interior and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  Respondents alleged that proposed curtailments in the budget of the National Wildlife Refuge System would significantly affect the quality of the human environment, and hence should have been accompanied by an EIS prepared both by the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers the Refuge System, and by OMB.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents and ordered petitioners to prepare EIS's on annual proposals for financing the Refuge System.  The District Court's holding was modified by the Court of Appeals, which concluded that, while  102(2)(C) has no application to a routine appropriation request for continuance of an ongoing program, an EIS is required when an appropriation request accompanies a proposal for taking new action that significantly changes the status quo, or when the request ""ushers in a considered programmatic course following a programmatic review.""

No. 78-753
Argued April 18, 1979
Decided June 11, 1979
442 U.S. 366

Syllabus 
After respondent, a former officer, director, and loan officer of petitioner Great American Federal Savings and Loan Association (Association) received a right-to-sue letter upon filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he brought this suit against the Association and its directors in Federal District Court, alleging that the Association had intentionally embarked upon a course of conduct the effect of which was to deny to female employees equal employment opportunity; that, when respondent expressed support for the female employees at a meeting of the board of directors, his connection with the Association abruptly ended; and that his support for the female employees was the cause of the termination of his employment.  Respondent claimed damages under 42 U.S.C.  1985(3) (1976 ed., Supp. II), contending that he had been injured as the result of a conspiracy to deprive him of equal protection of, and equal privileges and immunities under, the laws.  Section 1985(3) provides, inter alia, that a person so injured may have an action for damages against any one or more of the conspirators.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss, holding that  1985(3) could not be invoked because the directors of a single corporation cannot, as a matter of law and fact, engage in a conspiracy.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that conspiracies motivated by an invidious animus against women fall within  1985(3), and that respondent, a male allegedly injured as a result of such a conspiracy, has standing to bring suit under that provision.  The court further ruled that Title VII can be the source of a right asserted in a  1985(3) action, and that intracorporate conspiracies come within the intendment of the section.
Held:  Section 1985(3) may not be invoked to redress violations of Title VII.  It creates no substantive rights itself, but is a purely remedial statute, providing a civil cause of action when some otherwise defined federal right -- to equal protection of the laws or equal privileges and immunities under the laws -- is breached by a conspiracy in the manner defined by the section.  Thus, the question in this case is whether rights created by Title VII -- respondent alleged that he was injured 
Page 442 U. S. 367
 by a conspiracy to violate  704(a) of Title VII, which makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee because he has opposed any employment practice made unlawful by Title VII or because he has participated in an investigation or proceeding under Title VII -- may be asserted within the remedial framework of  1985(3).  If a violation of Title VII could be asserted through  1985(3), a complainant could avoid most if not all of the detailed and specific provisions of Title VII, which provides a comprehensive plan of administrative and judicial process designed to provide an opportunity for nonjudicial and nonadversary resolution of claims.  Perhaps most importantly, the complainant could completely bypass the administrative process, which plays such a crucial role in the scheme established by Congress in Title VII.  Unimpaired effectiveness can be given to the plan of Title VII only by holding that deprivation of a right created by Title VII cannot be the basis for a cause of action under  1985(3).  Cf. Brown v.

No. 78-711
Argued April 23, 1979
Decided June 11, 1979
442 U.S. 397

Syllabus 
Respondent, who suffers from a serious hearing disability and who seeks to be trained as a registered nurse, was denied admission to the nursing program of petitioner Southeastern Community College, a state institution that receives federal funds.  An audiologist's report indicated that, even with a hearing aid, respondent cannot understand speech directed to her except through lip-reading, and petitioner rejected respondent's application for admission because it believed her hearing disability made it impossible for her to participate safely in the normal clinical training program or to care safely for patients.  Respondent then filed suit against petitioner in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, a violation of  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination against an ""otherwise qualified handicapped individual"" in federally funded programs ""solely by reason of his handicap.""  The District Court entered judgment in favor of petitioner, confirming the audiologist's findings and concluding that respondent's handicap prevented her from safely performing in both her training program and her proposed profession.  On this basis, the court held that respondent was not an ""otherwise qualified handicapped individual"" protected by  504, and that the decision to exclude her was not discriminatory within the meaning of  504.  Although not disputing the District Court's factfindings, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, in light of intervening regulations of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW),  504 required petitioner to reconsider respondent's application for admission without regard to her hearing ability, and that, in determining whether respondent was ""otherwise qualified,"" petitioner must confine its inquiry to her ""academic and technical qualifications.""  The Court of Appeals also suggested that  504 required ""affirmative conduct"" by petitioner to modify its program to accommodate the disabilities of applicants.
Held:  There was no violation of  504 when petitioner concluded that respondent did not qualify for admission to its program.  Nothing in the language or history of  504 limits the freedom of an educational institution to require reasonable physical qualifications for admission to 
Page 442 U. S. 398
 a clinical training program.  Nor has there been any showing in this case that any action short of a substantial change in petitioner's program would render unreasonable the qualifications it imposed.  Pp.  442 U. S. 405-414.
(a) The terms of  504 indicate that mere possession of a handicap is not a permissible ground for assuming an inability to function in a particular context, but do not mean that a person need not meet legitimate physical requirements in order to be ""otherwise qualified.""  An otherwise qualified person is one who is able to meet all of a program's requirements in spite of his handicap.  HEW's regulations reinforce, rather than contradict, this conclusion.  Pp.  442 U. S. 405-407.
(b) Section 504 does not compel petitioner to undertake affirmative action that would dispense with the need for effective oral communication, such as by giving respondent individual supervision whenever she attends patients directly or by dispensing with certain required courses for respondent and training her to perform some but not all of the tasks a registered nurse is licensed to perform.  On the record, it appears unlikely that respondent could benefit from any affirmative action that HEW regulations reasonably could be interpreted as requiring with regard to ""modifications"" of post-secondary educational programs to accommodate handicapped persons and the provision of ""auxiliary aids"" such as sign language interpreters.  Moreover, an interpretation of the regulations that required the extensive modifications necessary to include respondent in the nursing program would raise grave doubts about their validity.  Neither the language, purpose, nor history of  504 reveals an intent to impose an affirmative action obligation on all recipients of federal funds, and thus even if HEW has attempted to create such an obligation itself, it lacks the authority to do so.  Pp.  442 U. S. 407-412.
(c) The line between a lawful refusal to extend affirmative action and illegal discrimination against handicapped persons will not always be clear, and situations may arise where a refusal to modify an existing program to accommodate the needs of a disabled person amounts to discrimination against the handicapped.  In this case, however, petitioner's unwillingness to make major adjustments in its nursing program does not constitute such discrimination.  Uncontroverted testimony established that the purpose of petitioner's program was to train persons who could serve the nursing profession in all customary ways, and this type of purpose, far from reflecting any animus against handicapped individuals, is shared by many, if not most, of the institutions that train persons to render professional service.  Section 504 imposes no requirement upon an educational institution to lower or to effect substantial 
Page 442 U. S. 399
 modifications of standards to accommodate a handicapped person.  Pp.  442 U. S. 412-413.

 a clinical training program.  Nor has there been any showing in this case that any action short of a substantial change in petitioner's program would render unreasonable the qualifications it imposed.  Pp.  442 U. S. 405-414.
(a) The terms of  504 indicate that mere possession of a handicap is not a permissible ground for assuming an inability to function in a particular context, but do not mean that a person need not meet legitimate physical requirements in order to be ""otherwise qualified.""  An otherwise qualified person is one who is able to meet all of a program's requirements in spite of his handicap.  HEW's regulations reinforce, rather than contradict, this conclusion.  Pp.  442 U. S. 405-407.
(b) Section 504 does not compel petitioner to undertake affirmative action that would dispense with the need for effective oral communication, such as by giving respondent individual supervision whenever she attends patients directly or by dispensing with certain required courses for respondent and training her to perform some but not all of the tasks a registered nurse is licensed to perform.  On the record, it appears unlikely that respondent could benefit from any affirmative action that HEW regulations reasonably could be interpreted as requiring with regard to ""modifications"" of post-secondary educational programs to accommodate handicapped persons and the provision of ""auxiliary aids"" such as sign language interpreters.  Moreover, an interpretation of the regulations that required the extensive modifications necessary to include respondent in the nursing program would raise grave doubts about their validity.  Neither the language, purpose, nor history of  504 reveals an intent to impose an affirmative action obligation on all recipients of federal funds, and thus even if HEW has attempted to create such an obligation itself, it lacks the authority to do so.  Pp.  442 U. S. 407-412.
(c) The line between a lawful refusal to extend affirmative action and illegal discrimination against handicapped persons will not always be clear, and situations may arise where a refusal to modify an existing program to accommodate the needs of a disabled person amounts to discrimination against the handicapped.  In this case, however, petitioner's unwillingness to make major adjustments in its nursing program does not constitute such discrimination.  Uncontroverted testimony established that the purpose of petitioner's program was to train persons who could serve the nursing profession in all customary ways, and this type of purpose, far from reflecting any animus against handicapped individuals, is shared by many, if not most, of the institutions that train persons to render professional service.  Section 504 imposes no requirement upon an educational institution to lower or to effect substantial 
Page 442 U. S. 399
 modifications of standards to accommodate a handicapped person.  Pp.  442 U. S. 412-413.

Syllabus 
When school authorities reported suspected abuse of one of adult appellees' children to the Texas Department of Human Resources (Department), the Department took temporary custody of all three of appellees' minor children and instituted suit in the Harris County, Tex., Juvenile Court for their emergency protection under Title 2 of the Texas Family Code.  The Juvenile Court entered an emergency ex parte order giving temporary custody to the Department.  Appellees then filed a motion to modify the ex parte order, but when they were unable to obtain an immediate hearing, they filed a habeas corpus petition in Harris County rather than renewing the motion or appealing the ex parte order.  The Harris County court ultimately entered an order transferring venue to the Montgomery County Juvenile Court, and, at the Harris County judge's direction, the Department filed another suit, which was also transferred to Montgomery County, while temporary custody of the children was continued in the Department.  Rather than attempting to expedite a hearing in the Montgomery County court, appellees filed an action in Federal District Court, broadly challenging the constitutionality of the interrelated parts of Title 2's statutory scheme defining the contours of the parent-child relationship and the permissible areas and modes of state intervention.  The District Court denied appellees a temporary restraining order, but later held that the state court's temporary orders had expired and that the children had to be returned to their parents.  The Department then filed a new suit in the Montgomery County court, which issued a show-cause order and writ of attachment ordering that the child suspected of being abused be delivered to the temporary custody of his grandparents.  Appellees countered by filing in the Federal District Court a second application for a temporary restraining order addressed to the Montgomery County Juvenile Court, and this was granted.  A three-judge District Court thereafter preliminarily enjoined the Department and other defendants from filing or prosecuting any state suit under the challenged state statutes until a final determination by the three-judge court.  Subsequently, this determination was made, the court concluding that abstention under the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, was unwarranted because the litigation was ""multifaceted,"" 
Page 442 U. S. 416
 involved custody of children, and was the product of procedural confusion in the state courts, and thereafter addressing the merits of the constitutional challenges.
Held:  In light of the pending state proceedings, the Federal District Court should not have exercised its jurisdiction, but should have abstained under the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, supra, which, in counseling federal court abstention when there is a pending state proceeding, reflects a strong policy against federal intervention in state judicial processes in the absence of great and immediate irreparable injury to the federal plaintiff.  Pp.  442 U. S. 423-435.
(a) The basic concern -- the threat to our federal system posed by displacement of state courts by those of the National Government -- is applicable not only to state criminal proceedings but also to civil proceedings in which important state interests are involved.  Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S. 592.  As was the case in Huffman, the State here was a party to the state proceedings, and the temporary removal of a child in the child abuse context is, like the public nuisance statute involved in Huffman, ""in aid of and closely related to criminal statutes.""  Id. at  420 U. S. 604.  P.  442 U. S. 423.
(b) While the District Court's reference to the litigation as being ""multifaceted"" as a reason for refusing abstention is unclear, it appears that this reference meant either that the appellees' constitutional challenge could not have been raised in the pending state proceedings or that, in view of the breadth of such challenge, abstention was inappropriate.  However, with respect to the pertinent inquiry whether the state proceedings afford an adequate opportunity to raise the constitutional claims, Texas law appears to raise no procedural barriers.  And the breadth of a challenge to a complex state statutory scheme has traditionally militated in favor of abstention, not against it.  Pp.  442 U. S. 424-428.
(c) There are three distinct considerations that counsel abstention when broad-based challenges are made to state statutes.  First is the concern of Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496, that a federal court will be forced to interpret state law without the benefit of state court consideration, and therefore under circumstances where a constitutional determination is predicated on a reading of the statute that is not binding on state courts and may be discredited at any time, such dangers increasing with the breadth of the challenge.  Second is the need for a concrete case or controversy, a concern also enhanced by the scope of the challenge and one that is demonstrated by the instant case.  The third concern is the threat to our federal system of government posed by
""the needless obstruction to the domestic policy of the states 
Page 442 U. S. 417
 by forestalling state action in construing and applying its own statutes.""
Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U. S. 450,  325 U. S. 471.  Almost every constitutional challenge -- and particularly one as far-ranging as that involved here -- offers the opportunity for narrowing constructions that might obviate the constitutional problem and intelligently mediate federal constitutional concerns and state interests.  Pp.  442 U. S. 428-430.
(d) With respect to appellees' argument that delay in affording them a hearing in state court made Younger abstention inappropriate, the federal injunction did, in fact, address the state proceeding, and it was unnecessary to obtain release of the children, as they had already been placed in appellees' custody pursuant to federal court order.  Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, distinguished.  Furthermore, such argument cannot be distinguished from conventional claims of bad faith and other sources of irreparable harm; in this case, the state authorities' conduct evinced no bad faith, and, while there was confusion, confusion is not bad faith.  Pp.  442 U. S. 430-432.
(e) In the absence of bad faith, there remain only limited grounds for not applying Younger.  Here, no claim could be properly made that the state proceedings were motivated by a desire to harass or that the challenged statute is ""flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions in every clause, sentence and paragraph,'"" Huffman, supra at  420 U. S. 611.  Nor were there present in this case other
""extraordinary circumstances in which the necessary irreparable injury can be shown even in the absence of the usual prerequisites of bad faith and harassment,""
Younger, supra, at  401 U. S. 53.  Unless it were held that every attachment issued to protect a child creates great, immediate, and irreparable harm warranting federal court intervention, it cannot be properly concluded that, with the state proceedings here in the posture they were at the time of the federal action, federal intervention was warranted.

Syllabus 
When petitioner railroads proposed a seasonal increase in the shipping rates for grain and soybeans, a number of shippers filed protests with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) requesting that it exercise its authority under  15 (8)(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act (Act) to suspend such rates and to investigate the charges of their illegality.  But the ICC issued an order declining such request, although it admonished the railroads to correct any such violations as might exist and directed that records be kept to protect the shippers' right to recover damages in such subsequent proceedings as they might bring pursuant to  13(1) of the Act.  The Court of Appeals held that the ICC had begun an investigation but had then erroneously terminated it without adequately investigating the charges of illegality and without supporting its decision with appropriate findings.  The court concluded that a decision by the ICC to refuse to make or to terminate an investigation of the lawfulness of a proposed tariff is subject to judicial review, even though suspension orders are not, primarily because a single  15(8)(a) proceeding initiated by the ICC is a better means of determining the lawfulness of rates than numerous  13(1) complaint proceedings initiated by shippers.
Held:
1. To the extent that the Court of Appeals interpreted the ICC's order as a final decision that the proposed tariff was lawful, rather than simply a discretionary decision not now to investigate its lawfulness, it misconstrued the order.  The order's express language belies any such interpretation, and the ICC did not reject the shippers' claim of illegality on the merits, but, on the contrary admonished the railroads about possible violations.  Moreover, since the ICC expressly indicated that charges of violation of the Act could be resolved in  13(1) proceedings, it is plainly incorrect to interpret its action as a prejudgment on the issue.  Pp.  442 U. S. 452-454. 
Page 442 U. S. 445

2. The ICC's ""no investigation"" decision is not subject to judicial review.  Pp.  442 U. S. 454-463.
(a) This conclusion is supported by  15(8)(a)'s language of permission and discretion (the ICC ""may, upon the complaint of an interested party . . . , order a hearing concerning the lawfulness of [a] rate""), and by the fact that the statute is silent on what factors should guide the ICC's decision.  Pp.  442 U. S. 455-456.
(b) The structure of the Act also indicates that Congress intended to prohibit judicial review of the ICC's ""no investigation"" decision.  Congress did not use permissive language such as that found in  15(8)(a) when it wished to create reviewable duties under the Act, but instead used mandatory language such as in  13(1).  To treat  15(8)(a) as if it were written in  13(1)'s mandatory language would allow shippers to use the open-ended and ill-defined procedures in  15(8)(a) to render obsolete the carefully designed and detailed procedures in  13(1).  Moreover, in view of the linkage between the ICC's power to investigate and its power to suspend proposed rates, the decisions holding that the merits of a suspension order are not reviewable, Aberdeen & Rockfish R. Co. v. SCRAP, 422 U. S. 289; United States v. SCRAP, 412 U. S. 669; Arrow Transportation Co. v. Southern R. Co., 372 U. S. 658, furnish further authority for holding that a ""no investigation"" decision is not reviewable.  Pp.  442 U. S. 456-450.
(c) The legislative history of the Mann-Elkins amendments adding  15(8) to the Act further supports nonreviewability of ""no investigation"" decisions.  Prior to those amendments, the ICC had no authority to suspend rates, or to adjudicate their lawfulness in advance either of their becoming effective or of their being challenged in a  13(1) complaint, and the adoption of  15(8) was designed to avoid the disruptive consequences of judicial interference with the ICC's ratemaking process.  To allow the courts to review  15(8)(a) investigation decisions would amount to ""backhanded approval"" of these same consequences, and judicial review would once again undermine the ICC's primary jurisdiction by bringing courts into the adjudication of the lawfulness of rates in advance of administrative consideration.  Pp.  442 U. S. 459-460.
3. There is no statutory support for a compromise position that, while not immediately reviewable, the ICC's decisions under  15(8)(a) do become reviewable later, upon the completion of whatever proceedings may be initiated under  13(1).  While the  13(1) remedy lessens the risk of harm from the ICC's initial refusal to investigate or suspend under  15(8)(a), that remedy is independent of  15(8)(a) proceedings.  Pp.  442 U. S. 463-464.

No. 78-5066
Argued March 21, 1979
Decided June 5, 1979
442 U.S. 200

Syllabus 
A Rochester, N.Y. police detective questioned a jail inmate, the supposed source of a lead implicating petitioner in an attempted robbery and homicide, but learned nothing that supplied ""enough information to get a warrant"" for petitioner's arrest.  Nevertheless, the detective ordered other detectives to ""pick up"" petitioner and ""bring him in.""  Petitioner was then taken into custody, and although not told that he was under arrest, he would have been physically restrained if he had attempted to leave.  He was driven to police headquarters and placed in an interrogation room, where he was questioned by officers after being given the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  He waived counsel and eventually made statements and drew sketches that incriminated him in the crime.  At his state court trial, his motions to suppress the statements and sketches were denied, and he was convicted.  The New York appellate courts affirmed the conviction, but this Court vacated the judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of t.he supervening decision in Brown v. Illinois, 422 U. S. 590, which held that there is no per se rule that Miranda warnings, in and of themselves, suffice to cure a Fourth Amendment violation involved in obtaining inculpatory statements during custodial interrogation following a formal arrest on less than probable cause, and that, in order to use such statements, the prosecution must show not only that the statements meet the Fifth Amendment voluntariness standard, but also that the causal connection between the statements and the illegal arrest is broken sufficiently to purge the primary taint of the illegal arrest in light of t.he distinct policies and interests of the Fourth Amendment.  On remand from the New York Court of Appeals, the trial court granted petitioner's motion to suppress, but the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court reversed, holding that, although the police lacked probable cause to arrest petitioner, law enforcement officials may detain an individual upon reasonable suspicion for questioning for a reasonable period of time under carefully controlled conditions which are ample to protect the individual's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, and that, even if petitioner's detention were illegal, the taint of such detention was sufficiently attenuated to allow the admission of his statements and sketches. 
Page 442 U. S. 201

Held:
1. The Rochester police violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments when, without probable cause to arrest, they seized petitioner and transported him to the police station for interrogation.  Pp.  442 U. S. 206-216.

Syllabus 
A Rochester, N.Y. police detective questioned a jail inmate, the supposed source of a lead implicating petitioner in an attempted robbery and homicide, but learned nothing that supplied ""enough information to get a warrant"" for petitioner's arrest.  Nevertheless, the detective ordered other detectives to ""pick up"" petitioner and ""bring him in.""  Petitioner was then taken into custody, and although not told that he was under arrest, he would have been physically restrained if he had attempted to leave.  He was driven to police headquarters and placed in an interrogation room, where he was questioned by officers after being given the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  He waived counsel and eventually made statements and drew sketches that incriminated him in the crime.  At his state court trial, his motions to suppress the statements and sketches were denied, and he was convicted.  The New York appellate courts affirmed the conviction, but this Court vacated the judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of t.he supervening decision in Brown v. Illinois, 422 U. S. 590, which held that there is no per se rule that Miranda warnings, in and of themselves, suffice to cure a Fourth Amendment violation involved in obtaining inculpatory statements during custodial interrogation following a formal arrest on less than probable cause, and that, in order to use such statements, the prosecution must show not only that the statements meet the Fifth Amendment voluntariness standard, but also that the causal connection between the statements and the illegal arrest is broken sufficiently to purge the primary taint of the illegal arrest in light of t.he distinct policies and interests of the Fourth Amendment.  On remand from the New York Court of Appeals, the trial court granted petitioner's motion to suppress, but the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court reversed, holding that, although the police lacked probable cause to arrest petitioner, law enforcement officials may detain an individual upon reasonable suspicion for questioning for a reasonable period of time under carefully controlled conditions which are ample to protect the individual's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, and that, even if petitioner's detention were illegal, the taint of such detention was sufficiently attenuated to allow the admission of his statements and sketches.

Syllabus 
Petitioner brought suit in Federal District Court alleging that respondent, who was a United States Congressman at the time this case commenced, had discriminated against petitioner on the basis of her sex, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, by terminating her employment as a deputy administrative assistant.  Petitioner sought damages in the form of backpay, and jurisdiction was founded on the provisions of 28 U.S.C.  1331(a) that confer original jurisdiction on federal district courts of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,00 and arises under the Federal Constitution.  The District Court ruled that petitioner had no private right of action, and the Court of Appeals ultimately held that ""no right of action may be implied from the Due Process Clause of the fifth amendment.""
Held:  A cause of action and damages remedy can be implied directly under the Constitution when the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is violated.  Cf. Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388; Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478.  Pp.  442 U. S. 233-249.
(a) The equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause confers on petitioner a federal constitutional right to be free from gender discrimination that does not serve important governmental objectives or is not substantially related to the achievement of such objectives.  Pp.  442 U. S. 234-235.
(b) The term ""cause of action,"" as used in this case, refers to whether a plaintiff is a member of a class of litigants that may, as a matter of law, appropriately invoke the power of the court.  Since petitioner rests her claim directly on the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, claiming that her rights under that Amendment have been violated and that she has no effective means other than the judiciary to vindicate these rights, she is an appropriate party to invoke the District Court's general federal question jurisdiction to seek relief, and she therefore has a cause of action under the Fifth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals erred in using the criteria of Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66, to conclude that petitioner lacked such a cause of action, since the question of who may enforce a statutory right is fundamentally different from the question of who may enforce a right protected by the Constitution.  Pp.  442 U. S. 236-244. 
Page 442 U. S. 229

(c) Petitioner should be able to redress her injury in damages if she is able to prevail on the merits.  A damages remedy is appropriate, since it is a ""remedial mechanism normally available in the federal courts,"" Bivens, supra at  403 U. S. 397, since it would be judicially manageable without difficult questions of valuation or causation, and since there are no available alternative forms of relief.  Moreover, if respondent's actions are not shielded by the Speech or Debate Clause, the principle that legislators ought generally to be bound by the law as are ordinary persons applies.  And there is ""no explicit congressional declaration that persons"" in petitioner's position injured by unconstitutional federal employment discrimination ""may not recover money damages from"" those responsible for the injury.  Ibid.  To afford petitioner a damages remedy does not mean that the federal courts will be deluged with claims, as the Court of Appeals feared.  Moreover, current limitations upon the effective functioning of the courts arising from budgetary inadequacies should not be permitted to stand in the way of the recognition of otherwise sound constitutional principles.

No. 78-233
Argued February 26, 1979
Decided June 5, 1979
442 U.S. 256

Syllabus 
During her 12-year tenure as a state employee, appellee, who is not a veteran, had passed a number of open competitive civil service examinations for better jobs, but because of Massachusetts' veterans' preference statute she was ranked in each instance below male veterans who had achieved lower test scores than appellee.  Under the statute, all veterans who qualify for state civil service positions must be considered for appointment ahead of any qualifying nonveterans.  The statutory preference, which is available to ""any person, male or female, including a nurse,"" who was honorably discharged from the United States Armed Forces after at least 90 days of active service, at least one day of which was during ""wartime,"" operates overwhelmingly to the advantage of males.  Appellee brought an action in Federal District Court, alleging that the absolute preference formula established in the Massachusetts statute inevitably operates to exclude women from consideration for the best state civil service jobs, and thus discriminates against women in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  A three-judge court declared the statute unconstitutional and enjoined its operation, finding that, while the goals of the preference were legitimate and the statute had not been enacted for the purpose of discriminating against women, the exclusionary impact upon women was so severe as to require the State to further its goals through a more limited form of preference.  On an earlier appeal, this Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of the intervening decision in Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, which held that a neutral law does not violate the Equal Protection Clause solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact, and that, instead, the disproportionate impact must be traced to a purpose to discriminate on the basis of race.  Upon remand, the District Court reaffirmed its original judgment, concluding that a veterans' hiring preference is inherently nonneutral, because it favors a class from which women have traditionally been excluded, and that the consequences of the Massachusetts absolute preference formula for the 
Page 442 U. S. 257
 employment opportunities of women were too inevitable to have been ""unintended.""
Held:  Massachusetts, in granting an absolute lifetime preference to veterans, has not discriminated against women in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  442 U. S. 271-281.
(a) Classifications based upon gender must bear a close and substantial relationship to important governmental objectives.  Although public employment is not a constitutional right and the States have wide discretion in framing employee qualifications, any state law overtly or covertly designed to prefer males over females in public employment would require an exceedingly persuasive justification to withstand a constitutional challenge under the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  442 U. S. 271-273.
(b) When a statute gender-neutral on its face is challenged on the ground that its effects upon women are disproportionably adverse, a twofold inquiry is appropriate.  The first question is whether the statutory classification is indeed neutral in the sense that it is not gender-based.  If the classification itself, covert or overt, is not based upon gender, the second question is whether the adverse effect reflects invidious gender-based discrimination.  Pp.  442 U. S. 273-274.
(c) Here, the appellee's concession and the District Court's finding that the Massachusetts statute is not a pretext for gender discrimination are clearly correct.  Apart from the facts that the definition of ""veterans"" in the statute has always been neutral as to gender and that Massachusetts has consistently defined veteran status in a way that has been inclusive of women who have served in the military, this is not a law that can plausibly, or even rationally, be explained only as a gender-based classification.  Significant numbers of nonveterans are men, and all nonveterans -- male as well as female -- are placed at a disadvantage.  The distinction made by the Massachusetts statute is, as it seems to be, quite simply between veterans and nonveterans, not between men and women.  Pp.  442 U. S. 274-275.
(d) Appellee's contention that this veterans' preference is ""inherently nonneutral"" or ""gender-biased"" in the sense that it favors a status reserved under federal military policy primarily to men is wholly at odds with the District Court's central finding that Massachusetts has not offered a preference to veterans for the purpose of discriminating against women; nor can it be reconciled with the assumption made by both the appellee and the District Court that a more limited hiring preference for veterans could be sustained, since the degree of the preference makes no constitutional difference.  Pp.  442 U. S. 276-278.
(e) While it would be disingenuous to say that the adverse consequences of this legislation for women were unintended, in the sense 
Page 442 U. S. 258
 that they were not volitional or in the sense that they were not foreseeable, nevertheless ""discriminatory purpose"" implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences; it implies that the decisionmaker selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ""because of,"" not merely ""in spite of,"" its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.  When the totality of legislative actions establishing and extending the Massachusetts veterans' preference are considered, the law remains what it purports to be:  a preference for veterans of either sex over nonveterans of either sex, not for men over women.  Pp.  442 U. S. 278-280.
(f) Although absolute and permanent preferences have always been subject to the objection that they give the veteran more than a square deal, the Fourteenth Amendment ""cannot be made a refuge from ill-advised . . . laws.""  District of Columbia v. Brooke, 214 U. S. 138,  214 U. S. 150.  The substantial edge granted to veterans by the Massachusetts statute may reflect unwise policy, but appellee has simply failed to demonstrate that the law in any way reflects a purpose to discriminate on the basis of sex.

442 U.S. 289

Syllabus 
Appellees (a farmworkers' union, a union agent, farmworkers, and a union supporter) brought suit in Federal District Court in Arizona seeking a declaration of the unconstitutionality of various provisions of Arizona's farm labor statute, as well as of the entire statute, and an injunction against its enforcement.  A three-judge court ruled unconstitutional on various grounds the provisions (1) specifying procedures for the election of employee bargaining representatives; (2) limiting union publicity directed at consumers of agricultural products; (3) imposing a criminal penalty for violations of the statute; (4) excusing an agricultural employer from furnishing a union any materials, information, time, or facilities to enable it to communicate with the employer's employees (access provision); and (5) governing arbitration of labor disputes, construed by the court as mandating compulsory arbitration.  Deeming these provisions inseparable from the remainder of the statute, the court went on to declare the whole statute unconstitutional, and enjoined its enforcement.
Held:
1. The challenges to the provisions regulating election procedures, consumer publicity, and criminal sanctions present a case or controversy, but the challenges to the access and arbitration provisions are not justiciable.  Pp. 297-305.
(a) The fact that appellees have not invoked the election procedures provision in the past or expressed any intention to do so in the future, does not defeat the justiciability of their challenge in view of the nature of their claim that delays attending the statutory election scheme and the technical limitations on who may vote in unit elections severely curtail their freedom of association.  To await appellees' participation in an election would not assist the resolution of the threshold question whether the election procedures are subject to scrutiny under the First Amendment at all, and, as this question is dispositive of appellees' challenge, there is no warrant for postponing consideration of the election procedures claim.  Pp.  442 U. S. 299-301. 
Page 442 U. S. 290

(b) With expect to appellees' claim that the consumer publicity provision (which, on its face, proscribes, as an unfair labor practice, dishonest, untruthful, and deceptive publicity) unconstitutionally penalizes inaccuracies inadvertently uttered, appellees have reason to fear prosecution for violation of the provision, where the State has not disavowed any intention of invoking the criminal penalty provision (which applies in terms to ""[a]ny person . . . who violates any provision"" of the statute) against unions that commit unfair labor practices.  Accordingly, the positions of the parties are sufficiently adverse with respect to the consumer publicity provision to present a case or controversy.  For the same reasons, a case or controversy is also presented by appellees' claim that such provision unduly restricts protected speech by limiting publicity to that directed at agricultural products of an employer with whom a union has a primary dispute.  Pp.  442 U. S. 301-303.
(c) Where it is clear that appellees desire to engage in prohibited consumer publicity campaigns, their claim that the criminal penalty provision is unconstitutionally vague was properly entertained by the District Court, and may be raised in this appeal.  If the provision were truly vague, appellees should not be expected to pursue their collective activities at their peril.  P.  442 U. S. 303.
(d) Appellees' challenge to the access provision is not justiciable, where not only is it conjectural to anticipate that access will be denied, but, more importantly, appellees' claim that such provision violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it deprives the state agency responsible for enforcing the statute of any discretion to compel agricultural employers to furnish the enumerated items depends upon the attributes of the situs involved.  An opinion on the constitutionality of the provision at this time would be patently advisory, and adjudication of the challenge must wait until appellees can assert an interest in seeking access to particular facilities, as well as a palpable basis for believing that access will be refused.  Pp.  442 U. S. 303-304.
(e) Similarly, any ruling on the allegedly compulsory arbitration provision would be wholly advisory where the record discloses that there is no real and concrete dispute as to the application of the provision, appellees themselves acknowledging that employers may elect responses to an arguably unlawful strike other than seeking an injunction and agreeing to arbitrate, and appellees never having contested the constitutionality of the provision.  Pp.  442 U. S. 304-305.
2. The District Court properly considered the constitutionality of the election procedures provision even though a prior construction of the provision by the Arizona state courts was lacking, but the court should 
Page 442 U. S. 291
 have abstained from adjudicating the challenges to the consumer publicity and criminal penalty provisions until material unresolved questions of state law were determined by the Arizona courts.  Pp.  442 U. S. 305-312.
(a) A state court construction of the election procedures provision would not obviate the need for decision of the constitutional issue or materially alter the question to be decided, as the resolution of the question whether such procedures are affected with a First Amendment interest at all is dispositive of appellees' challenge.  P.  442 U. S. 306.
(b) The criminal penalty provision might be construed broadly as applying to all provisions of the statute affirmatively proscribing or commanding courses of conduct, or narrowly as applying only to certain provisions susceptible of being ""violated,"" but, in either case, the provision is reasonably susceptible of constructions that might undercut or modify appellees' vagueness attack or otherwise significantly alter the constitutional questions requiring resolution.  Pp.  442 U. S. 307-308.
(c) In view of the fact that the consumer publicity provision is patently ambiguous and subject to varying interpretations which would substantially affect the constitutional question presented, the District Court erred in entertaining all aspects of appellees' challenge to such provision without the benefit of a construction thereof by the Arizona courts.  Pp.  442 U. S. 308-312.
3. The District Court erred in invalidating the election procedures provision.  Arizona was not constitutionally obliged to provide procedures pursuant to which agricultural employees, through a chosen representative, might compel their employers to negotiate, and that it has undertaken to do so in an assertedly niggardly fashion, presents, as a general matter, no First Amendment problems.  Moreover, the statute does not preclude voluntary recognition of a union by an agricultural employer. Pp. 312-314.

442 U.S. 100

Syllabus 
Petitioner's testimony before a grand jury in June, 1976, implicated one Musgrave in various drug-related offenses, and an indictment of Musgrave followed.  On September 30, 1976, petitioner recanted his testimony in an oral statement made under oath in the office of Musgrave's attorney.  Musgrave then moved to dismiss his indictment, alleging that it was based on perjured testimony.  At an evidentiary hearing on this motion on October 21, 1976, petitioner adopted his September 30 statement and testified that only a small part of his grand jury testimony was true.  As a result, the charges against Musgrave were reduced.  Petitioner was subsequently indicted for violations of 18 U.S.C.  1623 (1976 ed., Supp. 1), which prohibits false declarations made under oath ""in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury.""  The indictment charged that petitioner's grand jury testimony was inconsistent with statements made ""on September 30, 1976, while under oath as a witness in a proceeding ancillary to"" the Musgrave prosecution.  At trial, the Government introduced, over petitioner's objection, pertinent parts of his grand jury testimony, his testimony at the evidentiary hearing, and his sworn statement to Musgrave's attorney.  Petitioner was convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Although it agreed with petitioner that the September interview in the attorney's office was not an ancillary proceeding under  1623, the court concluded that the October 21 hearing was such a proceeding.  While acknowledging that the indictment specified the September 30 interview, rather than the October 21 hearing, as the ancillary proceeding, the court construed this discrepancy as a nonprejudicial variance between the indictment and the proof at trial.
Held:
1. Since the indictment and jury instructions specified the September 30 interview as the ancillary proceeding, the Court of Appeals erred in predicating its affirmance on petitioner's October 21 testimony.  To uphold a conviction on a charge that was neither alleged in an indictment nor presented to a jury offends the most basic notions of due process.  Although the jury might well have reached the same verdict had the prosecution built its case on petitioner's October 21 testimony adopting 
Page 442 U. S. 101
 his September 30 statement, rather than on the latter statement itself, the offense was not so defined, and appellate courts are not free to revise the basis on which a defendant is convicted simply because the same result would likely obtain on retrial.  Pp.  442 U. S. 105-107.
2. As both the language and legislative history of Title IV of the 1970 Organized Crime Control Act make clear, an interview in a private attorney's office at which a sworn statement is given does not constitute a ""proceeding ancillary to a court or grand jury"" within the meaning of  1623.  Moreover, to characterize such an interview as an ancillary proceeding would contravene the long-established practice of resolving doubt concerning the ambit of criminal statutes in favor of lenity.  Pp.  442 U. S. 107-113.

Syllabus 
Respondent was found guilty of violating 18 U.S.C.  922(h), which is part of Title IV of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Act).  That provision prohibits previously convicted felons from receiving a firearm that has traveled in interstate commerce.  The District Court sentenced respondent under 18 U.S.C.  924(a) to five years' imprisonment, the maximum term authorized for violation of  922(h).  The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but remanded for resentencing.  Noting that the substantive elements of  922(h) and 18 U.S.C.App.  1202(a), which is contained in Title VII of the Act, are identical as applied to a convicted felon who unlawfully receives a firearm, the court interpreted the Act to allow no more than the 2-year maximum sentence provided by  1202(a).
Held:  A defendant convicted of violating  922(h) is properly sentenced under  924(a) even though his conduct also violates  1202(a).  Pp.  442 U. S. 118-126.
(a) Nothing in the language, structure, or legislative history of the Act suggests that, because of the overlap between  922(h) and 1202(a), a defendant convicted under  922(h) may be imprisoned for no more than the maximum term specified in  1202(a).  Rather, each substantive statute, in conjunction with its own sentencing provision, operates independently of the other.  Pp.  442 U. S. 118-121.
(b) The Court of Appeals erroneously relied on three principles of statutory interpretation in construing  1202(a) to override the penalties authorized by  924(a).  The doctrine that ambiguities in criminal statutes must be resolved in favor of lenity is not applicable here, since there is no ambiguity to resolve.  Nor can  1202(a) be interpreted as implicitly repealing  924(a) whenever a defendant's conduct might violate both sections.  Legislative intent to repeal must be manifest in the ""positive repugnancy between the provisions.'""  United States v. Borden Co., 308 U. S. 188,  308 U. S. 199.  In this case, the penalty provisions are fully capable of coexisting because they apply to convictions under different statutes.  Finally, the maxim that statutes should be construed to avoid constitutional questions offers no assistance here, since this principle applies only when an alternative interpretation is fairly possible from the language of the statute.  There is simply no basis in 
Page 442 U. S. 115
 the Act for reading the term ""five"" in  924(a) to mean ""two.""  Pp.  442 U. S. 121-122.
(c) The statutory provisions at issue are not void for vagueness, because they unambiguously specify the activity proscribed and the penalties available upon conviction.  Although the statutes create uncertainty as to which crime may be charged, and therefore what penalties may be imposed, they do so to no greater extent than would a single statute authorizing alternative punishments.  So long as overlapping criminal provisions clearly define the conduct prohibited and the punishment authorized, the notice requirements of the Due Process Clause are satisfied.  P.  442 U. S. 123.
(d) Nor are the statutes unconstitutional under the equal protection component or Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment on the theory that they allow the prosecutor unfettered discretion in selecting which of two penalties to apply.  A prosecutor's discretion to choose between  922(h) and 1202(a) is not ""unfettered""; selectivity in the enforcement of criminal laws is subject to constitutional constraints.  Whether to prosecute and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury are decisions that generally rest in the prosecutor's discretion.  Just as a defendant has no constitutional right to elect which of two applicable federal statutes shall be the basis of his indictment and prosecution, neither is he entitled to choose the penalty scheme under which he will be sentenced.  Pp.  442 U. S. 123-125.
(e) The statutes are not unconstitutional as impermissibly delegating to the Executive Branch the Legislature's responsibility to fix criminal penalties.  Having clearly informed the courts, prosecutors, and defendants of the permissible punishment alternatives available under each statute, Congress has fulfilled its duty.  Pp.  442 U. S. 125-126.

Syllabus 
In the settlement of a state court collection suit, respondent stipulated that petitioner should have judgment against respondent.  Shortly thereafter, respondent filed for bankruptcy, and petitioner sought to establish that respondent's debt to him was not dischargeable because it was the product of respondent's fraud, deceit, and malicious conversion, and thus came within  17a(2) and (4) of the Bankruptcy Act, which provide that such debts are not affected by a discharge.  The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for respondent.  The court held that the record in the state court proceeding did not establish that respondent had committed fraud, and res judicata barred petitioner from offering additional evidence to prove the underlying nature of the debt.  The District Court, and Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The bankruptcy court is not confined to a review of the judgment and record in the prior state court proceeding when determining the dischargeability of respondent's debt.  When a debtor asserts the new defense of bankruptcy, res judicata does not bar the creditor from offering additional evidence to meet that defense.  A contrary rule would force premature federal issues on the state courts and would frustrate the command of the Bankruptcy Act that only honest debts are to be discharged.  Pp.  442 U. S. 131-139.
Reversed.

Syllabus 
Respondents (three adult males) and a 16-year-old girl (Jane Doe) were jointly tried in a New York state court on charges, inter alia, of illegally possessing two loaded handguns found in an automobile in which they were riding when it was stopped for speeding.  The guns had been positioned crosswise in Jane Doe's open handbag on either the front floor or front seat on the passenger side where she was sitting.  All four defendants objected to the introduction of the guns into evidence, arguing that the State had not adequately demonstrated a connection between the guns and the defendants.  The trial court overruled the objection, relying on the presumption of possession created by a New York statute providing that the presence of a firearm in an automobile is presumptive evidence of its illegal possession by all persons then occupying the vehicle, except when, inter alia, the firearm is found ""upon the person"" of one of the occupants.  The trial court also denied respondents' motion to dismiss the charges on the alleged ground that such exception applied because the guns were found on Jane Doe's person, the court concluding that the applicability of the exception was a question of fact for the jury.  After being instructed that it was entitled to infer possession from the defendants' presence in the car, to consider all circumstances tending to support or contradict such inference, and to decide the matter for itself without regard to how much evidence the defendants introduced, the jury convicted all four defendants of illegal possession of the handguns.  Defendants' post-trial motion in which they challenged the constitutionality of the New York statute as applied to them, was denied.  Both the intermediate appellate court and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, the latter court holding that it was a jury question whether the guns were on Jane Doe's person, treating this question as having been resolved in the prosecution's favor, and concluding that, therefore, the presumption applied, and that there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions.  The court also summarily rejected the argument that the presumption was unconstitutional as applied in this case.  Respondents then filed a 
Page 442 U. S. 141
 habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, contending that they were denied due process of law by the application of the statutory presumption.  The District Court issued the writ, holding that respondents had not ""deliberately bypassed"" their federal claim by their actions at trial, and that the mere presence of two guns in a woman's handbag in a car could not reasonably give rise to the inference that they were in the possession of three other persons in the car.  The United States Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the New York Court of Appeals had decided respondents' constitutional claim on its merits, rather than on any independent state procedural ground that might have barred collateral relief, and, without deciding whether the presumption was constitutional as applied in this case, that the statute is unconstitutional on its face.
Held:
1. The District Court had jurisdiction to entertain respondents' claim that the statutory presumption is unconstitutional.  There is no support in New York law or the history of this litigation for an inference that the New York courts decided such claim on an independent and adequate state procedural ground that bars the federal courts from addressing the issue on habeas corpus.  If neither the state legislature nor the state courts indicate that a federal constitutional claim is barred by some state procedural rule, a federal court implies no disrespect for the State by entertaining the claim.  Pp.  442 U. S. 147-154.
2. The United States Court of Appeals erred in deciding the facial constitutionality issue.  In analyzing a mandatory presumption, which the jury must accept even if it is the sole evidence of an element of an offense (as opposed to a purely permissive presumption, which allows, but does not require, the trier of fact to infer the elemental fact from proof by the prosecutor of the basic one and which places no burden of any kind on the defendant), it is irrelevant that there is ample evidence in the record other than the presumption to support a conviction.  Without determining whether the presumption in this case was mandatory, the Court of Appeals analyzed it on its face as if it were, despite the fact that the state trial judge's instructions made it clear that it was not.  Pp.  442 U. S. 154-163.
3. As applied to the facts of this case, the statutory presumption is constitutional.  Under the circumstances, the jury would have been entirely reasonable in rejecting the suggestion that the guns were in Jane Doe's sole possession.  Assuming that the jury did reject it, the case is tantamount to one in which the guns were lying on the car's floor or seat in the plain view of respondents, and in such a case, it is 
Page 442 U. S. 142
 surely rational to infer that each of the respondents was fully aware of the guns' presence and had both the ability and the intent to exercise dominion and control over them.  The application of the presumption in this case thus comports with the standard, Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6, that there be a ""rational connection"" between the basic facts that the prosecution proved and the ultimate fact presumed, and that the latter is ""more likely than not to flow from"" the former.  Moreover, the presumption should not be judged by a more stringent ""reasonable doubt"" test, insofar as it is a permissive, rather than a mandatory, presumption.  Pp.  442 U. S. 163-167.

Syllabus 
Held:  A federal prisoner's allegation that a postsentencing change in the policies of the United States Parole Commission has prolonged his actual imprisonment beyond the period intended by the sentencing judge will not support a collateral attack on the original sentence under 28 U.S.C.  2255.  Pp.  442 U. S. 184-190.
(a) The claimed error that the judge was incorrect in his assumptions about the future course of parole proceedings does not meet any of the established standards of collateral attack, where there is no claim of a constitutional violation, the sentence imposed was within the statutory limits, and the proceeding was not infected with any error of fact or law of a ""fundamental"" character that renders the entire proceeding irregular and invalid.  The change in Parole Commission policies involved here -- considering the seriousness of the offense as a significant factor in determining whether a prisoner should be granted parole -- affected the way in which the court's judgment and sentence would be performed, but did not affect the lawfulness of the judgment itself, then or now; and there is no claim that the action taken by the sentencing judge was unconstitutional or was based on misinformation of constitutional magnitude.  Davis v. United States, 417 U. S. 333, and United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, distinguished.  Pp.  442 U. S. 184-187.
(b) There is no basis for enlarging the grounds for collateral attack to include claims based not on any objectively ascertainable error but on the frustration of the subjective intent of the sentencing judge.  Under the present statutory scheme, the judge has no enforceable expectations with respect to the actual release of a sentenced defendant short of his statutory term; and while the judge may have expectations as to when release is likely, the actual decision is not his to make, either at the time of sentencing or later if his expectations are not met.  To require the Parole Commission to act in accordance with judicial expectations, and to use collateral attack as a mechanism for ensuring that these expectations are carried out, would substantially undermine the congressional decision to entrust release determinations to the Commission, not the courts, and nothing in  2255 supports -- let alone mandates -- such a frustration of congressional intent.  Thus, subsequent 
Page 442 U. S. 179
 actions taken.by the Parole Commission -- whether or not such actions accord with a trial judge's expectations at the time of sentencing -- do not retroactively affect the validity of the final judgment itself, and do not provide a basis for collateral attack on the sentence pursuant to  2255.

 Dudley D. GOULDEN v. Joseph OLIVER et alNo. 78-6067 
 Supreme Court of the United States June 4, 1979
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Dudley Dee Goulden asserts that he is an Orthodox Jew, and that the Alabama prison authorities have forced him to shave and cut his hair, which is contrary to his religious beliefs. He filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983 alleging that the prison's grooming regulations violated his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court dismissed his complaint, reasoning that the prison regulations promoted cleanliness and personal identification and that those valid objectives outweighed any religious freedom petitioner was entitled to enjoy under the Constitution. By a single-judge order and without opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied petitioner's pro se application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. To support these rulings, respondents rely on Brooks v. Wainwright, 428 F.2d 652 (CA5 1970), which upheld the dismissal of a somewhat similar complaint. [Footnote 1] See also Brown v. Wainwright, 419 F.2d 1376 ( CA5 1970). 
 In Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319 (1972), this Court held that a complaint that challenged restrictions on an inmate's practice of Buddhism stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. Ruling that ""reasonable opportunities must be afforded to all prisoners to exercise the religious freedom guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments without fear of penalty,"" id., at 322 n. 2, the Court remanded the case for a hearing on the merits. See also Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546 (1964). 
Page 442 U.S. 922 , 923
 Whatever validity the Fifth Circuit's Brooks rule may once have had, it has been severely undercut by Cruz and the subsequent cases that have reaffirmed the principle that prison regulations are subject to constitutional scrutiny. See Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Union, 433 U.S. 119 (1977); Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977); Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974). Citing Cruz and Martinez, the Second Circuit has rejected Brooks and held that a prisoner challenging prison grooming regulations on free exercise grounds is entitled to a hearing on the reasonableness of the prison's regulations. Burgin v. Henderson, 536 F.2d 501, 504, and n. 8 (CA2 1976). Accord: Jihaad v. Carlson, 410 F.Supp. 1132, 1143 (E.D.Mich.1976); Wright v. Raines, 1 Kan.App.2d 494, 500-501, 571 P.2d 26, 31-32 (1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 933 (1978). Similarly, the Eighth Circuit has rejected the contention that such regulations are valid as a matter of law, and has affirmed a decision finding violative of the Free Exercise Clause an Iowa rule that prevented an American Indian prisoner from wearing long braided hair. Teterud v. Burns, 522 F.2d 357, 362 (1975 ) (rejecting language in Proffitt v. Ciccone, 506 F.2d 1020 (CA8 1974)). Other courts have upheld similar free exercise claims. See Wright v. Raines, 457 F.Supp. 1082 (D.C.Kan.1978); Moskowitz v. Wilkinson, 432 F. Supp. 947 (Conn.1977) (Orthodox Jew); Monroe v. Bombard, 422 F.Supp. 211, 217-218 (S.D.N.Y.1976); Maguire v. Wilkinson, 405 F.Supp. 637 (Conn.1975). 
 While a decision based on evidentiary proof may well result in a finding that petitioner's religious beliefs are not sincere,2 or that the State's interests are sufficient to justify the restriction imposed on petitioner's professed religious practice, I am [442 U.S. 922 , 924]

Ruling that ""reasonable opportunities must be afforded to all prisoners to exercise the religious freedom guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments without fear of penalty,"" id., at 322 n. 2, the Court remanded the case for a hearing on the merits. See also Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546 (1964).

 Whatever validity the Fifth Circuit's Brooks rule may once have had, it has been severely undercut by Cruz and the subsequent cases that have reaffirmed the principle that prison regulations are subject to constitutional scrutiny. See Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Union, 433 U.S. 119 (1977); Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977); Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974). Citing Cruz and Martinez, the Second Circuit has rejected Brooks and held that a prisoner challenging prison grooming regulations on free exercise grounds is entitled to a hearing on the reasonableness of the prison's regulations. Burgin v. Henderson, 536 F.2d 501, 504, and n. 8 (CA2 1976). Accord: Jihaad v. Carlson, 410 F.Supp. 1132, 1143 (E.D.Mich.1976); Wright v. Raines, 1 Kan.App.2d 494, 500-501, 571 P.2d 26, 31-32 (1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 933 (1978). Similarly, the Eighth Circuit has rejected the contention that such regulations are valid as a matter of law, and has affirmed a decision finding violative of the Free Exercise Clause an Iowa rule that prevented an American Indian prisoner from wearing long braided hair. Teterud v. Burns, 522 F.2d 357, 362 (1975 ) (rejecting language in Proffitt v. Ciccone, 506 F.2d 1020 (CA8 1974)). Other courts have upheld similar free exercise claims. See Wright v. Raines, 457 F.Supp. 1082 (D.C.Kan.1978); Moskowitz v. Wilkinson, 432 F. Supp. 947 (Conn.1977) (Orthodox Jew); Monroe v. Bombard, 422 F.Supp. 211, 217-218 (S.D.N.Y.1976); Maguire v. Wilkinson, 405 F.Supp. 637 (Conn.1975). 
 While a decision based on evidentiary proof may well result in a finding that petitioner's religious beliefs are not sincere,2 or that the State's interests are sufficient to justify the restriction imposed on petitioner's professed religious practice, I am [442 U.S. 922 , 924]

Federal Reserve System v. Merrill
No. 77-1387
Argued December 6. 1978
Decided June 2, 1979
443 U.S. 340

Syllabus 
This case presents the question whether the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is violated by petitioner's practice, authorized by regulation, 12 CFR  271.5 (1978), of withholding certain monetary policy directives from the public during the month they are in effect, such directives being published in full in the Federal Register at the end of the month.  To implement its authority to conduct open market operations of the Federal Reserve System, petitioner has established a combined investment pool for all Federal Reserve banks, administered by the Account Manager.  Petitioner meets approximately once a month to review the overall state of the economy and consider the appropriate course of monetary and open market policy.  Its principal conclusions are embodied in a ""Domestic Policy Directive,"" which indicates in general terms whether petitioner wishes to follow an expansionary, deflationary, or unchanged monetary policy in the period ahead, and which includes specific tolerance ranges for the growth in the money supply and for the federal funds rate.  The Account Manager is guided by the Domestic Policy Directive in his transactions with dealers who trade in Government securities.  A Domestic Policy Directive exists as a document for approximately one month before it appears in the Federal Register, by which time it has been supplanted by a new Directive. Respondent, who had been denied immediate access under the FOIA to certain records of petitioner's policy actions, instituted suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against the operation of 12 CFR  271.5 and the policy of delayed disclosure.  Without expressly considering petitioner's contention that immediate disclosure of Domestic Policy Directives and tolerance ranges would interfere with the conduct of national monetary policy, the District Court entered judgment for respondent, holding, inter alia, that the Directives were ""statements of general policy"" which, under the FOIA, had to be ""currently"" published in the Federal Register; that the 1-month delay failed to satisfy the current publication requirement.; and that the Directives could not be withheld under Exemption 5 of the FOIA, which applies to documents that are
""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be 
Page 443 U. S. 341
 available by law to a party . . . in litigation with the agency.""
The Court of Appeals affirmed, also expressing no opinion about petitioner's assertion that immediate disclosure of Domestic Policy Directives and tolerance ranges would seriously interfere with the conduct of national monetary policy.
Held:
1. Petitioner's Domestic Policy Directives are ""intra-agency memorandums"" within the meaning of Exemption 5 of the FOIA.  Petitioner is clearly an ""agency"" as that term is defined in the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Directives are essentially petitioner's written instructions to the Account Manager, a subordinate official of the agency.  The instructions are binding only upon the Account Manager, and neither establish rules that govern the adjudication of individual rights nor require particular conduct or forbearance by any member of the public.  Pp.  443 U. S. 352-353.
2. Although Exemption 5 does not confer general authority upon an agency, without regard to any privilege enjoyed by the Government in the civil discovery context, to delay disclosure of intra-agency memorandums that would undermine the effectiveness of the agency's policy if released immediately, nevertheless Exemption 5 does incorporate a qualified privilege for confidential commercial information, at least to the extent that this information is generated by the Government itself in the process leading up to awarding a contract.  See Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 26(c) (7).  Pp.  443 U. S. 353-360.
3. Although petitioner's Domestic Policy Directives can fairly be described as containing confidential commercial information generated in the process of awarding a contract, it does not necessarily follow that they would be protected against immediate disclosure in the civil discovery process.  If the Directives contain sensitive information not otherwise available, and if immediate release of the Directives would significantly harm the Government's monetary functions or commercial interests, then a slight delay in the publication of the Directives, such as that authorized by 12 CFR  271.5, would be permitted under Exemption 5.  Determination of whether, or to what extent, the Directives would in fact be afforded protection in civil discovery must await the development of a proper record on remand.  If the District Court concludes that the Directives would be afforded protection, then it should also consider whether the operative portions of the Directives can feasibly be segregated from the purely descriptive materials therein, and the latter made subject to disclosure or publication without delay.

No. 78-201
Argued January 17, 1979
Decided May 29, 1979
442 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Under Nebraska statutes, a prison inmate becomes eligible for discretionary parole when his minimum term, less good-time credits, has been served.  Hearings are conducted in two stages to determine whether to grant or deny parole:  initial review hearings and final parole hearings.  Initial review hearings must be held at least once a year for every inmate.  At the first stage, the Board of Parole examines the inmate's preconfinement and postconfinement record, and holds an informal hearing; the Board interviews the inmate and considers any letters or statements presented in support of a claim for release.  If the Board determines that the inmate is not yet a good risk for release, it denies parole, stating why release was deferred.  If the Board determines that the inmate is a likely candidate for release, a final hearing is scheduled, at which the inmate may present evidence, call witnesses, and be represented by counsel.  A written statement of the reasons is given if parole is denied.  One section of the statutes ( 83-1,114(1)) provides that the Board ""shall"" order an inmate's release unless it concludes that his release should be deferred for at least one of four specified reasons.  Respondent inmates, who had been denied parole, brought a class action in Federal District Court, 
Page 442 U. S. 2
 which upheld their claim that the Board's procedures denied them procedural due process.  The Court of Appeals, agreeing, held that the inmates had the same kind of constitutionally protected ""conditional liberty"" interest as was recognized in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, also found a statutorily defined, protectible interest in  83-1, 114(1), and required, inter alia, that a formal hearing be held for every inmate eligible for parole and that every adverse parole decision include a statement of the evidence relied upon by the Board.
Held:
1. A reasonable entitlement to due process is not created merely because a State provides for the possibility of parole, such possibility providing no more than a mere hope that the benefit will be obtained.  Parole revocation, for which certain due process standards must be met, Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, entails deprivation of a liberty one has, and is a decision involving initially a wholly retrospective factual question as to whether the parolee violated his parole.  Parole release involves denial of a liberty desired by inmates, and that decision depends on an amalgam of elements, some factual, but many purely subjective evaluations by the Board.  Pp.  442 U. S. 9-11.
2. While the language and structure of  83-1,114(1) provides a mechanism for parole that is entitled to some constitutional protection, the Nebraska procedure provides all the process due with respect to the discretionary parole decision.  Pp.  442 U. S. 11-16.
(a) The formal hearing required by the Court of Appeals would provide, at best, a negligible decrease in the risk of error.  Since the Board of Parole's decision at its initial review hearing is one that must be made largely on the basis of the inmate's file, this procedure adequately safeguards against serious risks of error, and thus satisfies due process.  Pp.  442 U. S. 14-15.
(b) Nothing in due process concepts requires the Board to specify the particular ""evidence"" in the inmate's file or at his interview on which it rests its discretionary determination to deny release.  The Nebraska procedure affords an opportunity to be heard, and, when parole is denied, it informs the inmate in what respects he falls short of qualifying for parole; this affords all the process that is due in these circumstances, nothing more being required by the Constitution.

Respondent was discharged by his employer, the Union Pacific Railroad Co., for failing properly to request an extension of his medical leave of absence.

Syllabus 
Respondents were convicted, after a joint trial in a Tennessee court, of murder committed during the commission of a robbery.  None of the respondents took the witness stand, and their oral confessions, found by the trial court to have been freely and voluntarily given, were admitted into evidence through police officers' testimony.  Respondent Pickens' written confession was also admitted into evidence over his objection that it had been obtained in violation of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  The trial court instructed the jury that each confession could be used only against the defendant who gave it and could not be considered as evidence of a codefendant's guilt.  Ultimately, the Tennessee Supreme Court upheld the convictions, holding that admission of respondents' confessions did not violate the rule of Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123, which held that a defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment were violated by the admission, at a joint trial, of the confession of a codefendant who did not take the stand.  Respondents subsequently obtained writs of habeas corpus in a Federal District Court, which held that respondents' rights under Bruton had been violated, and that introduction of respondent Pickens' written confession had violated his rights under Miranda.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed as to respondent Pickens and reversed as to the other respondents.  Pp.  442 U. S. 69-77;  442 U. S. 77-81.
575 F.2d 1178, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and III, concluding that, since the grant of certiorari was limited to the Bruton issue, the Court had no occasion to pass on the merits of the ruling that respondent Pickens' rights under Miranda had been violated.  Pp.  442 U. S. 76-77.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concluded, in Part II, that admission of respondents' confessions with proper limiting jury instructions did 
Page 442 U. S. 63
 not infringe respondents' right of confrontation secured by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  442 U. S. 69-76.
(a) In Bruton, introduction at a joint trial of a nontestifying codefendant's confession had a ""devastating"" effect on the nonconfessing defendant's case.  Introduction of such incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant will seldom, if ever, have the same ""devastating"" consequences to a defendant who has himself confessed.  The constitutional right of cross-examination protected by Bruton has far less practical value to a defendant who has confessed to the crime than to one who has consistently maintained his innocence.  Pp.  442 U. S. 72-73.
(b) Nor does the natural ""motivation to shift blame onto others,"" recognized in Bruton to render the incriminating statements of codefendants ""inevitably suspect,"" require application of the Bruton rule when the incriminated defendant has corroborated his codefendant's statements by heaping blame onto himself.  P.  442 U. S. 73.
(c) The Confrontation Clause does not bar admission into evidence of every relevant extrajudicial statement by a nontestifying declarant simply because it in some way incriminates the defendant.

			"|"Parker v. Randolph
No. 78-99
Argued March 20, 1979
Decided May 29, 1979
442 U.S. 62

Syllabus 
Respondents were convicted, after a joint trial in a Tennessee court, of murder committed during the commission of a robbery.  None of the respondents took the witness stand, and their oral confessions, found by the trial court to have been freely and voluntarily given, were admitted into evidence through police officers' testimony.  Respondent Pickens' written confession was also admitted into evidence over his objection that it had been obtained in violation of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  The trial court instructed the jury that each confession could be used only against the defendant who gave it and could not be considered as evidence of a codefendant's guilt.  Ultimately, the Tennessee Supreme Court upheld the convictions, holding that admission of respondents' confessions did not violate the rule of Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123, which held that a defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment were violated by the admission, at a joint trial, of the confession of a codefendant who did not take the stand.  Respondents subsequently obtained writs of habeas corpus in a Federal District Court, which held that respondents' rights under Bruton had been violated, and that introduction of respondent Pickens' written confession had violated his rights under Miranda.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed as to respondent Pickens and reversed as to the other respondents.  Pp.  442 U. S. 69-77;  442 U. S. 77-81.
575 F.2d 1178, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and III, concluding that, since the grant of certiorari was limited to the Bruton issue, the Court had no occasion to pass on the merits of the ruling that respondent Pickens' rights under Miranda had been violated.  Pp.  442 U. S. 76-77.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concluded, in Part II, that admission of respondents' confessions with proper limiting jury instructions did 
Page 442 U. S. 63
 not infringe respondents' right of confrontation secured by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  442 U. S. 69-76.
(a) In Bruton, introduction at a joint trial of a nontestifying codefendant's confession had a ""devastating"" effect on the nonconfessing defendant's case.  Introduction of such incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant will seldom, if ever, have the same ""devastating"" consequences to a defendant who has himself confessed.  The constitutional right of cross-examination protected by Bruton has far less practical value to a defendant who has confessed to the crime than to one who has consistently maintained his innocence.  Pp.  442 U. S. 72-73.
(b) Nor does the natural ""motivation to shift blame onto others,"" recognized in Bruton to render the incriminating statements of codefendants ""inevitably suspect,"" require application of the Bruton rule when the incriminated defendant has corroborated his codefendant's statements by heaping blame onto himself.  P.  442 U. S. 73.
(c) The Confrontation Clause does not bar admission into evidence of every relevant extrajudicial statement by a nontestifying declarant simply because it in some way incriminates the defendant.  And an instruction directing the jury to consider a codefendant's extrajudicial statement only against its source is generally sufficient to avoid offending the implicated defendant's confrontation right.  Pp.  442 U. S. 73-74.
(d) When the defendant's own confession is properly before the jury, as here, the possible prejudice resulting from the jury's failure to follow the trial court's instructions is not so ""devastating"" or ""vital"" to the confessing defendant as to require departure from the general rule allowing admission of evidence with limiting instructions.  Pp.  442 U. S. 74-75.

No. 78-5944
Decided May 29, 1979
442 U.S. 95

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who was indicted with one Moore for rape and murder, was tried separately in a Georgia state court.  After the jury determined that petitioner was guilty of murder, a second proceeding was held to decide whether capital punishment would be imposed, and petitioner attempted to introduce the testimony of a third person, who had testified for the State at Moore's earlier trial (wherein Moore was convicted of both crimes and sentenced to death), to the effect that Moore had confided to the witness that Moore had killed the victim, shooting her twice after ordering petitioner to run an errand.  The trial court refused to admit the testimony, ruling that it constituted inadmissible hearsay under Georgia law.  The petitioner was sentenced to death, and the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentence.
Held:  Regardless of whether the proffered testimony comes within Georgia's hearsay rule, under the facts of this case, its exclusion constituted a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, denying petitioner a fair trial on the issue of punishment, and thus requiring that the sentence be vacated.  The excluded testimony was highly relevant to a critical issue in the punishment phase of the trial, and substantial reasons existed to assume its reliability.  Perhaps most important, the State considered the testimony sufficiently reliable to use it against Moore and to base a death sentence upon it.
Certiorari granted; 242 Ga. 261, 249 S.E.2d 1, reversed and remanded.

My difficulty with the Court's action, and with the action of Judge Tuttle in granting a stay in this case, undoubtedly stems from the six years of litigation revolving about the question of whether the State of Florida is entitled to impose the death sentence on respondent. This procedural history is set forth in detail in my May 22 chambers opinion in which I denied respondent's application for a stay. 442 U.S. 1301. The stay occasioning the instant motion is, in my view, the product of a clear abuse of the writ of habeas corpus, and I am concerned that this Court's action implicitly sanctions the use of such tactics to frustrate the attempts of the State to effectuate the will of its citizens. 
 Mr. Justice REHNQUIST reserves the right to file a written statement at a future date. 
 May 25, 1979. On Motion to Vacate Stay of Execution. 
 Attorneys representing defendants under sentence of death have a difficult and arduous task to perform, but in seeking stays of execution they need devote little time to the oft-litigated issue of ""irreparable injury."" ""[D]eath is a punishment different from all other sanctions in kind rather than degree."" Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 303- 304 (1976) (opinion of STEWART, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.). The irreversible nature of the penalty makes irreparable by definition any injury inflicted in violation of the United States Constitution. But because imposition of the death penalty is irreversible, I respectfully suggest that there may be a tendency on the part of individual judges or courts exercising the extraordinary writ authority conferred upon them by 28 U.S.C. 1651 not merely to resolve all constitutional questions fairly admitting of doubt in favor of a federal habeas petitioner under sentence of death, but to create or assume such doubts where in fact there are none.

 Applicants seek a stay of an order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois enjoining the State of Illinois from refusing to fund under its medical assistance programs medically necessary abortions performed prior to viability. 
 The plaintiffs in this action are a class of pregnant women eligible for Illinois medical assistance programs for whom an abortion is medically necessary and a class of physicians who perform such procedures and are certified to receive reimbursement for necessary medical services. Their complaint alleged that the Illinois statute, 1977 Ill.Laws, Pub. Act 80- 1091, 1, denying reimbursement for medically necessary abortions vio-

 lated their rights under both the Social Security Act and the Fourteenth Amendment. After the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the District Court's initial decision to abstain, 572 F.2d 582, the District Judge held that the Illinois statute violated the federal Social Security Act and its implementing regulations, since Illinois' funding of only ""life-preserving"" abortions fell short of the federal statutory responsibility to ""establish reasonable standards"" for providing medically necessary treatment. The court rejected the argument that the Hyde Amendment's 1 prohibition of federal funding of certain categories of abortions limited the state's statutory responsibility, and entered an injunction requiring Illinois to fund medically necessary abortions. The Court of Appeals, after denying a stay of the injunction pending appeal, reversed the District Court decision. The Court of Appeals concluded that the Hyde Amendment was not simply a limitation on the use of federal funds for abortions, but was itself a substantive amendment to the obligations imposed upon the State by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq. The court recognized the constitutional questions raised by its interpretation, and remanded to the District Court with instructions to consider the constitutionality of both the Illinois statute and the Hyde Amendment. 
 The District Court held both provisions to be unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. While rejecting the argument that strict scrutiny was appropriate, Judge Grady [442 U.S. 1309 , 1311]

 May 22, 1979.

 This application for stay has come to me by reason of the unavailability of Mr. Justice POWELL. On December 20, 1973, following a trial and jury verdict, applicant was sentenced to death pursuant to the Florida statute that we upheld in Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242, 96 S. Ct. 2960 (1976), for a murder committed in February 1973. On applicant's appeal, the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed both the conviction and sentence, Spenkelink v. State, 313 So.2d 666 (1975), and this Court denied certiorari. 428 U.S. 911 (1976). Applicant next sought executive clemency from the Governor of Florida, but his request for that relief was denied on September 12, 1977, and at the same time the Governor signed a death warrant setting applicant's execution for 8:30 a. m. on September 19, 1977. The following day, applicant filed a motion 
Page 442 U.S. 1301 , 1302
 collateral relief in the Florida trial court that had convicted him; this motion, too, was denied, the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed its denial, Spenkelink v. State, 350 So.2d 85 (1977), and we again denied certiorari. 434 U.S. 960 (1977). 
 One day after he filed his petition for collateral relief in state court, however, applicant filed a petition for federal habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, which transferred the case to the Northern District of Florida. That court stayed the execution and scheduled an evidentiary hearing for September 21, 1977. At that time a hearing was held, which lasted from the late morning into the evening and produced over 300 pages of testimony. On September 23, the District Court dismissed the petition and ordered that the stay of execution previously issued by it terminate at noon on September 30. But the District Court also granted applicant a certificate of probable cause to appeal, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit then stayed applicant's execution pending its decision of his appeal. 
 On August 21, 1978, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court. Spenkelink v. Wainwright, 578 F.2d 582. In an opinion comprising 39 pages in the Federal Reporter, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dealt at length with all of applicant's claims, which had previously been rejected by the United States District Court and by the Supreme Court of Florida. It affirmed the judgment of the District Court, and we again denied certiorari on March 26, 1979, with Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL dissenting on the basis of their views set forth in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 231, 2950, 2971, 2973d 859 (1976). 440 U.S. 976.

 John A. SPENKELINK, Applicant,v. Louie L. WAINWRIGHT et al.No. A-1016. 
 May 22, 1979.

 This application for stay has come to me by reason of the unavailability of Mr. Justice POWELL. On December 20, 1973, following a trial and jury verdict, applicant was sentenced to death pursuant to the Florida statute that we upheld in Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242, 96 S. Ct. 2960 (1976), for a murder committed in February 1973. On applicant's appeal, the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed both the conviction and sentence, Spenkelink v. State, 313 So.2d 666 (1975), and this Court denied certiorari. 428 U.S. 911 (1976). Applicant next sought executive clemency from the Governor of Florida, but his request for that relief was denied on September 12, 1977, and at the same time the Governor signed a death warrant setting applicant's execution for 8:30 a. m. on September 19, 1977. The following day, applicant filed a motion 
Page 442 U.S. 1301 , 1302
 collateral relief in the Florida trial court that had convicted him; this motion, too, was denied, the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed its denial, Spenkelink v. State, 350 So.2d 85 (1977), and we again denied certiorari. 434 U.S. 960 (1977). 
 One day after he filed his petition for collateral relief in state court, however, applicant filed a petition for federal habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, which transferred the case to the Northern District of Florida. That court stayed the execution and scheduled an evidentiary hearing for September 21, 1977. At that time a hearing was held, which lasted from the late morning into the evening and produced over 300 pages of testimony. On September 23, the District Court dismissed the petition and ordered that the stay of execution previously issued by it terminate at noon on September 30. But the District Court also granted applicant a certificate of probable cause to appeal, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit then stayed applicant's execution pending its decision of his appeal. 
 On August 21, 1978, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court. Spenkelink v. Wainwright, 578 F.2d 582. In an opinion comprising 39 pages in the Federal Reporter, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dealt at length with all of applicant's claims, which had previously been rejected by the United States District Court and by the Supreme Court of Florida. It affirmed the judgment of the District Court, and we again denied certiorari on March 26, 1979, with Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL dissenting on the basis of their views set forth in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 231, 2950, 2971, 2973d 859 (1976). 440 U.S. 976. 
 According to the application now before me, the Governor of Florida again denied executive clemency on Friday, May 18, 1979, and signed a death warrant authorizing the execution of [442 U.S. 1301 , 1303]

No. 78-275

Decided May 21, 1979
441 U.S. 750

Syllabus 
Section 14(b) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) provides that in the case of an alleged unlawful practice occurring in a State which has a law prohibiting discrimination in employment because of age and authorizing a state authority to grant and seek relief from such discriminatory practice, no suit may be brought under  7(c) of the ADEA before the expiration of 60 days after proceedings have been commenced under the state law, unless such proceedings have been earlier terminated.  Section 14(b) also provides that, if any requirement for the commencement of such proceedings is imposed by a state authority other than a requirement of a filing of a written and signed statement of the facts upon which the proceeding is based, the proceeding shall be deemed to have been commenced for the purposes of  14(b) at the time such statement is sent by registered mail to the appropriate state authority.  Respondent, who had been involuntarily retired after 23 years of employment by petitioner company, filed with the United States Department of Labor a notice of intent to sue the company under the ADEA, charging that he had been forced to retire because of his age in violation of the Act.  Upon respondent's inquiry, the Department informed him that the ADEA contained no requirement that he file a state complaint in order to preserve his federal rights.  After federal conciliation efforts failed, respondent brought suit against petitioner company and company officials in Federal District Court, which denied petitioners' motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the Iowa State Civil Rights Commission was empowered to remedy age discrimination in employment, and that  14(b) required resort to this state remedy prior to the commencement of the federal suit.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Under  14(b), resort to administrative remedies by claimants in States with agencies empowered to remedy age discrimination in employment (deferral States) is mandatory, not optional, and federal suit may not be brought under the ADEA unless the claimant has first commenced a proceeding with the appropriate state agency.  Pp.  441 U. S. 754-758.
(a) Since the ADEA and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
Page 441 U. S. 751
 share the common purpose of the elimination of discrimination in the workplace, since the language of  14(b) is almost in haec verba with  706(c) of Title VII, which has been interpreted to require individuals in deferral States to resort to appropriate state proceedings before bringing suit under Title VII, and since the legislative history of  14(b) indicates that its source was  706(c), it may be properly concluded that Congress intended that the construction of  14(b) should follow that of  706(c).  Pp.  441 U. S. 755-756.
(b) Claimants do not have the option to ignore state remedies merely because under the ADEA, unlike Title VII, they may file with state and federal agencies simultaneously.  The ADEA permits concurrent, rather than sequential, state and federal administrative jurisdiction in order to expedite the processing and settling of age discrimination claims, and thus the possibility of concurrent state and federal cognizance does not support the construction of  14(b) that ADEA grievants may ignore state remedies altogether.  A Committee Report accompanying 1978 ADEA amendments which suggested that resort to state remedies should be optional under  14(b) is insufficient to overcome the clear and convincing evidence that Congress, in 1967, intended  14(b) to have the same meaning as  706(c).  Pp.  441 U. S. 756-758.
2. However, a grievant is not required by  14(b) to commence state proceedings within time limits specified by state law.  Pp.  441 U. S. 758-764.
(a) By its terms,  14(b) requires only that state proceedings be ""commenced"" 60 days before federal litigation is instituted, and use of the word ""commenced"" strongly implies that state limitations periods are irrelevant.  This implication is made express by the provision in  14(b) that, if a state authority imposes requirements ""other than a requirement of the filing of a written and signed statement of the facts upon which the proceeding is based,"" the proceeding shall be deemed to have been commenced for purposes of 14(b) at the time such statement is sent by registered mail to the appropriate state authority.  State limitations periods are requirements other than that specified in  14(b) and, thus, even if a State were to make timeliness a precondition for commencement, a state proceeding will be deemed commenced for purposes of  14(b) as soon as the complaint is filed.  Pp.  441 U. S. 759-760.
(b) This construction of the statute is consistent both with the ADEA's remedial purposes and with the purposes of  14(b), which does not stipulate an exhaustion requirement, but is intended only to give state agencies a limited opportunity to settle the grievances of ADEA claimants in a voluntary and localized manner so that the grievants thereafter have no need or desire for independent federal relief.  
Page 441 U. S. 752
 The ADEA's structure -- setting forth limitations periods in explicit terms in  7(d) and(e), not  14(b) -- reinforces the conclusion that state procedural defaults cannot foreclose federal relief, and that state limitations periods cannot govern the efficacy of the federal remedy.  Pp.  441 U. S. 761-764.
3. Even though Iowa's 120-day statute of limitations has run, respondent may yet comply with the requirements of  14(b) by simply filing a signed complaint with the Iowa State Civil Rights Commission.  That Commission must be given an opportunity to entertain respondent's grievance before his federal litigation can continue.  Meanwhile the federal suit should be held in abeyance, rather than be dismissed with leave to refile, because respondent has already filed a timely federal complaint, and to require a second filing would serve no purpose other than the creation of an additional procedural technicality.  If respondent's state complaint is subsequently dismissed as untimely, he may then return to federal court; but until that happens, or until 60 days have passed without a settlement, respondent must pursue his state remedy.  Pp.  441 U. S. 764-765.

No. 78-561
Argued March 26, 1979
Decided May 21, 1979
441 U.S. 768

Syllabus 
Respondent engaged in a fraudulent ""short selling"" scheme, by placing orders with brokers to sell certain shares of stock which he believed had peaked in price and which he falsely represented that he owned.  Gambling that the price would decline substantially before he was required to deliver the securities, he planned to make offsetting purchases through other brokers at lower prices.  But the market price rose sharply before the delivery date, so that respondent was unable to make covering purchases and never delivered the securities.  Consequently, the brokers were unable to deliver the securities to the investor purchasers, and were forced to borrow stock to make the delivery.  In order to return the borrowed stock, the brokers had to purchase replacement shares on the open market at the now higher prices, a process known as ""buying in.""  While the investors were thereby shielded from direct injury, the brokers suffered substantial financial losses.  The District Court found respondent guilty of employing ""a scheme and artifice to defraud"" in the sale of securities in violation of  17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, which makes it unlawful ""for any person in the offer or sale of any securities . . . directly or indirectly . . . to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud.""  The Court of Appeals, while finding the evidence sufficient to establish that respondent had committed fraud, vacated the conviction on the ground that the purpose of the Securities Act was to protect investors from fraudulent practices in the sale of securities, and that, since respondent's fraud injured only brokers, and not investors, respondent did not violate  17(a)(1).
Held:  Section 17(a)(1) prohibits frauds against brokers as well as investors.  Pp.  441 U. S. 771-779.
(a) Nothing on the face of  17(a)(1) indicates that it applies solely to frauds directed against investors.  Rather, its language requires only that the fraud occur ""in"" an ""offer or sale"" of securities.  Here, an offer and sale clearly occurred within the meaning of the terms as defined in  2(3) of the Securities Act.  And the fraud occurred ""in"" the ""offer"" and ""sale,"" as the statute does not require that the fraud occur in any particular phase of the selling transaction.  Pp.  441 U. S. 772-773. 
Page 441 U. S. 769

(b) The fat that  17(a)(3) makes it unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit ""upon the purchaser"" does not mean that this latter phrase should be read into  17(a)(1), since each subsection of  17(a) proscribes a distinct category of misconduct.  Pp.  441 U. S. 773-774.
(c) Neither this Court nor Congress has ever suggested that investor protection was the sole purpose of the Securities Act.  While prevention of fraud against investors was a key part of the purpose of the Act, so was the effort ""to achieve a high standard of business ethics . . . in every facet of the securities industry,"" SEC v. Capital Gains Bureau, 375 U. S. 180,  375 U. S. 186-187, and this conclusion is amply supported by the legislative history.  Pp.  441 U. S. 774-776.
(d) Moreover, frauds against brokers may well redound to the detriment of investors.  Although the investors in this case suffered no immediate financial injury, the indirect impact upon investors in such a situation can be substantial.  And direct injury to investors is also possible.  Had the brokers in this case been insolvent or unable to borrow, the investors might have failed to receive their promised shares.  Placing brokers outside the aegis of  17(a)(1) would create a loophole in the statute that Congress did not intend.  Pp.  441 U. S. 776-777.
(e) Although the Securities Act was primarily concerned with the regulation of new offerings of securities, the antifraud prohibition of  17(a) was meant as a major departure from that limitation, and was intended to cover any fraudulent scheme in an offer or sale of securities, whether in the course of an initial distribution or in the course of ordinary market trading.  Accordingly, the fact that respondent's fraud did not involve a new offering does not render  17(a)(1) inapplicable to that fraud.  Pp.  441 U. S. 777-778.
(f) Since the words of  17(a)(1) ""plainly impose"" a penalty for the acts committed in this case, it would be inappropriate to apply the rule that ambiguity as to the scope of a criminal statute should be resolved in favor of lenity.  Pp.  441 U. S. 778-779.

441 U.S. 780

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of a federal drug offense upon a guilty plea.  Upon accepting the plea, the trial judge explained to respondent that he could receive a 15-year prison sentence and a $25,000 fine, but failed to mention a mandatory special parole term of at least 3 years required by the applicable statute.  Respondent was then sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment plus a 5-year special parole term, and fined $5,000.  Subsequently, respondent moved in District Court to vacate the sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2255 on the ground that the trial judge had violated Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 11 by accepting the guilty plea without informing respondent of the mandatory special parole term.  The District Court, while recognizing that a violation of Rule 11 had occurred, held that it did not justify collateral relief under  2255.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a violation of Rule 11 will support a collateral attack on a conviction based on a guilty plea even when there is neither constitutional error nor any showing of special prejudice to the defendant.
Held:  A conviction based on a guilty plea is not subject to collateral attack when all that can be shown is a formal violation of Rule 11.  Such a violation is neither constitutional nor jurisdictional.  Nor can any claim reasonably be made that the error here resulted in a ""complete miscarriage of justice"" or in a proceeding ""inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.""  Hill v. United States, 368 U. S. 424,  368 U. S. 428.  Respondent could have raised his claim on direct appeal but did not, and there is no basis here for allowing collateral attack to do service for an appeal.  Pp.  441 U. S. 783-785.

Respondent was then sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment plus a 5-year special parole term, and fined $5,000.  Subsequently, respondent moved in District Court to vacate the sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2255 on the ground that the trial judge had violated Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 11 by accepting the guilty plea without informing respondent of the mandatory special parole term.  The District Court, while recognizing that a violation of Rule 11 had occurred, held that it did not justify collateral relief under  2255.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a violation of Rule 11 will support a collateral attack on a conviction based on a guilty plea even when there is neither constitutional error nor any showing of special prejudice to the defendant.
Held:  A conviction based on a guilty plea is not subject to collateral attack when all that can be shown is a formal violation of Rule 11.  Such a violation is neither constitutional nor jurisdictional.  Nor can any claim reasonably be made that the error here resulted in a ""complete miscarriage of justice"" or in a proceeding ""inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.""  Hill v. United States, 368 U. S. 424,  368 U. S. 428.  Respondent could have raised his claim on direct appeal but did not, and there is no basis here for allowing collateral attack to do service for an appeal.  Pp.  441 U. S. 783-785.

No. 78-749
Argued April 16, 1979
Decided May 21, 1979
441 U.S. 786

Syllabus 
Upon trial in a Kentucky state court, respondent was convicted of several offenses.  The trial court refused to give respondent's requested jury instruction on the presumption of innocence, but did give an instruction to the effect that the jury could return a guilty verdict only if they found beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent had committed the acts charged with the requisite criminal intent.  Relying on its understanding of Taylor v. Kentucky, 436 U. S. 478 -- where this Court reversed a conviction resulting from a trial in which the judge had refused to give a requested instruction on the presumption of innocence -- the Kentucky Supreme Court held that such an instruction is constitutionally required in all criminal trials, and that the failure of a trial judge to give it cannot be harmless error.
Held:  The Kentucky Supreme Court erred in interpreting Taylor, supra, as holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment absolutely requires that an instruction on the presumption of innocence must be given in every criminal case.  The failure to give such an instruction when requested does not, in and of itself, violate the Constitution.  Under Taylor, such a failure must be evaluated in light of the totality of the circumstances -- including all the instructions, the arguments of counsel, whether the weight of the evidence was overwhelming, and other relevant factors -- to determine whether the defendant received a constitutionally fair trial.

Syllabus 
Respondents, shareholders of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (ICA), brought this derivative suit in Federal District Court against several of the company's directors and its registered investment adviser, alleging that the defendants had violated their duties under the ICA, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (IAA), and the common law in connection with a purchase by the company of the commercial paper of another company.  The investment company's five directors who were neither affiliated with the investment adviser nor defendants in the action, acting as a quorum pursuant to the company's bylaws, concluded that continuation of the litigation was contrary to the best interests of the company, and its shareholders and moved the District Court to dismiss the action.  Finding no evidence that the directors who voted to terminate the suit had acted other than independently and in good faith, the District Court entered summary judgment against respondents.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, because of the ICA, disinterested directors of an investment company have no power to foreclose the continuation of nonfrivolous litigation brought by shareholders against majority directors for breach of their fiduciary duties.
Held:  In suits alleging violations of the ICA and IAA, federal courts should, as a matter of federal law, apply state law governing the authority of independent directors to discontinue derivative suits to the extent such law is consistent with the policies of the ICA and the IAA.  Congress did not require that States, or federal courts, absolutely forbid director termination of all nonfrivolous actions.  Pp.  441 U. S. 475-486.
(a) Assuming, without deciding, that respondents have implied derivative causes of action under the federal Acts, state law cannot operate of its own force.  Instead,
""the overriding federal law applicable here would, where the facts required, control the appropriateness of redress despite the provisions of state corporation law. . . .""
J. I Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426,  377 U. S. 434 (emphasis added). Pp. 475-477.
(b) The fact that the scope of respondents' federal right is a federal question does not, however, make state law irrelevant.  Since the ICA does not purport to be the source of authority for managerial power, 
Page 441 U. S. 472
 but instead functions primarily to impose controls and restrictions on the internal management of investment companies, the ICA and the IAA do not require that federal law displace state laws governing the powers of directors unless the state laws permit action prohibited by the Acts, or unless ""their application would be inconsistent with the federal policy underlying the cause of action. . . .""  Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U. S. 454,  421 U. S. 465.  Pp.  441 U. S. 477-480.
(c) Thus, the threshold inquiry in this case (not determined by either of the courts below) should have been to determine whether state law permitted the disinterested directors to terminate respondents' suit; if so, the next inquiry should have been whether such a state rule was consistent with the policy of the federal Acts.  The Court of Appeals incorrectly implied that the only state law that would be consistent with the ICA would be one which absolutely prohibited the termination of nonfrivolous derivative suits.  Although the Acts may justify some restaints upon the unfettered discretion of even disinterested mutual fund directors, they do not justify a flat rule that directors may never terminate nonfrivolous actions involving codirectors.  The structure and purpose of the ICA indicate that Congress entrusted to the independent directors of investment companies, exercising the authority granted to them by state law, the primary responsibility for looking after the interests of the funds' shareholders.  There may be situations in which the independent directors could reasonably believe that the best interests of the shareholders call for a decision not to sue -- as, for example, where the costs of litigation to the corporation outweigh any potential recovery.  In such cases, it would be consistent with the Act to allow the independent directors to terminate a suit, even though not frivolous.  Pp.  441 U. S. 480-485.

Syllabus 
Petitioner provides its employees with in-plant cafeteria and vending machine services.  The services are managed by an independent caterer, but petitioner has the right to review and approve the quality, quantity, and prices of the food served.  When petitioner notified respondent union, which represents the employees, that the cafeteria and vending machine prices were to be increased, the union requested bargaining over the prices and services.  Petitioner refused to bargain, and the union then filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), alleging a refusal to bargain contrary to  8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  The duty of management and unions to bargain under  8(a)(5) is defined by  8(d) as the obligation to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and ""other terms and conditions of employment.""  Taking its consistent view that in-plant food prices and services are ""other terms and conditions of employment,"" the NLRB sustained the charge and ordered petitioner to bargain.  The Court of Appeals enforced the order.
Held:  In-plant cafeteria and vending machine food and beverage prices and services are ""terms and conditions of employment"" subject to mandatory collective bargaining under  8(a)(5) and 8(d) of the NLRA.  Pp.  441 U. S. 494-503.
(a) Since Congress has assigned to the NLRB the primary task of marking out the scope of the statutory language and duty to bargain, and since the NLRB has special expertise in classifying bargaining subjects as ""terms and conditions of employment,"" its judgment as to what is a mandatory bargaining subject is entitled to considerable deference.  Pp.  441 U. S. 494-496.
(b) The NLRB's judgment is subject to judicial review, but if its construction of the statute is reasonably defensible, it should not be rejected merely because the courts might prefer another view of the statute.  Here, the NLRB's view is not an unreasonable or unprincipled construction of the statute and should be accepted and enforced.  Pp.  441 U. S. 497-498. 
Page 441 U. S. 489

(c) Including within  8(d) the prices of in-plant-supplied food and beverages serves the ends of the NLRA by funneling an area of common dispute between employers and employees into collective bargaining.  Pp.  441 U. S. 498-500
(d) In-plant food prices and services are an aspect of the relationship between petitioner and its employees, and no third-party interest is directly implicated.  Therefore, the standard applied in Chemical & Alkali Workers v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., 404 U. S. 157, as to whether the third-party concern ""vitally affects"" the ""terms and conditions"" of the bargaining unit employees' employment, has no application.  Pp.  441 U. S. 500-501.
(e) Petitioner's argument that in-plant food prices and services are too trivial to qualify as mandatory bargaining subjects is without merit, especially where both the NLRB and the bargaining unit employees have taken a contrary view.  P.  441 U. S. 501.
(f) Problems created by constantly shifting food prices can be anticipated and provided for in the collective bargaining agreement.  To the extent that disputes are likely to be frequent and intense, more, not less, collective bargaining is the remedy.  Pp.  441 U. S. 501-502.
(g) To require petitioner to bargain over in-plant food service prices is not futile.  Although the prices are set by the third-party caterer, petitioner retains the right to review and control such prices.  In any event, an employer can always affect prices by initiating or altering a subsidy to a third-party supplier, such as that provided by petitioner in this case, and will typically have the right to change suppliers in the future.

No. 78-488
Argued March 27, 1979
Decided May 14, 1979
441 U.S. 506

Syllabus 
The Government initiated condemnation proceedings to acquire land on which respondent, a private nonprofit organization, operated summer camps.  Before trial, respondent rejected the Government's offer to pay the fair market value of the property, demanding instead the cost of developing functionally equivalent substitute facilities at a new site.  The District Court held that the ""substitute facilities"" measure of compensation was available only to governmental condemnees, and that respondent therefore was entitled only to the fair market value of its property.  On interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that private nonprofit owners can obtain substitute facilities compensation if there is no ""ready market"" for the condemned property and if the facilities are ""reasonably necessary to public welfare.""  At trial, the jury found that respondent was not entitled to such compensation and awarded the fair market value of the property.  The Court of Appeals again reversed, concluding that a new trial was required because of erroneous jury instructions on the ""reasonable necessity"" requirement.
Held:  Allowing respondent the fair market value of its property, rather than the cost of substitute facilities, is consistent with the principles of fairness underlying the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  441 U. S. 510-517.
(a) In giving content to the just compensation requirement of the Fifth Amendment, this Court has sought to put the owner of condemned property ""in as good a position pecuniarily as if his property had not been taken,"" Olson v. United States, 292 U. S. 246,  292 U. S. 255.  But this principle of indemnity has not been given its full and literal force.  Because of serious practical difficulties in assessing the worth an individual places on particular property, the Court has resorted to the concept of fair market value -- what a willing buyer would pay in cash to a willing seller at the time of the taking -- even though this measure does not encompass all values an owner may derive from his property.  However, when market value is too difficult to ascertain, or when such 
Page 441 U. S. 507
 an award would depart too far from the indemnity principle, other standards of compensation are appropriate.  United States v. Commodities Trading Corp., 339 U. S. 121,  339 U. S. 123.  Pp.  441 U. S. 510-513.
(b) Here, there are no circumstances that require suspension of the normal rules for determining just compensation.  Respondent's property had a readily discernible market value.  And an award reflecting that figure would not be unjust simply because it might preclude continuation of respondent's use.  This Court has previously held that nontransferable values arising from the owner's unique need for the property are not compensable.  That respondent is a nonprofit organization does not require a different result.  Nor is it relevant whether respondent's camps were reasonably necessary to the public welfare, since respondent is under no legal or factual obligation to replace the camps, regardless of their social worth.  And that the camps may have benefited the community does not warrant compensating respondent differently from other private owners, for the principle of indemnity focuses exclusively on the owner's loss.  To the extent that denial of an award for the use value of respondent's property departs from the indemnity principle, it is justified by the necessity for a workable measure of valuation.  Pp.  441 U. S. 513-517.

 an award would depart too far from the indemnity principle, other standards of compensation are appropriate.  United States v. Commodities Trading Corp., 339 U. S. 121,  339 U. S. 123.  Pp.  441 U. S. 510-513.
(b) Here, there are no circumstances that require suspension of the normal rules for determining just compensation.  Respondent's property had a readily discernible market value.  And an award reflecting that figure would not be unjust simply because it might preclude continuation of respondent's use.  This Court has previously held that nontransferable values arising from the owner's unique need for the property are not compensable.  That respondent is a nonprofit organization does not require a different result.  Nor is it relevant whether respondent's camps were reasonably necessary to the public welfare, since respondent is under no legal or factual obligation to replace the camps, regardless of their social worth.  And that the camps may have benefited the community does not warrant compensating respondent differently from other private owners, for the principle of indemnity focuses exclusively on the owner's loss.  To the extent that denial of an award for the use value of respondent's property departs from the indemnity principle, it is justified by the necessity for a workable measure of valuation.  Pp.  441 U. S. 513-517.

Syllabus 
Respondent inmates brought this class action in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of numerous conditions of confinement and practices in the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), a federally operated short-term custodial facility in New York City designed primarily to house pretrial detainees.  The District Court, on various constitutional grounds, enjoined, inter alia, the practice of housing, primarily for sleeping purposes, two inmates in individual rooms originally intended for single occupancy (""double-bunking""); enforcement of the so-called ""publisher only"" rule prohibiting inmates from receiving hard-cover books that are not mailed directly from publishers, book clubs, or bookstores; the prohibition against inmates' receipt of packages of food and personal items from outside the institution; the practice of body cavity searches of inmates following contact visits with persons from outside the institution; and the requirement that pretrial detainees remain outside their rooms during routine inspections by MCC officials. The Court of Appeals affirmed these rulings, holding with respect to the ""double-bunking"" practice that the MCC had failed to make a showing of ""compelling necessity"" sufficient to justify such practice.
Held:
1. The ""double-bunking"" practice does not deprive pretrial detainees of their liberty without due process of law in contravention of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  441 U. S. 530-543.
(a) There is no source in the Constitution for the Court of Appeals' ""compelling necessity"" standard.  Neither the presumption of innocence, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, nor a pretrial detainee's right to be free from punishment provides any basis for such standard.  Pp.  441 U. S. 531-535.
(b) In evaluating the constitutionality of conditions or restrictions of pretrial detention that implicate only the protection against deprivation of liberty without due process of law, the proper inquiry is whether those conditions or restrictions amount to punishment of the detainee.  Absent a showing of an expressed intent to punish, if a particular condition or restriction is reasonably related to a legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective, it does not, without more, amount to ""punishment,"" but, conversely, if a condition or restriction is arbitrary or purposeless, 
Page 441 U. S. 521
 a court may permissibly infer that the purpose of the governmental action is punishment that may not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees qua detainees.  In addition to ensuring the detainees' presence at trial, the effective management of the detention facility once the individual is confined is a valid objective that may justify imposition of conditions and restrictions of pretrial detention and dispel any inference that such conditions and restrictions are intended as punishment.  Pp.  441 U. S. 535-540.
(c) Judged by the above analysis and on the record, ""double-bunking"" as practiced at the MCC did not, as a matter of law, amount to punishment, and hence did not violate respondents' rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  While ""double-bunking"" may have taxed some of the equipment or particular facilities in certain of the common areas in the MCC, this does not mean that the conditions at the MCC failed to meet the standards required by the Constitution, particularly where it appears that nearly all pretrial detainees are released within 60 days.  Pp.  441 U. S. 541-543.
2. Nor do the ""publisher only"" rule, body cavity searches, the prohibition against the receipt of packages, or the room search rule violate any constitutional guarantees.  Pp.  441 U. S. 544-562.
(a) Simply because prison inmates retain certain constitutional rights does not mean that these rights are not subject to restrictions and limitations.  There must be a ""mutual accommodation between institutional needs and objectives and the provisions of the Constitution that are of general application,"" Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539,  418 U. S. 556, and this principle applies equally to pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners.  Maintaining institutional security and preserving internal order and discipline are essential goals that may require limitation or retraction of the retained constitutional rights of both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees.  Since problems that arise in the day-to-day operation of a corrections facility are not susceptible of easy solutions, prison administrators should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that, in their judgment, are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.  Pp.  441 U. S. 544-548.
(b) The ""publisher only"" rule does not violate the First Amendment rights of MCC inmates but is a rational response by prison officials to the obvious security problem of preventing the smuggling of contraband in books sent from outside.  Moreover, such rule operates in a neutral fashion, without regard to the content of the expression, there are alternative means of obtaining reading material, and the rule's impact on pretrial detainees is limited to a maximum period of approximately 60 days.  Pp.  441 U. S. 548-552. 
Page 441 U. S. 522

(c) The restriction against the receipt of packages from outside the facility does not deprive pretrial detainees of their property without due process of law in contravention of the Fifth Amendment, especially in view of the obvious fact that such packages are handy devices for the smuggling of contraband.  Pp.  441 U. S. 553-555.
(d) Assuming that a pretrial detainee retains a diminished expectation of privacy after commitment to a custodial facility, the room search rule does not violate the Fourth Amendment, but simply facilitates the safe and effective performance of the searches, and thus does not render the searches ""unreasonable"" within the meaning of that Amendment.  Pp.  441 U. S. 555-557.
(e) Similarly, assuming that pretrial detainees retain some Fourth Amendment rights upon commitment to a corrections facility, the body cavity searches do not violate that Amendment.  Balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against the inmates' privacy interests, such searches can be conducted on less than probable, cause and are not unreasonable.  Pp.  441 U. S. 558-560.
(f) None of the security restrictions and practices described above constitute ""punishment"" in violation of the rights of pretrial detainees under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  These restrictions and practices were reasonable responses by MCC officials to legitimate security concerns, and, in any event, were of only limited duration so far as the pretrial detainees were concerned.  Pp. 560-562.

Syllabus 
Under 28 U.S.C.  1343(3), federal district courts have jurisdiction over civil actions ""authorized by law"" claiming a deprivation, under color of state law, of rights ""secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights,"" and under  1343(4) have jurisdiction over such actions seeking relief under ""any Act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights, including the right to vote.""  Petitioner in No. 77-5324 brought suit in Federal District Court claiming that New Jersey officials, by denying her emergency assistance funds because she was not ""in a state of homelessness"" as required by the relevant state regulations, had deprived her of a right to such assistance ""necessary to avoid destitution"" within the meaning of  406(e)(1) of the federal Social Security Act.  The District Court held, inter alia, that the complaint stated a cause of action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 (which provides that every person who, under color of any state statute or regulation subjects another to the deprivation of any rights ""secured by the Constitution and laws"" shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law or suit in equity), and that it had jurisdiction under  1343(3) and (4).  The Court of Appeals held that the District Court should have dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction; that a constitutional claim must involve more than a contention that the Supremacy Clause requires that a federal statute be given effect over conflicting state law; that the Social Security Act is not an Act of Congress securing either ""equal rights"" or ""civil rights"" as those terms are used in  1343; and that those terms limit the grant of federal jurisdiction under  1343 even if  1983 creates a remedy for a broader category of statutory claims.  Respondents in No. 77-719 brought a class action in Federal District Court claiming that Texas 
Page 441 U. S. 601
 regulations requiring that Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits be reduced if the recipient shares a household with a nondependent person violate  402(a)(7) of the Social Security Act and implementing regulations.  The District Court's judgment upholding the Texas regulations was reversed by the Court of Appeals, but the appellate court held that the District Court had jurisdiction under  1343(4), since  1983 is an Act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights within the meaning of the jurisdictional grant.
Held:  Federal district courts' jurisdiction under  1343(3) and (4) does not encompass claims, such as those involved here, that a state welfare regulation is invalid because it conflicts with the Social Security Act, and hence the District Court in neither case had jurisdiction.  Pp  441 U. S. 607-623.
(a) To give meaning to  1343, it must be concluded that an allegation of incompatibility between federal and state statutes and regulations does not, in itself, give rise to a claim ""secured by the Constitution"" within the meaning of  1343(3).  The entire reference in  1343(3) to rights secured by an Act of Congress would be unnecessary if the earlier reference to constitutional claims embraced those resting solely on the Supremacy Clause, and, more importantly, the additional language describing a limited category of Acts of Congress -- those ""providing for equal rights"" -- plainly negates the notion that jurisdiction over al statutory claims had already been conferred by the preceding reference to constitutional claims.  Pp.  441 U. S. 612-615.
(b) Section 1983 is not a statute that secures ""equal rights"" or ""civil rights"" within the meaning of  1343.  One cannot go into court and claim ""a violation of  1983,"" for  1983, by itself, does not protect anyone against anything, but simply provides a remedy.  While  1983, when properly invoked, satisfies the first requirement of  1343(3) that the civil action be ""authorized by law,"" it cannot satisfy the second requirement that the action be one to redress the deprivation of rights ""secured by the Constitution of the United States or by an Act of Congress providing for equal rights.""  Since  1983 does not provide any substantive rights at all, it is not a statute ""providing for the protection of civil rights, including the right to vote"" within the meaning of  1343(4), and, moreover, to construe  1343(4) as encompassing all federal statutory suits would be plainly inconsistent with the congressional intent in passing that statute to ensure federal court jurisdiction over authorized suits by the Attorney General against conspiracies to deprive individuals of certain enumerated rights.  Pp.  441 U. S. 615-620.
(c) Section 1343 does not confer federal jurisdiction over claims based on the Social Security Act, since that Act is not a statute securing 
Page 441 U. S. 602
 ""equal rights"" within  1343(3) or ""civil rights"" within  1343(4).  While the provisions of the Act at issue here, to the extent that they prescribe a minimum level of subsistence for all individuals, might be regarded as securing either ""equal rights"" or ""civil rights,"" these terms have a more restrictive meaning as used in  1343.

No. 77-926.
Argued January 9, 1979
Decided May 14, 1979
441 U.S. 677

Syllabus 
Section 901(a) of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) provides in part that
""[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.""
Petitioner instituted litigation in Federal District Court, alleging that she had been excluded from participation in the medical education programs of respondent private universities on the basis of her gender and that these programs were receiving federal financial assistance at the time of her exclusion.  The District Court granted respondents' motions to dismiss the complaints, since Title IX does not expressly authorize a private right of action by a person injured by a violation of  901, and since the court concluded that no private remedy should be inferred.  The Court of Appeals agreed that the statute did not contain an implied private remedy.  It concluded, inter alia, that Congress intended the remedy in  902 of Title IX, establishing a procedure for the termination of federal financial support for institutions that violated  901, to be the exclusive means of enforcement, and that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, upon which Title IX was patterned, did not include an implied private cause of action.
Held:  Petitioner may maintain her lawsuit, despite the absence of any express authorization for it in Title IX.  Pp.  441 U. S. 688-717.
(a) Before concluding that Congress intended to make a remedy available to a special class of litigants, a court must carefully analyze the following four factors that Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66, identifies as indicative of such an intent:  (1) whether the statute was enacted for the benefit of a special class of which the plaintiff is a member, (2) whether there is any indication of legislative intent to create a private remedy, (3) whether implication of such a remedy is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme, and (4) whether implying a federal remedy is inappropriate because the subject matter involves an area basically of concern to the States.  P.  441 U. S. 688.
(b) The first factor is satisfied here since Title IX explicitly confers a benefit on persons discriminated against on the basis of sex, and petitioner 
Page 441 U. S. 678
 is clearly a member of that class for whose special benefit the statute was enacted.  Pp.  441 U. S. 689-694.
(c) As to the second factor, the legislative history of Title IX rather plainly indicates that Congress intended to create a private cause of action.  Title IX was patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the drafters of Title IX explicitly assumed that it would be interpreted and enforced in the same manner as Title VI, which had already been construed by lower federal courts as creating a private remedy when Title IX was enacted.  Pp.  441 U. S. 694-703.
(d) The third factor is satisfied, since implication of a private remedy will not frustrate the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme but, instead, will assist in achieving the statutory purpose of providing individual citizens effective protection against discriminatory practices.  Pp.  441 U. S. 703-708.
(e) As to the fourth factor, since the Civil War, the Federal Government and the federal courts have been the primary and powerful reliances in protecting citizens against invidious discrimination of any sort, including that on the basis of sex.  Moreover, it is the expenditure of federal funds that provides the justification for this particular statutory prohibition.  Pp.  441 U. S. 708-709.
(f) Respondents' principal argument against implying a cause of action under Title IX -- that it is unwise to subject admissions decisions of universities to judicial scrutiny at the behest of disappointed applicants on a case-by-case basis because this kind of litigation is burdensome, and inevitably will have an adverse effect on the independence of members of university committees -- is without merit.  The congressional majorities that passed Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX rejected the same argument when advanced by the congressional opponents of the two statutes, and there is nothing to demonstrate that private Title VI litigation has been so costly or voluminous that either the academic community or the courts have been unduly burdened, or that university administrators will be so concerned about the risk of litigation that they will fail to discharge their important responsibilities in an independent and professional manner.  Pp.  441 U. S. 709-710.
(g) Nor is there any merit to respondents' arguments, starting from the premise that Title IX and Title VI should receive the same construction, that a comparison of Title VI with other titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 demonstrates that Congress created express private remedies whenever it found them desirable, and that certain excerpts from the legislative history of Title VI foreclose the implication of a private remedy.  The fact that other provisions of a complex statutory scheme create express remedies has not been accepted as a sufficient

 reason, by itself, for refusing to imply an otherwise appropriate remedy under a separate section, and none of the excerpts from the legislative history cited by respondents evidences any hostility toward an implied private remedy for terminating the offending discrimination.

			"|"Cannon v. University of Chicago
No. 77-926.
Argued January 9, 1979
Decided May 14, 1979
441 U.S. 677

Syllabus 
Section 901(a) of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) provides in part that
""[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.""
Petitioner instituted litigation in Federal District Court, alleging that she had been excluded from participation in the medical education programs of respondent private universities on the basis of her gender and that these programs were receiving federal financial assistance at the time of her exclusion.  The District Court granted respondents' motions to dismiss the complaints, since Title IX does not expressly authorize a private right of action by a person injured by a violation of  901, and since the court concluded that no private remedy should be inferred.  The Court of Appeals agreed that the statute did not contain an implied private remedy.  It concluded, inter alia, that Congress intended the remedy in  902 of Title IX, establishing a procedure for the termination of federal financial support for institutions that violated  901, to be the exclusive means of enforcement, and that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, upon which Title IX was patterned, did not include an implied private cause of action.
Held:  Petitioner may maintain her lawsuit, despite the absence of any express authorization for it in Title IX.  Pp.  441 U. S. 688-717.
(a) Before concluding that Congress intended to make a remedy available to a special class of litigants, a court must carefully analyze the following four factors that Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66, identifies as indicative of such an intent:  (1) whether the statute was enacted for the benefit of a special class of which the plaintiff is a member, (2) whether there is any indication of legislative intent to create a private remedy, (3) whether implication of such a remedy is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme, and (4) whether implying a federal remedy is inappropriate because the subject matter involves an area basically of concern to the States.  P.  441 U. S. 688.
(b) The first factor is satisfied here since Title IX explicitly confers a benefit on persons discriminated against on the basis of sex, and petitioner 
Page 441 U. S. 678
 is clearly a member of that class for whose special benefit the statute was enacted.  Pp.  441 U. S. 689-694.
(c) As to the second factor, the legislative history of Title IX rather plainly indicates that Congress intended to create a private cause of action.  Title IX was patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the drafters of Title IX explicitly assumed that it would be interpreted and enforced in the same manner as Title VI, which had already been construed by lower federal courts as creating a private remedy when Title IX was enacted.  Pp.  441 U. S. 694-703.
(d) The third factor is satisfied, since implication of a private remedy will not frustrate the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme but, instead, will assist in achieving the statutory purpose of providing individual citizens effective protection against discriminatory practices.  Pp.  441 U. S. 703-708.
(e) As to the fourth factor, since the Civil War, the Federal Government and the federal courts have been the primary and powerful reliances in protecting citizens against invidious discrimination of any sort, including that on the basis of sex.  Moreover, it is the expenditure of federal funds that provides the justification for this particular statutory prohibition.  Pp.  441 U. S. 708-709.
(f) Respondents' principal argument against implying a cause of action under Title IX -- that it is unwise to subject admissions decisions of universities to judicial scrutiny at the behest of disappointed applicants on a case-by-case basis because this kind of litigation is burdensome, and inevitably will have an adverse effect on the independence of members of university committees -- is without merit.  The congressional majorities that passed Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX rejected the same argument when advanced by the congressional opponents of the two statutes, and there is nothing to demonstrate that private Title VI litigation has been so costly or voluminous that either the academic community or the courts have been unduly burdened, or that university administrators will be so concerned about the risk of litigation that they will fail to discharge their important responsibilities in an independent and professional manner.  Pp.  441 U. S. 709-710.
(g) Nor is there any merit to respondents' arguments, starting from the premise that Title IX and Title VI should receive the same construction, that a comparison of Title VI with other titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 demonstrates that Congress created express private remedies whenever it found them desirable, and that certain excerpts from the legislative history of Title VI foreclose the implication of a private remedy.

Biles v. State, 338 So.2d 1004 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 940 ( 1977). Nonetheless, on the ground that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction for the ""lesser included offense"" of ""simple"" murder, the court affirmed as to guilt and remanded for resentencing. 338 So.2d, at 1005. Simple murder is defined in relevant part under 97-3-19(1)(a) as ""[t]he killing of a human being . . . [w]hen done with deliberate design to effect the death of the person killed . . .."" Petitioner subsequently filed a pleading in the Mississippi Supreme Court that was treated as a petition for writ of error coram nobis and was denied without written opinion.

 Whatever the phrase ""lesser included offense"" may connote under Mississippi law, it is apparent from the relevant Mississippi statutes that capital murder may be committed ""without any design to effect death,"" while simple murder requires ""a deliberate design to effect . . . death ."" Although overturning petitioner's conviction for capital murder, the Mississippi Supreme Court, finding evidence of the necessary intent to kill, found petitioner guilty of simple murder and to this extent affirmed the conviction. Petitioner, however, was not tried by the jury for simple murder, and the judgment of the Mississippi court would appear infirm under Cole v. Arkansas,

On the basis of the statutory definitions of the crimes involved, it appears that exactly that might have happened here.

No. 77-5992
Argued November 28, 1978
Decided April 30, 1979
441 U.S. 418

Syllabus 
Appellant's mother filed a petition for his indefinite commitment to a state mental hospital in accordance with Texas law governing involuntary commitments.  Appellant had a long history of confinements for mental and emotional disorders.  The state trial court instructed the jury to determine whether, based on ""clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence,"" appellant was mentally ill and required hospitalization for his own welfare and protection or the protection of others.  Appellant contended that the trial court should have employed the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard of proof.  The jury found that appellant was mentally ill and that he required hospitalization, and the trial court ordered his commitment for an indefinite period.  The Texas Court of Appeals reversed, agreeing with appellant on the standard of proof issue.  The Texas Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and reinstated the trial court's judgment, concluding that a ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard of proof in a civil commitment proceeding satisfied due process, and that, since the trial court's improper instructions in the instant case had benefited appellant, the error was harmless.
Held:  A ""clear and convincing"" standard of proof is required by the Fourteenth Amendment in a civil proceeding brought under state law to commit an individual involuntarily for an indefinite period to a state mental hospital.  Pp.  441 U. S. 425-433.
(a) The individual's liberty interest in the outcome of a civil commitment proceeding is of such weight and gravity, compared with the state's interests in providing care to its citizens who are unable, because of emotional disorders, to care for themselves and in protecting the community from the dangerous tendencies of some who are mentally ill, that due process requires the state to justify confinement by proof more substantial than a mere preponderance of the evidence.  Pp.  441 U. S. 425-427.
(b) Due process does not require states to use the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard of proof applicable in criminal prosecutions and delinquency proceedings.  In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, distinguished.  The reasonable doubt standard is inappropriate in civil commitment proceedings because, given the uncertainties of psychiatric diagnosis, it may impose a burden the state cannot meet, and thereby erect an unreasonable barrier to needed medical treatment.  The state should 
Page 441 U. S. 419
 not be required to employ a standard of proof that may completely undercut its efforts to further the legitimate interests of both the state and the patient that are served by civil commitments.  Pp.  441 U. S. 427 431.
(c) To meet due process demands in commitment,proceedings, the standard of proof has to inform the factfinder that the proof must be greater than the ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard applicable to other categories of civil cases.  However, use of the term ""unequivocal"" in conjunction with the terms ""clear and convincing"" in jury instructions (as included in the instructions given by the Texas state court in this case) is not constitutionally required, although states are free to use that standard.  Pp.  441 U. S. 431-433.

Appellant Japanese shipping companies' vessels carry cargo containers which, like the ships, are owned by appellants, are based, registered, and subjected to property tax in Japan, and are used exclusively in foreign commerce.  A number of appellants' containers were temporarily present in appellee county and cities in California, and appellees levied property taxes on the containers.  The California Supreme Court upheld the tax as applied.
Held:
1. This Court has appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1257(2), since the California Supreme Court sustained the tax, as applied, as against the contention that such application would violate the Commerce Clause and various treaties.  Pp.  441 U. S. 440-441.
2. It is unnecessary to decide the broad proposition whether mere use of international routes is enough, under the ""home port doctrine,"" to render an instrumentality immune from tax in a nondomiciliary State.  The question here is a more narrow one, namely, whether instrumentalities of commerce that are owned, based, and registered abroad, and that are used exclusively in international commerce, may be subjected to apportioned ad valorem property taxation by a State.  Pp.  441 U. S. 441-444.
3. While, under Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, no impermissible burden on interstate commerce will be found if a state tax ""is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State,"" id. at  430 U. S. 279, a more elaborate inquiry is necessary when a State seeks to tax the instrumentalities of foreign, rather than of interstate, commerce.  In addition to answering the nexus, apportionment, and nondiscrimination questions posed in Complete Auto, a court must also inquire, first, whether the tax, notwithstanding apportionment, creates a substantial risk of international multiple taxation, and, second, whether the tax prevents the Federal Government from ""speak[ing] with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments.""

Respondents, representing a class of nonimmigrant alien residents of Maryland who either held or were financially dependent upon a person who held a ""G-4 visa"" (a nonimmigrant visa granted to officers or employees of international organizations and members of their immediate families), instituted an action in Federal District Court, challenging the validity of the policy of the University of Maryland whereby ""in-state"" status for tuition purposes was denied to such aliens because they were conclusively presumed by the University to be nondomiciliaries of the State.  The District Court held for respondents, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held:  The case will not be restored to this Court's active docket for further briefing and argument, since this Court's decision in Elkins, supra, rested on the premise that the University apparently has no interest in continuing to deny in-state status to G-4 aliens as a class if they can become Maryland domiciliaries, but this premise no longer appears to be true in view of the resolution subsequently adopted by the Board of Regents.

Argued January 9, 1979
Decided April 24, 1979
441 U.S. 322

Syllabus 
An Oklahoma statute prohibits transporting or shipping outside the State for sale natural minnows seined or procured from waters within the State.  Appellant, who holds a Texas license to operate a commercial minnow business in Texas, was charged with violating the Oklahoma statute by transporting from Oklahoma to Texas a load of natural minnows purchased from a minnow dealer licensed to do business in Oklahoma.  Appellant's defense that the Oklahoma statute was unconstitutional because it was repugnant to the Commerce Clause was rejected, and he was convicted and fined.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, relying on Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519, which had sustained against a Commerce Clause challenge a Connecticut statute forbidding the transportation beyond the State of game birds that had been lawfully killed within the State.  The Geer decision rested on the holding that no interstate commerce was involved, because the State had the power, as representative for its citizens, who ""owned"" in common all wild animals within the State, to control the ""ownership"" of game that had been lawfully reduced to possession, and had exercised its power by prohibiting its removal from the State.
Held:  The Oklahoma statute is repugnant to the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  441 U. S. 325-339.
(a) Geer v. Connecticut, supra, is overruled.  Time has revealed the error of the result reached in Geer through its application of the 19th-century legal fiction of state ownership of wild animals.  Challenges under the Commerce Clause to state regulations of wild animals should be considered according to the same general rule applied to state regulations of other natural resources.  Pp.  441 U. S. 326-335.
(b) Under that general rule, this Court must inquire whether the challenged statute regulates evenhandedly with only ""incidental"" effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate commerce either on its face or in practical effect; whether the statute serves a legitimate local purpose; and, if so, whether alternative means could promote this local purpose as well without discriminating against interstate commerce.  P.  441 U. S. 336.
(c) The Oklahoma statute, on its face, discriminates against interstate 
Page 441 U. S. 323
 commerce by forbidding the transportation of natural minnows out of the State for purposes of sale, and thus overtly blocking the flow of interstate commerce at the State's border.  The statute is not a ""last ditch"" attempt at conservation after nondiscriminatory alternatives have proved unfeasible.  It is, rather, a choice of the most discriminatory means, even though nondiscriminatory alternatives would seem likely to fulfill the State's purported legitimate local purpose of conservation more effectively.  Pp.  441 U. S. 336-338.
(d) States may promote the legitimate purpose of protecting and conserving wild animal life within their borders only in ways consistent with the basic principle that the pertinent economic unit is the Nation; and when a wild animal becomes an article of commerce, its use cannot be limited to the citizens of one State to the exclusion of citizens of another State.

Syllabus 
A Georgia statute, while permitting the mother of an illegitimate child, or the father if he has legitimated the child and there is no mother, to sue for the wrongful death of the child, precludes a father who has not legitimated a child from so suing.  Appellant, the father of an illegitimate child, whom he had not legitimated and who was killed, along with the mother, in an automobile accident, sued for the child's wrongful death, and the Georgia trial court, denying a summary judgment for the defendant (appellee), held that the statute violated both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Georgia Supreme Court reversed, holding that the statutory classification was rationally related to three specified legitimate state interests.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  441 U. S. 351-359;  441 U. S. 359-361.
241 Ga.198, 243 S.E.2d 867, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, joined by MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that:
1. The Georgia statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  441 U. S. 351-358.
(a) If the statute is not invidiously discriminatory, it is entitled to a presumption of validity and will be upheld
""unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that we can only conclude that the legislature's actions were irrational,""
Vance v. Bradley, 440 U. S. 93,  440 U. S. 97.  Pp.  441 U. S. 351-352.
(b) The rationale that it is unjust and ineffective for society to express its condemnation of procreation outside the marital relationship by punishing the illegitimate child who is in no way responsible for his situation and is unable to change it, Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, is inapplicable to the statute in question, which does not impose differing burdens or award differing benefits to legitimate and illegitimate children, but simply denies a natural father the right to sue for his illegitimate child's wrongful death.  Pp.  441 U. S. 352-353.
(c) The statute does not invidiously discriminate against appellant simply because he is of the male sex.  The conferral of the right of a 
Page 441 U. S. 348
 natural father to sue for his child's wrongful death only if he has previously acted to identify himself, to undertake his paternal responsibilities, and to make his child legitimate, does not reflect any overbroad generalizations about men as a class, but rather the reality that, in Georgia, only a father can, by unilateral action, legitimate an illegitimate child.  Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71; Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677; Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7, distinguished.  Pp.  441 U. S. 353-357.
(d) The statutory classification is a rational means for dealing with the problem of proving paternity.

2. Nor does the Georgia statute violate the Due Process Clause, Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, distinguished.  Pp.  441 U. S. 358-359.
MR.

Respondent, while under arrest for certain crimes and after being advised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, made incriminating statements to the arresting officers.  His motion to suppress evidence of these statements on the ground that he had not waived his right to assistance of counsel at the time the statements were made was denied by a North Carolina trial court, and he was subsequently convicted.  The North Carolina Supreme Court reversed, holding that Miranda requires that no statement of a person under custodial interrogation may be admitted in evidence against him unless, at the time the statement was made, he explicitly waived the right to the presence of a lawyer.
Held:  An explicit statement of waiver is not invariably necessary to support a finding that the defendant waived the right to counsel guaranteed by the Miranda case.  The question of waiver must be determined on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the case, and there is no reason in a case such as this for a per se rule, such as that of the North Carolina Supreme Court.  By creating an inflexible rule that no implicit waiver can ever suffice, that court has gone beyond the requirements of federal organic law, and thus its judgment cannot stand, since a state court can neither add to nor subtract from the mandates of the United States Constitution.

No.77-6431
Argued November 6, 1978
Decided April 24, 1979
441 U.S. 380

Syllabus 
Appellant and appellee Maria Mohammed lived together out of wedlock for several years in New York City, during which time two children were born.  Appellant, who was identified as the father on the birth certificates, contributed to the children's support.  After the couple separated, Maria took the children and married her present husband (also an appellee).  During the next two years, appellant frequently saw or otherwise maintained contact with the children.  Appellees subsequently petitioned for adoption of the children, and appellant filed a cross-petition.  The Surrogate granted appellees' petition under  111 of the New York Domestic Relations Law, which permits an unwed mother, but not an unwed father, to block the adoption of their child simply by withholding her consent.  Rejecting appellant's contention that  111 is unconstitutional, the state appellate courts affirmed on the basis of In re Malpica-Orsini, 36 N.Y.2d 568, 331 N.E.2d 486.  In that case, the New York Court of Appeals held that  111 furthered the interests of illegitimate children, for whom adoption is often the best course, reasoning that people wishing to adopt a child born out of wedlock would be discouraged if the natural father could prevent adoption merely by withholding his consent.  Moreover, the court suggested that, if the consent of the natural father were required, adoptions would be jeopardized because of his unavailability.
Held:
1. Contrary to appellees' contention, it is clear that  111 treats unmarried parents differently according to their sex.  The section's consent requirement is no mere formality, since the New York courts have held that the question of whether consent is required is entirely separate from the consideration of the best interests of the child.  In this very case, the Surrogate held that adoption by appellant was impermissible absent Maria's consent, whereas adoption by Maria and her husband could be prevented by appellant only if he could show that such adoption would not be in the children's best interests.  Pp.  441 U. S. 387-388.
2. The sex-based distinction in  111 between unmarried mothers and unmarried fathers violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it bears no substantial relation to any important state interest.  Pp.  441 U. S. 388-394. 
Page 441 U. S. 381

No.77-6431
Argued November 6, 1978
Decided April 24, 1979
441 U.S. 380

Syllabus 
Appellant and appellee Maria Mohammed lived together out of wedlock for several years in New York City, during which time two children were born.  Appellant, who was identified as the father on the birth certificates, contributed to the children's support.  After the couple separated, Maria took the children and married her present husband (also an appellee).  During the next two years, appellant frequently saw or otherwise maintained contact with the children.  Appellees subsequently petitioned for adoption of the children, and appellant filed a cross-petition.  The Surrogate granted appellees' petition under  111 of the New York Domestic Relations Law, which permits an unwed mother, but not an unwed father, to block the adoption of their child simply by withholding her consent.  Rejecting appellant's contention that  111 is unconstitutional, the state appellate courts affirmed on the basis of In re Malpica-Orsini, 36 N.Y.2d 568, 331 N.E.2d 486.  In that case, the New York Court of Appeals held that  111 furthered the interests of illegitimate children, for whom adoption is often the best course, reasoning that people wishing to adopt a child born out of wedlock would be discouraged if the natural father could prevent adoption merely by withholding his consent.  Moreover, the court suggested that, if the consent of the natural father were required, adoptions would be jeopardized because of his unavailability.
Held:
1. Contrary to appellees' contention, it is clear that  111 treats unmarried parents differently according to their sex.  The section's consent requirement is no mere formality, since the New York courts have held that the question of whether consent is required is entirely separate from the consideration of the best interests of the child.  In this very case, the Surrogate held that adoption by appellant was impermissible absent Maria's consent, whereas adoption by Maria and her husband could be prevented by appellant only if he could show that such adoption would not be in the children's best interests.  Pp.  441 U. S. 387-388.
2. The sex-based distinction in  111 between unmarried mothers and unmarried fathers violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it bears no substantial relation to any important state interest.  Pp.  441 U. S. 388-394.

Syllabus 
New Mexico has imposed an energy tax on the privilege of generating electricity within the State.  This tax applies to all utility companies generating electricity within the State and may be credited against the New Mexico gross receipts tax liability for electricity sold at retail within New Mexico.  But where the electricity is transmitted to other States for sale and consumption, there is no gross receipts tax liability against which to offset energy tax liability.  A federal statute, 15 U.S.C.  391, prohibits a State from imposing a tax on the generation or transmission of electricity which discriminates against out-of-state consumers, and further provides that a tax is discriminatory if it ""results, either directly or indirectly, in a greater tax burden on electricity"" generated and transmitted in interstate commerce than on electricity generated and transmitted in intrastate commerce.  Appellant utility companies, owners of New Mexico power plants at which most of the electricity generated is ultimately sold to out-of-state consumers, brought action in a New Mexico state court seeking to have the energy tax invalidated on the ground, inter alia, that it violated the federal statute, but the New Mexico Supreme Court, affirming the trial court, upheld the tax.
Held:  The New Mexico energy tax is invalid under the Supremacy Clause by reason of the federal statute.  Because the tax itself, through operation of the tax-credit provisions, indirectly but necessarily discriminates against electricity sold outside New Mexico, it violates that statute.  The federal statute does not exceed the permissible bounds of congressional action under the Commerce Clause, since Congress had a rational basis for finding that a tax such as New Mexico's interfered with interstate commerce, and selected a reasonable method to eliminate that interference.

Syllabus 
Petitioner instituted a diversity action in Federal District Court against the respondents, a television network and two of its employees, and a magazine, alleging that a program aired by the network and an article published by the magazine defamed him.  Petitioner conceded that, because he was a ""public figure"" the First and Fourteenth Amendments precluded recovery absent proof that respondents had published damaging falsehoods with ""actual malice"" -- that is, with knowledge that the statements were false or with reckless disregard of whether they were false or not.  See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, and subsequent decisions of this Court.  Preparing to prove his case in light of these requirements, petitioner deposed one of the network employees at length and sought an order to compel answers to a variety of questions to which response was refused on the ground that the First Amendment protected against inquiry into the state of mind of those who edit, produce, or publish, and into the editorial process.  The District Court ruled that the questions were relevant and rejected the claim of constitutional privilege.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed, two judges concluding that the First Amendment lent sufficient protection to the editorial processes to protect the network employee from inquiry about his thoughts, opinions, and conclusions with respect to the material gathered by him and about his conversations with his editorial colleagues.
Held:  When a member of the press is alleged to have circulated damaging falsehoods and is sued for injury to the plaintiff's reputation, there is no privilege under the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press barring the plaintiff from inquiring into the editorial processes of those responsible for the publication where the inquiry will produce evidence material to the proof of a critical element of the plaintiff's cause of action.  Pp.  441 U. S. 158-177.
(a) Contrary to the views of the Court of Appeals, according an absolute privilege to the editorial process of a media defendant in a libel case is not required, authorized, or presaged by this Court's prior cases, and would substantially enhance the burden of proving actual malice, contrary to the expectations of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 
Page 441 U. S. 154
 supra; Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U. S. 130, and similar cases.  New York Times and its progeny do not suggest any First Amendment restriction on the sources from which the plaintiff can obtain the necessary evidence to prove the critical elements of his cause of action, but, on the contrary, make it essential to proving liability that the plaintiff focus on the defendant's conduct and state of mind.  It is also untenable to conclude from the prior cases that, although proof of the necessary state of mind can be in the form of objective circumstances from which the ultimate fact can be inferred, plaintiffs may not inquire directly from the defendants whether they knew or suspected that their damaging publication was in error.  Pp.  441 U. S. 158-169.
(b) The case for modifying firmly established constitutional doctrine by placing beyond the plaintiff's reach a range of direct evidence relevant to proving knowing or reckless falsehood by the publisher of an alleged libel, elements that are critical to a plaintiff such as petitioner, is by no means clear and convincing.  The suggested privilege for the editorial process would constitute a substantial interference with the ability of a defamation plaintiff to establish the ingredients of malice as required by New York Times, and furthermore the outer boundaries of the suggested editorial privilege are difficult to perceive.  The important interests of petitioner and other defamation plaintiffs at stake in opposing the creation of the asserted privilege cannot be overridden on the ground that requiring disclosure of editorial conversations and of a reporter's conclusions about veracity of the material he has gathered will have an intolerable chilling effect on the editorial process and editorial decisionmaking.  If the claimed inhibition flows from the fear of damages liability for publishing knowing or reckless falsehoods, those effects are precisely those that have been held to be consistent with the First Amendment.  Pp.  441 U. S. 169-175.
(c) Creating a constitutional privilege foreclosing direct inquiry into the editorial process would not cure the press' problem as to escalating costs and other burdens incident to defamation litigation.  Only complete immunity from liability for defamation would effect this result, and this Court has regularly found this to be an untenable construction of the First Amendment.  Furthermore, mushrooming litigation costs, much of it due to pretrial discovery, are not peculiar to the libel and slander area.  Until and unless there are major changes in the present Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, reliance must be had on what in fact and in law are ample powers of the district judge to prevent abuse.

Syllabus 
Respondents are independent gasoline dealers, one of which operates in Arizona and several other States, and two of which operate in the vicinity of Tucson, Ariz.  They brought civil antitrust actions in the District Court in Arizona against several large oil companies, including petitioners.  While these proceedings were in pretrial stages, a Government antitrust investigation in the Central District of California culminated in an indictment for illegal price fixing in California, Arizona, and elsewhere, of petitioners and several other large oil companies, all of which ultimately pleaded nolo contendere.  After unavailing discovery requests, respondents petitioned the District Court for the Central District of California to order release of certain grand jury transcripts under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 6(e)(2)(C)(i), which provides for disclosure of grand jury transcripts ""when so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.""  The Antitrust Division did not object to the disclosure.  Over petitioners' objection, the transcripts' release was ordered by the District Court for the Central District of California, subject to various protective conditions.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying upon United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U. S. 677, which held that parties seeking grand jury transcripts must show that the material sought is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding; that the disclosure need exceeds the need for continued secrecy; and that the disclosure request covers only the material needed.  The court found that continued grand jury secrecy was not a substantial factor, as the grand jury proceeding had concluded three years before and the transcripts had already been released to petitioners.  Although the court conceded that it knew little about the Arizona proceedings, it speculated that the transcripts would facilitate prosecution of the civil suits.
Held:
1. The courts below did not err in selecting the standard governing disclosure of grand jury transcripts under Rule 6(e).  Though the veil of grand jury secrecy should not be lifted unnecessarily, it is recognized 
Page 441 U. S. 212
 that, in some situations, justice may demand that discrete portions of transcripts be made available in subsequent proceedings.  Here, the California District Court made clear that it had to be demonstrated that a particularized need for disclosure outweighed the interest in continued grand jury secrecy, and the Court of Appeals correctly understood the standard applied in Procter & Gamble, supra.  Pp.  441 U. S. 217-224.
2. In this case, however, the California District Court having custody of the grand jury transcripts abused its discretion in issuing the disclosure order, for that court concededly had no dependable knowledge of the status of, and the needs of the parties in, the Arizona civil suits.  The court based its decision largely upon unsupported assertions of counsel during oral argument, supplemented by other inadequate data such as the criminal indictment and the civil complaints.  Even a comparison of those documents did not clearly show what portions, if any, of the transcripts would be pertinent to the Arizona actions, which involved only some of the same parties and only some of the same territory as were involved in the criminal case.  Under these circumstances, the better practice would have been for the California District Court, after making a written evaluation of the need for continued grand jury secrecy and a determination that the limited evidence before it showed that disclosure might be appropriate, to send the requested materials to the Arizona District Court where the civil cases were pending.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, as a party to numerous Government contracts, was required to comply with Executive Orders 11246 and 11375, which charge the Secretary of Labor with ensuring that corporations that benefit from Government contracts provide equal employment opportunity regardless of race or sex.  Regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) require Government contractors to furnish reports about their affirmative action programs and the general composition of their workforces, and provide that, notwithstanding exemption from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), records obtained pursuant to Executive Order 11246 shall be made available for inspection if it is determined that the requested inspection furthers the public interest and does not impede agency functions, except in the case of records disclosure of which is prohibited by law.  After the Department of Defense's Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the designated compliance agency responsible for monitoring petitioner's employment practices, informed petitioner that third parties had made an FOIA request for disclosure of certain materials that had been furnished to the DLA by petitioner, petitioner objected to release of the materials.  The DLA determined that the materials were subject to disclosure under the FOIA and OFCCP disclosure rules, and petitioner then filed a complaint in the Federal District Court seeking to enjoin release of the documents.  Petitioner contended, inter alia, that disclosure was barred by the FOIA and was inconsistent with the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C.  1905, which imposes criminal sanctions on Government employees who disclose or make known, in any manner or to any extent ""not authorized by law,"" certain classes of information submitted to a Government agency, including trade secrets and confidential statistical data.  Finding jurisdiction to subject the disclosure decision to review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the District Court held that certain of the requested information fell within Exemption 4 of the FOIA, relating to trade secrets and commercial or financial information; that whether the requested information may or must be withheld thus 
Page 441 U. S. 282
 depended on applicable agency regulations; and that, here, a regulation (29 CFR  70.21(a) (1977)) which states that no officer or employee of the Department of Labor is to violate 18 U.S.C.  1905, and which proscribes specified disclosures if ""not authorized by law,"" required that the information be withheld.  Both sides appealed, and the Court of Appeals vacated the District Court's judgment.  While agreeing with the District Court that the FOIA does not compel withholding of information that falls within its exemptions, and that analysis must proceed under the APA, the Court of Appeals reached a different conclusion as to the interpretation of 29 CFR  70.21(a).  In the Court of Appeals' view, disclosures made pursuant to OFCCP disclosure regulations are ""authorized by law"" by virtue of those regulations.
Held:
1. The FOIA is exclusively a disclosure statute, and affords petitioner no private right of action to enjoin agency disclosure.  The language, logic, and history of the FOIA show that its provisions exempting specified material from disclosure were only meant to permit the agency to withhold certain information, and were not meant to mandate nondisclosure.  Congressional concern was with the agency's need or preference for confidentiality; the FOIA, by itself, protects the interest in confidentiality of private entities submitting information only to the extent that this interest is endorsed by the agency collecting the information.  Pp.  441 U. S. 290-294.
2. The type of disclosure threatened in this case is not ""authorized by law"" within the meaning of the Trade Secrets Act on the theory that the OFCCP regulations relied on by DLA were the source of that authorization.  Pp.  441 U. S. 295-316.
(a) The Act addresses formal agency action as well as acts of individual Government employees, and there is nothing in its legislative history to show that Congress intended the phrase ""authorized by law"" to have a special, limited meaning different from the traditional understanding that properly promulgated, substantive agency regulations have the ""force and effect of law.""  In order for a regulation to have the ""force and effect of law,"" it must be a ""substantive"" or ""legislative-type"" rule affecting individual rights and obligations (as do the regulations in the case at bar), and it must be the product of a congressional grant of legislative authority, promulgated in conformity with any procedural requirements imposed by Congress.  Pp.  441 U. S. 295-303.
(b) The disclosure regulations at issue in this case cannot be based on  201 of Executive Order 11246, as amended, and a regulation which permits units in the Department of Labor to promulgate supplemental 
Page 441 U. S. 283
 disclosure regulations consistent with the FOIA.  Since materials that are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA are outside the ambit of that Act, the Government cannot rely on the FOIA as congressional authorization for disclosure regulations that permit the release of information within the Act's exemptions.  In order for regulations adopted under  201 of Executive Order 11246 -- which speaks in terms of rules and regulations ""necessary and appropriate"" to achieve the Executive Order's purposes of ending discrimination by the Federal Government and those who deal with it -- to have the ""force and effect of law,"" there must be a nexus between the regulations and some delegation of the requisite legislative authority by Congress.  When Congress enacted statutes which arguably authorized the Executive Order (the Federal Property and Administration Services Act of 1949, Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972), it was not concerned with public disclosure of trade secrets or confidential business information, and it is not possible to find in these statutes a delegation of the disclosure authority asserted by the Government here.  Also, one cannot readily pull from the logic and purposes of the Executive Order any concern with the public's access to information in Government files or the importance of protecting trade secrets or confidential business statistics.  Pp.  441 U. S. 303-308.
(c) Legislative authority for the OFCCP disclosure regulations cannot be found in 5 U.S.C.  301, which authorizes heads of Government departments to prescribe regulations to govern internal departmental affairs and the custody and use of its records, and which provides that it does not authorize withholding information from the public or limiting the availability of records to the public.  Section 301 is a ""housekeeping statute,"" authorizing rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice as opposed to ""substantive rules.""  There is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that  301 is a substantive grant of legislative power to promulgate rules authorizing the release of trade secrets or confidential business information.  Thus,  301 does not authorize regulations limiting the scope of the Trade Secrets Act.  Pp. 308-312.
(d) There is also a procedural defect in the OFCCP disclosure regulations that precludes courts from affording them the force and effect of law, since they were promulgated as ""interpretative rules"" without complying with the APA's requirement that interested persons be given general notice of an agency's proposed rulemaking and an opportunity to comment before a ""substantive rule"" is promulgated.  An ""interpretative regulation"" cannot be the ""authoriz[ation] by law"" required by the Trade Secrets Act.  Pp.  441 U. S. 312-316. 
Page 441 U. S. 284

3. However, the Trade Secrets Act does not afford a private right of action to enjoin disclosure in violation of the statute.  Where this Court has implied a private right of action under a criminal statute, ""there was at least a statutory basis for inferring that a civil cause of action of some sort lay in favor of someone.""  Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66,  422 U. S. 79.  Nothing in the Trade Secrets Act prompts such an inference; nor is there any indication of legislative intent to create a private right of action.  Most importantly, a private right of action under the Act is not necessary to make effective the congressional purpose, since review of DLA's decision to disclose petitioner's employment data is available under the APA.  Pp.  441 U. S. 316-317.
4. Since the Trade Secrets Act and any ""authoriz[ation] by law"" contemplated by that Act place substantive limits on agency action, DLA's decision to disclose petitioner's reports is reviewable agency action, and petitioner is a person ""adversely affected or aggrieved"" within the meaning of the APA's provision affording the right of judicial review of agency action to such a person.  Because the Court of Appeals did not reach the issue whether disclosure of petitioner's documents was barred by the Trade Secrets Act, the case is remanded in order that the Court of Appeals may consider whether the contemplated disclosures would violate the Act.  Pp.  441 U. S. 317-319.
565 F.2d 1172, vacated and remanded.

No. 77-922
Argued November 8, 1978
Decided April 18, 1979
441 U.S. 281

Syllabus 
Petitioner, as a party to numerous Government contracts, was required to comply with Executive Orders 11246 and 11375, which charge the Secretary of Labor with ensuring that corporations that benefit from Government contracts provide equal employment opportunity regardless of race or sex.  Regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) require Government contractors to furnish reports about their affirmative action programs and the general composition of their workforces, and provide that, notwithstanding exemption from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), records obtained pursuant to Executive Order 11246 shall be made available for inspection if it is determined that the requested inspection furthers the public interest and does not impede agency functions, except in the case of records disclosure of which is prohibited by law.  After the Department of Defense's Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the designated compliance agency responsible for monitoring petitioner's employment practices, informed petitioner that third parties had made an FOIA request for disclosure of certain materials that had been furnished to the DLA by petitioner, petitioner objected to release of the materials.  The DLA determined that the materials were subject to disclosure under the FOIA and OFCCP disclosure rules, and petitioner then filed a complaint in the Federal District Court seeking to enjoin release of the documents.  Petitioner contended, inter alia, that disclosure was barred by the FOIA and was inconsistent with the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C.  1905, which imposes criminal sanctions on Government employees who disclose or make known, in any manner or to any extent ""not authorized by law,"" certain classes of information submitted to a Government agency, including trade secrets and confidential statistical data.  Finding jurisdiction to subject the disclosure decision to review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the District Court held that certain of the requested information fell within Exemption 4 of the FOIA, relating to trade secrets and commercial or financial information; that whether the requested information may or must be withheld thus 
Page 441 U. S. 282
 depended on applicable agency regulations; and that, here, a regulation (29 CFR  70.21(a) (1977)) which states that no officer or employee of the Department of Labor is to violate 18 U.S.C.  1905, and which proscribes specified disclosures if ""not authorized by law,"" required that the information be withheld.

441 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Respondent Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. (CBS), brought this action against petitioners, American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), and their members and affiliates, alleging, inter alia, that the issuance by ASCAP and BMI to CBS of blanket licenses to copyrighted musical compositions at fees negotiated by them is illegal price-fixing under the antitrust laws.  Blanket licenses give the licensees the right to perform any and all of the compositions owned by the members or affiliates as often as the licensees desire for a stated term.  Fees for blanket licenses are ordinarily a percentage of total revenues or a flat dollar amount, and do not directly depend on the amount or type of music used.  After a trial limited to the issue of liability, the District Court dismissed the complaint, holding, inter alia, that the blanket license was not price-fixing and a per se violation of the Sherman Act.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for consideration of the appropriate remedy, holding that the blanket license issued to television networks was a form of price-fixing illegal per se under the Sherman Act and established copyright misuse. 
Page 441 U. S. 2

Held:  The issuance by ASCAP and BMI of blanket licenses does not constitute price-fixing per se unlawful under the antitrust laws.  Pp.  441 U. S. 7-25.
(a) ""It is only after considerable experience with certain business relationships that courts classify them as per se violations of the Sherman Act.""  United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U. S. 596,  405 U. S. 607-608.  And though there has been rather intensive antitrust scrutiny of ASCAP and BMI and their blanket licenses, that experience hardly counsels that this Court should outlaw the blanket license as a per se restraint of trade.  Furthermore, the United States, by its amicus brief in the present case, urges that the blanket licenses, which consent decrees in earlier actions by the Government authorize ASCAP and BMI to issue to television networks, are not per se violations of the Sherman Act.  And Congress, in the Copyright Act of 1976, has itself chosen to employ the blanket license and similar practices.  Thus, there is no nearly universal view that the blanket licenses are a form of price-fixing subject to automatic condemnation under the Sherman Act, rather than to a careful assessment under the rule of reason generally applied in Sherman Act cases.  Pp.  441 U. S. 7-16.
(b) In characterizing the conduct of issuing blanket licenses under the per se rule, this Court's inquiry must focus on whether the effect and, here because it tends to show effect, the purpose of the practice are to threaten the proper operation of a predominantly free-market economy.  The blanket license is not a ""naked restrain[t] of trade with no purpose except stifling of competition,"" White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U. S. 253,  372 U. S. 263, but rather accompanies the integration of sales, monitoring, and enforcement against unauthorized copyright use, which would be difficult and expensive problems if left to individual users and copyright owners.  Although the blanket license fee is set by ASCAP and BMI, rather than by competition among individual copyright owners, and although it is a fee for the use of any of the compositions covered by the license, the license cannot be wholly equated with a simple horizontal arrangement among competitors, and is quite different from anything any individual owner could issue.  In light of the background, which plainly indicates that, over the years, and in the face of available alternatives, including direct negotiation with individual copyright owners, the blanket license has provided an acceptable mechanism for at least a large part of the market for the performing rights to copyrighted musical compositions, it cannot automatically be declared illegal in all of its many manifestations.  Rather, it should be subjected to a more discriminating examination under the rule of reason.  Pp.  441 U. S. 16-24.

of Housing and Urban Development
No. 77-874
Argued December 5, 1978
Decided April 17, 1979*
441 U.S. 39

Syllabus 
The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Relocation Act) makes relocation benefits available for individuals and businesses that satisfy the statutory definition of a ""displaced person.""  Section 101(6) of the Act defines that term to include
""any person who . . . moves . . . as a result of the acquisition of . . . real property . . . or as a result of the written order of the acquiring agency to vacate real property, for a program or project undertaken by a Federal agency.""
Both of these cases involve tenants displaced from housing projects that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) acquired because the projects' sponsors defaulted on federally insured loans.  Petitioners in No. 77-874 were dislocated by HUD's subsequent closing of an Indianapolis, Ind., housing project, and HUD refused to provide relocation benefits for these tenants.  Petitioners then initiated this action in Federal District Court, claiming that they were ""displaced persons"" under the written order clause of  101(6).  The District Court rejected the tenants' statutory construction and granted summary judgment for HUD.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that  101(6) encompasses only displacements for programs designed to benefit the public as a whole or to fulfill a public need, not dislocations caused by the irretrievable failure of a public housing project.  Respondents in No. 77-1463 were displaced when HUD determined that a Washington, D.C., project should be demolished and the land sold to private developers.  When HUD ordered the tenants to vacate but declined to extend assistance under the Relocation Act, respondents brought suit in Federal District Court.  The court agreed that the dislocated tenants were covered by the written order clause of  101(6), and granted summary judgment for respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the written order 
Page 441 U. S. 40
 clause encompasses all persons ordered to vacate so that an agency's property can be devoted to a federal program ""designed for the benefit of the public as a whole.""  Because HUD's demolition plans met this description, the tenants HUD directed to move were considered ""displaced persons.""
Held:
1. The written order clause of  101(6) encompasses only those persons ordered to vacate in connection with the actual or proposed acquisition of property for a federal. program.  Pp.  441 U. S. 49-63.
(a) Both the language and origins of the Relocation Act demonstrate that Congress intended to provide relocation assistance when property is acquired for federal programs, not to extend assistance beyond that limited context for all persons somehow displaced by Government programs.  Pp.  441 U. S. 49-53.
(b) Similarly, the legislative history of the written order clause reveals no congressional intent to extend relocation benefits beyond the acquisition context.  Rather, this clause was designed to ensure that assistance is available for a distinct group of persons directed to move because of a contemplated acquisition, whether the agency ultimately acquires the property or not.  Thus, the clause applies only when a proposed acquisition directly causes issuance of the notice to vacate and the property acquisition is intended to further a federal program or project.  Pp.  441 U. S. 53-59.
(c) The structure of the Relocation Act, as well as the statutory provisions specifying the benefits available for displaced persons, manifests the limited scope of  101(6) and the written order clause.  Pp.  441 U. S. 60-62.
(d) In essence, the written order clause embodies two causal requirements.  First, the written order to vacate must result directly from an actual or contemplated property acquisition.  Second, and more fundamentally, that acquisition must be ""for,"" or intended to further, a federal program or project.  In combination, these two causal requirements substantially limit applicability of the clause, so that persons directed to vacate property for a federal program cannot obtain relocation assistance unless the agency also intended at the time of acquisition to use the property for such a program or project.  Thus, a program developed after the agency procures property will not suffice, even though it necessitates displacements, since that program could not have motivated the property acquisition.  Pp.  441 U. S. 62-63.
2. Here, the relationship between HUD's acquisitions and orders to 
Page 441 U. S. 41
 vacate does not bring the tenants within the purview of  101(6).  Pp.  441 U. S. 63-67.
(a) The Relocation Act's legislative history demonstrates that the mere anticipation and authorization of default acquisitions in the National Housing Act mortgage insurance programs cannot render these tenants eligible for relocation assistance under  101(6).  By requiring that an acquisition be ""for"" a federal program or project, Congress intended that the acquisition must further or accomplish a program designed to benefit the public as a whole.  Even assuming that the mortgage insurance programs constitute federal ""programs or projects,"" default acquisitions arising out of those programs do not satisfy  101(6)'s causality requirements.  Although these default acquisitions occur as a result of the mortgage insurance programs' failures, they do not further the purpose of these particular programs.  Pp.  441 U. S. 665.
(b) In addition, HUD's adoption of a property management plan cannot retroactively establish the requisite purpose for acquiring property in the first instance.  P.  441 U. S. 65.
(c) Even though HUD's demolition plan in No. 77-1463 is the type of program or project to which  101(6) refers, HUD did not acquire the project for that purpose.  The statute requires more than a causal connection between the order to vacate and the demolition program.  The program or project must also be the reason for acquiring the property.  Without the requisite relationship between the demolition program and the acquisition, HUD's proposal for disposing of the housing project is no different than any other property management plan, insufficient by itself to confer eligibility under  101(6).  Pp.  441 U. S. 65-66.

			"|"Alexander v. United States Department
of Housing and Urban Development
No. 77-874
Argued December 5, 1978
Decided April 17, 1979*
441 U.S. 39

Syllabus 
The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Relocation Act) makes relocation benefits available for individuals and businesses that satisfy the statutory definition of a ""displaced person.""  Section 101(6) of the Act defines that term to include
""any person who . . . moves . . . as a result of the acquisition of . . . real property . . . or as a result of the written order of the acquiring agency to vacate real property, for a program or project undertaken by a Federal agency.""
Both of these cases involve tenants displaced from housing projects that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) acquired because the projects' sponsors defaulted on federally insured loans.  Petitioners in No. 77-874 were dislocated by HUD's subsequent closing of an Indianapolis, Ind., housing project, and HUD refused to provide relocation benefits for these tenants.  Petitioners then initiated this action in Federal District Court, claiming that they were ""displaced persons"" under the written order clause of  101(6).  The District Court rejected the tenants' statutory construction and granted summary judgment for HUD.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that  101(6) encompasses only displacements for programs designed to benefit the public as a whole or to fulfill a public need, not dislocations caused by the irretrievable failure of a public housing project.  Respondents in No. 77-1463 were displaced when HUD determined that a Washington, D.C., project should be demolished and the land sold to private developers.  When HUD ordered the tenants to vacate but declined to extend assistance under the Relocation Act, respondents brought suit in Federal District Court.  The court agreed that the dislocated tenants were covered by the written order clause of  101(6), and granted summary judgment for respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the written order 
Page 441 U. S. 40
 clause encompasses all persons ordered to vacate so that an agency's property can be devoted to a federal program ""designed for the benefit of the public as a whole.""  Because HUD's demolition plans met this description, the tenants HUD directed to move were considered ""displaced persons.""
Held:
1. The written order clause of  101(6) encompasses only those persons ordered to vacate in connection with the actual or proposed acquisition of property for a federal. program.  Pp.  441 U. S. 49-63.
(a) Both the language and origins of the Relocation Act demonstrate that Congress intended to provide relocation assistance when property is acquired for federal programs, not to extend assistance beyond that limited context for all persons somehow displaced by Government programs.  Pp.  441 U. S. 49-53.
(b) Similarly, the legislative history of the written order clause reveals no congressional intent to extend relocation benefits beyond the acquisition context.  Rather, this clause was designed to ensure that assistance is available for a distinct group of persons directed to move because of a contemplated acquisition, whether the agency ultimately acquires the property or not.  Thus, the clause applies only when a proposed acquisition directly causes issuance of the notice to vacate and the property acquisition is intended to further a federal program or project.  Pp.  441 U. S. 53-59.
(c) The structure of the Relocation Act, as well as the statutory provisions specifying the benefits available for displaced persons, manifests the limited scope of  101(6) and the written order clause.  Pp.  441 U. S. 60-62.
(d) In essence, the written order clause embodies two causal requirements.  First, the written order to vacate must result directly from an actual or contemplated property acquisition.  Second, and more fundamentally, that acquisition must be ""for,"" or intended to further, a federal program or project.  In combination, these two causal requirements substantially limit applicability of the clause, so that persons directed to vacate property for a federal program cannot obtain relocation assistance unless the agency also intended at the time of acquisition to use the property for such a program or project.  Thus, a program developed after the agency procures property will not suffice, even though it necessitates displacements, since that program could not have motivated the property acquisition.  Pp.  441 U. S. 62-63.
2. Here, the relationship between HUD's acquisitions and orders to 
Page 441 U. S. 41
 vacate does not bring the tenants within the purview of  101(6).  Pp.  441 U. S. 63-67.
(a) The Relocation Act's legislative history demonstrates that the mere anticipation and authorization of default acquisitions in the National Housing Act mortgage insurance programs cannot render these tenants eligible for relocation assistance under  101(6).  By requiring that an acquisition be ""for"" a federal program or project, Congress intended that the acquisition must further or accomplish a program designed to benefit the public as a whole.  Even assuming that the mortgage insurance programs constitute federal ""programs or projects,"" default acquisitions arising out of those programs do not satisfy  101(6)'s causality requirements.  Although these default acquisitions occur as a result of the mortgage insurance programs' failures, they do not further the purpose of these particular programs.  Pp.  441 U. S. 665.
(b) In addition, HUD's adoption of a property management plan cannot retroactively establish the requisite purpose for acquiring property in the first instance.  P.  441 U. S. 65.
(c) Even though HUD's demolition plan in No. 77-1463 is the type of program or project to which  101(6) refers, HUD did not acquire the project for that purpose.  The statute requires more than a causal connection between the order to vacate and the demolition program.  The program or project must also be the reason for acquiring the property.  Without the requisite relationship between the demolition program and the acquisition, HUD's proposal for disposing of the housing project is no different than any other property management plan, insufficient by itself to confer eligibility under  101(6).  Pp.  441 U. S. 65-66.
No. 77-874, 555 F.2d 166, affirmed; No. 77-1463, 187 U.S.App.D.C. 156, 571 F.2d 590, reversed.

441 U.S. 68

Syllabus 
Held:  A New York statute forbidding permanent certification as a public school teacher of any person who is not a United States citizen unless that person has manifested an intention to apply for citizenship does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  441 U. S. 72-81.
(a) As a general principle, some state functions are so bound up with the operation of the State as a governmental entity as to permit exclusion from those functions of all persons who have not become part of the process of self-government.  Accordingly, a State is required to justify its exclusion of aliens from such governmental positions only ""by a showing of some rational relationship between the interest sought to be protected and the limiting classification.""  Foley v. Connelie, 435 U. S. 291,  435 U. S. 296.  Pp  441 U. S. 73-74.
(b) This rule for governmental functions, which is an exception to the stricter general standard applicable to classifications based on alienage, rests on important principles inherent in the Constitution.  The distinction between citizens and aliens, though ordinarily irrelevant to private activity, is fundamental to the definition and government of a State, and the references to such distinction in the Constitution itself indicate that the status of citizenship was meant to have significance in the structure of our government.  It is because of this special significance of citizenship that governmental entities, when exercising the functions of government, have wider latitude in limiting the participation of noncitizens.  P.  441 U. S. 75.
(c) Taking into consideration the role of public education and the degree of responsibility and discretion teachers possess in fulfilling that role, it is clear that public school teachers come well within the ""governmental function"" principle recognized in Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U. S. 634, and Foley v. Connelie, supra, and, accordingly, the Constitution requires only that a citizenship requirement applicable to teaching in the public school bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.  Pp.  441 U. S. 75-80.

(d) Here, the statute in question does bear a rational relationship to the State's interest in furthering its educational goals, especially with respect to regarding all teachers as having an obligation to promote civic virtues and understanding in their classes, regardless of the subject taught.

441 U.S. 91

Syllabus 
Section 812 of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (Act) provides that the rights granted by  804 against racial discrimination in the sales or rental of housing ""may be enforced by civil actions in appropriate United States district courts.""  Respondents (the village of Bellwood, one Negro and four white residents of Bellwood, and one Negro resident of a neighboring municipality) brought separate actions in District Court under  812 against petitioners (two real estate brokerage firms and certain of their employees), alleging that they had violated  804 by ""steering"" prospective Negro homeowners toward a specified 12- by 13-block integrated area (""target"" area) of Bellwood and by steering white customers away from the ""target"" area.  It was further alleged that Bellwood had been injured by having its housing market wrongfully manipulated to the economic and social detriment of its citizens, and that the individual respondents had been denied their right to select housing without regard to race, and had been deprived of the social and professional benefits of living in an integrated society.  Monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief was sought.  Prior to bringing suit, the individual respondents, purportedly, but not in fact, seeking to purchase homes, had acted as ""testers"" in an attempt to determine whether petitioners were engaged in racial steering.  Four of the six individual respondents reside in the ""target"" area.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the petitioners in both cases, holding that respondents, who had acted only as testers, and thus were, at most, indirect victims of the alleged violations, lacked standing to sue under  812, which was limited to actions by ""direct victims"" of violations.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that, although the individual respondents lacked standing in their capacity as testers, they were entitled to prove that the discriminatory practices documented by their testing deprived them, as residents of the adversely affected area, of the social and professional benefits of living in an integrated society; that the requirements of Art. III had been satisfied as to both the individual respondents and respondent village; that  810 of the Act -- which provides that a ""person aggrieved"" by a violation of the 
Page 441 U. S. 92
 Act may seek conciliation from the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and, if conciliation fails, bring suit in district court -- and  812 provide alternative remedies available to precisely the same class of plaintiffs; and that the conclusion in Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S. 205,  409 U. S. 209, that standing under  810 extends ""as broadly as is permitted by Article III,'"" is applicable to cases brought under  812.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals correctly interpreted  810 and 812 as providing alternative remedies to precisely the same class of plaintiffs, with the result that standing under  812, like that under  810, is as broad as is permitted by Art. III.  Trafficante, supra.  This construction of the Act is consistent with both its language and its legislative history, and with the interpretation of HUD, the agency primarily assigned to implement and administer the Act.  Pp.  441 U. S. 100-109.
2. The facts alleged in the complaints and revealed by initial discovery are sufficient to provide standing to respondents under Art. III, except with respect to the two individual respondents who do not reside within the ""target"" area, and thus summary judgments for petitioners should not have been entered.  Pp.  441 U. S. 109-116.
(a) If, as alleged, petitioners' sales practices actually have begun to rob Bellwood of its racial balance and stability, the village has standing to challenge the legality of that conduct.  Pp.  441 U. S. 109-111.
(b) The allegation that the ""target"" area is losing its integrated character because of petitioners' conduct is sufficient to satisfy Art. III with respect to the individual respondents who reside in that area.  The constitutional limits of these respondents' standing to protest the intentional segregation of their community do not vary simply because that community is defined in terms of city blocks rather than, as in Trafficante, supra, by reference to apartment buildings, but instead are determined by the presence or absence of a ""distinct and palpable injury"" to respondents.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490,  422 U. S. 501.  Moreover, to the extent that the complaints allege economic injury to these respondents resulting from a diminution in the value of their homes due to petitioners' conduct, convincing evidence of such a decrease in value would be sufficient under Art. III to allow standing to contest the legality of that conduct.  Pp.  441 U. S. 111-115.

 John Buford IRVING, IIIv. State of MISSISSIPPINo. 78-5873 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 16, 1979
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I adhere to my view that the death penalty is unconstitutional under all circumstances. Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 
Page 441 U.S. 913 , 914
 238, 314 (1972) (MARSHALL, J., concurring); Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231 (1976) ( MARSHALL, J., dissenting). I would therefore grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence on this basis alone. However, because the Mississippi Supreme Court's ruling on an issue of joint representation appears inconsistent with this Court's prior decisions, I believe certiorari should be granted on that ground as well. 
 Petitioner John Irving was indicted in Pontotoc County, Miss. on July 7, 1976, for capital murder. Both petitioner and a separately indicted accomplice, Keith Givhan, retained the same counsel. On November 8, 1976, the day before petitioner's trial, his attorney filed a motion to withdraw because of a conflict of interest. Counsel did, however, express his willingness to continue representing Givhan, whose trial was scheduled for the following week. After a hearing, the circuit court denied the motion and petitioner's case proceeded to trial. A jury found petitioner guilty as charged and sentenced him to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. Irving v. State, 361 So.2d 1360 (1978).

 John Buford IRVING, IIIv. State of MISSISSIPPINo. 78-5873 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 16, 1979
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I adhere to my view that the death penalty is unconstitutional under all circumstances. Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 
Page 441 U.S. 913 , 914
 238, 314 (1972) (MARSHALL, J., concurring); Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231 (1976) ( MARSHALL, J., dissenting). I would therefore grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence on this basis alone. However, because the Mississippi Supreme Court's ruling on an issue of joint representation appears inconsistent with this Court's prior decisions, I believe certiorari should be granted on that ground as well. 
 Petitioner John Irving was indicted in Pontotoc County, Miss. on July 7, 1976, for capital murder. Both petitioner and a separately indicted accomplice, Keith Givhan, retained the same counsel. On November 8, 1976, the day before petitioner's trial, his attorney filed a motion to withdraw because of a conflict of interest. Counsel did, however, express his willingness to continue representing Givhan, whose trial was scheduled for the following week. After a hearing, the circuit court denied the motion and petitioner's case proceeded to trial. A jury found petitioner guilty as charged and sentenced him to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. Irving v. State, 361 So.2d 1360 (1978). 
 In the affidavit supporting his motion to withdraw, petitioner's counsel identified several potential sources of conflict. Each defendant had given an inculpatory statement implicating the other. Also, during the period of pretrial incarceration, each had developed inconsistent theories of defense. Finally, plea negotiations with the local district and county attorneys had raised the possibility of a bargain in one case but not the other. Under those circumstances, counsel averred that he could not, based on his ""reading of Glasser [v.

440 U.S. 689

Syllabus 
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) promulgated rules requiring cable television systems that have 3,500 or more subscribers and carry broadcast signals to develop, at a minimum, a 20-channel capacity by 1986, to make available certain channels for access by public, educational, local governmental, and leased-access users, and to furnish equipment and facilities for access purposes.  Under the rules, cable operators are deprived of all discretion regarding who may exploit their access channels and what may be transmitted over such channels.  During the rulemaking proceedings, the FCC rejected a challenge to the rules on jurisdictional grounds, maintaining that the rules would promote
""the achievement of longstanding communications regulatory objectives by increasing outlets for local self-expression and augmenting the public's choice of programs.""
On petition for review, the Court of Appeals set aside the FCC's rules as beyond the agency's jurisdiction.  The court was of the view that the rules amounted to an attempt to impose common carrier obligations on cable operators, and thus ran counter to the command of  3(h) of the Communications Act of 1934 that ""a person engaged in . . . broadcasting shall not . . . be deemed a common carrier.""
Held:  The FCC's rules are not ""reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of the Commission's various responsibilities for the regulation of television broadcasting,"" United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U. S. 157,  392 U. S. 178, and hence are not within the FCC's statutory authority.  Pp.  440 U. S. 696-709.
(a) The FCC's access rules plainly impose common carrier obligations on cable operators.  United States v. Midwest Video Corp., 406 U. S. 649, distinguished.  Under the rules, cable systems are required to hold out dedicated channels on a first-come, nondiscriminatory basis; operators are prohibited from determining or influencing the content of access

(b) Consistently with the policy of the Act to preserve editorial control of programming in the licensee,  3(h) forecloses any discretion in the FCC to impose access requirements amounting to common carrier obligations on broadcast systems.  The provision's background manifests a congressional belief that the intrusion worked by such regulation on the journalistic integrity of broadcasters would overshadow any benefits associated with the resulting public access.  Although  3(h) does not explicitly limit the regulation of cable systems, Congress' limitation on the FCC's ability to advance objectives associated with public access at the expense of the journalistic freedom of persons engaged in broadcasting is not one having peculiar applicability to television broadcasting.  Its force is not diminished by the variant technology involved in cable transmissions.  Pp.  440 U. S. 702-707.
(c) In light of the hesitancy with which Congress has approached the access issue in the broadcast area, and in view of its outright rejection of a broad right of public access on a common carrier basis, this Court is constrained to hold that the FCC exceeded the limits of its authority in promulgating its access rules.  The FCC may not regulate cable systems as common carriers, just as it may not impose such obligations on television broadcasters.

|440 u.s. 715|"United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc.
No. 77-1359
Argued January 8, 1979
Decided April 2, 1979*
440 U.S. 715

Syllabus 
These cases present the question whether contractual liens arising from certain federal loan programs take precedence over private liens, absent a federal statute that sets priorities.  Resolution of this question requires determination of whether federal or state law governs the conflicting claims, and, if federal law applies, whether a uniform priority rule should be fashioned or state commercial law should be incorporated as the federal rule of decision.  In No. 77-1359, the United States' contractual lien secures a loan guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Small Business Act, which generally does not specify priority rules to govern SBA security interests.  The private lien of respondent Kimbell Foods, Inc. (Kimbell), arose from security agreements that were executed before the federal guarantee and secured advances that Kimbell made after the federal guarantee.  Both the federal and private security interests, which covered the same collateral, were perfected pursuant to Texas' Uniform Commercial Code.  The District Court found that the Government's lien was superior to Kimbell's.  In so ruling, it applied the first-in-time and choateness doctrines, rules originally developed to afford federal statutory tax liens special priority over state and private liens where the governing statute does not specify priorities.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's judgment.  While agreeing that federal law governed the controversy, and that the ""first in time, first in right"" priority principle controlled the competing claims, the court refused to extend the choateness rule to situations in which the Government was a voluntary lender.  Instead, the Court of Appeals fashioned a federal common law rule whereby the first lien to meet Uniform Commercial Code perfection requirements achieved priority, and held that, under this rule, Kimbell's lien was superior.  Although the Court of Appeals did not adopt Texas law, it did determine that Texas law would also afford priority to Kimbell's security interests.  In No. 77-1644, a borrower obtained several loans from the Farmers Home Administration (FHA) under the Consolidated Farmers Home Administration Act of 1961 (now 
Page 440 U. S. 716
 redesignated the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act), which does not establish rules of priority.  To secure the loans, the FHA obtained a security interest in the borrower's crops and farm equipment, and perfected its interest by filing a standard financing statement with Georgia officials.  Subsequently, respondent repaired the borrower's tractor on numerous occasions.  When the borrower failed to pay the repair bills, respondent retained the tractor and acquired a lien therein under Georgia law.  After the borrower had filed for bankruptcy and had been discharged from his debts, the United States instituted this action to obtain possession of the tractor.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondent, holding that the FHA had not properly perfected its security interest because the financing statement inadequately described the collateral; and that, even if the description were sufficient, both federal and state law accorded priority to respondent's lien.  Affirming in part and reversing in part, the Court of Appeals fashioned a federal rule, based on the Model Uniform Commercial Code, to determine the validity of the financing statement.  It found the description of the collateral adequate to perfect the FHA's security interest.  As to the priority question, the Court of Appeals rejected state law, as well as the first-in-time and choateness doctrines.  In their place the court devised a special ""federal commercial law rule"" giving priority to repairman's liens when the repairman continuously possesses the property from the time his lien arises.  The court concluded that, under this rule, respondent's lien for only the final repair bill took precedence over the FHA's security interest.
Held:
1. The priority of liens stemming from federal lending programs must be determined with reference to federal law.  Since both the SBA and the FHA derive their authority to effectuate loan transactions from specific Acts of Congress passed in the exercise of a ""constitutional function or power,"" Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U. S. 363,  318 U. S. 366, their rights, as well, should derive from a federal source.  That the statutes authorizing these federal lending programs do not specify the appropriate rule of decision in no way limits the reach of federal law.  Pp.  440 U. S. 726-727
2. Because a national rule is unnecessary to protect the federal interests underlying the SBA and FHA loan programs, the relative priority of private liens and consensual liens arising from the programs is to be determined under nondiscriminatory state laws, absent a congressional directive to the contrary.  Pp.  440 U. S. 727-740.
(a) Incorporating state law to determine the rights of the United States as against private creditors will in no way hinder administration of the SBA and FHA loan programs.  The agencies' own operating 
Page 440 U. S. 717
 practices, which recognize that the Government's security interests are controlled by the commercial law of each State, belie the assertion that a uniform rule of priority is needed to avoid the administrative burdens created by disparate state commercial rules.  Pp.  440 U. S. 729-733.
(b) Deference to customary commercial practices will not conflict with the objectives of the lending programs.  The SBA and FHA loan programs are a form of social welfare legislation, primarily designed to assist farmers and businesses that cannot obtain funds from private lenders on reasonable terms.  If Congress had intended the private commercial sector, rather than taxpayers in general, to bear the risks of default entailed by these public welfare programs, it would have established a priority scheme displacing state law.  Since the Government is in substantially the same position as private lenders when it extends funds under the programs, the special status it seeks is unnecessary to safeguard the public fisc.  Pp.  440 U. S. 733-738.
(c) Rejecting well established commercial rules which have proven workable over time could undermine the stability on which the commercial community depends in making reliable evaluations of risk.  Absent concrete reasons for altering settled commercial practices, the prudent course is to adopt the ready-made body of state law as the federal rule of decision until Congress strikes a different accommodation.  Pp.  440 U. S. 739-740.
3. The judgment in No. 77-1359 is affirmed, since the Court of Appeals found that Texas law gave preference to Kimbell's lien.  The judgment in No. 77-1644 is vacated, and the case is remanded for determination of whether the FHA's financing statement is sufficient under Georgia law, and whether Georgia treats repairman's liens as superior to previously perfected consensual liens.  P.  440 U. S. 740.
No. 77-1359, 557 F.2d 491, affirmed; No. 77-1644, 563 F.2d 678, vacated and remanded.

(b) Deference to customary commercial practices will not conflict with the objectives of the lending programs.  The SBA and FHA loan programs are a form of social welfare legislation, primarily designed to assist farmers and businesses that cannot obtain funds from private lenders on reasonable terms.  If Congress had intended the private commercial sector, rather than taxpayers in general, to bear the risks of default entailed by these public welfare programs, it would have established a priority scheme displacing state law.  Since the Government is in substantially the same position as private lenders when it extends funds under the programs, the special status it seeks is unnecessary to safeguard the public fisc.  Pp.  440 U. S. 733-738.
(c) Rejecting well established commercial rules which have proven workable over time could undermine the stability on which the commercial community depends in making reliable evaluations of risk.  Absent concrete reasons for altering settled commercial practices, the prudent course is to adopt the ready-made body of state law as the federal rule of decision until Congress strikes a different accommodation.  Pp.  440 U. S. 739-740.
3. The judgment in No. 77-1359 is affirmed, since the Court of Appeals found that Texas law gave preference to Kimbell's lien.  The judgment in No. 77-1644 is vacated, and the case is remanded for determination of whether the FHA's financing statement is sufficient under Georgia law, and whether Georgia treats repairman's liens as superior to previously perfected consensual liens.  P.  440 U. S. 740.

Syllabus 
Regulations in the Internal Revenue Service Manual prohibit ""consensual electronic surveillance"" between taxpayers and IRS agents unless certain specified prior authorization is obtained. With respect to the monitoring of face-to-face (nontelephone) conversations, the Director of the Internal Security Division or the Assistant Commissioner (Inspection) of the IRS may authorize the recording of such conversations in emergency situations, but if there is at least 48 hours in which to obtain approval, a signed request must also be submitted to the Attorney General or a designated Assistant Attorney General.  In connection with the audit of the income tax returns of respondent and his wife, an IRS agent met with respondent on, among other dates, January 31 and February 6, 1975.  Emergency approval for the use of electronic equipment at both meetings was obtained, pending a request to the Justice Department for authority to monitor conversations with respondent for a 30-day period, but such authority was never obtained for the January 31 and February 6 meetings.  At these meetings, respondent, unaware of the surveillance, paid or offered money to the agent for a favorable resolution of the audit.  The agent at both meetings wore a concealed radio transmitter which allowed other agents to monitor and record the conversations.  Subsequently, respondent was prosecuted for bribing the IRS agent.  At his trial, he moved to suppress tape recordings of the conversations on the ground that the authorizations required by the IRS regulations had not been secured.  The District Court granted the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Both courts held that the meetings had not been monitored in accordance with the IRS regulations, concluding that neither meeting fell within the emergency provision of the regulations because the exigencies were the product of ""government-created scheduling problems.""
Held:  The tape recordings, and the testimony of the agents who monitored the meetings in question, were not required to be excluded from evidence because of the conceded violation of the IRS regulations.  Pp.  440 U. S. 749-757.
(a) While a court has a duty to enforce an agency regulation when compliance with the regulation is mandated by the Constitution or federal law, here the agency was not required either by the Constitution, Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427; United States v. White, 401 U.S.

 745, or by statute, Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U. S. 135, distinguished, to adopt any particular procedures or rules before engaging in consensual monitoring and recording.  Pp.  440 U. S. 749-751.
(b) None of respondent's constitutional rights was violated either by the actual recording or by the agency's violation of its own regulations.  That respondent's conversations were monitored without Justice Department approval, whereas conversations of others similarly situated would, assuming the IRS generally follows its own regulations, be recorded only with such approval, does not amount to a denial of equal protection.  Nor does the IRS officials' construction of the situation as an emergency, even if erroneous, raise any constitutional questions.  And this is not a case in which the Due Process Clause is implicated, since respondent cannot reasonably contend that he relied on the regulations or that their breach had any effect on his conduct.  Finally, the Administrative Procedure Act provides no grounds for judicial enforcement of the violated regulations, since the remedy sought is not invalidation of the agency action, but rather judicial enforcement of the regulations by means of the exclusionary rule.  Pp.  440 U. S. 751-755.
(c) This Court declines to adopt any rigid exclusionary rule, such as is urged by respondent, whereby all evidence obtained in violation of regulations concerning electronic eavesdropping would be excluded.  Nor can this Court accept respondent's further argument that, even without a rigid rule of exclusion, his is a case in which evidence secured in violation of agency regulations should be excluded under a more limited, individualized approach, since, to the contrary, this case exemplifies those situations in which evidence would not be excluded under a case-by-case approach, it appearing that the agency action, though later found to violate the regulations, nonetheless reflected a reasonable, good faith attempt to comply in a situation in which monitoring was appropriate and would have received Justice Department approval if the request had been received more promptly.

441 U.S. 238

Syllabus 
Pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, the District Court, finding probable cause to believe that petitioner was a member of a conspiracy the purpose of which was to steal goods being shipped in interstate commerce, granted the Government's request for authorization to intercept all oral communications taking place in petitioner's business office.  Petitioner was subsequently convicted of receiving stolen goods and conspiring to transport, receive, and possess stolen goods.  At a hearing on his motion to suppress evidence obtained under the bugging order, it was shown that, although such order did not explicitly authorize entry of petitioner's business office, FBI agents had entered the office secretly at midnight on the day of the bugging order and had spent three hours installing an electronic bug in the ceiling.  Denying petitioner's motion to suppress, the District Court ruled that, under Title III, a covert entry to install electronic eavesdropping equipment is not unlawful merely because the court approving the surveillance did not explicitly authorize such an entry.  Affirming petitioner's conviction, the Court of Appeals rejected his contention that separate court authorization was necessary for the covert entry of his office.
Held:
1. The Fourth Amendment does not prohibit per se a covert entry performed for the purpose of installing otherwise legal electronic bugging equipment.  Implicit in decisions such as Irvine v. California, 347 U. S. 12, and Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, has been this Court's view that covert entries are constitutional in some circumstances, at least if they are made pursuant to warrant.  Petitioner's argument that covert entries are unconstitutional for their lack of notice is frivolous, as was indicated in Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347,  39 U. S. 355 n. 16, where this Court stated that
""officers need not announce their purpose before conducting an otherwise [duly] authorized search if such an announcement would provoke the escape of the suspect or the destruction of critical evidence.""
Pp.  441 U. S. 246-248.
2. Congress has given the courts statutory authority to approve covert entries for the purpose of installing electronic surveillance equipment.  Although Title III does not refer explicitly to covert entry, the language, 
Page 441 U. S. 239
 structure, purpose, and history of the statute demonstrate that Congress meant to authorize courts -- in certain specified circumstances -- to approve electronic surveillance without limitation on the means necessary to its accomplishment, so long as they are reasonable under the circumstances.  Congress clearly understood that it was conferring power upon the courts to authorize covert entries ancillary to their responsibility to review and approve surveillance applications under the statute.  Pp.  441 U. S. 249-254.
3. The Fourth Amendment does not require that a Title III electronic surveillance order include a specific authorization to enter covertly the premises described in the order.  Pp.  441 U. S. 254-259.
(a) The Warrant  Clause of the Fourth Amendment requires only that warrants be issued by neutral, disinterested magistrates, that those seeking the warrant must demonstrate to the magistrate their probable cause to believe that the evidence sought will aid in a particular apprehension or conviction for a particular offense, and that warrants must particularly describe the things to be seized, as well as the place to be searched.  Here, the bugging order was a warrant issued in full compliance with these traditional Fourth Amendment requirements.  Pp.  441 U. S. 255-256.
(b) Nothing in the language of the Constitution or in this Court's decisions interpreting that language suggests that, in addition to these requirements, search warrants also must include a specification of the precise manner in which they are to be executed.  On the contrary, it is generally left to the discretion of the executing officers to determine the details of how best to proceed with the performance of a search authorized by warrant -- subject to the general Fourth Amendment protection ""against unreasonable searches and seizures.""  Pp.  441 U. S. 256-257.
(c) An interpretation of the Warrant  Clause so as to require that, whenever it is reasonably likely that Fourth Amendment rights may be affected in more than one way, the court must set forth precisely the procedures to be followed by the executing officers, is unnecessary, since the manner in which a warrant is executed is subject to later judicial review as to its reasonableness.  More important, it would promote empty formalism were this Court to require magistrates to make explicit what unquestionably is implicit in bugging authorizations:  that a covert entry, with its attendant interference with Fourth Amendment interests, may be necessary for the installation of the surveillance equipment.

Syllabus 
Respondents, representing present and future black and Mexican-American applicants to the Los Angeles County Fire Department, brought a class action against petitioners (Los Angeles County, and the County Board of Supervisors and Civil Service Commission), alleging, inter alia, that petitioners' hiring procedure whereby they proposed to interview the top 544 scorers (of whom 492 were white, 10 were black, and 33 were Mexican-American) on a 1972 written civil service examination in order to fill temporary emergency manpower needs in the Fire Department, violated 42 U.S.C.  1981.  The District Court, in 1973, held that the procedure, though not discriminatorily motivated, violated  1981 because the 1972 examination had not been validated as predictive of job performance, and accordingly the court permanently enjoined all future discrimination and mandated good faith affirmative action efforts.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The controversy has become moot during the pendency of the litigation.  Pp.  440 U. S. 631-634.
(a) Jurisdiction, properly acquired, may abate if a case becomes moot because (1) there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur, and (2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.  When both conditions are satisfied, the case is moot because neither party has a legally cognizable interest in the final determination of the underlying questions of fact and law.  P.  440 U. S. 631.
(b) Here the first condition is met, because there can be no reasonable expectation that petitioners will use an unvalidated civil service examination for the purposes contemplated in 1972.  The temporary emergency firefighter shortage and lack of an alternative means of screening job applicants existing at that time were unique, are no longer present, and are unlikely to recur because, since the commencement of the litigation, petitioners have instituted an efficient and nonrandom method of screening job applicants and increasing minority representation in the Fire Department.  Pp.  440 U. S. 631-633.
(c) The second condition of mootness is met because petitioners' compliance since 1973 with the District Court's decree and their hiring

Decided March 27, 1979
440 U.S. 648

Syllabus 
A patrolman in a police cruiser stopped an automobile occupied by respondent and seized marihuana in plain view on the car floor.  Respondent was subsequently indicted for illegal possession of a controlled substance.  At a hearing on respondent's motion to suppress the marihuana, the patrolman testified that, prior to stopping the vehicle, he had observed neither traffic or equipment violations nor any suspicious activity, and that he made the stop only in order to check the driver's license and the car's registration.  The patrolman was not acting pursuant to any standards, guidelines, or procedures pertaining to document spot checks, promulgated by either his department or the State Attorney General.  The trial court granted the motion to suppress, finding the stop and detention to have been wholly capricious, and therefore violative of the Fourth Amendment.  The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction in this case even though the Delaware Supreme Court held that the stop at issue not only violated the Federal Constitution but also was impermissible under the Delaware Constitution.  That court's opinion shows that, even if the State Constitution would have provided an adequate basis for the judgment below, the court did not intend to rest its decision independently on the State Constitution, its holding instead depending upon its view of the reach of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  440 U. S. 651-653.
2. Except where there is at least articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or that either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law, stopping an automobile and detaining the driver in order to check his driver's license and the registration of the automobile are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  440 U. S. 653-663.
(a) Stopping an automobile and detaining its occupants constitute a ""seizure"" within the meaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.  The permissibility of a particular law enforcement practice is judged by balancing its intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.  Pp.  440 U. S. 653-655. 
Page 440 U. S. 649

(b) The State's interest in discretionary spot checks as a means of ensuring the safety of its roadways does not outweigh the resulting intrusion on the privacy and security of the persons detained.

			"|"Delaware v. Prouse
No. 77-1571
Argued January 17, 1979
Decided March 27, 1979
440 U.S. 648

Syllabus 
A patrolman in a police cruiser stopped an automobile occupied by respondent and seized marihuana in plain view on the car floor.  Respondent was subsequently indicted for illegal possession of a controlled substance.  At a hearing on respondent's motion to suppress the marihuana, the patrolman testified that, prior to stopping the vehicle, he had observed neither traffic or equipment violations nor any suspicious activity, and that he made the stop only in order to check the driver's license and the car's registration.  The patrolman was not acting pursuant to any standards, guidelines, or procedures pertaining to document spot checks, promulgated by either his department or the State Attorney General.  The trial court granted the motion to suppress, finding the stop and detention to have been wholly capricious, and therefore violative of the Fourth Amendment.  The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction in this case even though the Delaware Supreme Court held that the stop at issue not only violated the Federal Constitution but also was impermissible under the Delaware Constitution.  That court's opinion shows that, even if the State Constitution would have provided an adequate basis for the judgment below, the court did not intend to rest its decision independently on the State Constitution, its holding instead depending upon its view of the reach of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  440 U. S. 651-653.
2. Except where there is at least articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or that either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law, stopping an automobile and detaining the driver in order to check his driver's license and the registration of the automobile are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  440 U. S. 653-663.
(a) Stopping an automobile and detaining its occupants constitute a ""seizure"" within the meaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.  The permissibility of a particular law enforcement practice is judged by balancing its intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.  Pp.  440 U. S. 653-655. 
Page 440 U. S. 649

(b) The State's interest in discretionary spot checks as a means of ensuring the safety of its roadways does not outweigh the resulting intrusion on the privacy and security of the persons detained.  Given the physical and psychological intrusion visited upon the occupants of a vehicle by a random stop to check documents, cf. United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. 3. 873; United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543, the marginal contribution to roadway safety possibly resulting from a system of spot checks cannot justify subjecting every occupant of every vehicle on the roads to a seizure at the unbridled discretion of law enforcement officials.  Pp.  440 U. S. 655-661.
(c) An individual operating or traveling in an automobile does not lose all reasonable expectation of privacy simply because the automobile and its use are subject to government regulation.  People are not shorn of all Fourth Amendment protection when they step from their homes onto the public sidewalk; nor are they shorn of those interests when they step from the sidewalks into their automobiles.

Decided March 27, 1979
440 U.S. 668

Syllabus 
The Union Pacific Act of 1862 granted public land to the Union Pacific Railroad for each mile of track that it laid, and this was done under a system whereby land surrounding the railroad right-of-way was divided into ""checkerboard"" blocks, with odd-numbered lots being granted to the railroad and even-numbered lots being reserved for the Government.  Petitioners, the railroad's successors in fee to certain odd-numbered lots in Wyoming lying in the vicinity of a reservoir area used by the public for fishing and hunting, brought an action to quiet title against the United States after the Govrnment had cleared a road across the Leo Sheep Co.'s land to afford the public access to the reservoir area.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, when Congress granted land to the Union Pacific Railroad, it implicitly reserved an easement to pass over the odd-numbered sections in order to reach the even-numbered sections held by the Government.
Held:  The Government does not have an implied easement to build a road across petitioners' land.  Pp.  440 U. S. 678-688.
(a) The tenuous relevance of the common law doctrine of easement by necessity to the Government's asserted reserved right here is insufficient to overcome the inference prompted by the omission of any reference in the 1862 Act to such a right.  Pp.  440 U. S. 679-682.
(b) Nor does the canon of construction that, when grants to federal lands are at issue, any doubts ""are resolved for the Government, not against it,"" Andrus v.

440 U.S. 490

Syllabus 
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certified unions as bargaining agents for lay teachers in schools operated by respondents, which refused to recognize or bargain with the unions; the NLRB issued cease-and-desist orders against respondents, holding that it had properly assumed jurisdiction over the schools.  Exercise of jurisdiction was asserted to be in line with its policy of declining jurisdiction only when schools are ""completely religious"" not just ""religiously associated,"" as it found to be the case here, because the schools taught secular as well as religious subjects.  On respondents' challenges to the NLRB orders, the Court of Appeals denied enforcement, holding that the NLRB standard failed to provide a workable guide for the exercise of its discretion, and that the NLRB's assumption of jurisdiction was foreclosed by the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.
Held:  Schools operated by a church to teach both religious and secular subjects are not within the jurisdiction granted by the National Labor Relations Act, and the NLRB was therefore without authority to issue the orders against respondents.  Pp.  440 U. S. 499-507.
(a) There would be a significant risk of infringement of the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment if the Act conferred jurisdiction over church-operated schools.  Cf. Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602,  403 U. S. 617.  Pp.  440 U. S. 501-504.
(b) Neither the language of the statute nor its legislative history discloses any affirmative intention by Congress that church-operated schools be within the NLRB's jurisdiction, and, absent a clear expression of Congress' intent to bring teachers of church-operated schools within the NLRB's jurisdiction, the Court will not construe the Act in such a way as would call for the resolution of difficult and sensitive First Amendment questions.

No. 77-961
Argued October 30, 1978

Syllabus 
A New York statute authorizes the payment of unemployment compensation after one week of unemployment, except that, if a claimant's loss of employment is caused by a strike in the place of his employment the payment of benefits is suspended for an additional 7-week period.  Pursuant to this statute, petitioners' striking employees began to collect unemployment compensation after the 8-week waiting period, and were paid benefits for the remaining five months of the strike.  Because New York's unemployment insurance system is financed primarily by employer contributions based on the benefits paid to former employees of each employer in past years, a substantial part of the cost of these benefits was ultimately imposed on petitioners.  Petitioners brought suit in District Court seeking a declaration that the New York statute conflicts with federal law, and is therefore invalid, and injunctive and monetary relief.  The District Court granted the requested relief, holding that the availability of unemployment compensation is a substantial factor in the worker's decision to remain on strike and has a measurable impact on the progress of the strike, and that the payment of such compensation conflicted ""with the policy of free collective bargaining established in the federal labor laws and is therefore invalid under the [S]upremacy [C]lause.""  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although the New York statute conflicts with the federal labor policy, the legislative histories of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and Social Security Act (SSA) indicate that such conflict was one which Congress has decided to tolerate.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  440 U. S. 527-546;  440 U. S. 546-547;  440 U. S. 547-551.
566 F.2d 388, affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by MR. JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that Congress, in enacting the NLRA and SSA, did not intend to preempt a State's power to pay unemployment compensation to strikers.  Pp.  440 U. S. 527-546.
(a) This case does not involve any attempt by the State to regulate or prohibit private conduct in the labor-management field, but rather involves a state program for the distribution of benefits to certain 
Page 440 U. S. 520
 members of the public.  Teamsters v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252, and Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427 U. S. 132, distinguished.  Although the class benefited is primarily made up of employees in the State and the class providing the benefits is primarily made up of employers in the State, and although some members of each class are occasionally engaged in labor disputes, the general purport of the program is not to regulate the bargaining relationship between the two classes, but instead to provide an efficient means of insuring employment security in the State.  Pp.  440 U. S. 527-533.
(b) Rather than being a ""state la[w] regulating the relations between employees, their union, and their employer,"" as to which the reasons underlying the preemption doctrine have their ""greatest force,"" Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Carpenters, 436 U. S. 180,  436 U. S. 193, the New York statute is a law of general applicability.  Since it appears that Congress has been sensitive to the importance of the States' interest in fashioning their own unemployment compensation programs, and especially their own eligibility criteria, Ohio Bureau of Employment Services v. Hodory, 431 U. S. 471; Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548; Batterton v. Francis, 432 U. S. 416, it is appropriate to treat New York's statute with the same deference that this Court has afforded analogous state laws of general applicability that protect interests ""deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility.""  With respect to such laws, ""in the absence of compelling congressional direction,"" it will not be inferred that Congress ""had deprived the States of the power to act.""  San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236,  359 U. S. 244.  Pp.  440 U. S. 533-540.
(c) The omission of any direction concerning payment of unemployment compensation to strikers in either the NLRA or SSA implies that Congress intended that the States be free to authorize, or to prohibit, such payments, an intention confirmed by frequent discussions in Congress subsequent to 1935 (when both of those Acts were passed) wherein the question of payments to strikers was raised but no prohibition against payments was ever imposed.  In any event, a State's power to fashion its own policy concerning the payment of unemployment compensation is not to be denied on the basis of speculation about the unexpressed intent of Congress.  New York has not sought either to regulate private conduct that is subject to the National Labor Relations Board's regulatory jurisdiction or to regulate any private conduct of the parties to a labor dispute, but instead has sought to administer its unemployment compensation program in a manner that it believes best effectuates the purposes of that scheme.  In an area in which Congress has decided to tolerate a substantial measure of diversity, the fact that 
Page 440 U. S. 521
 the implementation of this general state policy affects the relative strength of the antagonists in a bargaining dispute is not a sufficient reason for concluding that Congress intended to preempt that exercise of state power.  Pp.  440 U. S. 540-546.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concluded that the legislative histories of the NLRA and SSA provide sufficient evidence of congressional intent not to preempt a State's power to pay unemployment compensation to strikers, and that therefore it was unnecessary to rely on any purported distinctions between this case and Teamsters v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252, and Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427 U. S. 132.  Pp.  440 U. S. 546-547.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded that, under the preemption analysis of Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427 U. S. 132, the evidence justifies the holding that Congress has decided to permit New York's compensation law notwithstanding its impact on the balance of bargaining power.  He would not apply the requirement that ""compelling congressional direction"" be established before preemption can be found, nor would he find New York's law to be a ""law of general applicability"" under San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236.  Pp.  440 U. S. 547-551.

With respect to such laws, ""in the absence of compelling congressional direction,"" it will not be inferred that Congress ""had deprived the States of the power to act.""  San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236,  359 U. S. 244.  Pp.  440 U. S. 533-540.
(c) The omission of any direction concerning payment of unemployment compensation to strikers in either the NLRA or SSA implies that Congress intended that the States be free to authorize, or to prohibit, such payments, an intention confirmed by frequent discussions in Congress subsequent to 1935 (when both of those Acts were passed) wherein the question of payments to strikers was raised but no prohibition against payments was ever imposed.  In any event, a State's power to fashion its own policy concerning the payment of unemployment compensation is not to be denied on the basis of speculation about the unexpressed intent of Congress.  New York has not sought either to regulate private conduct that is subject to the National Labor Relations Board's regulatory jurisdiction or to regulate any private conduct of the parties to a labor dispute, but instead has sought to administer its unemployment compensation program in a manner that it believes best effectuates the purposes of that scheme.  In an area in which Congress has decided to tolerate a substantial measure of diversity, the fact that 
Page 440 U. S. 521
 the implementation of this general state policy affects the relative strength of the antagonists in a bargaining dispute is not a sufficient reason for concluding that Congress intended to preempt that exercise of state power.  Pp.  440 U. S. 540-546.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concluded that the legislative histories of the NLRA and SSA provide sufficient evidence of congressional intent not to preempt a State's power to pay unemployment compensation to strikers, and that therefore it was unnecessary to rely on any purported distinctions between this case and Teamsters v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252, and Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427 U. S. 132.  Pp.  440 U. S. 546-547.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded that, under the preemption analysis of Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427 U. S. 132, the evidence justifies the holding that Congress has decided to permit New York's compensation law notwithstanding its impact on the balance of bargaining power.  He would not apply the requirement that ""compelling congressional direction"" be established before preemption can be found, nor would he find New York's law to be a ""law of general applicability"" under San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236.  Pp.  440 U. S. 547-551.

No. 77-1427
Argued December 6, 1978
Decided March 21, 1979
440 U.S. 568

Syllabus 
Petitioner, New York City Transit Authority (TA), which, in operating the subway system and certain bus lines in New York City, employs about 47,000 persons, of whom many are employed in positions that involve danger to themselves or to the public, enforces a general policy against employing persons who use narcotic drugs.  TA interprets its drug regulation to encompass current users of methadone, including those receiving methadone maintenance treatment for curing heroin addiction.  Respondents, two former employees of TA who were dismissed while they were receiving methadone treatment, and two persons who were refused employment because they were receiving methadone treatment, brought a class action, alleging, inter alia, that TA's blanket exclusion of all former heroin addicts receiving methadone treatments was illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court found that TA's blanket methadone policy violates the Equal Protection Clause, and granted injunctive relief which, however, authorized TA to exclude methadone users from specific categories of safety-sensitive positions and also to condition eligibility on satisfactory performance in a methadone program for at least a year.  Subsequently, the District Court also held that TA's drug policy violates Title VII because, even though the policy was not adopted with a discriminatory purpose, it nevertheless was not related to any of TA's business needs.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's constitutional holding without reaching the statutory question.
Held:
1. An amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 after certiorari was granted, even if construed to proscribe TA's enforcement of a general rule denying employment to methadone users, does not render the case moot, since respondents' claims arose even before that Act itself was passed, and they have been awarded monetary relief.  More importantly, however this Court might construe that Act, the concerns that prompted the grant of certiorari -- the lower courts' departure from the procedure normally followed in addressing statutory and constitutional questions in the same case, and the concern that those courts 
Page 440 U. S. 569
 erroneously decided the merits of such questions -- would still merit this Court's attention.  Pp.  440 U. S. 580-581.
2. The statistical evidence on which respondents and the District Court relied does not support the conclusion that TA's regulation prohibiting the use of narcotics, or its interpretation of that regulation to encompass users of methadone, violated Title VII.  Pp.  440 U. S. 583-587.
(a) The statistic that 81% of the employees referred to TA's medical director for suspected violations of its narcotics rule were either black or Hispanic indicates nothing about the racial composition of the employees suspected of using methadone, and respondents have only challenged the rule to the extent that it is construed to apply to methadone users.  Nor does the record provide any information about the number of black, Hispanic, or white persons who were dismissed for using methadone.  Pp.  440 U. S. 584-585.
(b) The statistic that about 63% of the persons in New York City receiving methadone maintenance in public programs are black or Hispanic does not indicate how many of these persons ever worked or sought to work for TA; tells nothing about the class of otherwise qualified applicants and employees who have participated in methadone maintenance programs for over a year, the only class improperly excluded by TA's policy under the District Court's analysis; and affords no data on the 14,000 methadone users in private programs, leaving open the possibility that the percentage of blacks and Hispanics in the class of methadone users is not significantly greater than the percentage of those minorities in the general population of New York City.  Pp.  440 U. S. 585-586.
(c) Even if respondents' statistical showing is considered to be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, it is rebutted by TA's demonstration that its narcotics rule (and the rule's application to methadone users) is ""job-related.""  The District Court's finding that the rule was not motivated by racial animus forecloses any claim that it was merely a pretext for intentional discrimination.  P. 587.
3. TA's blanket exclusion of persons who regularly use narcotic drugs, including methadone, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause for failing to include more precise special rules for methadone users who have progressed satisfactorily with their treatment for one year and who, when examined individually, satisfy TA's employment criteria for nonsensitive jobs.  Pp.  440 U. S. 587-594.
(a) An employment policy such as TA's that postpones eligibility for employment until the methadone treatment has been completed, rather than accepting an intermediate point on an uncertain line -- such as one year of treatment -- is rational, and is neither unprincipled nor 
Page 440 U. S. 570
 invidious in the sense that it implies disrespect for the excluded subclass.  Pp.  440 U. S. 590-592.
(b) Even assuming that TA's rule is broader than necessary to exclude those methadone users who are not actually qualified to work for TA, and that it is probably unwise for a large employer like TA to rely on a general rule, instead of individualized considerations of every job applicant, nevertheless, under the circumstances of this case, such assumptions concern matters of personnel policy that do not implicate the principle safeguarded by the Equal Protection Clause.

Syllabus 
Respondent municipal official testified before a state grand jury under immunity granted pursuant to a New Jersey statute preventing a public employee's grand jury testimony or evidence derived therefrom from being used against him in a subsequent criminal proceeding.  Thereafter, respondent was charged with misconduct in office and extortion, and, at his trial, the judge ruled that respondent's grand jury testimony could be used to impeach his credibility if he testified.  As a result of this ruling, respondent did not testify, and he was ultimately convicted.  The New Jersey appellate court held that the use of the immunized grand jury testimony to impeach respondent would have violated the Constitution, and, because respondent's decision not to testify was based on the trial court's erroneous ruling to the contrary, reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial.
Held:  Under the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination made binding on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, respondent's testimony before the grand jury under a grant of immunity could not constitutionally be used against him in the later criminal trial.  Pp.  440 U. S. 453-460.
(a) That respondent did not take the witness stand does not render the constitutional question abstract and hypothetical.  It appears from the record that the trial judge did rule on the merits of such question, and the appellate court necessarily concluded that such question had been properly presented, because it ruled in respondent's favor on the merits.  Moreover, there is nothing in federal law to prohibit New Jersey from following such a procedure, nor, so long as Art. III's ""case or controversy"" requirement is met, to foreclose this Court's consideration of the constitutional issue now that the New Jersey courts have decided it.  Pp.  440 U. S. 454-456.
(b) Testimony given in response to a grant of legislative immunity is the essence of coerced testimony and involves the constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination in its most pristine form.  Thus, any balancing of interests so as to take into account the interest in preventing perjury is not only unnecessary, but impermissible.  Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222, and Oregon v.

No. 77-1119
Argued November 27, 1978
Decided March 5, 1979
440 U.S. 268

Syllabus 
Following a stipulation between appellant husband and appellee wife, in which appellant agreed to pay appellee alimony, an Alabama court, acting pursuant to state alimony statutes under which husbands, but not wives, may be required to pay alimony upon divorce, ordered appellant to make monthly alimony payments.  Some two years thereafter, appellee filed a petition seeking to have appellant adjudged in contempt for failing to maintain the alimony payments.  At the hearing on the petition appellant, though not claiming that he was entitled to an alimony award from appellee, made the contention (advanced for the first time in that proceeding) that the Alabama statutes, by virtue of their reliance on a gender-based classification, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The trial court, ruling adversely to appellant on that issue, entered judgment against him, which was affirmed on appeal.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction over appellant's appeal.  Pp.  440 U. S. 271-278.
(a) Appellant's failure to ask for alimony for himself does not deprive him of standing to attack the constitutionality of the Alabama statutes for underinclusiveness.  That attack holds the only promise of relief from the burden deriving from the challenged statutes, and appellant has therefore
""alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which th[is] court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.""
Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186,  369 U. S. 204.  Pp.  440 U. S. 271-273.
(b) Had the courts below refused to entertain appellant's constitutional contention on the ground that it was not timely made under applicable state procedures, this Court might have lacked jurisdiction to consider the contention; but no timeliness point was raised or considered below and the constitutional issue was decided on the merits.  Under these circumstances, it is irrelevant whether the decision below could have been based upon an adequate and independent state ground.  Pp.  440 U. S. 274-275.
(c) No point was raised or considered below that appellant, by virtue of the stipulation, was obliged to make the alimony payments under state contract law.
""Where the state court does not decide 
Page 440 U. S. 269
 against [an] appellant upon an independent state ground, but deeming the federal question to be before it, actually . . . decides that question adversely to the federal right asserted, this Court has jurisdiction to review the judgment if, as here, it is . . . final. . . .""
Indiana ex rel. Anderson v. Brand, 303 U. S. 95,  303 U. S. 98.  Pp.  440 U. S. 275-278.
2. The Alabama statutory scheme of imposing alimony obligations on husbands, but not wives, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  440 U. S. 278-283.
(a) ""To withstand scrutiny"" under the Equal Protection Clause,
""'classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives, and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.'""
Califano v. Webster, 430 U. S. 313,  430 U. S. 316-317.  Pp.  440 U. S. 278-279.
(b) The statutes cannot be validated on the basis of the State's preference for an allocation of family responsibilities under which the wife plays a dependent role.
""No longer is the female destined solely for the home and the rearing of the family, and only the male for the marketplace and the world of ideas.""
Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7,  421 U. S. 14-15.  Pp.  440 U. S. 279-280.
(c) Though it could be argued that the Alabama statutory scheme is designed to provide help for needy spouses, using sex as a proxy for need, and to compensate women for past discrimination during marriage, which assertedly has left them unprepared to fend for themselves in the working world following divorce, these considerations would not justify that scheme, because, under the Alabama statutes, individualized hearings at which the parties' relative financial circumstances are considered already occur.  Since such hearings can determine which spouses are needy, as well as which wives were, in fact, discriminated against, there is no reason to operate by generalization.  ""Thus, the gender-based distinction is gratuitous. . . .""  Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636,  420 U. S. 653.  Pp.  440 U. S. 280-282.

			"|"Orr v. Orr
No. 77-1119
Argued November 27, 1978
Decided March 5, 1979
440 U.S. 268

Syllabus 
Following a stipulation between appellant husband and appellee wife, in which appellant agreed to pay appellee alimony, an Alabama court, acting pursuant to state alimony statutes under which husbands, but not wives, may be required to pay alimony upon divorce, ordered appellant to make monthly alimony payments.  Some two years thereafter, appellee filed a petition seeking to have appellant adjudged in contempt for failing to maintain the alimony payments.  At the hearing on the petition appellant, though not claiming that he was entitled to an alimony award from appellee, made the contention (advanced for the first time in that proceeding) that the Alabama statutes, by virtue of their reliance on a gender-based classification, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The trial court, ruling adversely to appellant on that issue, entered judgment against him, which was affirmed on appeal.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction over appellant's appeal.  Pp.  440 U. S. 271-278.
(a) Appellant's failure to ask for alimony for himself does not deprive him of standing to attack the constitutionality of the Alabama statutes for underinclusiveness.  That attack holds the only promise of relief from the burden deriving from the challenged statutes, and appellant has therefore
""alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which th[is] court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.""
Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186,  369 U. S. 204.  Pp.  440 U. S. 271-273.
(b) Had the courts below refused to entertain appellant's constitutional contention on the ground that it was not timely made under applicable state procedures, this Court might have lacked jurisdiction to consider the contention; but no timeliness point was raised or considered below and the constitutional issue was decided on the merits.  Under these circumstances, it is irrelevant whether the decision below could have been based upon an adequate and independent state ground.  Pp.  440 U. S. 274-275.
(c) No point was raised or considered below that appellant, by virtue of the stipulation, was obliged to make the alimony payments under state contract law.
""Where the state court does not decide 
Page 440 U. S. 269
 against [an] appellant upon an independent state ground, but deeming the federal question to be before it, actually . . . decides that question adversely to the federal right asserted, this Court has jurisdiction to review the judgment if, as here, it is . . . final. . . .""
Indiana ex rel. Anderson v. Brand, 303 U. S. 95,  303 U. S. 98.  Pp.  440 U. S. 275-278.
2. The Alabama statutory scheme of imposing alimony obligations on husbands, but not wives, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  440 U. S. 278-283.
(a) ""To withstand scrutiny"" under the Equal Protection Clause,
""'classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives, and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.'""
Califano v. Webster, 430 U. S. 313,  430 U. S. 316-317.  Pp.  440 U. S. 278-279.
(b) The statutes cannot be validated on the basis of the State's preference for an allocation of family responsibilities under which the wife plays a dependent role.
""No longer is the female destined solely for the home and the rearing of the family, and only the male for the marketplace and the world of ideas.""
Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7,  421 U. S. 14-15.  Pp.  440 U. S. 279-280.
(c) Though it could be argued that the Alabama statutory scheme is designed to provide help for needy spouses, using sex as a proxy for need, and to compensate women for past discrimination during marriage, which assertedly has left them unprepared to fend for themselves in the working world following divorce, these considerations would not justify that scheme, because, under the Alabama statutes, individualized hearings at which the parties' relative financial circumstances are considered already occur.  Since such hearings can determine which spouses are needy, as well as which wives were, in fact, discriminated against, there is no reason to operate by generalization.  ""Thus, the gender-based distinction is gratuitous. . . .""  Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636,  420 U. S. 653.  Pp.  440 U. S. 280-282.
(d) Use of a gender classification, moreover, actually produces perverse results in this case, because only a financially secure wife whose husband is in need derives an advantage from the Alabama scheme, as compared to a gender-neutral one.  Pp.  440 U. S. 282-283.
3. The question remains open on remand whether appellant's stipulated agreement to pay alimony, or other grounds of gender-neutral state law, bind him to continue his alimony payments.  Pp.  440 U. S. 283-284.

No. 77-968
Argued November 6, 1978

440 U.S. 301

Syllabus 
Petitioner employer, in response to a request made by a Union in connection with arbitration of a grievance filed on behalf of employees in a bargaining unit, supplied the Union with certain information pertaining to petitioner's employee psychological aptitude testing program under which certain unit employees had been rejected for certain job openings because of their failure to receive ""acceptable"" test scores.  However, petitioner refused to release the actual test questions, the actual employee answer sheets, and the scores linked with the names of the employees who received them, maintaining that complete confidentiality of these materials was necessary to insure the future integrity of the tests and to protect the examinees' privacy interests.  Petitioner did offer to turn over the scores of any employee who signed a waiver releasing petitioner's psychologist from his pledge of confidentiality, but the Union declined to seek such releases.  In unfair labor practice proceedings against petitioner -- based on the Union's charge that petitioner had violated its duty to bargain collectively under  8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to provide relevant information needed by the Union for the proper performance of its duties as the employees' bargaining representative -- the National Labor Relations Board concluded that all the requested items were relevant to the grievance and ordered petitioner to turn over all of the materials directly to the Union, subject to certain restrictions on the Union's use of the information.  The Board rejected petitioner's request that, in order to preserve test secrecy, the tests and answer sheets be turned over to an industrial psychologist selected by the Union.  The Board and the Court of Appeals, in its decision enforcing the Board's order, both rejected petitioner's claim that employee privacy and the professional obligations of petitioner's industrial psychologists should outweigh the Union's request for the employee-linked scores.
Held:
1. The Board abused its remedial discretion in ordering petitioner to turn over the test battery and answer sheets directly to the Union.  Pp.  440 U. S. 312-317.
(a) A union's bare assertion that it needs information to process a grievance does not automatically oblige the employer to supply all the 
Page 440 U. S. 302
 information in the manner requested.  The duty to supply information under  8(a)(5) turns upon ""the circumstances of the particular case,"" NLRB v. Truitt Mfg. Co., 351 U. S. 149,  351 U. S. 153, and much the same may be said for the type of disclosure that will satisfy that duty.  Pp.  440 U. S. 314-315.
(b) Petitioner's interest in test secrecy has been abundantly demonstrated on the record, which established petitioner's freedom under the collective bargaining contract to use aptitude tests as a criterion for promotion, the empirical validity of the tests, and the relationship between secrecy and test validity.  The Board has cited no principle of national labor policy to warrant a remedy that would unnecessarily disserve this interest.  P.  440 U. S. 315.
(c) The remedy selected by the Board, barring the Union from taking any action that might cause the tests to fall into the hands of employees who have taken or are likely to take them, does not adequately protect the security of the tests.  There is substantial doubt whether the Union, which was not a party to the enforcement proceeding in the Court of Appeals, would be subject to a contempt citation were it to ignore the restrictions.  Moreover, the Union clearly would not be accountable in either contempt or unfair labor practice proceedings for the most realistic vice inherent in the Board's remedy -- the danger of inadvertent leaks.  Pp.  440 U. S. 315-316.
2. Petitioner's willingness to disclose test scores linked with the employee names only upon receipt of consents from the examinees satisfied petitioner's statutory obligations under  8(a)(5).  In light of the sensitive nature of testing information, the minimal burden that compliance with petitioner's offer would have placed on the Union, and the total absence of evidence that petitioner had fabricated concern for employee confidentiality only to frustrate the Union in the discharge of its responsibilities, the Board's conclusion that petitioner, in resisting an unconsented-to disclosure of individual test results, violated the statutory obligation to bargain in good faith cannot be sustained.  Accordingly, the order requiring petitioner unconditionally to disclose the employee scores to the Union was erroneous.  Pp.  440 U. S. 317-320.

440 U.S. 332

Syllabus 
In Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, it was held that retroactive welfare benefits awarded by a Federal District Court to the plaintiff class, by reason of wrongful denial of benefits by Illinois officials prior to the entry of the court's order determining the wrongfulness of their actions, violated the Eleventh Amendment, and that in, an action under 42 U.S.C.  1983,
""a federal court's remedial power, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, is necessarily limited to prospective injunctive relief . . . , and may not include a retroactive award which requires the payment of funds from the state treasury.""
Edelman, supra at  415 U. S. 677.  On remand, the District Court ordered the state officials to send to each member of the plaintiff class a notice informing him that he was denied public assistance to which he was entitled, together with a ""Notice of Appeal"" by which the recipient could request a hearing on the denial of benefits.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the proposed form of notice would have been barred by the Eleventh Amendment, but stated that, on remand, the District Court could order the state officials to send a ""mere explanatory notice to applicants advising them that there is a state administrative procedure available if they desire to have the state determine whether or not they may be eligible for past benefits,"" and that a returnable notice of appeal could also be provided.
Held:
1. Neither Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658, the legislative history cited in that decision, nor this Court's Eleventh Amendment cases subsequent to Edelman cast any doubt on Edelman's holding that  1983 does not abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States.  Section 1983 does not explicitly and by clear language indicate on its face an intent to sweep away the immunity of the States; nor does it have a history which focuses directly on the question of state liability or shows that Congress considered and firmly decided to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States.  Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678, distinguished.  Nor does this Court's reaffirmance of Edelman in this case render  1983 meaningless insofar as States are concerned.  Pp.  440 U. S. 338-345 
Page 440 U. S. 333

2. The modified notice contemplated by the Court of Appeals constitutes permissible prospective relief, and not a ""retroactive award which requires payment of funds from the state treasury.""  Such notice, in effect, simply informs plaintiff class members that there are existing administrative procedures by which they may receive a determination of eligibility for past benefits, that their federal suit is at an end, and that the federal court can provide them with no further relief.  Whether a recipient of the notice decides to take advantage of the available procedures is left completely to the discretion of that particular class member, the federal court playing no role in that decision.  And whether or not the class member will receive retroactive benefits rests entirely with the State, its agencies, courts, and legislature, not with the federal court.  Pp.  440 U. S. 346-349.

No. 77-1327
Argued December 4, 1978
Decided March 5, 1979
440 U.S. 391

Syllabus 
California and Nevada entered into a Compact, later consented to by Congress, to create respondent Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) to coordinate and regulate development in the Lake Tahoe Basin resort area and to conserve its natural resources.  The Compact authorized TRPA to adopt and enforce a regional plan for land use, transportation, conservation, recreation, and public services.  Petitioners, Basin property owners, brought suit in Federal District Court alleging that TRPA and its individual members and executive officer (also respondents) had adopted a land use ordinance that destroyed the value of petitioners' property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and seeking monetary and equitable relief.  To support their federal claim, petitioners asserted, inter alia, that respondents had acted under color of state law and that therefore their cause of action was authorized by 42 U.S.C.  1983, and jurisdiction was provided by 28 U.S.C.  1343.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that, although a cause of action for ""inverse condemnation"" was sufficiently alleged, the action could not be maintained against TRPA because it had no authority to condemn property, and that the individual respondents were immune from liability.  The Court of Appeals, while reinstating the complaint against the individual respondents on other grounds, rejected petitioners' claims based on  1983 and 1343, holding that congressional approval had transformed the Compact into federal law, with the result that respondents had acted pursuant to federal authority, rather than under color of state law.  The court further held that TRPA was immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, and that with respect to the individual respondents they should be absolutely immune for conduct of a legislative character and qualifiedly immune for executive action.
Held:
1. Petitioners stated a cause of action under  1983, and hence properly invoked federal jurisdiction under  1343.  The requirement of federal approval of the Compact did not foreclose a finding that respondents' conduct was ""under color of state law"" within the meaning of  1983.  The facts with respect to TRPA's operation -- such as that its implementation depended upon the appointment of members by 
Page 440 U. S. 392
 both States and their subdivisions and upon financing by counties; that the appointees, in discharging their duties as TRPA officials, also serve the interests of the appointing units; that federal involvement is limited to the appointment of one nonvoting member; and that each State has an absolute right to withdraw from the Compact -- adequately characterize respondents' alleged actions as ""under color of state law.""  Pp.  440 U. S. 398-400.
2. TRPA is not immune from liability under the Eleventh Amendment.  The States' intention in creating TRPA, the terms of the Compact, and TRPA's actual operation make clear that nothing short of an absolute rule would allow TRPA to claim sovereign immunity, and, because the Eleventh Amendment prescribes no such rule, TRPA is subject to ""the judicial power of the United States"" within the meaning of that Amendment.  Pp.  440 U. S. 400-402.
3. To the extent that the evidence discloses that the individual respondents were acting in a legislative capacity, they are entitled to absolute immunity from federal damages liability.
""Legislators are immune from deterrents to the uninhibited discharge of their legislative duty, not for their private indulgence but for the public good,""
Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367,  341 U. S. 377, and this reasoning is equally applicable to federal, state, and regional legislators.  Whatever potential damages liability regional legislators may face as a matter of state law, petitioners' federal claims do not encompass the recovery of damages from TRPA members acting in a legislative capacity.

No. 77-1327
Argued December 4, 1978
Decided March 5, 1979
440 U.S. 391

Syllabus 
California and Nevada entered into a Compact, later consented to by Congress, to create respondent Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) to coordinate and regulate development in the Lake Tahoe Basin resort area and to conserve its natural resources.  The Compact authorized TRPA to adopt and enforce a regional plan for land use, transportation, conservation, recreation, and public services.

No. 77-1337
Argued November 7, 1978
Decided March 5, 1979
440 U.S. 410

Syllabus 
Respondents, California residents, brought this suit in a California court for damages against petitioner State of Nevada and others for injuries respondents sustained when a Nevada-owned vehicle on official business collided on a California highway with a vehicle occupied by respondents.  After the California Supreme Court, reversing the trial court, held Nevada amenable to suit in the California courts, Nevada, on the basis of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Federal Constitution, unsuccessfully invoked a Nevada statute limiting to $25,000 any tort award against the State pursuant to its statutory waiver of sovereign immunity.  Following trial, damages were awarded respondents for $1,150,000, and the judgment in their favor was affirmed on appeal.
Held:  A State is not constitutionally immune from suit in the courts of another State.  Pp.  440 U. S. 414-427.
(a) The doctrine that no sovereign may be sued in its own courts without its consent does not support a claim of immunity in another sovereign's courts.  Pp.  440 U. S. 414-418.
(b) The need for constitutional protection against one State's being sued in the courts of another State was not discussed by the Framers, and nothing in Art. III authorizing the judicial power of the United States or in the Eleventh Amendment limitation on that power provides any basis, explicit or implicit, for this Court to limit the judicial powers that California has exercised in this case.  Pp.  440 U. S. 418-421.
(c) The Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require a State to apply another State's law in violation of its own legitimate public policy.  Pacific Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 306 U. S. 493.  Here California, which has provided by statute for jurisdiction in its courts over residents and nonresidents alike to allow those negligently injured on its highways to secure full compensation for their injuries in California courts, is not required to surrender jurisdiction to Nevada or to limit respondents' recovery to the $25,000 Nevada statutory maximum.  Pp.  440 U. S. 421-424.
(d) The specific limitations that certain constitutional provisions such as Art. I,  8, and Art. IV,  2, place upon the sovereignty of the States do not imply that any one State's immunity from suit in the courts of

of the City of New York
No. 77-1659
Decided March 5, 1979
440 U.S. 447

Syllabus 
Petitioners, national banks that lease offices and maintain their principal places of business in New York City, brought the present action after the city had assessed them for its commercial rent and occupancy tax for the period June 1, 1970, through May 31, 1972.  The New York Court of Appeals held that the tax could be imposed pursuant to Pub.L. 91156, as amended, which provided that, as of January 1, 1973, national banks were to be treated as state banks for the purposes of state tax laws, and which contained temporary provisions that enabled States to tax national banks on a more limited basis from its date of enactment, December 24, 1969, until January 1, 1973.  A saving clause, however, prevented the imposition prior to January 1, 1973, of any tax in effect prior to the enactment of Pub.L. 91-156, unless such imposition was authorized by subsequent ""affirmative action"" of the state legislature.
Held:
1. The disputed tax could not be imposed on petitioners prior to January 1, 1973, because the affirmative action requirement of the saving clause was not satisfied by a mere rate increase in the city's commercial rent tax passed subsequent to Pub.L. 91-156.  The affirmative action provision was designed to require the States, when imposing new taxes on national banks prior to January 1, 1973, to consider the impact of such taxes on the existing balance of taxation between national and state banks, and nothing in the legislative history of the rate increase suggests that Pub.L. 91-156 was given the slightest attention.
2. The city's commercial rent and occupancy tax is not a tax on ""tangible personal property"" within the meaning of the provisions of Pub.L. 91-156 that render the saving clause prohibition inapplicable to such a tax.  The question is one of federal law; and, for the purposes of Pub.L. 91-156, Congress did not consider real estate occupancy taxes to be taxes on tangible personal property.

No. 77-1413
Argued December 6, 1978
Decided February 28, 1979
440 U.S. 257

Syllabus 
Petitioner entered into a contract with respondent whereby, in return for the exclusive right to make and sell a keyholder designed by petitioner for which a patent application was pending, respondent agreed to pay petitioner a royalty of 5% of the selling price.  If the patent was not allowed within five years, the royalty was to be reduced to 2 1/2% of sales.  The patent was not allowed within five years, whereupon respondent accordingly reduced the royalty to 2 1/2%.  Subsequently, the patent application was rejected.  After respondent had paid petitioner royalties for a number of years following rejection of the patent application, it brought an action in District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the royalty agreement was unenforceable on the ground that state law which otherwise made the contract enforceable was preempted by federal patent law.  The District Court upheld the contract, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the contract became unenforceable once petitioner failed to obtain a patent within the stipulated 5-year period, and that a continuing obligation to pay royalties would be contrary to ""the strong federal policy in favor of the full and free use of ideas in the public domain,"" Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U. S. 653,  395 U. S. 674.
Held:  Federal patent law does not preempt state contract law so as to preclude enforcement of the contract.  Cf. Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U. S. 470.  Pp.  440 U. S. 261-266.
(a) Enforcement of the contract is not inconsistent with the purposes of the federal patent system (1) to foster and reward invention; (2) to promote disclosure of inventions, stimulate further innovation, and permit the public to practice the invention once the patent expires; and (3) to assure that ideas in the public domain remain there for the free use of the public.  Pp.  440 U. S. 262-264.
(b) Enforcement of the contract does not prevent anyone from copying the keyholder, but merely requires respondent to pay the consideration it promised in return for the use of a novel device which enabled it to preempt the market.  P.  440 U. S. 264.
(c) When, as here, no patent has issued, and no ideas have been withdrawn from public use, the case is not controlled by the holding of Lear, supra, that a patent licensee who establishes the invalidity of a patent need not pay royalties accrued after the issuance of the patent, 
Page 440 U. S. 258
 nor by the rationale of that case that it is desirable to encourage licensees to challenge the validity of patents in order to further the strong federal policy that only inventions meeting the rigorous requirements of patentability shall be withdrawn from the public domain.  P.  440 U. S. 264.
(d) Enforcement of the contract comports with the principle that the monopoly granted under a patent cannot lawfully be used ""to negotiate with the leverage of that monopoly,"" Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U. S. 29,  379 U. S. 33, since the challenged reduced royalty, rather than being so negotiated, rested on the contingency that no patent would issue within five years.  Pp.  440 U. S. 264-265.
567 F.2d 757, reversed.

No. 77-1413
Argued December 6, 1978
Decided February 28, 1979
440 U.S. 257

Syllabus 
Petitioner entered into a contract with respondent whereby, in return for the exclusive right to make and sell a keyholder designed by petitioner for which a patent application was pending, respondent agreed to pay petitioner a royalty of 5% of the selling price.  If the patent was not allowed within five years, the royalty was to be reduced to 2 1/2% of sales.  The patent was not allowed within five years, whereupon respondent accordingly reduced the royalty to 2 1/2%.  Subsequently, the patent application was rejected.  After respondent had paid petitioner royalties for a number of years following rejection of the patent application, it brought an action in District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the royalty agreement was unenforceable on the ground that state law which otherwise made the contract enforceable was preempted by federal patent law.  The District Court upheld the contract, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the contract became unenforceable once petitioner failed to obtain a patent within the stipulated 5-year period, and that a continuing obligation to pay royalties would be contrary to ""the strong federal policy in favor of the full and free use of ideas in the public domain,"" Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U. S. 653,  395 U. S. 674.
Held:  Federal patent law does not preempt state contract law so as to preclude enforcement of the contract.  Cf. Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U. S. 470.  Pp.  440 U. S. 261-266.
(a) Enforcement of the contract is not inconsistent with the purposes of the federal patent system (1) to foster and reward invention; (2) to promote disclosure of inventions, stimulate further innovation, and permit the public to practice the invention once the patent expires; and (3) to assure that ideas in the public domain remain there for the free use of the public.  Pp.  440 U. S. 262-264.
(b) Enforcement of the contract does not prevent anyone from copying the keyholder, but merely requires respondent to pay the consideration it promised in return for the use of a novel device which enabled it to preempt the market.  P.  440 U. S. 264.
(c) When, as here, no patent has issued, and no ideas have been withdrawn from public use, the case is not controlled by the holding of Lear, supra, that a patent licensee who establishes the invalidity of a patent need not pay royalties accrued after the issuance of the patent, 
Page 440 U. S. 258
 nor by the rationale of that case that it is desirable to encourage licensees to challenge the validity of patents in order to further the strong federal policy that only inventions meeting the rigorous requirements of patentability shall be withdrawn from the public domain.  P.  440 U. S. 264.
(d) Enforcement of the contract comports with the principle that the monopoly granted under a patent cannot lawfully be used ""to negotiate with the leverage of that monopoly,"" Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U. S. 29,  379 U. S. 33, since the challenged reduced royalty, rather than being so negotiated, rested on the contingency that no patent would issue within five years.  Pp.  440 U.

Syllabus 
Petitioner Blue Shield, a Texas insurance company, offers policies that entitle the insured to obtain prescription drugs. The insured may obtain the drugs from a pharmacy participating in a ""Pharmacy Agreement"" with Blue Shield (in which case the insured must pay only $2 for every prescription drug, with the remainder of the cost being paid directly by Blue Shield to the participating pharmacy) or from a nonparticipating pharmacy (in which case the insured pays the full price and may be reimbursed by Blue Shield for 75% of the difference between that price and $2.)  Blue Shield offered to enter into a Pharmacy Agreement with each licensed pharmacy in Texas, the participating pharmacy to agree to furnish Blue Shield policyholders prescription drugs at $2 each, with Blue Shield to agree to reimburse the pharmacy for its cost in acquiring the drug.  Respondents, nonparticipating pharmacies, brought this antitrust action alleging that Blue Shield and three participating pharmacies, also petitioners, had violated  1 of the Sherman Act by entering into agreements fixing the retail prices of drugs and that petitioners' activities had caused Blue Shield policyholders to boycott certain respondents.  The trial court granted petitioners summary judgment on the ground that the agreements are exempt from the antitrust laws under  2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act (Act), because the agreements are the ""business of insurance,"" are regulated by Texas, and are not boycotts within the meaning of the Act.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The Pharmacy Agreements are not the ""business of insurance"" within the meaning of  2(b).  Pp.  440 U. S. 211-233.
(a) Section 2(b) exempts the ""business of insurance,"" not the ""business of insurers.""  Pp.  440 U. S. 210-211.
(b) A primary element of an insurance contract is the underwriting or spreading of risk, SEC v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 359 U. S. 65, but that element is not involved in the Pharmacy Agreements, which are merely arrangements for the purchase of goods and services by Blue Shield, enabling it to effect cost savings.  Pp.  440 U. S. 211-215. 
Page 440 U. S. 206

(e) The Pharmacy Agreements involve contractual arrangements between Blue Shield and the pharmacies, not its policyholders.  Pp.  440 U. S. 215-217.
(d) The legislative history of the Act confirms the conclusion that the ""business of insurance"" was understood by Congress to involve the underwriting of risk and the relationship and transactions between insurance companies and their policyholders, and no legislative intention is disclosed to exempt agreements or transactions between insurance companies and entities outside the insurance industry.  Moreover, at the time of the Act's enactment, health care plans such as those of Blue Shield were not considered to constitute insurance at all, and it is difficult to assume that Congress, contrary to that contemporary view, could have considered such plans to be the ""business of insurance"" within the meaning of the Act.  Even if Congress did consider certain aspects of such plans to be the ""business of insurance,"" however, it still does not follow that the Pharmacy Agreements in this case are within the meaning of that phrase.

No. 78-443
Decided February 26, 1979
440 U.S. 194

Syllabus 
Respondent, a tenured teacher, was denied salary increases during the 1972-1974 school years because of her refusal to comply with the School Board's continuing education requirement, which was incorporated by reference into her employment contract.  After the Oklahoma Legislature enacted a law mandating certain salary raises for teachers regardless of their compliance with the continuing education policy, the School Board notified respondent that her contract would not be renewed for the 1974-1975 school year unless she enrolled in the required continuing education courses.  When respondent refused to comply, the School Board found that her persistent noncompliance with the continuing education requirement constituted ""willful neglect of duty"" under an Oklahoma statute and refused to renew her contract for the following school year.  The District Court dismissed respondent's complaint, which claimed that the School Board's action denied respondent her liberty and property  without due process of law and equal protection of the laws, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. The School Board's actions did not violate respondent's due process rights.  Respondent has no colorable claim of a denial of procedural due process:  she was advised of the School Board's decision not to renew her contract and of her right to a hearing before the Board, and, at her request, a hearing was held at which both she and her attorney appeared and unsuccessfully contested the Board's determination that her refusal to enroll in continuing education courses constituted ""willful neglect of duty.""  Nor did the School Board's action deny respondent substantive due process.  After the state legislature, by making pay raises mandatory, deprived the Board of the sanction that it had earlier used to enforce its teachers' contractual obligation to earn continuing education credits, the Board turned to contract nonrenewal, but applied this sanction purely prospectively, so that those who might have relied on its past practice would nonetheless have an opportunity to bring themselves into compliance with the terms of their contracts.  Such a course of conduct on the part of a school board responsible for the public 
Page 440 U. S. 195
 education of students within its jurisdiction, and employing teachers to perform the principal portion of that task, can scarcely be described as arbitrary
2. Respondent was not deprived of equal protection of the laws.  The School Board's concern with the educational qualifications of its teachers cannot, under any reasoned analysis, be described as impermissible, and it is not contended that the Board's continuing education requirement bears no rational relationship to that legitimate governmental concern.  The sanction of contract nonrenewal, imposed uniformly on the ""class"" of teachers who refuse to comply with the continuing education requirement, is quite rationally related to the Board's objective of enforcing the continuing education obligation of its teachers.  That the Board was forced by the state legislature to penalize noncompliance differently than it had in the past in no way alters the equal protection analysis of respondent's claim.
Certiorari granted; 579 F.2d 1192, reversed.

Syllabus 
To resolve a dispute over the ownership of certain lands, California seeks to invoke this Court's original jurisdiction in an action to quiet title against Arizona and the United States, both of which contend that the United States has not consents to be a defendant and that therefore California's motion for leave to file a bill of complaint must be denied.  Title 28 U.S.C.  209a(a) permits the United States to be named as a defendant in an action to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest other than a security interest or water rights; and 28 U.S.C.  1346(f) gives the federal district courts ""exclusive original jurisdiction"" of actions under  2409a to quiet title to real property in which an interest is claimed by the United States.
Held:  Under  2409a(a), the United States has waived its sovereign immunity to suit in this case, and hence there is no bar to the suit.  The legislative history of  1346(f) shows no intent by Congress to divest this Court of jurisdiction over such actions in cases otherwise within its original jurisdiction, an attempt that would raise grave constitutional questions.

Syllabus 
Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, prohibits price discrimination by sellers, but under  2(b), the seller may rebut a prima facie case of price discrimination by showing that his lower price was made in good faith to meet a competitor's equally low price.  Section 2(f) makes it unlawful
""for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, knowingly to induce or receive a discrimination in price which is prohibited by this section.""
Petitioner, in an effort to achieve cost savings, entered into an agreement with its longtime supplier, Borden Co., under which Borden would supply ""private label"" (as opposed to ""brand label"") milk to petitioner's stores in the Chicago area.  Petitioner refused Borden's initial offer in implementation of the agreement, and solicited offers from other companies, resulting in a lower offer from one of Borden's competitors.  At this point, petitioner's buyer informed Borden that its offer was ""not even in the ball park,"" and that a $50,000 improvement in the offer ""would not be a drop in the bucket.""  Borden then submitted a new offer that was substantially better than its competitor's, and petitioner accepted it.  Based on these facts, the Federal Trade Commission charged petitioner with violating  5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act for allegedly misleading Borden during contract negotiations by failing to inform it that its second offer was better than its competitor's, and with violating  2(f) by knowingly inducing or receiving price discrimination from Borden.  The FTC dismissed the  5 charge on the ground that the issue was what amount of disclosure is required of the buyer during contract negotiations, and that to impose a duty of affirmative disclosure would be ""contrary to normal business practice"" and ""contrary to the public interest,"" but held that petitioner had violated  2(f), the FTC rejecting, inter alia, petitioner's defense that the Borden offer had been made to meet competition.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  A buyer who has done no more than accept the lower of two prices competitively offered does not violate  2(f) provided the seller has a ""meeting competition"" defense, and here, where Borden had such a defense, and thus could not be liable under 
Page 440 U. S. 70
  2(b) petitioner, who did no more than accept Borden's offer, cannot be liable under  2(f).  Pp.  440 U. S. 75-85.
(a) Since liability under  2(f) is limited to price discrimination ""prohibited by this section,"" and since only  2(a) and (b) deal with seller liability for price discrimination, a buyer, under  2(f)'s plain meaning, cannot be liable if a prima facie case cannot be established against a seller or if the seller has an affirmative defense.  Automatic Canteen Co. of America v. FTC, 346 U. S. 61.  In either situation, there is no price discrimination ""prohibited by this section.""  And the legislative history of  2(f) confirms the conclusion that buyer liability under  2(f) is dependent on seller liability under  2(a).  Pp.  440 U. S. 75-78.
(b) To rewrite  2(f) to hold a buyer liable even though there is no price discrimination ""prohibited by this section"" would contravene the rule that this Court ""cannot supply what Congress has studiously omitted,"" FTC v. Simplicity Pattern Co., 360 U. S. 55,  360 U. S. 67.  Pp.  440 U. S. 78-79.
(c) Imposition of  2(f) liability on petitioner would lead to price uniformity and rigidity contrary to the purposes of other antitrust legislation.  P.  440 U. S. 80.
(d) A duty of affirmative disclosure requiring a buyer to inform a seller that his bid has beaten competition would frustrate competitive bidding and, by reducing uncertainty, would lead to price matching and anticompetitive cooperation among sellers.  P.  440 U. S. 80.
(e) The effect of the finding that petitioner's same conduct violated  2(f) as violated  5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act is to impose the same duty of affirmative disclosure that the FTC condemned as anticompetitive, ""contrary to the public interest,"" and ""contrary to normal business practice,"" in dismissing the  5 charge.  Pp.  440 U. S. 80-81.
(f) The test for determining when a seller has a valid ""meeting competition"" defense is whether he can
""show the existence of facts which would lead a reasonable and prudent person to believe that the granting of a lower price would in fact meet the equally low price of a competitor.""
FTC v. A. E. Staley Mfg. Co., 324 U. S. 746.  Under the circumstances of this case, Borden did act reasonably and in good faith when it made its second bid, since, in light of its established business relationship with petitioner, it could justifiably conclude that petitioner's statements about the first offer were reliable, and that it was necessary to make another bid offering substantial concessions to avoid losing its account with petitioner.  Pp.  440 U. S. 82-84.

Held:  A buyer who has done no more than accept the lower of two prices competitively offered does not violate  2(f) provided the seller has a ""meeting competition"" defense, and here, where Borden had such a defense, and thus could not be liable under 
Page 440 U. S. 70
  2(b) petitioner, who did no more than accept Borden's offer, cannot be liable under  2(f).  Pp.  440 U. S. 75-85.
(a) Since liability under  2(f) is limited to price discrimination ""prohibited by this section,"" and since only  2(a) and (b) deal with seller liability for price discrimination, a buyer, under  2(f)'s plain meaning, cannot be liable if a prima facie case cannot be established against a seller or if the seller has an affirmative defense.  Automatic Canteen Co. of America v. FTC, 346 U. S. 61.  In either situation, there is no price discrimination ""prohibited by this section.""  And the legislative history of  2(f) confirms the conclusion that buyer liability under  2(f) is dependent on seller liability under  2(a).  Pp.  440 U. S. 75-78.
(b) To rewrite  2(f) to hold a buyer liable even though there is no price discrimination ""prohibited by this section"" would contravene the rule that this Court ""cannot supply what Congress has studiously omitted,"" FTC v. Simplicity Pattern Co., 360 U. S. 55,  360 U. S. 67.  Pp.  440 U. S. 78-79.
(c) Imposition of  2(f) liability on petitioner would lead to price uniformity and rigidity contrary to the purposes of other antitrust legislation.  P.  440 U. S. 80.
(d) A duty of affirmative disclosure requiring a buyer to inform a seller that his bid has beaten competition would frustrate competitive bidding and, by reducing uncertainty, would lead to price matching and anticompetitive cooperation among sellers.  P.  440 U. S. 80.
(e) The effect of the finding that petitioner's same conduct violated  2(f) as violated  5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act is to impose the same duty of affirmative disclosure that the FTC condemned as anticompetitive, ""contrary to the public interest,"" and ""contrary to normal business practice,"" in dismissing the  5 charge.  Pp.  440 U. S. 80-81.
(f) The test for determining when a seller has a valid ""meeting competition"" defense is whether he can
""show the existence of facts which would lead a reasonable and prudent person to believe that the granting of a lower price would in fact meet the equally low price of a competitor.""
FTC v. A. E. Staley Mfg. Co., 324 U. S. 746.  Under the circumstances of this case, Borden did act reasonably and in good faith when it made its second bid, since, in light of its established business relationship with petitioner, it could justifiably conclude that petitioner's statements about the first offer were reliable, and that it was necessary to make another bid offering substantial concessions to avoid losing its account with petitioner.  Pp.  440 U. S. 82-84.

Section 632 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, which requires persons covered by the Foreign Service retirement system to retire at age 60, though no mandatory retirement age is established for Civil Service employees, including those who serve abroad, held not to violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

selection out operating primarily at the lower, and compulsory retirement at the higher, Foreign Service levels.  Pp.  440 U. S. 98-102.
(c) Section 632 also furthers the congressional purpose of removing from the Foreign Service those who are sufficiently old that they may be less dependable than younger persons in facing the rigors of overseas duty.

Pp.  440 U. S. 103-106.

Syllabus 
In administering its Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Foster Care program (AFDC-FC), Illinois distinguishes between children who reside with relatives and those who do not.  Children placed in unrelated foster homes qualify for the AFDC-FC program, which provides greater monthly payments than the basic AFDC program.  But children who are placed in relatives' homes may participate only in the basic AFDC program, because the State defines the term ""foster family home"" as a facility for children unrelated to the operator.  Section 408(a) of the Social Security Act establishes certain conditions of AFDC-FC eligibility, among which is the requirement that the child be placed in ""a foster family home.""  This term is defined in  408 as ""a foster family home for children which is licensed by the State in which it is situated or has been approved . . . as meeting the standards established for such licensing.""  The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) has interpreted the federal statute to require that States provide AFDC-FC benefits ""regardless of whether the . . . foster family home in which a child is placed is operated by a relative.""  Appellees are four foster children who were removed from their mother's home following a judicial determination of neglect, and their older sister and her husband.  Two of these children were placed by the State in the home of their sister and her husband, which was approved as meeting the licensing standards for unrelated foster family homes.  Illinois nevertheless refused to make AFDC-FC payments on behalf of the children because they were related to their foster parents.  Appellees then brought this action challenging the validity of Illinois' distinction between related and unrelated foster parents.  The Court of Appeals, affirming the District Court's judgment for appellees, struck down the Illinois statute.
Held:  The AFDC-FC program encompasses foster children who, pursuant to a judicial determination of neglect, have been placed in related homes that meet a State's licensing requirements for 
Page 440 U. S. 126
 unrelated foster homes.  Accordingly, Illinois may not exclude from its AFDC-FC program children who reside with relatives.  Pp.  440 U. S. 133-146.
(a) Both the language and Legislative history of  408 show that the AFDC-FC program was designed to meet the particular needs of all eligible neglected children, whether they are placed with related or unrelated foster parents.  Distinguishing among equally neglected children based on their relationship to their foster parents would conflict with Congress' overriding goal of providing the best available care for all dependent children removed from their homes pursuant to a judicial determination of neglect.

440 U.S. 147

Syllabus 
Montana levies a 1% gross receipts tax upon contractors of public, but not private, construction projects.  A public contractor may credit against the gross receipts tax its payments of personal property, corporate income, and individual income taxes.  Any remaining gross receipts tax liability is customarily passed on in the form of increased construction costs to the governmental unit financing the project.  In 1971, the contractor on a federal project in Montana brought a suit in state court contending that the gross receipts tax unconstitutionally discriminated against the Government and the companies with which it dealt.  The litigation was directed and financed by the United States.  Less than a month later, the Government brought this action in the Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of the tax.  By stipulation, the case was continued pending resolution of the state court litigation, which concluded in a decision by the Montana Supreme Court upholding the tax.  Kiewit I.  The court found the distinction between public and private contractors consistent with the mandates of the Supremacy and Equal Protection Clauses.  At the Solicitor General's direction, the contractor abandoned its request for review by this Court.  The contractor then instituted a second state court action regarding certain tax payments different from those in Kiewit I.  The Montana Supreme Court, finding the second claim essentially no different from the first, invoked the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata to affirm the dismissal of the complaint.  Kiewit II.  Thereafter, the District Court heard the instant case on the merits, and concluded that the United States was not bound by Kiewit I and that the tax violated the Supremacy Clause.
Held:  The United States is collaterally estopped from challenging the prior judgment of the Montana Supreme Court.  Pp.  440 U. S. 153-164.
(a) The interests underlying the related doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata -- that a

(b) The precise constitutional claim advanced by the United States in this litigation was presented and resolved against the Government in Kiewit I.  Pp.  440 U. S. 156-158.
(c) The factual and legal context in which the issues of this case arise has not materially changed since Kiewit I, and thus the normal rules of preclusion should operate to relieve the parties of ""redundant litigation [over] the identical question of the statute's application to the taxpayer's status.""

|440 u.s. 173|"Illinois State Board of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party
No. 77-1248
Argued November 6, 1978
Decided February 22, 1979
440 U.S. 173

Syllabus 
Under the Illinois Election Code, new political parties and independent candidates must obtain the signatures of 25,000 qualified voters in order to appear on the ballot in statewide elections.  However, the minimum number of signatures required in elections for offices of political subdivisions of the State is 5% of the number of persons who voted at the previous election for such offices.  Application of these provisions to a special mayoral election in Chicago produced the result that a new party or independent candidate needed substantially more signatures than would be needed for ballot access in a statewide election.  In actions by appellees, an independent candidate, two new political parties, and certain voters, challenging this discrepancy on equal protection grounds, the District Court enjoined enforcement of the 5% provision insofar as it mandated more than 25,000 signatures, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. This Court's summary affirmance in Jackson v. Ogilvie, 403 U.S. 925, of the District Court's decision in 325 F.Supp. 864, upholding Illinois' 5% signature requirement is not dispositive of the equal protection question presented here.  The precedential effect of a summary affirmance can extend no further than ""the precise issues presented and necessarily decided by those actions,"" Mandel v. Bradley, 432 U. S. 173,  432 U. S. 176.  In contrast to this case, the challenge in Jackson involved only the discrepancy between the 5% requirement and the less stringent requirements for candidates of established political parties.  The issue presented here was not referred to by the Jackson District Court, and was mentioned only in passing in the jurisdictional statement subsequently filed with this Court.  Thus, the issue was not adequately presented to, or decided by, this Court in its summary affirmance.  Pp.  440 U. S. 180-183.
2. The Illinois Election Code, insofar as it requires independent candidates and new political parties to obtain more than 25,000 signatures in Chicago violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  440 U. S. 183-187. 
Page 440 U. S. 174

(a) When such fundamental rights as the freedom to associate as a political party and the right to cast votes effectively are at stake, a State must establish that its regulation of ballot access is necessary to serve a compelling interest.  Pp.  440 U. S. 184-185.
(b) ""[E]ven when pursuing a legitimate interest, a State may not choose means that unnecessarily restrict constitutionally protected liberty,"" Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U. S. 51,  414 U. S. 58-59, and States must adopt the least drastic means to achieve their ends.  This requirement is particularly important where restrictions on access to the ballot are involved.  Since the State has determined that a smaller number of signatures in a larger political unit adequately serves its interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot, the signature requirements for independent candidates and political parties seeking offices in Chicago are clearly not the least restrictive means of achieving the same objective.  Appellant State Board of Elections has advanced no reason, much less a compelling one, why the State needs a more stringent requirement for elections in Chicago than for statewide elections.  Pp.  440 U. S. 185-186.
(c) Prior invalidation of Illinois' rules regarding geographic distribution of signatures tied the requirements for both city and state candidates solely to a population standard.

			"|"Illinois State Board of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party
No. 77-1248
Argued November 6, 1978
Decided February 22, 1979
440 U.S. 173

Syllabus 
Under the Illinois Election Code, new political parties and independent candidates must obtain the signatures of 25,000 qualified voters in order to appear on the ballot in statewide elections.  However, the minimum number of signatures required in elections for offices of political subdivisions of the State is 5% of the number of persons who voted at the previous election for such offices.  Application of these provisions to a special mayoral election in Chicago produced the result that a new party or independent candidate needed substantially more signatures than would be needed for ballot access in a statewide election.  In actions by appellees, an independent candidate, two new political parties, and certain voters, challenging this discrepancy on equal protection grounds, the District Court enjoined enforcement of the 5% provision insofar as it mandated more than 25,000 signatures, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. This Court's summary affirmance in Jackson v. Ogilvie, 403 U.S. 925, of the District Court's decision in 325 F.Supp. 864, upholding Illinois' 5% signature requirement is not dispositive of the equal protection question presented here.  The precedential effect of a summary affirmance can extend no further than ""the precise issues presented and necessarily decided by those actions,"" Mandel v. Bradley, 432 U. S. 173,  432 U. S. 176.  In contrast to this case, the challenge in Jackson involved only the discrepancy between the 5% requirement and the less stringent requirements for candidates of established political parties.  The issue presented here was not referred to by the Jackson District Court, and was mentioned only in passing in the jurisdictional statement subsequently filed with this Court.  Thus, the issue was not adequately presented to, or decided by, this Court in its summary affirmance.  Pp.  440 U. S. 180-183.
2. The Illinois Election Code, insofar as it requires independent candidates and new political parties to obtain more than 25,000 signatures in Chicago violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  440 U. S. 183-187. 
Page 440 U. S. 174

(a) When such fundamental rights as the freedom to associate as a political party and the right to cast votes effectively are at stake, a State must establish that its regulation of ballot access is necessary to serve a compelling interest.  Pp.  440 U. S. 184-185.
(b) ""[E]ven when pursuing a legitimate interest, a State may not choose means that unnecessarily restrict constitutionally protected liberty,"" Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U. S. 51,  414 U. S. 58-59, and States must adopt the least drastic means to achieve their ends.  This requirement is particularly important where restrictions on access to the ballot are involved.  Since the State has determined that a smaller number of signatures in a larger political unit adequately serves its interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot, the signature requirements for independent candidates and political parties seeking offices in Chicago are clearly not the least restrictive means of achieving the same objective.  Appellant State Board of Elections has advanced no reason, much less a compelling one, why the State needs a more stringent requirement for elections in Chicago than for statewide elections.  Pp.  440 U. S. 185-186.
(c) Prior invalidation of Illinois' rules regarding geographic distribution of signatures tied the requirements for both city and state candidates solely to a population standard.  However, while this may explain the anomaly at issue here, it does not justify it.  Historical accident, without more, cannot constitute a compelling state interest.  Pp.  440 U. S. 186-187.
3. The Court of Appeals properly dismissed as moot appellant's claim that the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners lacked authority to conclude a settlement agreement with respect to the unresolved issue whether the 5% signature requirement, coupled with the filing deadline, impermissibly burdened First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

Decided February 21, 1979*
440 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Section 5.13(d) of the Texas Optometry Act prohibits the practice of optometry under a trade name, and  2.02 requires that four of the six members of the Texas Optometry Board, which regulates the practice of optometry in the State, be members of the Texas Optometric Association (TOA), a professional organization of optometrists.  Rogers, a Board member but ineligible for membership in TOA because of noncompliance with the code of ethics required for membership, brought an action challenging the constitutionality of these provisions.  A three-judge District Court held that  2.02 is related reasonably to the State's purpose of ensuring enforcement of the Act and therefore constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but that  5.13(d) is an unconstitutional restriction of the ""free flow of commercial information"" under the First Amendment. Held:

Because these ill-defined associations of trade names with price and quality information can be manipulated by the users.of trade names, there is a significant possibility that trade names will be used to mislead the public.  Pp.  440 U. S. 11-13.
(b) The State's interest in protecting the public from such deceptive and misleading use of optometrical trade names is substantial and well demonstrated in this case, and the prohibition against the use of trade names is a constitutionally permissible regulation in furtherance of this interest.  Rather than stifling commercial speech, such prohibition ensures that information regarding optometrical services will be communicated more fully and accurately to consumers than it had been in the past.  Pp.  440 U. S. 13-16.
2. Section 2.02 is also constitutional.  Pp.  440 U. S. 17-19.
(a) The history of the Texas Optometry Act shows that such provision is related reasonably to the State's legitimate purpose of securing a regulatory board that will administer the Act faithfully.  Pp.  440 U. S. 17-18.
(b) While Rogers has a constitutional right to a fair and impartial hearing in any disciplinary proceeding conducted against him by the Texas Optometry Board, his challenge to the fairness of the Board does not arise from any disciplinary proceeding against him.

Syllabus 
The Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (Act) Amendments of 1972, to combat inflation, replaced the Act's $70 maximum limitation on weekly disability benefits with a four-step limitation scheme tied to specified percentages of the ""applicable national average weekly wage"" determined annually by the Secretary of Labor.  6(b)(1).  At the same time, death benefits to surviving spouses and children were increased, respectively, from 35% to 50% and from 15% to 163% of the deceased's average weekly wages.  Total weekly death benefits were still limited to 663% of the deceased's average weekly wages, but the former specific dollar minimum and maximum limitations on average weekly wages were replaced by a provision dealing only with a minimum limitation tied to the applicable national average weekly wage.  Thus, as amended,  9(e) provides that.
""[i]n computing death benefits the average weekly wages of the deceased shall be considered to have been not less than the applicable national average weekly wage as prescribed in section 6(b) but the total weekly benefits shall not exceed the average weekly wages of the deceased.""
Respondents, the widow and son of a covered employee, claimed combined death benefits ($532 per week) equal to 663% of the deceased's average weekly wages.  The employer, its insurance carrier, and the Director of the Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (petitioners) contended that  6(b)(1)'s limitation on disability payments (then $167 per week), was meant to apply to death benefits as well as disability benefits, and that Congress' failure to place a maximum on death benefits when it amended  9(e) was inadvertent.  An administrative decision in respondents' favor was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
Held:  Death benefits payable under the Act are not subject to the maximum limitations placed on disability payments 
Page 440 U. S. 30
 by  6(b)(1).  This conclusion is supported by both the language and legislative history of the 1972 Amendments.  Pp.  440 U. S. 35-47.
(a) That the omission of a maximum limitation on death benefits was inadvertent is disproved by the legislative history of the 1972 Amendments, especially the pertinent Committee Reports, which clearly reflect the Committees' understanding that the minimum and maximum limitations on death benefits of former  9(e) were being eliminated and that only a minimum benefits provision tied to the applicable national average weekly wage was being substituted in their place.  Pp.  440 U. S. 37-41.
(b) Section 6(d), which provides that ""determinations"" under  6 ""with respect to a period"" shall apply to employees currently receiving disability benefits or survivors currently receiving death benefits during such period, does not render the maximum limitations contained in  6(b)(1) applicable to death benefits.  Congress' use of the word ""determinations"" in  6(d) and of its verb form elsewhere in  6 strongly suggests that it intended the term to refer only to the Secretary of Labor's annual determination under  6(b)(3) of the national average weekly wage, not to the mathematical computation of disability benefit maximums contemplated under  6(b)(1).  This view is confirmed by  6(d)'s legislative history.  Pp.  440 U. S. 41-44.
(c) Since both the language and legislative history of the 1972 Amendments show that Congress' omission of a ceiling on death benefits was intentional, this Court must reject petitioners' suggested interpretation of the Act.  Pp.  440 U. S. 45-47.

440 U.S. 48

Syllabus 
In Chapter XI arrangement proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act, petitioner acquired a second mortgage on certain North Carolina real estate to secure a $360,000 indebtedness but received no express security interest in the rents earned by the property.  The bankruptcy judge thereafter appointed an agent to collect the rents and apply them to the payment of taxes, insurance, interest, and principal payments due on the first and second mortgages.  The mortgagor was later adjudicated a bankrupt, at which time the first and second mortgages were in default, and the trustee was ordered to collect and retain all rents.  The bankrupt's properties were ultimately sold to petitioner for $174,000, that price being paid by reduction of the estate's indebtedness to petitioner from $360,000 to $186,000.  At the sale date, the trustee had accumulated almost $163,000 in rents which petitioner unsuccessfully sought to have applied to the balance of the second mortgage indebtedness, the bankruptcy judge ruling that the $186,000 balance due petitioner should be treated as a general unsecured claim.  The District Court reversed.  Though recognizing that, under North Carolina law, a mortgagor is deemed the owner of the land subject to the mortgage, and, during his possession, is entitled to rents and profits, even after default, the court viewed the agent's appointment during the arrangement proceedings as tantamount to the appointment of a receiver, which satisfied the state law requirement of a change of possession, giving the mortgagee an interest in the rents which no further action after the bankruptcy adjudication was required to preserve.  The Court of Appeals reversed, reinstating the disposition of the bankruptcy judge.  The appellate court held that the bankruptcy adjudication had terminated the state court receivership status arising out of the appointment of the agent to collect rents, and that, because petitioner had made no request during the bankruptcy for a sequestration of rents or for the appointment of a receiver, petitioner had not taken the kind of action North Carolina law required to give a mortgagee a security interest in the rents collected after the bankruptcy adjudication.
Held:  Apart from certain special provisions, the Bankruptcy Act generally leaves the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt's estate to 
Page 440 U. S. 49
 state law.  The law of the State where the property is located accordingly governs a mortgagee's right to rents during bankruptcy, and a federal bankruptcy court should take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that a mortgagee is afforded in federal ankruptcy court the same protection he would have under state law had no bankruptcy ensued.  Though the general plinciple of the applicability of state law to determine property rights in a bankrupt's assets was applied by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals (and those courts properly did not follow the minority federal quity rule under which a mortgagee is accorded a secured interest in rent even if state law would not recognize any such interest until after foreclosure), those courts disagreed about the requirements of North Carolina law.  Hwever, that state law issue, as such, will not be reviewed by this Court.  Pp.  440 U. S. 51-58.

No. 77-1410
Argued November 27, 1978
Decided February 21, 1979
440 U.S. 48

Syllabus 
In Chapter XI arrangement proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act, petitioner acquired a second mortgage on certain North Carolina real estate to secure a $360,000 indebtedness but received no express security interest in the rents earned by the property.  The bankruptcy judge thereafter appointed an agent to collect the rents and apply them to the payment of taxes, insurance, interest, and principal payments due on the first and second mortgages.  The mortgagor was later adjudicated a bankrupt, at which time the first and second mortgages were in default, and the trustee was ordered to collect and retain all rents.  The bankrupt's properties were ultimately sold to petitioner for $174,000, that price being paid by reduction of the estate's indebtedness to petitioner from $360,000 to $186,000.  At the sale date, the trustee had accumulated almost $163,000 in rents which petitioner unsuccessfully sought to have applied to the balance of the second mortgage indebtedness, the bankruptcy judge ruling that the $186,000 balance due petitioner should be treated as a general unsecured claim.  The District Court reversed.  Though recognizing that, under North Carolina law, a mortgagor is deemed the owner of the land subject to the mortgage, and, during his possession, is entitled to rents and profits, even after default, the court viewed the agent's appointment during the arrangement proceedings as tantamount to the appointment of a receiver, which satisfied the state law requirement of a change of possession, giving the mortgagee an interest in the rents which no further action after the bankruptcy adjudication was required to preserve.

Syllabus 
The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (Act) provides retirement benefits for railroad employees.  The benefits are not contractual and can be altered by Congress at any time.  Benefits for an employee's spouse terminate upon an absolute divorce.  45 U.S.C.  231d(c)(3).  Except for satisfying child support or alimony obligations,
""no annuity [under the Act] shall be assignable or be subject to any tax or to garnishment, attachment, or other legal process under any circumstances whatsoever, nor shall the payment thereof be anticipated. . . .""
45 U.S.C.  231m.  Petitioner, a California resident whose years of service as a railroad employee entitled him to benefits under the Act if and when he attained age 60, petitioned for dissolution of his marriage to respondent, also a resident of California, which has a community property law.  The trial court divided the parties' community property, but held that respondent had no interest in petitioner's expectation of receiving railroad retirement benefits.  The Supreme Court of California ultimately reversed, holding that, because the benefits would flow in part from petitioner's employment during marriage, they were community property.  The court rejected petitioner's contention that  231m barred respondent's claim, reasoning that the provision was intended to apply to creditors only.
Held:  Benefits payable under the Act may not be divided under the community property law.  Pp.  439 U. S. 581-590.
(a) Ordering petitioner to pay respondent an appropriate portion of his benefits under the Act, or it monetary equivalent, as petitioner receives it, would contravene  231m, and would deprive petitioner of a portion of the benefit Congress, in  231d(c)(3), indicated was designed for the railroad employee alone.  Under the Supremacy Clause, California must defer to the Act's statutory scheme for allocating benefits insofar as the terms of federal law require.  Pp.  439 U. S. 583-587.
(b) An offsetting award for the expected value of respondent's interest in petitioner's statutory benefits would likewise defeat the purpose of barring the anticipation of payments under  231m of the Act.  Pp.  439 U. S. 588-590.

Yakima Indian Nation
No. 77-388
Argued October 2, 1978
Decided January 16, 1979
439 U.S. 463

Syllabus 
Section 6 of Pub.L. 280 authorizes the people of States whose constitutions or statutes contain organic law disclaimers of jurisdiction over Indian country to amend ""where necessary"" their constitutions or statutes to remove any legal impediment to assumption of such jurisdiction under the Act, notwithstanding the provision of any Enabling Act for the admission of the State, but provided that the Act shall not become effective with respect to such assumption of jurisdiction until the people of the State have appropriately amended their state constitution or statutes, as the case may be.  In  7 of Pub.L. 280, Congress gave the consent of the United States
""to any other State . . . to assume jurisdiction at such time and in such manner as the people of the State shall, by affirmative legislative action, obligate and bind the State to assumption thereof.""
The State of Washington's Constitution contains a disclaimer of authority over Indian country, and hence the State is one of those covered by  6.  In 1963, after the Washington Supreme Court, in another case, had held that the barrier posed by the disclaimer could be lifted by the state legislature, the legislature enacted a statute (Chapter 36) obligating the State to assume civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indians and Indian territory within the State, subject only to the condition that, in all but eight subject matter areas, jurisdiction would not extend to Indians on trust or restricted lands unless the affected tribe so requested.  Appellee Yakima Nation, which did not make such a request, brought this action in Federal District Court challenging the statutory and constitutional validity of the State's partial assertion of jurisdiction on its Reservation.  The Tribe contended that the State had not complied with the procedural requirements of Pub.L. 280, especially the requirement that the State first amend its constitution; that, in any event, Pub.L. 280 did not authorize the State to assert only partial jurisdiction within an Indian reservation; and that Chapter 36, even if authorized by Congress, violated the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The 
Page 439 U. S. 464
 District Court rejected both the statutory and constitutional claims, and entered judgment for the State.  The Court of Appeals, while rejecting the contention that Washington's assumption of only partial jurisdiction was not authorized by Congress, reversed, holding that the ""checkerboard"" jurisdictional system produced by Chapter 36 had no rational foundation, and therefore violated the Equal Protection Clause.
Held:
1. Section 6 of Pub.L. 280 does not require disclaimer States to amend their constitutions to make an effective acceptance of jurisdiction over an Indian reservation, and any Enabling Act requirement of this nature was effectively repealed by  6.  Here, the Washington Supreme Court, having determined that, for purposes of the repeal of the state constitutional disclaimer, legislative action is sufficient, and, the state legislature having enacted legislation obligating the State to assume jurisdiction under Pub.L. 280, it follows that the State has satisfied the procedural requirements of  6.  Pp.  439 U. S. 478-493.
2. Once the requirements of  6 have been satisfied, the terms of  7 govern the scope of jurisdiction conferred upon disclaimer States.  Statutory authorization for the partial subject matter and geographic jurisdiction asserted by Washington is found in the words of  7 permitting option States to assume jurisdiction ""in such manner"" as the people of the State shall, ""by affirmative legislative action, obligate and bind the State to assumption thereof.""  The phrase ""in such manner"" means at least that an option State can condition the assumption of full jurisdiction on an affected tribe's consent.  Here, Washington has offered to assume full jurisdiction if a tribe so requests.  The partial jurisdiction asserted on the reservations of nonconsenting tribes reflects a responsible attempt to accommodate both state and tribal interests, and is consistent with the concerns that underlay the adoption of Pub.L. 280.  Accordingly, it does not violate the terms of  7.  Pp.  439 U. S. 493-499.
3. The ""checkerboard"" pattern of jurisdiction ordained by Chapter 36 is not, on its face, invalid under the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  439 U. S. 499-502.
(a) The classifications based on tribal status and land tenure implicit in Chapter 36 are not ""suspect,"" so as to require that they be justified by a compelling state interest, nor does Chapter 36 abridge any fundamental right of self-government.  Pp.  439 U. S. 500-501.
(b) Chapter 36 is valid as bearing a rational relationship to the State's interest in providing protection to non-Indian citizens living within a reservation, while at the same time allowing scope for tribal self-government on trust or restricted lands, the land-tenure classification being neither an irrational nor arbitrary means of identifying those area

439 U.S. 508

Syllabus 
Respondent pipeline company purchases for resale in the interstate market natural gas produced from a Louisiana field by respondent oil companies (Producers), whose prices are subject to regulation by petitioner Commission.  Under their lease agreements with the field's owner, the Producers pay royalties pegged to the ""market value"" or ""market price"" of the gas.  Following a dispute over the lessor's contention that those terms related to the unregulated price of natural gas in the intrastate market, rather than to the lower interstate Commission-regulated rates, the parties ultimately agreed to increased royalty payments based on intrastate market values of natural gas.  Alternatively, the Producers would abandon delivery to the pipeline company of the royalty portion of the gas and deliver it instead as payment in kind to the lessor.  The settlement agreement was to be binding only if the rate increase or the alternative abandonment was approved by the Commission, which the Producers then petitioned for special relief.  The Commission denied price relief, holding that it would be contrary to its mandate to permit royalty costs to be passed on to the Producers' customers if the royalties were calculated on any basis other than the just and reasonable rate for the gas involved, and, relying in part on FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. 380, the Commission concluded that it was ""not free"" to allow royalty costs based on the value of the gas in an unregulated market.  The Commission also denied the alternative abandonment request.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, concluding that the Commission had ""authority to consider the reasonableness of any costs incurred,"" which ""necessarily requires consideration of market price""; had failed to explain why royalty costs in an unregulated market differ from other production costs; and should determine the merits of the Producers' requests.  The court, following its opinion in Southland Royalty Co. v. FPC, 543 F.2d 1134, disagreed with the Commission on the abandonment issue.
Held:
1. The Natural Gas Act does not deny the Commission authority to give special rate relief to individual producers where escalating royalty costs are a function of, or are otherwise based upon, an unregulated 
Page 439 U. S. 509
 market price for the product whose sale in the interstate market is regulated by the Commission, and the Commission misconstrued Texaco in holding to the contrary.  Pp.  439 U. S. 514-517.
2. The Court of Appeals encroached upon the Commission's ratemaking authority when it strongly suggested that the Commission is required to grant relief to the Producers as long as the increase in royalty costs is not imprudent and the relief, when granted, will merely sustain, rather than increase, the Producers' profits, since the Commission is not obliged automatically to relieve the bind on producers facing increased royalty costs based on unregulated prices.  ""All that is protected against, in a constitutional sense, is that the rates fixed by the Commission be higher than a confiscatory level.""  FPC v. Texaco Inc., supra at  417 U. S. 392.  Pp.  439 U. S. 517-519.
3. In view of the record, a remand to the Commission is proper so that, in the first instance, it may clearly enunciate whether and to what extent individual relief from area rates will be granted due to the increased royalty costs, and, if relief is to be denied, that it may adequately explain its judgment.

			"|"Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Pennzoil Producing Co.
No. 77-648
Argued November 28, 1978
Decided January 16, 1979
439 U.S. 508

Syllabus 
Respondent pipeline company purchases for resale in the interstate market natural gas produced from a Louisiana field by respondent oil companies (Producers), whose prices are subject to regulation by petitioner Commission.  Under their lease agreements with the field's owner, the Producers pay royalties pegged to the ""market value"" or ""market price"" of the gas.  Following a dispute over the lessor's contention that those terms related to the unregulated price of natural gas in the intrastate market, rather than to the lower interstate Commission-regulated rates, the parties ultimately agreed to increased royalty payments based on intrastate market values of natural gas.  Alternatively, the Producers would abandon delivery to the pipeline company of the royalty portion of the gas and deliver it instead as payment in kind to the lessor.  The settlement agreement was to be binding only if the rate increase or the alternative abandonment was approved by the Commission, which the Producers then petitioned for special relief.  The Commission denied price relief, holding that it would be contrary to its mandate to permit royalty costs to be passed on to the Producers' customers if the royalties were calculated on any basis other than the just and reasonable rate for the gas involved, and, relying in part on FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. 380, the Commission concluded that it was ""not free"" to allow royalty costs based on the value of the gas in an unregulated market.  The Commission also denied the alternative abandonment request.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, concluding that the Commission had ""authority to consider the reasonableness of any costs incurred,"" which ""necessarily requires consideration of market price""; had failed to explain why royalty costs in an unregulated market differ from other production costs; and should determine the merits of the Producers' requests.  The court, following its opinion in Southland Royalty Co. v. FPC, 543 F.2d 1134, disagreed with the Commission on the abandonment issue.
Held:
1. The Natural Gas Act does not deny the Commission authority to give special rate relief to individual producers where escalating royalty costs are a function of, or are otherwise based upon, an unregulated 
Page 439 U. S. 509
 market price for the product whose sale in the interstate market is regulated by the Commission, and the Commission misconstrued Texaco in holding to the contrary.  Pp.  439 U. S. 514-517.
2. The Court of Appeals encroached upon the Commission's ratemaking authority when it strongly suggested that the Commission is required to grant relief to the Producers as long as the increase in royalty costs is not imprudent and the relief, when granted, will merely sustain, rather than increase, the Producers' profits, since the Commission is not obliged automatically to relieve the bind on producers facing increased royalty costs based on unregulated prices.  ""All that is protected against, in a constitutional sense, is that the rates fixed by the Commission be higher than a confiscatory level.""  FPC v. Texaco Inc., supra at  417 U. S. 392.  Pp.  439 U. S. 517-519.
3. In view of the record, a remand to the Commission is proper so that, in the first instance, it may clearly enunciate whether and to what extent individual relief from area rates will be granted due to the increased royalty costs, and, if relief is to be denied, that it may adequately explain its judgment.  Pp.  439 U. S. 519-520.
4. On the abandonment issue, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent that it relied upon its judgment that was later reversed in California v. Southland Royalty Co., 436 U. S. 519.  Moreover, the questions of individual rate relief and abandonment are not unrelated, and may be considered by the Commission on remand.  Pp.  439 U. S. 520-521.

No. 77-920
Argued November 1, 1978
Decided January 16, 1979
439 U.S. 522

Syllabus 
Inventory accounting for tax purposes is governed by  446 and 471 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.  Section 446 provides that taxable income is to be computed under the taxpayer's normal method of accounting unless that method ""does not clearly reflect income,"" in which event taxable income is to be computed ""under such method as, in the opinion of the [Commissioner], does clearly reflect income.""  Section 471 provides that
""[w]henever in the opinion of the [Commissioner] the use of inventories is necessary in order clearly to determine the income of any taxpayer, inventory shall be taken by such taxpayer on such basis as the [Commissioner] may prescribe as conforming as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and as most clearly reflecting income.""
The implementing Regulations require a taxpayer to value inventory for tax purposes at cost unless ""market"" (defined as replacement cost) is lower.  The Regulations specify two situations in which inventory may be valued below ""market"" as so defined:  (1) where the taxpayer in the normal course of business has actually offered merchandise for sale at prices lower than replacement cost; and (2) where the merchandise is defective.  In 1964, petitioner, a tool manufacturer, wrote down in accord with ""generally accepted accounting principles"" what it regarded as ""excess"" inventory to its own estimate of the ""net realizable value"" (generally scrap value) of the ""excess"" goods (mostly spare parts), but continued to hold the goods for sale at their original prices.  It offset the write-down against 1964 sales, and thereby produced a net operating loss for that year.  The Commissioner disallowed the offset, maintaining that the writedown did not reflect income clearly for tax purposes.  Deductions for bad debts are covered by  166.  Section 166(c) provides that an accrual-basis taxpayer ""shall be allowed (in the discretion of the [Commissioner]) a deduction for a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts.""  In 1965, petitioner added to its reserve and asserted as a deduction under  166(c) a sum that presupposed a substantially higher charge-off rate for bad debts than it had experienced in immediately preceding years.  The Commissioner ruled that the addition was excessive, 
Page 439 U. S. 523
 and determined, pursuant to the ""six-year moving average"" formula derived from Black Motor Co. v. Commissioner, 41 B.T.A. 300, what he regarded as a lesser but ""reasonable"" amount to be added to petitioner's reserve.  On petitioner's petition for redetermination, the Tax Court upheld the Commissioner's exercise of discretion with respect to both the inventory write-down and the bad debt deduction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in determining that the write-down of ""excess"" inventory failed to reflect petitioner's 1964 income clearly, since the write-down was plainly inconsistent with the governing Regulations.  Pp.  439 U. S. 531-546.
(a) Although conceding that ""an active market prevailed"" on the inventory date, petitioner made no effort to determine the replacement cost of its ""excess"" inventory, and thus failed to ascertain ""market"" in accord with the general rule of the Regulations.  Petitioner, however, failed to bring itself within either of the authorized exceptions for valuing inventory below ""market.""  Whereas the Regulations demand concrete evidence of reduced market value, petitioner provided no objective evidence whatever that its ""excess"" inventory had the value management ascribed to it.  Pp.  439 U. S. 535-538.
(b) There is no presumption that an inventory practice conformable to ""generally accepted accounting principles"" is valid for tax purposes.  Such a presumption is insupportable m light of the statute, this Court's past decisions, and the differing objectives of tax and financial accounting.  Pp.  439 U. S. 538-544.
(c) While petitioner argues that it should not be forced to defer a tax benefit for inventory currently deemed unsalable until future years, when the ""excess"" items are actually disposed of, petitioner's ""dilemma"" is nothing more than the choice every taxpayer with a paper loss must face.  Pp.  439 U. S. 545-546.
2. The Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in recomputing a ""reasonable"" addition to petitioner's bad debt reserve according to the Black Motor formula.  Because petitioner did not show why its debt collections in 1965 would be less likely than in prior years, it failed to carry its ""heavy burden"" of showing that application of the Black Motor formula would have been arbitrary.  Pp.  439 U. S. 546-550
563 F.2d 861, affirmed.

439 U.S. 551

Syllabus 
A pension plan entered into under a collective bargaining agreement between petitioner local labor union and employer trucking firms required all employees to participate in the plan, but not to pay anything into it.  All contributions to the plan were to be made by the employers at a specified amount per week for each man-week of covered employment.  To be eligible for a pension, an employee was required to have 20 years of continuous service.  Respondent employee, who had over 20 years' service, was denied a pension upon retirement because of a break in service.  He then brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that the union and petitioner trustee of the pension fund had misrepresented and omitted to state material facts with respect to the value of a covered employee's interest in the pension plan, and that such misstatements and omissions constituted a fraud in connection with the sale of a security in violation of  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-5, and also violated  17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Denying petitioners' motion to dismiss, the District Court held that respondent's interest in the pension fund constituted a ""security"" within the meaning of  2(1) of the Securities Act and  3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act because the plan created an ""investment contract,"" and also that there had been a ""sale"" of this interest to respondent within the meaning of  2(3) of the Securities Act and  3(a)(14) of the Securities Exchange Act.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act do not apply to a noncontributory, compulsory pension plan.  Pp.  439 U. S. 558-570.
(a) To determine whether a particular financial relationship constitutes an investment contract, ""[t]he test is whether the scheme involves 
Page 439 U. S. 552
 an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.""  SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U. S. 293,  328 U. S. 301.  Looking separately at each element of this test, it is apparent that an employee's participation in a noncontributory, compulsory pension plan such as the one in question here does not comport with the commonly held understanding of an investment contract.  With respect to the ""investment of money"" element, in such a pension plan, the purported investment is a relatively insignificant part of the total and indivisible compensation package of an employee, who, from the standpoint of the economic realities, is selling his labor to obtain a livelihood, not making an investment for the future.  And with respect to the ""expectation of profits"" element, while the pension fund depends to some extent on earnings from its assets, the possibility of participating in asset earnings is too insubstantial to bring the entire transaction within the Securities Acts.  Pp.  439 U. S. 558-562.
(b) There is no evidence that Congress at any time thought noncontributory plans were subject to federal regulation as securities.  Nor until the instant litigation arose is there any evidence that the SEC had ever considered the Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act to be applicable to such plans.  Accordingly, there is no justification for deference to the SEC's present interpretation.  Pp.  439 U. S. 563-569.
(c) The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which comprehensively governs the use and terms of employee pension plans, severely undercuts all argument for extending the Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act to noncontributory, compulsory pension plans, and whatever benefits employees might derive from the effect of these latter Acts are now provided in more definite form through ERISA.

 LeRoy SYMM, Tax Assessor-Collector of Waller County, Texasv. UNITED STATES et alNo. 77-1688 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 15, 1979
 The judgment is affirmed.
 Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting. 
 Today the Court summarily affirms the judgment of a three-judge District Court enjoining appellant Symm, the Tax Assessor-Collector and ex officio voting registrar of Waller County, Tex., from using a certain questionnaire designed to aid Symm in determining whether persons registering to vote in Waller County are bona fide residents. Because I believe the three-judge District Court mistakenly exercised jurisdiction over Symm, I dissent. [ Symm v. U.S 439 U.S. 1105 (1979) ][1105-Continued.]

 LeRoy SYMM, Tax Assessor-Collector of Waller County, Texasv. UNITED STATES et alNo. 77-1688 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 15, 1979
 The judgment is affirmed.
 Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting. 
 Today the Court summarily affirms the judgment of a three-judge District Court enjoining appellant Symm, the Tax Assessor-Collector and ex officio voting registrar of Waller County, Tex., from using a certain questionnaire designed to aid Symm in determining whether persons registering to vote in Waller County are bona fide residents. Because I believe the three-judge District Court mistakenly exercised jurisdiction over Symm, I dissent. [ Symm v. U.S 439 U.S. 1105 (1979) ][1105-Continued.] 
 Waller County, a small rural county west of Houston, has a population of approximately 15,000, a slight majority of which is Negro.

No. 77-1305
Argued October 30, 1978
Decided January 9, 1979
439 U.S. 322

Syllabus 
Respondent brought this stockholder's class action in the District Court for damages and other relief against petitioners, a corporation, its officers, directors, and stockholders, who allegedly had issued a materially false and misleading proxy statement in violation of the federal securities laws and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.  Before the action came to trial, the SEC sued the same defendants in the District Court alleging that the proxy statement was materially false and misleading in essentially the same respects as respondent had claimed.  The District Court, after a nonjury trial, entered a declaratory judgment for the SEC, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Respondent in this case then moved for partial summary judgment against petitioners, asserting that they were collaterally estopped from relitigating the issues that had been resolved against them in the SEC suit.  The District Court denied the motion on the ground that such an application of collateral estoppel would deny petitioners their Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. Petitioners, who had a ""full and fair"" opportunity to litigate their claims in the SEC action, are collaterally estopped from relitigating the question of whether the proxy statement was materially false and misleading.  Pp.  439 U. S. 326-333.
(a) The mutuality doctrine, under which neither party could use a prior judgment against the other unless both parties were bound by the same judgment, no longer applies.  See Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, 402 U. S. 313.  Pp.  402 U. S. 326-328.
(b) The offensive use of collateral estoppel (when, as here, the plaintiff seeks to foreclose the defendant from litigating an issue that the defendant has previously litigated unsuccessfully in an action with another party) does not promote judicial economy in the same manner that is promoted by defensive use (when a defendant seeks to prevent a plaintiff from asserting a claim that the plaintiff has previously litigated and lost against another defendant), and such offensive use may also be unfair to a defendant in various ways.  Therefore, the general rule should be that, in cases where a plaintiff could easily have joined in the 
Page 439 U. S. 323
 earlier action, or where the application of offensive estoppel would be unfair to a defendant, a trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, should not allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel.  Pp.  439 U. S. 329-331.
(c) In this case, however, the application of offensive collateral estoppel will not reward a private plaintiff who could have joined in the previous action, since the respondent probably could not have joined in the injunctive action brought by the SEC.  Nor is there any unfairness to petitioners in such application here, since petitioners had every incentive fully and vigorously to litigate the SEC suit; the judgment in the SEC action was not inconsistent with any prior decision; and in the respondent's action there will be no procedural opportunities available to the petitioners that were unavailable in the SEC action of a kind that might be likely to cause a different result.  Pp.  439 U. S. 331-333.
2. The use of collateral estoppel in this case would not violate petitioners' Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.  Pp.  439 U. S. 333-337.
(a) An equitable determination can have collateral estoppel effect in a subsequent legal action without violating the Seventh Amendment.  Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323.  Pp.  439 U. S. 333-335.
(b) Petitioners' contention that, since the scope of the Seventh Amendment must be determined by reference to the common law as it existed in 1791, at which time collateral estoppel was permitted only where there was mutuality of parties, is without merit, for many procedural devices developed since 1791 that have diminished the civil jury's historic domain have been found not to violate the Seventh Amendment.  See, e.g., Galloway v. United States, 319 U. S. 372,  319 U. S. 388-393.  Pp.  439 U. S. 335-337.

439 U.S. 357

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of crimes in a Missouri State court notwithstanding his contention that his right to trial by a jury chosen from a fair cross-section of his community was denied by provisions of Missouri law granting women who so request an automatic exemption from jury service.  Under the challenged jury selection system, before the jury wheel is filled, women may claim exemption in response to a prominent notice on a jury selection questionnaire, and, prior to the appearance of jurors for service, women are afforded an additional opportunity to decline service by returning the summons or by simply not reporting for jury duty.  Petitioner established that 54% of the adults in the forum county were women; that, during 8 of the 10 months immediately prior to his trial, only 26.7% of those summoned from the jury wheel were women; and that only 14.5% of the persons on the post-summons weekly venires during this period were women.  For the month in which petitioner's jury was chosen, the weekly venires averaged 15.5% women.  Petitioner's all-male jury was selected from a panel of 53, of whom 5 were women.  The Missouri Supreme Court questioned aspects of petitioner's statistics, but held that the underrepresentation of women on jury venires in the forum county did not violate the fair cross-section requirement set forth in Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522, under which a defendant, in order to establish a prima facie violation of that requirement, must show (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a ""distinctive"" group in the community; (2) that the group's representation in the source from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation results from systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process.
Held:  The exemption on request of women from jury service under Missouri law, resulting in an average of less than 15% women on jury venires in the forum county, violates the ""fair-cross-section"" requirement of the Sixth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.  Pp.  439 U. S. 363-370.
(a) If women, who ""are sufficiently numerous and distinct from men,"" are systematically excluded from venires, the fair cross-section requirement cannot be satisfied.  Taylor, supra at  419 U. S. 531.  P.  439 U. S. 364.
(b) There is no evidence to show that the 1970 census data on which 
Page 439 U. S. 358
 petitioner relied distorted the percentage of women in the forum county at the time of trial, and the court below erred in concluding that jury venires with approximately 15% women are ""reasonably representative"" of the relevant community.  Pp.  439 U. S. 364-366.
(c) Petitioner's proof showed that the underrepresentation of women, generally and on his venire, was attributable to their systematic exclusion in the jury selection process at both the jury wheel and summons stages, resulting in the low percentage (14.5%) at the final, venire, stage.  Pp.  439 U. S. 366-367.
(d) Respondent did not satisfy its burden of showing any significant state interest justifying the infringement of petitioner's constitutional right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community.  It did not how that exemptions other than that for women caused the underrepresentation of women.  Nor does exempting all women because of preclusive domestic responsibilities of some women constitute sufficient justification for the disproportionate exclusion of women on jury venire permitted in Missouri.  Pp.  439 U. S. 367-370.

Syllabus 
Section 5(a) of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act requires every person who performs an abortion to make a determination, ""based on his experience, judgment or professional competence,"" that the fetus is not viable.  If such person determines that the fetus ""is viable,"" or ""if there is sufficient reason to believe that the fetus may be viable,"" then he must exercise the same care to preserve the fetus' life and health as would be required in the case of a fetus intended to be born alive, and must use the abortion technique providing the best opportunity for the fetus to be aborted alive, so long as a different technique is not necessary to preserve the mother's life or health.  The Act, in  5(d), also imposes a penal sanction for a violation of  5(a).  Appellees brought suit claiming, inter alia, that  5(a) is unconstitutionally vague, and a three-judge District Court upheld their claim.
Held:
1. The viability determination requirement of  5(a) is void for vagueness.  Pp.  439 U. S. 390-397.
(a) Though apparently the determination of whether the fetus ""is viable"" is to rest upon the basis of the attending physician's ""experience, judgment or professional competence,"" it is ambiguous whether that subjective language applies to the second condition that activates the duty to the fetus, viz., ""sufficient reason to believe that the fetus may be viable.""  Pp.  439 U. S. 391-392.
(b) The intended distinction between ""is viable"" and ""may be viable"" is elusive.  Apparently those phrases refer to distinct conditions, one of which indeterminately differs from the definition of viability set forth in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, and Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52.  Pp.  439 U. S. 392-394.
(c) The vagueness of the viability determination requirement is compounded by the fact that  5(d) subjects the physician to potential criminal liability without regard to fault.  Because of the absence of a scienter requirement in the provision directing the physician to determine whether the fetus is or may be viable, the Act is little more than ""a trap for those who act in good faith,"" United States v. Ragen, 314 U. S. 513,  314 U. S. 524, and the perils of strict criminal liability are particularly

 acute here because of the uncertainty of the viability determination itself.  Pp.  439 U. S. 390-397.
2. The standard of care provision is likewise impermissibly vague.  It is uncertain whether the statute permits the physician to consider his duty to the patient to be paramount to his duty to the fetus, or whether it requires the physician to make a ""trade-off"" between the patient's health and increased chances of fetal survival.  Where conflicting duties of such magnitude are involved, there must be greater statutory precision before a physician may be subjected to possible criminal sanctions.  Pp.  439 U. S. 397-401.

Syllabus 
After petitioner was dismissed from her employment as a teacher, she intervened in a desegregation action against respondent School District, seeking reinstatement on the ground, inter alia, that her dismissal infringed her right of free speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

Concluding that the primary reason for the dismissal was petitioner's criticism of the School District's practices and policies, which she conceived to be racially discriminatory, the District Court held that the dismissal violated petitioner's First Amendment rights and ordered her reinstatement.

Held:  A public employee does not forfeit his First Amendment protection against governmental abridgment of freedom of speech when he arranges to communicate privately with his employer, rather than to express his views publicly.  Pp.  439 U. S. 413-417.
(a) Pickering, Perry, and Mt. Healthy do not support the Court of Appeals' conclusion that private expression is unprotected by the First Amendment.  The fact that each of those cases involved public expression by the employee was not critical to the decision.  Pp.  439 U. S. 414-415.
(b) Nor is the Court of Appeals' view supported by the ""captive audience"" rationale, since the principal, having opened his office door to petitioner, was hardly in a position to argue that he was the ""unwilling recipient"" of her views.  P.  439 U. S. 415.
(c) Respondents' Mt. Healthy claim, rejected by the Court of Appeals, that the decision to terminate petitioner would have been made

No. 77-1051
Argued November 7, 1978
Decided January 9, 1979

Syllabus 
After petitioner was dismissed from her employment as a teacher, she intervened in a desegregation action against respondent School District, seeking reinstatement on the ground, inter alia, that her dismissal infringed her right of free speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  In an effort to justify the dismissal, the School District introduced evidence of, inter alia, a series of private encounters between petitioner and the school principal in which petitioner allegedly made ""petty and unreasonable demands"" in a manner variously described by the principal as ""insulting,"" ""hostile,"" ""loud,"" and ""arrogant.""  Concluding that the primary reason for the dismissal was petitioner's criticism of the School District's practices and policies, which she conceived to be racially discriminatory, the District Court held that the dismissal violated petitioner's First Amendment rights and ordered her reinstatement.

 In 1970, a civil rights organization and several individuals filed a charge against petitioner with respondent Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). It was claimed that in discharging an employee and in failing to promote another, petitioner had discriminated on the basis of race. In 1972, an additional complaint was lodged on behalf of a female employee who asserted that petitioner's pregnancy-leave policies discriminated against her on the basis of sex. Upon the unsuccessful conclusion of conciliation efforts concerning these charges, the EEOC commenced this action against petitioner in the District Court. The complaint alleged broadly that petitioner had discriminated on the basis of race in its hiring, promotion, apprenticeship, and other practices, and on the basis of sex with respect to its maternity-leave and disability benefits. 
 Each party served interrogatories on the other. The dispute leading to this petition arose from the EEOC's refusal adequately to answer interrogatories seeking the names of the individuals, other than those named in the initial administrative charges, against whom the EEOC believed petitioner had discriminated. Rather than supply this information, the EEOC moved the District Court to stay the filing of its answers while it completed its discovery against petitioner. This motion was denied. The EEOC thereafter submitted the following answer to the interrogatories: ""The Commission is unable at this time to identify other individuals until it has completed its discovery."" 
 Petitioner moved for sanctions against the EEOC under Fed.Rule Civ. Proc. 37. At a hearing on this motion, the District Judge reserved decision and directed the parties to confer. He stated that if they could not agree on the matter, he would consider the motion for sanctions. Further negotiations failed to produce an agreement.

 In 1973, New York enacted a comprehensive drug law which prescribes mandatory maximum life sentences and varying minimum terms of imprisonment for all class A narcotics felonies. N.Y. Penal Law 70.00(2)(a), 70.00( 3)(a) (McKinney).1 The Court today declines to consider whether two mandatory life sentences imposed under this statute, one for possession of an ounce of a substance containing cocaine, and the other for sale of 0. 00455 of an ounce of a substance containing cocaine, constitute cruel and unusual punishment.

 In 1975, petitioner Martha Carmona pleaded guilty to possession of an ounce of a substance containing cocaine in viola-

Penal Law 70.00(2)(a), (3)(a)(ii) (McKinney 1975).3 Prior to a series of events giving rise to the instant charges, petitioner Carmona had no criminal record except for one non-drug-related arrest 19 years earlier.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 8, 1979
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction after rejecting his claim that a plea bargain had been breached in violation of Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257 (1971). Rezin v. State, 93 Nev. 55, 559 P.2d 822 (1977). Petitioner then unsuccessfully sought federal habeas corpus, the District Court denying his petition on the grounds that he had failed to raise the Santobello claim until his appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court. Affirming, the Court of Appeals held that petitioner's failure to object in the state trial court was not within the ""cause and prejudice"" exception of Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72 (1977). Affirmance order, 580 F.2d 1053 (CA9 1978). 
 Wainwright v. Sykes, however, did not impose its own contemporaneous- objection rule independent of state rules governing the time for raising objections in state criminal proceedings. The only issue addressed in Sykes was: ""In what instances will an adequate and independent state ground bar consideration of otherwise cognizable federal issues on federal habeas review?"" 433 U.S., at 78-79, 81. In this case, the Nevada Supreme Court reached and decided the Santobello issue, and there would have been no adequate and independent state ground of decision barring review by this Court on a petition for certiorari from the judgment of the Nevada Supreme Court. Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153, 154-157 (1974). If Nevada has a rule requiring the Santobello issues to be presented to the trial court, the Nevada Supreme Court 
Page 439 U.S. 1103 , 1104
 did not enforce the rule in this case. Wainwright v. Sykes is therefore beside the point, and I would grant certiorari.
