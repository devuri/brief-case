 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 30, 1980
 The application of the Solicitor General for a stay pending appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was presented to Justice Marshall as Circuit Justice, and by him referred to the Court. The application was directed to that portion of the judgment entered December 29, 1980, by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, case No. 80 Civ. 4550, that precludes the Bureau of the Census from certifying to the President the population totals for New York and the state-by-state census tabulations, on December 31, 1980, as mandated by 13 U.S.C. 141(b). The application is hereby granted. This order shall remain in effect pending disposition of the appeal by

 the Court of Appeals. 
 Justice STEVENS took no part in the consideration or decision of this application. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 In this case, applicant Secretary of Commerce and others seek a stay pending appeal, of an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, enjoining the Census Bureau from certifying the official tabulation of New York State's population to the President as required by 13 U.S.C. 141(b). Respondents include the city of New York and its Mayor; the Governor of the State; and several voters and taxpayers in various city, congressional, and state senatorial and assembly districts who filed suit in District Court alleging that the 1980 census was conducted in a manner that will inevitably result in an undercount, largely in low-income areas populated by members of minority groups. Specifically, respondents alleged that the master address registers used by the Census Bureau were grossly inadequate and that the followup check of the master address registers by Postal Service and census workers was grossly inadequate. Respondents' ultimate contentions were that the resulting undercount not only will cause New York to lose at least one congressional seat to which it is entitled when reapportionment is made pursuant to the 1980 census, but that it will also result in the dilution of the votes of New York residents vis-a-vis those of residents of other States, and will cost New York City and the State vast sums of money distributed under federal revenue sharing and other programs with statutory formulas tied to the census. 
 The District Court initially entered a preliminary injunction against the Census Bureau: It found that respondents had established a clear possibility of irreparable harm to the efficacy of their votes, and that respondents were likely to succeed because they had submitted significant evidence concerning Census Bureau mismanagement and had raised serious questions as to whether some of the Bureau's policies and [449 U.S. 1068 , 1070]

No. 79-983
Argued October 13, 1980
Decided December 15, 1980*
449 U.S. 200

Syllabus 
An interlocking network of federal statutes fixes the compensation of high-level federal officials, including federal judges, and provides for annual cost-of-living adjustments in salary determined in the same way as those for federal employees generally.  In four consecutive fiscal years (hereafter Years 1, 2, 3, and 4), Congress, with respect to these high-level officials, enacted statutes to stop or reduce previously authorized cost-of-living increases initially intended to be automatically operative under that statutory scheme.  In Years 2 and 3, the statutes became law before the start of the fiscal year, and in Years 1 and 4 became law on or after the first day of the fiscal year.  A number of United States District Court Judges (appellees) filed class actions against the United States in District Court, challenging the validity of the statutes under the Compensation Clause of the Constitution, which provides that federal judges shall receive compensation which ""shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.""  The District Court granted summary judgments for appellees.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction of the appeals under 28 U.S.C.  1252, providing for appeals to this Court from judgments holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional in any civil action to which the United States is a party.  And the District Court had jurisdiction over the actions under 28 U.S.C.  1346(a)(2), which confers on district courts and the Court of Claims concurrent jurisdiction over actions against the United States based on the Constitution when the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000, none of the individual claims here having been alleged to have exceeded that amount.  Pp.  449 U. S. 210-211.
2. Title 28 U.S.C.  455 -- which requires a federal judge to disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned or where he has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or is a party to the proceeding -- by reason of the Rule of

 Necessity does not operate to disqualify all federal judges, including the Justices of this Court, from deciding the issues presented by these cases.  Where, under the circumstances of these cases, all Article III judges have an interest in the outcome, so that it was not possible to assign a substitute district judge or for the Chief Justice to remit the appeal, as he is authorized to do by statute, to a division of the Court of Appeals with judges who are not subject to the disqualification provisions of  455, the common law Rule of Necessity, under which a judge, even though he has an interest in the case, has a duty to hear and decide the case if it cannot otherwise be heard, prevails over the disqualification standards of  455.  Far from promoting  455's purpose of reaching disqualification of an individual judge when there is another to whom the case may be assigned, failure to apply the Rule of Necessity in these cases would have a contrary effect by denying some litigants their right to a forum.  And the public might be denied resolution of the crucial matter involved if first the District Judge and now all the Justices of this Court were to ignore the mandate of the Rule of Necessity and decline to answer the questions presented . Pp.  449 U. S. 211-217.
3. The statutes in question in Years 1 and 4, but not in Years 2 and 3, violated the Compensation Clause.  Pp.  449 U. S. 217-230.
(a) In each of the four years in question, Congress intended in effect to repeal or postpone previously authorized salary increases for federal judges, not simply to consign such increases to the fiscal limbo of an account due but not payable.  Pp.  449 U. S. 221-224.
(b) Since the statute applying to Year 1 became law on the first day of the fiscal year, by which time the salary increases already had taken effect, it purported to repeal a salary increase already in force, and thus ""diminished"" the compensation of federal judges.  That the statute included in the salary ""freeze"" other federal officials who are not protected by the Compensation Clause did not insulate a direct diminution in judges' salaries from the clear mandate of that Clause.  Pp.  449 U. S. 224-226.
(c) But the statutes applying to Years 2 and 3 became law before the scheduled salary increases for federal judges had taken effect, i.e., before they had become a part of the compensation due Article III judges, and hence in no sense diminished the compensation such judges were receiving.  Pp.  449 U. S. 226-229.
(d) Even though the statute applying to Year 4 referred only to ""executive employees, which includes Members of Congress,"" and did not expressly mention judges, it appears that Congress intended to include Article III judges.  Accordingly, where such statute, similarly to the statute applying to Year 1, purported to revoke an increase in

 judges' compensation after the statutes granting the increase had taken effect, it violated the Compensation Clause.  Pp.  449 U. S. 229-230.

No. 79-900
Argued October 15, 1980
Decided December 15, 1980

Syllabus 
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a complaint against respondent and several other major oil companies, alleging that the FTC had ""reason to believe"" that the companies were violating $ 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (Act), which prohibits unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce.  While adjudication of the complaint before an Administrative Law Judge was still pending, respondent, having unsuccessfully sought to have the FTC withdraw the complaint, brought an action in Federal District Court, alleging that the FTC had issued its complaint without having ""reason to believe"" that respondent was violating the Act, and seeking an order declaring the complaint unlawful and requiring that it be withdrawn.  The District Court dismissed the action.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court could inquire whether the FTC in fact had made the determination that it had reason to believe that respondent was violating the Act, and that the issuance of the complaint was ""final agency action"" under  10(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).
Held:  The FTC's issuance of its complaint was not ""final agency action"" under  10(c) of the APA, and hence was not judicially reviewable before the conclusion of the administrative adjudication.  Pp.  449 U. S. 238-246.
(a) The issuance of the complaint was not a definitive ruling or regulation and had no legal force or practical effect upon respondent's daily business other than the disruptions that accompany any major litigation.  Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, distinguished.  Immediate judicial review would serve neither efficiency nor enforcement of the Act.  Pp.  449 U. S. 239-243.
(b) Although respondent, by requesting the FTC to withdraw its complaint and awaiting the FTC's refusal to do so, may have exhausted its administrative remedy as to the averment of a ""reason to believe,"" the FTC's refusal to withdraw the complaint does not render the complaint a ""definitive"" action.  Such refusal does not augment the complaint's legal force or practical effect on respondent, nor does it diminish the concern for efficiency and enforcement of the Act.  P.  449 U. S. 243. 
Page 449 U. S. 233

(c) The expense and disruption in defending itself, even if substantial, does not constitute irreparable injury to respondent.  P.  449 U. S. 244.
(d) Respondent's challenge to the FTC's complaint will not become ""insulated"" from judicial review if it is not reviewed before the FTC's adjudication concludes, since, under the APA, a court of appeals reviewing a cease-and-desist order has the power to review alleged unlawfulness in the issuance of an agency complaint, assuming that the issuance of the complaint is not ""committed to agency discretion by law.""  Pp.  449 U. S. 244-245.
(e) Since issuance of the complaint averring ""reason to believe"" is a step toward, and will merge in, the FTC's decision on the merits, the claim of illegality in issuance of the complaint is not subject to judicial review as a ""collateral"" order.

|449 u.s. 250|"Delaware State College v. Ricks
No. 79-939
Argued October 7, 1980
Decided December 15, 1980
449 U.S. 250

Syllabus 
The Board of Trustees of petitioner Delaware State College formally voted to deny tenure to respondent professor on the basis of recommendations of the College's tenure committee and Faculty Senate.  During the pendency of respondent's grievance before the Board's grievance committee, the Trustees on June 26, 1974, told him that, pursuant to College policy, he would be offered a 1-year ""terminal"" contract that would expire June 30, 1975.  Respondent signed the contract, and on September 12, 1974, the Board notified him that it had denied his grievance.  After the appropriate Delaware agency had waived its primary jurisdiction over respondent's employment discrimination charge under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), on April 28, 1975, accepted his complaint for filing.  More than two years later, the EEOC issued a ""right to sue"" letter, and respondent filed this action in the District Court on September 9, 1977.  The complaint alleged, inter alia, that the College had discriminated against him on the basis of his national origin in violation of both Title VII and 42 U.S.C.  1981.  Title VII requires that a complaint be filed with the EEOC within 180 days (300 days under certain circumstances) ""after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,"" 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(e).  Under the applicable Delaware statute of limitations, cases under 42 U.S.C.  1981 must be filed within three years of the unfavorable employment decision.  The District Court dismissed both of respondent's claims as untimely.  It held that the only unlawful employment practice alleged was the College's decision to deny respondent tenure, and that the limitations periods for both claims had commenced to run by June 26, 1974, when the Board officially notified him that he would be offered a 1-year ""terminal"" contract.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the limitations period for both claims did not commence to run until the ""terminal"" contract expired on June 30, 1975.
Held:  Respondent's Title VII and  1981 claims were untimely.  Pp.  449 U. S. 256-262.
(a) The allegations of the complaint do not support respondent's ""continuing violation"" argument that discrimination motivated the College not only in denying him tenure but also in terminating his employment 
Page 449 U. S. 251
 on June 30, 1975.  The only discrimination alleged occurred -- and the filing limitations periods therefore commenced -- at the time the tenure decision was made and communicated to respondent.  This is so even though one of the effects of the denial of tenure -- the eventual loss of a teaching position -- did not occur until later.  Pp.  449 U. S. 256-258.
(b) Nor can the final date of employment be adopted, for policy reasons and simplicity, as the date when the limitations periods commenced.  Where, as here, the only challenged practice occurs before the date of termination of employment, the limitations periods necessarily commenced to run before that date.  Pp.  449 U. S. 259-260.
(c) The date when respondent was notified that his grievance had been denied, September 12, 1974, cannot be considered to be the date of the unfavorable tenure decision.  The Board had made clear well before then that it had formally rejected respondent's tenure bid, and entertaining a grievance complaining of the tenure decision does not suggest that the prior decision was in any respect tentative.  Nor does the pendency of a grievance, or some other method of collateral review of an employment decision, toll the running of the limitations periods, Electrical Workers v. Robbins & Myers, Inc., 429 U. S. 229.  Pp.  449 U. S. 260-261.
(d) The District Court's conclusion that the limitations periods had commenced to run by June 26, 1974, when the Board notified respondent that he would be offered a ""terminal"" contract, was not erroneous.  In light of the earlier recommendations of the tenure committee and the Faculty Senate that respondent not receive tenure and the Board's formal vote to deny tenure, the conclusion that the College had established its official position -- and made that position apparent to respondent -- no later than June 26, 1974, was justified.  Pp.  449 U. S. 261-262.

After the appropriate Delaware agency had waived its primary jurisdiction over respondent's employment discrimination charge under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), on April 28, 1975, accepted his complaint for filing.  More than two years later, the EEOC issued a ""right to sue"" letter, and respondent filed this action in the District Court on September 9, 1977.  The complaint alleged, inter alia, that the College had discriminated against him on the basis of his national origin in violation of both Title VII and 42 U.S.C.  1981.  Title VII requires that a complaint be filed with the EEOC within 180 days (300 days under certain circumstances) ""after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,"" 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(e).  Under the applicable Delaware statute of limitations, cases under 42 U.S.C.  1981 must be filed within three years of the unfavorable employment decision.  The District Court dismissed both of respondent's claims as untimely.  It held that the only unlawful employment practice alleged was the College's decision to deny respondent tenure, and that the limitations periods for both claims had commenced to run by June 26, 1974, when the Board officially notified him that he would be offered a 1-year ""terminal"" contract.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the limitations period for both claims did not commence to run until the ""terminal"" contract expired on June 30, 1975.
Held:  Respondent's Title VII and  1981 claims were untimely.  Pp.  449 U. S. 256-262.
(a) The allegations of the complaint do not support respondent's ""continuing violation"" argument that discrimination motivated the College not only in denying him tenure but also in terminating his employment 
Page 449 U. S. 251
 on June 30, 1975.  The only discrimination alleged occurred -- and the filing limitations periods therefore commenced -- at the time the tenure decision was made and communicated to respondent.  This is so even though one of the effects of the denial of tenure -- the eventual loss of a teaching position -- did not occur until later.  Pp.  449 U. S. 256-258.
(b) Nor can the final date of employment be adopted, for policy reasons and simplicity, as the date when the limitations periods commenced.  Where, as here, the only challenged practice occurs before the date of termination of employment, the limitations periods necessarily commenced to run before that date.  Pp.  449 U. S. 259-260.
(c) The date when respondent was notified that his grievance had been denied, September 12, 1974, cannot be considered to be the date of the unfavorable tenure decision.  The Board had made clear well before then that it had formally rejected respondent's tenure bid, and entertaining a grievance complaining of the tenure decision does not suggest that the prior decision was in any respect tentative.  Nor does the pendency of a grievance, or some other method of collateral review of an employment decision, toll the running of the limitations periods, Electrical Workers v. Robbins & Myers, Inc., 429 U. S. 229.  Pp.  449 U. S. 260-261.
(d) The District Court's conclusion that the limitations periods had commenced to run by June 26, 1974, when the Board notified respondent that he would be offered a ""terminal"" contract, was not erroneous.  In light of the earlier recommendations of the tenure committee and the Faculty Senate that respondent not receive tenure and the Board's formal vote to deny tenure, the conclusion that the College had established its official position -- and made that position apparent to respondent -- no later than June 26, 1974, was justified.  Pp.  449 U. S. 261-262.

Syllabus 
Under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, compensation for a permanent partial disability must be determined in one of two ways.  First, if the injury is of a kind specifically identified in the schedule set forth in  8(c)(1)-(20) of the Act, the injured employee is entitled to receive two-thirds of his average weekly wages for a specific number of weeks, regardless of whether his earning capacity has been impaired.  Second, in ""all other cases,""  8(c)(21) authorizes compensation equal to two-thirds of the difference between the employee's pre-injury average weekly wages and his post-injury wage-earning capacity, during the period of his disability.  Respondent employee (an employee covered by the Act) in the course of his employment suffered a permanent partial loss of the use of his left leg, an injury specified in the statutory schedule.  But the Administrative Law Judge, rather than awarding him compensation under the schedule, allowed him the larger recovery under  8(c)(21), and the Benefits Review Board affirmed.  The Court of Appeals also affirmed, concluding that the ""all other cases"" language in  8(c)(21) provided a ""remedial alternative"" measure of compensation for cases in which the scheduled benefits failed adequately to compensate for a diminution in wage-earning capabilities.
Held:  Respondent employee's recovery must be limited by the statutory schedule.  Pp.  449 U. S. 273-284.
(a) There is nothing in the language of the Act itself to support the view that the reference to ""all other cases"" in  8(c)(21) was intended to authorize an alternative method for computing disability benefits in certain cases of permanent partial disability already provided for in the statutory schedule.  Pp.  449 U. S. 273-274.
(b) The Act's legislative history is entirely consistent with the conclusion that it was intended to mean what it says.  Pp.  449 U. S. 275-276.
(c) The weight of judicial authority also supports a literal reading of the Act.  Pp.  449 U. S. 276-280.

(d) It is not correct to interpret the Act a6 guaranteeing a completely adequate remedy for all covered disabilities, but rather, like most workmen' compensation legislation, the Act represents a compromise between the competing interests of disabled laborers and their employers.  The use of a schedule of fixed benefits as an exclusive remedy in certain cases is consistent with the employees' interest in receiving a prompt and certain recovery for their industrial injuries as well as with the employers' interest in having their contingent liabilities identified as precisely and as early as possible.

Syllabus 
At a hearing before respondent's criminal trial, a Missouri court denied, in part, respondent's motion to suppress, on Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment grounds, certain evidence that had been seized by the police.  Respondent was subsequently convicted, and the conviction was affirmed on appeal.  Because he did not assert that the state courts had denied him a ""full and fair opportunity"" to litigate his search and seizure claim, respondent was barred by Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, from seeking a writ of habeas corpus in a federal district court.  Nevertheless, he sought federal court redress for the alleged constitutional violation by bringing a suit for damages under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against the officers who had seized the evidence in question.  The Federal District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, holding that collateral estoppel prevented respondent from relitigating the search and seizure question already decided against him in the state courts.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, noting that Stone v. Powell, supra, barred respondent from federal habeas corpus relief, and that the  1983 suit was, therefore, respondent's only route to a federal forum for his constitutional claim, and directed the trial court to allow him to proceed to trial unencumbered by collateral estoppel.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondent's inability to obtain federal habeas corpus relief upon his Fourth Amendment claim renders the doctrine of collateral estoppel inapplicable to his  1983 suit.  Nothing in the language or legislative history of  1983 discloses any congressional intent to deny binding effect to a state court judgment or decision when the state court, acting within its proper jurisdiction, has given the parties a full and fair opportunity to litigate federal claims, and thereby has shown itself willing and able to protect federal rights.  Nor does anything in  1983's legislative history reveal any purpose to afford less deference to judgments in state criminal proceedings than to those in state civil proceedings.  Pp.  449 U.

Syllabus 
The Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, 18 U.S.C.  3576, grants the United States the right, under specified conditions, to appeal the sentence imposed upon a ""dangerous special offender.""  Respondent was convicted of federal racketeering offenses at a trial in Federal District Court.  He was sentenced as a dangerous special offender under 18 U.S.C.  3575 to two 10-year prison terms, to be served concurrently with each other and with a 9-year sentence previously imposed on convictions at an unrelated federal trial.  The United States sought review of the dangerous special offender sentences under  3576, claiming that the District Court abused its discretion in imposing sentences that amounted to additional imprisonment of respondent for only one year, in the face of the findings the court made after the dangerous special offender hearing.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on double jeopardy grounds.
Held:  Section 3576 does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  449 U. S. 126-143.
(a) Section 3576 does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause's guarantee against multiple trials.  ""[W]here a Government appeal presents no threat of successive prosecutions, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not offended.""  United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564,  430 U. S. 569-570.  Accordingly, the Government's taking of a review of respondent's sentence does not, in itself, offend double jeopardy principles just because its success might deprive respondent of the benefit of a more lenient sentence.  Neither the history of sentencing practices, nor the pertinent rulings of this Court, nor even considerations of double jeopardy policy support the proposition that a criminal sentence, once pronounced, is to be accorded constitutional finality similar to that which attaches to a jury's verdict of acquittal.  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not provide the defendant with a right to know at any specific moment in time what the exact limit of his punishment will turn out to be.  Pp.  449 U. S. 132-138.
(b) The increase of a sentence on review under  3576 does not constitute multiple punishment in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  The argument that the defendant perceives the length of his sentence as 
Page 449 U. S. 118
 finally determined when he begins to serve it, and that the trial judge should be prohibited from thereafter increasing the sentence, has no force where, as in the dangerous special offender statute, Congress has specifically provided that the sentence is subject to appeal.  Under such circumstances, there can be no expectation of finality in the original sentence.  Pp.  449 U. S. 138-139.
(c) The conclusion that  3576 violates neither the guarantee against multiple punishment nor the guarantee against multiple trials is consistent with those opinions in which this Court has upheld the constitutionality of two-stage criminal proceedings.

No. 79-870
Argued October 6, 1980
Decided December 9, 1980
449 U.S. 166

Syllabus 
The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (1974 Act) fundamentally restructured the railroad retirement system under the predecessor 1937 Act, which had included provisions whereby a person who worked for both railroad and nonrailroad employers and who qualified for both railroad retirement and social security benefits received benefits under both systems and an accompanying ""windfall"" benefit.  Although providing that employees who lacked the requisite 10 years of railroad employment to qualify for railroad retirement benefits as of the January 1, 1975, changeover date would not receive any windfall benefits, the 1974 Act preserved windfall benefits for individuals who had retired and were receiving dual benefits as of the changeover date.  A provision of the 1974 Act, 45 U.S.C. $ 231b(h)(1), also preserved windfall benefits for employees who had qualified for dual benefits as of the changeover date, but who had not yet retired, if they had (1) performed some railroad service in 1974 or (2) had a ""current connection"" with the railroad industry as of December 31, 1974, or their later retirement date, or (3) completed 25 years of railroad service as of December 31, 1974.  The 1974 Act further provided, 45 U.S.C. $ 231b(h)(2), that employees who had qualified for railroad benefits as of the changeover date, but lacked a current connection with the railroad industry in 1974 and 25 years of railroad employment, could obtain a lesser amount of windfall benefits if they had qualified for social security benefits as of the year (prior to 1975) they left railroad employment.  Appellee and others filed a class action in Federal District Court for a declaratory judgment that $ 231b(h) is unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, contending that it was irrational for Congress to distinguish between employees who had more than 10 years but less than 25 years of railroad employment simply on the basis of whether they had a ""current connection"" with the railroad industry as of the changeover date or as of the date of retirement.  The District Court certified a plaintiff class of all persons eligible to retire between January 1, 1975, and January 31, 1977, who were permanently insured under the Social Security Act as of December 31, 1974, but who were not eligible to receive any windfall benefits because they had left the 
Page 449 U. S. 167
 railroad industry before 1974, had no ""current connection"" with it at the end of 1974, and had less than 25 years of railroad service.  The court held that the differentiation based solely on whether an employee was ""active"" in the railroad business as of 1974 was not ""rationally related"" to the congressional purposes of insuring the solvency of the railroad retirement system and protecting vested benefits.
Held:  The challenged provisions of the 1974 Act do not deny the plaintiff class equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  449 U. S. 174-179.
(a) When social and economic legislation enacted by Congress is challenged on equal protection grounds as being violative of the Fifth Amendment, the rational basis standard is the appropriate standard of judicial review.  If the classification has some ""reasonable basis,"" it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification is not made with mathematical nicety or because, in practice, it results in some inequality.  This Court will not invalidate on equal protection grounds legislation that it simply deems unwise or unartfully drawn.  Cf., e.g., Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471; Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.

			"|"United States. Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz
No. 79-870
Argued October 6, 1980
Decided December 9, 1980
449 U.S. 166

Syllabus 
The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (1974 Act) fundamentally restructured the railroad retirement system under the predecessor 1937 Act, which had included provisions whereby a person who worked for both railroad and nonrailroad employers and who qualified for both railroad retirement and social security benefits received benefits under both systems and an accompanying ""windfall"" benefit.  Although providing that employees who lacked the requisite 10 years of railroad employment to qualify for railroad retirement benefits as of the January 1, 1975, changeover date would not receive any windfall benefits, the 1974 Act preserved windfall benefits for individuals who had retired and were receiving dual benefits as of the changeover date.  A provision of the 1974 Act, 45 U.S.C. $ 231b(h)(1), also preserved windfall benefits for employees who had qualified for dual benefits as of the changeover date, but who had not yet retired, if they had (1) performed some railroad service in 1974 or (2) had a ""current connection"" with the railroad industry as of December 31, 1974, or their later retirement date, or (3) completed 25 years of railroad service as of December 31, 1974.  The 1974 Act further provided, 45 U.S.C. $ 231b(h)(2), that employees who had qualified for railroad benefits as of the changeover date, but lacked a current connection with the railroad industry in 1974 and 25 years of railroad employment, could obtain a lesser amount of windfall benefits if they had qualified for social security benefits as of the year (prior to 1975) they left railroad employment.  Appellee and others filed a class action in Federal District Court for a declaratory judgment that $ 231b(h) is unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, contending that it was irrational for Congress to distinguish between employees who had more than 10 years but less than 25 years of railroad employment simply on the basis of whether they had a ""current connection"" with the railroad industry as of the changeover date or as of the date of retirement.  The District Court certified a plaintiff class of all persons eligible to retire between January 1, 1975, and January 31, 1977, who were permanently insured under the Social Security Act as of December 31, 1974, but who were not eligible to receive any windfall benefits because they had left the 
Page 449 U. S. 167
 railroad industry before 1974, had no ""current connection"" with it at the end of 1974, and had less than 25 years of railroad service.  The court held that the differentiation based solely on whether an employee was ""active"" in the railroad business as of 1974 was not ""rationally related"" to the congressional purposes of insuring the solvency of the railroad retirement system and protecting vested benefits.
Held:  The challenged provisions of the 1974 Act do not deny the plaintiff class equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  449 U. S. 174-179.
(a) When social and economic legislation enacted by Congress is challenged on equal protection grounds as being violative of the Fifth Amendment, the rational basis standard is the appropriate standard of judicial review.  If the classification has some ""reasonable basis,"" it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification is not made with mathematical nicety or because, in practice, it results in some inequality.  This Court will not invalidate on equal protection grounds legislation that it simply deems unwise or unartfully drawn.  Cf., e.g., Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471; Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U. S. 535.  Pp.  449 U. S. 174-176.
(b) Under such principles, $ 231b(h) does not violate the Fifth Amendment.  Because Congress could have eliminated windfall benefits for all classes of employees, it is not constitutionally impermissible for Congress to have drawn lines between groups of employees for the purpose of phasing out those benefits.  Congress did not achieve its purpose in a patently arbitrary or irrational way, since it could properly conclude that persons who had actually acquired statutory entitlement to windfall benefits while still employed in the railroad industry had a greater equitable claim to those benefits than the members of the plaintiff class who were no longer in railroad employment when they became eligible for dual benefits.  Furthermore, the ""current connection"" test is not a patently arbitrary means for determining which employees are ""career railroaders,"" the class for whom the 1974 Act was designed.  Pp.  449 U. S. 176-178.

Decided December 8, 1980
449 U.S. 86

Syllabus 
Respondent, who had escaped from the Arkansas Department of Corrections, was apprehended in California and was served with a warrant of arrest and rendition issued by the Governor of California pursuant to the Governor of Arkansas' request for extradition.  Respondent thereafter challenged the issuance of the warrant in both state and federal courts.  Ultimately, the California Supreme Court issued a writ of habeas corpus directing a California trial court to conduct an inquiry as to whether the Arkansas penitentiary in which respondent would be confined was presently operated in conformance with the Eighth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.
Held:  The Extradition Clause, Art. IV,  2, cl. 2, and its implementing statute, 18 U.S.C.  3182, do not give the courts of the ""asylum"" or ""sending"" State authority to inquire into the prison conditions of the ""demanding"" State.  Once the Governor of California issued the warrant, claims as to constitutional defects in the Arkansas penal system should be heard in the courts of Arkansas, not those of California.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 8, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 In Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236d 1060 (1968), this Court held that members of a local school board had standing to challenge in federal court the constitutionality of a state statute that required them to lend books to parochial school students. Addressing the constitutional requirement that the parties have a "" personal stake in the outcome"" of the litigation, the Court found such a "" stake"" in the dilemma that the appellants confronted: a choice between violating their oaths of office to support the United States Constitution or refusing to comply with the statutory requirements, a step which was "" likely to bring their expulsion from office and also a reduction in state funds for their school districts."" Id., at 241, n. 5, n. 5. The Court of Appeals in the present case stated that 
 ""[w]ere Allen the last word from the Supreme Court on standing, we could simply adopt [its] rationale . . . and determine that the councilmembers in the case before us have standing on the basis that they believe that enforcing the . . . ordinances would violate their oaths of office."" 625 F.2d 231, 236 (1980). 
 The court declined to follow Allen, however, holding instead that our subsequent cases have effectively overruled Allen. I do not believe that we have sub silentio overruled Allen. The Courts of Appeals, however, are in conflict over its continuing validity. Compare Regents of the Univ. of Minn. v. NCAA, 560 F.2d 352, 363-364 (CA8 1977), and Aguayo v. Richardson, 473 F.2d 1090, 1100 (CA2 1973), with Finch v. Mississippi State Medical Assn., Inc., 585 F.2d 765 (CA5 1978). If the Allen doctrine is to be reconsidered, it should be done by this Court, and not by the various Courts of Appeals. I therefore dissent from the denial of certiorari.

 The California Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (CTRPA) is a political subdivision of the State of California, exercising responsibility for the development and enforcement of plans for land and resource development in the Lake Tahoe region of California. Cal.Gov't Code Ann. 67040 et seq. ( West Supp.1980). The city of South Lake Tahoe lies within the geographic area regulated by the CTRPA. Petitioners, the city, its Mayor and four council members, are required by law to enforce CTRPA regulations, Cal. Gov't Code Ann. 67072, 67102 (West Supp.1980). A willful failure of a state official to perform his duty is a misdemeanor, Cal.Gov't Code Ann. 1222 (West 1980), which may result in removal from office. Cal.Penal Code Ann. 661 (West 1970). 
 In August 1975, the CTRPA enacted the plan of land-use and transportation regulations that is the subject of this lawsuit. Petitioners, believing that enforcement of these regulations would be unconstitutional on a number of grounds,1 brought suit in Federal District Court seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. The District Court dismissed the action, believing that federal court abstention was appropriate.

 The Court of Appeals relied primarily on Schlesinger v. Reservists to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208 (1974), and United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166 ( 1974), to support its conclusion that petitioners could no longer claim standing under [449 U.S. 1039 , 1041]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 8, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal of California for the Second Appellate District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, a 13-year-old minor, was taken from his home to a police station for questioning by police officers who had neither an arrest warrant nor probable cause for his arrest. The court below held that there was no violation of petitioner's constitutional rights because the officers acted on instructions from his mother. Because I believe the case presents an important question concerning a parent's authority to waive her minor child's right under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to be free from ""unreasonable seizures,"" I dissent from denial of the petition for a writ of certiorari. 
 I  
 On March 8, 1979, an investigator with the Los Angeles Police Department told two of his subordinates that he had been in contact with a mother about one of her children who allegedly had been involved in a burglary. He told the officers that the mother had agreed to bring the minor to the police station the previous day but had failed to do so, and he instructed the officers to go to the woman's house and find out when she would bring her son to the station. 
 At the house, the officers were invited into a bedroom where they saw petitioner's mother lying in bed. The officers informed her of the reason for their visit and asked why she had not brought her son to the police station the previous day as she had promised. Petitioner's mother explained that her car had broken down, and when the officers asked her if 
Page 449 U.S. 1043 , 1044
 she could bring the boy in that day, she told them that her car was still not working. The officers next inquired where her son was. The mother pointed to petitioner, who was lying in another bed in the same room, and told him to wake up. The officers then asked her when she would be able to bring her son in and she replied: ""Well, you officers are here. You can take him down."" She told the officers that she had been having trouble with her son and wanted to know if he had been involved in a burglary so she could notify his probation officer. She then told petitioner to get out of bed and get dressed because the officers were waiting for him. Petitioner dressed and left the house with the officers, who placed him in handcuffs before driving him to the police station. At the station, petitioner was given the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). He indicated that he understood them, waived his rights, and confessed to the burglary.  1 

 A petition was filed against petitioner in juvenile court charging him with burglary in violation of 459 of the Cal.Penal Code Ann. (West Supp.1980). Petitioner filed a motion to suppress the confession he made at the police station as the fruit of an illegal arrest. At the combined suppression and adjudication hearing, the State conceded that the police officers had neither an arrest warrant nor probable cause to arrest petitioner at the time he was taken to the station for questioning. Nonetheless, the court denied the suppression motion and relied on the confession in sustaining the charge against petitioner. At the dispositional hearing, the court ordered that petitioner be removed from the custody of his mother. Physical confinement was set at a maximum period of two years. [449 U.S. 1043 , 1045]

 Duncan Peder McKENZIE, Jr.v. State of MONTANANo. 80-5123 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 8, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Montana. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 On two prior occasions, this Court has vacated decisions of the Supreme Court of Montana in this death penalty case and remanded the case for further consideration. McKenzie v. Montana, 443 U.S. 903 (1979); McKenzie v. Montana, 433 U.S. 905 (1977). In both instances, we directed the Supreme Court of Montana to reconsider the case in light of intervening decisions of this Court establishing that due process forbids a State to place on a defendant the burden to disprove an element of the offense charged. McKenzie v. Montana, 443 U.S. 903 (1979) ( directing reconsideration in light of Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510 (1979)); McKenzie v. Montana, 433 U.S. 905 (1977) (directing reconsideration in light of Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197 ( 1977)). On each remand, the state court reaffirmed the conviction and reinstated the death penalty. Mont., 
Page 449 U.S. 1050 , 1051
 608 P.2d 428 (1980); 177 Mont. 280, 581 P.2d 1205 (1978). In its most recent decision in this case, the State Supreme Court conceded that the jury instructions unconstitutionally shifted to petitioner the burden to disprove that he had the criminal intent necessary to support conviction. 608 P.2d, at 457-458. The court nonetheless avoided granting petitioner a new trial by deeming this constitutional violation ""harmless error."" 608 P.2d, at 458-459. A state court's analysis of harmless error in a typical case may not present a question worthy of full review by this Court, yet, where, as here, the death penalty is the result, close scrutiny is required.

 Duncan Peder McKENZIE, Jr.v. State of MONTANANo. 80-5123 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 8, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Montana. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 On two prior occasions, this Court has vacated decisions of the Supreme Court of Montana in this death penalty case and remanded the case for further consideration. McKenzie v. Montana, 443 U.S. 903 (1979); McKenzie v. Montana, 433 U.S. 905 (1977). In both instances, we directed the Supreme Court of Montana to reconsider the case in light of intervening decisions of this Court establishing that due process forbids a State to place on a defendant the burden to disprove an element of the offense charged. McKenzie v. Montana, 443 U.S. 903 (1979) ( directing reconsideration in light of Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510 (1979)); McKenzie v. Montana, 433 U.S. 905 (1977) (directing reconsideration in light of Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197 ( 1977)). On each remand, the state court reaffirmed the conviction and reinstated the death penalty. Mont., 
Page 449 U.S. 1050 , 1051
 608 P.2d 428 (1980); 177 Mont. 280, 581 P.2d 1205 (1978). In its most recent decision in this case, the State Supreme Court conceded that the jury instructions unconstitutionally shifted to petitioner the burden to disprove that he had the criminal intent necessary to support conviction. 608 P.2d, at 457-458. The court nonetheless avoided granting petitioner a new trial by deeming this constitutional violation ""harmless error."" 608 P.2d, at 458-459. A state court's analysis of harmless error in a typical case may not present a question worthy of full review by this Court, yet, where, as here, the death penalty is the result, close scrutiny is required. Because I find the court's analysis of harmless error lacking of evenhanded treatment, I dissent from this Court's denial of certiorari.

No. 79-1003
Argued October 15, 1980
Decided December 2, 1980
449 U.S. 54

Syllabus 
Petitioner county obtained an injunction in a California state court prohibiting the owner of a tract of land from selling water from a well on the premises for use outside the county in violation of a conditional use permit required by a county zoning ordinance and allowing the sale of water only for use within the county.  The California Supreme Court affirmed, and this Court dismissed the tract owner's appeal.  Meanwhile, respondents, merchants involved in the tract owner's sale of water to Mexico, brought suit in Federal District Court in California, challenging the conditional permit on the ground that it violated the Commerce Clause, and secured a preliminary injunction restraining petitioner county from enforcing the permit.  The court rejected the county's argument that the Anti-Injunction Act -- which prohibits a federal court from granting an injunction ""to stay proceedings in a State court"" except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments -- operated to prohibit the court from so enjoining the county.  The United States Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the state trial court proceedings had terminated, that the federal injunction, therefore, did not violate the rule that the Anti-Injunction Act cannot be evaded by addressing a federal injunction to the parties, rather than the state court, and that, moreover, under Hale v. Bimco Trading, Inc., 306 U. S. 375, third parties were not barred under that Act from challenging a statute on federal constitutional grounds when the statute was also under litigation in the state courts.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in finding the Anti-Injunction Act inapplicable to prohibit the District Court from enjoining petitioner county from enforcing the tract owner's permit.  Pp.  449 U. S. 58-60.
(a) The Court of Appeals' view that, after a state court has entered an injunction, its proceedings are concluded for Anti-Injunction Act purposes is contrary to the holding of Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S. 281, that, although a federal injunction against a certain party's giving effect to a state court injunction was 
Page 449 U. S. 55
 directed only at that party, the injunction was nevertheless one ""to stay proceedings in a State court"" within the meaning of the Anti-Injunction Act.  Pp.  449 U. S. 559.
(b) Hale v. Bimco Trading, Inc., supra, does not govern this case, where neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed the question whether respondents were ""strangers to the state court proceeding"" who were not bound as though they were parties to such proceeding.  Unless respondents were such ""strangers,"" the federal injunction was barred by the Anti-Injunction Act.  Pp.  449 U. S. 59-60.

National Crushed Stone Association
No. 79-770
Argued October 7, 1980
Decided December 2, 1980*
449 U.S. 64

Syllabus 
Under  301(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to set 1977 effluent limitations for categories of point sources, requiring such sources to meet standards based on application of the ""best practicable control technology currently available"" (BPT), and 1987 limitations, requiring all point sources to meet standards based on application of the ""best available technology economically achievable"" (BAT).  Section 301(c) of the Act provides for variances from 1987 BAT effluent limitations for individual point sources upon a showing ""that such modified requirements (1) will represent the maximum use of technology within the economic capability of the owner or operators; and (2) will result in reasonable further progress toward the elimination of the discharge of pollutants.""  However, the Act contains no similar variance provision authorizing consideration of the economic ability of the individual operator to meet the cost of complying with 1977 BPT standards.  In 1977, the EPA promulgated BPT pollution discharge limitations for the coal mining industry and for certain portions of the mineral mining and processing industry.  Under the regulations, a greater than normal cost of implementation will be considered in acting on a request for a variance, but a variance will not be granted on the basis of the applicant's economic inability to meet the cost of implementing the uniform standard.  Respondents sought review of the regulations in various Courts of Appeals, challenging both the substantive standards and the variance clause. All of the petitions were transferred to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which set aside the variance provision as unduly restrictive and required the EPA to consider, inter alia, the factors set out in  301(c), including the applicant's economic capability.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in not accepting the EPA's interpretation of the Act.  The EPA is not required by the Act to consider economic 
Page 449 U. S. 65
 capability in granting variances from its uniform BPT standards.  Pp.  449 U. S. 73-85.
(a) The statute's plain language does not support the Court of Appeals' position.  Section 301(c)'s requirement for a BAT variance of ""reasonable further progress"" toward the elimination of pollutant discharges refers to the prior BPT standard, but there is no comparable prior standard with respect to BPT limitations.  And since BPT limitations do not require an industrial category to commit the maximum resources economically possible to pollution control, even if affordable, the  301(c) BAT variance factor as to the maximum use of technology within the applicant's economic capability is inapposite in the BPT context.  More importantly, under the Act, the Administrator of the EPA, in determining BPT limitations, is directed to consider the benefits of effluent reductions as compared to the cost of pollution control in defining the best practicable technology at a level that would effect the 1977 goal of substantially reducing total pollution produced by each industrial category.  Thus, the statute contemplated regulations that would require a substantial number of point sources with the poorest performances either to conform to BPT standards or to cease production.  To allow a BPT variance based on economic capability and not to require adherence to the prescribed minimum technology would permit the employment of the very practices that the Administrator had rejected in establishing the best practicable technology currently available in the industry.  Pp.  449 U. S. 73-78.
(b) The EPA's interpretation of the statutory language is also supported by the legislative history, which shows that Congress understood that the economic capability provision of  301(c) was limited to BAT variances; foresaw and accepted the economic hardship, including the closing of some plants, that BPT effluent limitations would cause; and took certain steps to alleviate this hardship, steps which did not include allowing a BPT variance based on economic capability.  Pp.  449 U. S. 79-83.
(c) In the face of  301(c)'s explicit limitation to BAT variances and in the absence of any other specific direction in the statute to provide for BPT variances in connection with permits for individual point sources, the Administrator adopted a reasonable construction of the statutory mandate, and the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that, since BAT limitations are to be more stringent than BPT limitations, the variance provision for the latter must be at least as flexible as that for the former with respect to affordability.

 December 1, 1980
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 Under Connecticut law, a person is guilty of a misdemeanor when ""with intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, he makes a telephone call, whether or not a conversation ensues, in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm."" Conn.Gen.Stat. 53a-183(a)(3) (1975 rev.). Petitioner was convicted of violating this statute after she made a telephone call to a woman with whom she had some personal quarrel. Following an unsuccessful direct appeal in the state courts,1 petitioner brought a federal habeas corpus action arguing that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found no constitutional infirmity. The petition for certiorari challenges that judgment. 
 To be sure, a State has a valid interest in protecting its citizens against unwarranted invasions of privacy. Rowan v. Post Office Department, 397 U.S. 728 (1970). See generally, Note, Give Me a Home Where No Salesmen Phone: Telephone Solicitation and the First Amendment, 7 Hastings Const.L.Q. 129 (1979). This is especially true when unprotected speech, such as obscenity or threats of physical violence, is involved. But it is equally clear that a State may not pursue these interests by unduly infringing on what would 
Page 449 U.S. 1023 , 1024
 otherwise be protected speech. It is therefore critical to recall that speech may be ""annoying"" without losing its First Amendment protection 2 and that the Connecticut statute on its face criminalizes any telephone call that annoys and was intended to do so. It is not difficult to imagine various clearly protected telephone communications that would fall within the ban of the Connecticut statute. [Footnote 3] As such it is fairly arguable that the statute is substantially overbroad and hence unconstitutional. Lewis v. New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130 (1974); Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518 (1972).4

Syllabus 
After a Texas state court's injunction against respondents' production of minerals from certain oil leases was dissolved by an appellate court as having been illegally issued, respondents filed suit in Federal District Court alleging a cause of action for damages under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against the judge who issued the injunction, the corporation that had obtained the injunction, its owner, and the sureties on the injunction bond (one of whom is the petitioner).  Respondents claimed that the injunction had been corruptly issued as the result of a conspiracy between the judge and the other defendants, thus causing a deprivation of property without due process of law.  The District Court dismissed the action, holding that the judge was immune from liability in a  1983 suit because the injunction was a judicial act within the jurisdiction of the state court, and that, with the dismissal of the judge, the remaining defendants could not be said to have conspired ""under color"" of state law within the meaning of  1983.  The Court of Appeals agreed that the judge was immune from suit, but ultimately reversed as to the dismissal of the claims against the other defendants.
Held:  The action against the private parties accused of conspiring with the judge is not subject to dismissal.  Private persons, jointly engaged with state officials in a challenged action, are acting ""under color"" of law for purposes of  1983 actions.  And the judge's immunity from damages liability for an official act that was allegedly the product of a corrupt conspiracy involving bribery of the judge does not change the character of his action or that of his coconspirators.  Historically at common law, judicial immunity does not insulate from damages liability those private persons who corruptly conspire with a judge.  Nor has the doctrine of judicial immunity been considered historically as excusing a judge from responding as a witness when his coconspirators are sued, even though a charge of conspiracy and judicial corruption will be aired and decided.  Gravel v. United States, 408 U. S. 606, distinguished.  The potential harm to the public from denying immunity to coconspirators if the factfinder mistakenly upholds a charge of a corrupt conspiracy is outweighed by the benefits of providing a remedy

449 U.S. 33

Syllabus 
Held:  Where the District Court, because of error in certain of its evidentiary rulings in respondent's private antitrust action, had entered a nonappealable interlocutory order granting a new trial after the jury had returned a verdict for respondent, the Court of Appeals erred in issuing a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to restore the verdict as to liability but permitting a new trial on damages.  The remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations. The party seeking issuance of the writ must have no other adequate means to obtain the relief he desires, and thus a trial court's ordering of a new trial, which is reviewable on direct appeal after a final judgment has been entered, rarely, if ever, will justify the issuance of the writ.  To overturn a new trial order by way of mandamus undermines the policy against piecemeal appellate review.

Syllabus 
Held:  A Kentucky statute requiring the posting of a copy of the Ten Commandments, purchased with private contributions, on the wall of each public school classroom in the State has no secular legislative purpose, and therefore is unconstitutional as violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  While the state legislature required the notation in small print at the bottom of each display that
""[t]he secular application of the Ten Commandments is clearly seen in its adoption as the fundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States,""
such an ""avowed"" secular purpose is not sufficient to avoid conflict with the First Amendment.  The preeminent purpose of posting the Ten Commandments, which do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters, is plainly religious in nature, and the posting serves no constitutional educational function.  Cf. Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203.  That the posted copies are financed by voluntary private contributions is immaterial, for the mere posting under the auspices of the legislature provides the official support of the state government that the Establishment Clause prohibits.  Nor is it significant that the Ten Commandments are merely posted, rather than read aloud, for it is no defense to urge that the religious practices may be relatively minor encroachments on the First Amendment

|449 u.s. 5|"Hughes v. Rowe
No. 79-6000
Decided November 10, 1980
449 U.S. 5

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a state prisoner, was placed in a segregation cell for a violation of prison regulations, was given a hearing two days later, and, after admitting the violation, was sentenced to 10 days' segregation.  After exhausting administrative remedies, petitioner brought a federal court civil rights action against respondent Illinois corrections officers under 42 U.S.C. $ 1983.  The complaint, which was prepared without the assistance of counsel, raised federal questions concerning, inter alia, the initial decision to place petitioner in segregation without a prior hearing.  Respondents filed no affidavits denying or explaining the facts alleged by petitioner.  The District Court dismissed the complaint without taking any evidence, and later ordered petitioner to pay counsel fees under 42 U.S.C. $ 1988 for services rendered by the Attorney General of Illinois in representing respondents in the action.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Although petitioner's allegations as to bias of certain of the officers conducting the disciplinary hearing after his initial segregation, procedural irregularities at the hearing, unequal treatment, and cruel and unusual punishment were properly dismissed for failure to state a claim -- even under the controlling principle that a prisoner's complaint prepared without counsel should not be dismissed unless it appears beyond doubt that he can prove no set of facts entitling him to relief -- nevertheless the complaint was adequate at least to require some response from respondents, by way of affidavit or otherwise, to petitioner's claim that his initial confinement to segregation violated due process because it occurred without a prior hearing.  Segregation without a prior hearing may violate due process if the postponement of procedural protections is not justified by apprehended emergency conditions.  Here, the record did not show that petitioner's immediate segregation was necessitated by emergency conditions, and an administrative regulation authorizing segregation pending investigation of disciplinary matters, where required ""in the interest of institutional security and safety,"" did not justify dismissal of the suit in the absence of any showing that concern for institutional security and safety as the basis for petitioner's immediate segregation without a prior hearing. 
Page 449 U. S. 6

2. The award of attorney's fees entered against petitioner was improper.  The defendant in an action brought under 42 U.S.C.  1983 may recover attorney's fees from the plaintiff only if the district court finds ""that the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation,"" cf. Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412,  434 U. S. 421.  No such finding supported the fee award in this case, and the limitations apply with special force in an action, such as here, initiated by an uncounseled prisoner.  Moreover, the fact that a prisoner's complaint, even when liberally construed, cannot survive a motion to dismiss does not, without more, entitle the defendant to attorney's fees.
Certiorari granted; affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

 Glover ALLISONv. FULTON-DeKALB HOSPITAL AUTHORITYNo. 79-6743 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 3, 1980
 The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. 
 Treating the papers whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for a writ of certiorari, certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 The issue on this appeal is whether the Georgia Supreme Court's reliance upon a newly announced state procedural rule requiring litigants to raise federal constitutional claims earlier than other claims constituted reliance upon an independent and adequate state ground barring this Court's jurisdiction. 
 Appellee Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority filed a complaint on February 5, 1975, against appellant Allison for hospital expenses incurred by his 16-year-old daughter when she gave birth to an illegitimate child. There was no contract between Allison and the hospital. Instead, the suit was brought under a now repealed Georgia paternal child-support statute making it the duty of the father to provide for the ""maintenance, protection, and education of his child"" until majority. Ga.Code 74-105 ( 1978).1 
Page 449 U.S. 939 , 940
 Allison's answer to the complaint denied owing any money; however, his answer failed to raise any constitutional challenge to the statute. In April 1976, the hospital answered interrogatories revealing, inter alia, that Allison was billed because of his status as father of the minor patient. Almost three years later, but still before the start of trial, Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268 (1979), was decided by this Court, and Allison amended his answer to include an equal protection challenge to the statute. His case was tried several days later, and resulted in entry of judgment for the hospital. Observing that the debt was incurred more than four years before Orr was decided, the trial court, without analysis, concluded, inter alia, that the constitutional defense established by Orr should not be given retroactive effect. 
 On appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the judgment, refusing to reach the constitutional question on the ground that it had not been timely raised. The court noted that under state case law, constitutional challenges must be raised ""at the first opportunity,"" which the court interpreted as occurring when ""the law which is subject to constitutional objection comes to the attention of the challenger's attorney,"" 245 Ga. 445, 446, 265 S.E.2d 575, 576 (1980). In this case, the court interpreted the rule to require constitutional challenge at least at the time the hospital answered Allison's interrogatories. 
 Because I entertain serious doubt whether our decided cases permit the Georgia Supreme Court to avoid decision of Allison's federal constitutional claim by charging him with the duty to anticipate application of the new procedural rule announced in his case, NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 457-458, 1169-1170 ( 1958), and because I doubt in any event that the rule serves a legitimate state interest, Henry v. Mississippi, [449 U.S. 939 , 941]

 Jerome BLAIR v. Commonwealth of KENTUCKY. 
 Richard CARPENTER and Stephen Borders v. Commonwealth of KENTUCKYNo. 79- 1795No.79-1798 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 3, 1980
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Kentucky. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 These petitions present the question whether the decision of the Supreme Court of Kentucky rests upon an independent and adequate state procedural ground that bars this Court's review of petitioners' constitutional claim, inter alia, that their convictions were based on a record lacking sufficient evidence. Because the question of when and how failure to comply with state procedural rules precludes our consideration of a federal constitutional claim is itself a federal question, Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 447-448, 567-569 ( 1965), and because I have serious doubts whether the Kentucky Supreme Court could properly insist on compliance with the procedural rule it invoked, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 Petitioners Carpenter, Borders, and Blair were convicted in a Kentucky trial court of wanton endangerment in the first degree and criminal mischief in the third degree. The charges stemmed from the allegation that they fired a shotgun at businesses and automobiles, injuring one person and damaging property. All three petitioners moved for directed verdict of acquittal at the close of the Commonwealth's case, and also moved for new trial after the jury verdict. Both motions were grounded on claims that the evidence was insufficient to sustain guilty verdicts. However, no petitioner

 moved for a directed verdict on that ground at the close of all the evidence. 
 The Kentucky intermediate appellate court entertained petitioners' appeals from their convictions, and set them aside after finding that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions. [Footnote 1] The Supreme Court of Kentucky affirmed as to Carpenter and Borders, but reversed as to Blair . The court rejected the Commonwealth's argument that under state procedural law, Kimbrough v. Commonwealth, 550 S.W.2d 525, 529 (Ky.1977), petitioners Carpenter and Borders' failure at the close of all the evidence to move for a directed verdict for insufficiency of the evidence forfeited their right of review on that ground. Citing Vachon v. New Hampshire, 414 U.S. 478, 480, 665 (1974), the Kentucky Supreme Court not only held that ""the evidence was insufficient"" but also concluded that ""the record before us contains no relevant evidence linking Carpenter and Borders to the charged offenses."" ( Emphasis added.) Blair's case differed, the Court held, because there was "" relevant evidence"" as to him. See Thompson v. Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 206, 629 (1960). The court therefore applied the Kimbrough rule and held that Blair had waived his right to raise the insufficiency-of-the-evidence issue on appeal. 
 The Commonwealth filed a petition for rehearing. This time, the Kentucky Supreme Court reversed itself and reinstated the convictions of Carpenter and Borders. The court held that, ""as clarified in Kimbrough , . . . in order for the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence to be preserved for appellate review, the party wishing to use the insufficiency as a basis for his appeal must have moved for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence, not just at the close of the Commonwealth's case in chief."" 592 S.W.2d 132, 133 (1979).

 Jerome BLAIR v. Commonwealth of KENTUCKY. 
 Richard CARPENTER and Stephen Borders v. Commonwealth of KENTUCKYNo. 79- 1795No.79-1798 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 3, 1980
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Kentucky. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 These petitions present the question whether the decision of the Supreme Court of Kentucky rests upon an independent and adequate state procedural ground that bars this Court's review of petitioners' constitutional claim, inter alia, that their convictions were based on a record lacking sufficient evidence. Because the question of when and how failure to comply with state procedural rules precludes our consideration of a federal constitutional claim is itself a federal question, Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 447-448, 567-569 ( 1965), and because I have serious doubts whether the Kentucky Supreme Court could properly insist on compliance with the procedural rule it invoked, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 Petitioners Carpenter, Borders, and Blair were convicted in a Kentucky trial court of wanton endangerment in the first degree and criminal mischief in the third degree. The charges stemmed from the allegation that they fired a shotgun at businesses and automobiles, injuring one person and damaging property. All three petitioners moved for directed verdict of acquittal at the close of the Commonwealth's case, and also moved for new trial after the jury verdict. Both motions were grounded on claims that the evidence was insufficient to sustain guilty verdicts. However, no petitioner 
Page 449 U.S. 962 , 963
 moved for a directed verdict on that ground at the close of all the evidence. 
 The Kentucky intermediate appellate court entertained petitioners' appeals from their convictions, and set them aside after finding that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions. [Footnote 1] The Supreme Court of Kentucky affirmed as to Carpenter and Borders, but reversed as to Blair . The court rejected the Commonwealth's argument that under state procedural law, Kimbrough v. Commonwealth, 550 S.W.2d 525, 529 (Ky.1977), petitioners Carpenter and Borders' failure at the close of all the evidence to move for a directed verdict for insufficiency of the evidence forfeited their right of review on that ground.

 LORAIN JOURNAL COMPANY, The News-Herald and J. Theodore Diadiun v. Michael MILKOVICHNo. 80-100 Supreme Court of the United States November 3, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Ohio, Lake County. 
 The motion of Beacon Journal Publishing Company et al. for leave to file a brief as amici curiae is granted. The motion of Ohio Newspapers Association for leave to file a brief as amicus curiae is granted. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 This petition for certiorari raises an important question concerning limitations on the authority of trial courts to grant dismissals, summary judgments, or judgments notwithstanding the verdict 1 in favor of media defendants in libel actions, based on the qualified privilege outlined in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 ( 1964). 
 On January 8, 1975, the News-Herald of Willoughby, Ohio, published a column by sportswriter Ted Diadium criticizing respondent Michael Milkovich, a wrestling coash at Maple Heights High Schoo, who is treated as a 'public figure' for purposes of this case. Headlined ""Maple beat the law with the 'big lie,' "" the column accused Milkovich of lying about a fracas that occurred during one of his team's wrestling matches. 
 On February 9, 1974, the Maple High School wrestling team, coached by Milkovich, faced a team from Mentor High School. A brawl involving both wrestlers and spectators erupted after a controversial ruling by a referee . Several wrestlers were injured. The Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) subsequently conducted a hearing into the occurrence, censured Milkovich for his conduct at the match, 
Page 449 U.S. 966 , 967
 placed his team on probation for the school year, and declared the team ineligible to compete in the state wrestling tournament. Diadiun attended and reported on both the match and the hearing, at which Milkovich had defended his behavior. Thereafter, a group of parents and high school wrestlers filed suit in Franklin County Common Pleas Court, claiming that the OHSAA had denied the team due process. Milkovich, not a party to that lawsuit, appeared as a witness for the plaintiffs. On January 7, 1975, the court held that due process had been denied, and enjoined the team's suspension. Barrett v. Ohio High School Athletic Assn., No. 74CV-09-3390. 2 
 Justice STEWART would deny this petition for want of a final judgment. 
 Diadiun did not attend the court hearing, review the transcript, or read the court's opinion, but he wrote a column about the decision based on his own recollection of the wrestling match and ensuing OHSAA hearing and on a description of the court proceeding given him by an OHSAA Commissioner. In the column, Diadiun stated that Milkovich and others had "" misrepresented"" the occurrences at the OHSAA hearing, and that Milkovich's testimony ""had enough contradictions and obvious untruths so that the six board members were able to see through it."" Diadiun went on to say, however, that at the later court hearing Milkovich and a fellow witness "" apparently had their version of the incident polished and reconstructed, and the judge apparently believed them."" Diadiun concluded that anyone who had attended the match ""knows in his heart that Milkovich . . . lied at the hearing after . . . having given his solemn oath to tell the truth. But [he] got away with it."" 
 Milkovich filed a libel action in state court against petitioners Diadiun, the News-Herald, and the latter's parent [449 U.S. 966 , 968]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 3, 1980 Rehearing Denied Jan. 12, 1981. 
 See 449 U.S. 1104. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 More than half a century ago, this Court observed that ""[t]he settled policy of Congress, in authorizing the taking of land and appurtenances, has been to limit the right to compensation to interests in the land taken ."" Mitchell v. United States, 267 U.S. 341, 346, 294 (1925). In 1970, however, Congress enacted the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act, wherein it declared its purpose to ""establish a uniform policy for the fair and equitable treatment of persons displaced as a result of Federal and federally assisted programs in order that such persons shall not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole."" 84 Stat. 1895, 42 U.S.C. 4621. The substantive provisions of the Act provide for actual reasonable expenses in moving the condemnee, his business, his family, his farm, or other personal property, and actual reasonable expenses in searching for a replacement business or farm. The only substantive provisions of the Act dealing with state condemnations in general are carefully treated in 42 U. S.C. 4627 and 4630, which forbid the head of a ""Federal agency"" to approve a ""grant to, or contract or agreement with, a State agency, under which Federal financial assistance will be available to pay all or part of the cost of any program or project . . . unless he receives satisfactory assurances from such State agency"" that fair and reasonable relocation payments and assistance shall be provided to or for displaced persons, as are required to be provided by a federal agency under the earlier sections of the Act. 
Page 449 U.S. 971 , 972
 We may expect frequent interaction between the Federal and State Governments such as is contemplated by the Act, and the fact that this case raises serious questions under the Act concerning federal jurisdiction would lead me to grant certiorari. 
 Beaird-Poulan, a corporation engaged in the manufacture of chain saws, owned a 16.5-acre tract of land in Louisiana. It operated plant facilities on the front portion of this tract, while the rest consisted of unimproved timberland not used for business purposes in any way. In May 1971 the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) expropriated a 3-acre section of the unused portion of the tract for construction of Interstate 220, a federally assisted highway project. Beaird-Poulan moved some of its facilities to a new plant location after the expropriation, and filed suit against DOTD and the United States Secretary of Transportation in Federal District Court to recover its moving expenses. It alleged that its action arose under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act, 42 U.S.C . 4601 et seq. Pursuant to 4630 Louisiana had enacted its own Relocation Assistance Act, La.Rev.Stat.Ann. 38:3101-3110 (West Supp. 1980). 
 The United States District Court, after preliminary litigation as to the meaning of the Louisiana Constitution, ordered respondent to submit its claim to petitioner, and ordered that petitioner conduct a full, fair, and complete adversary hearing, retaining ""jurisdiction of this case to review the administrative determination."" After considering respondent's claim petitioner denied it both because the state legislation was not in effect when the claim arose, and because respondent did not qualify as a displaced person.

|449 u.s. 1|"Colorado v. Bannister
No. 79-1901
Decided October 20, 1980
449 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Shortly after a police officer observed a speeding automobile, he heard a police radio dispatch which reported that a theft of motor vehicle parts, including chrome lug nuts, had occurred in the area, and which described two suspects.  A few minutes later, he again spotted the speeding automobile and followed it into a service station for the purpose of issuing a traffic citation.  As he approached the car, respondent and his companion stepped out of it, and during an ensuing conversation with the car's occupants, the officer observed chrome lug nuts and lug wrenches in plain view in the car.  Recognizing that the car's occupants met the description of the suspects, the officer arrested them and seized the lug nuts and wrenches.  Before respondent's trial on charges of stealing motor vehicle parts, the trial court granted his motion to suppress the seized items, and the Colorado Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The circumstances in this case provided probable cause for the officer's seizure of the incriminating items without a warrant.  Cf. Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132; Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 20, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, dissenting. 
 It seems to me that the Court's denial of certiorari in this case utterly ignores the parties' intent in executing a consent to a judgment and in their subsequent actions pursuant thereto. 
 Petitioner is a sugar refiner. It filed suit under 20(11) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 386, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 20(11),1 against respondent, a common carrier by motor, for damage to a cargo of sugar respondent undertook to transport. Although respondent by its formal answer denied liability, the real issue in the litigation proved to be the amount for which respondent was liable. Petitioner-shipper took the position that, under Gore Products, Inc. v. Texas & N. O. R. Co., 34 So.2d 418 (La.App.1948), the proper measure of damages was the profit lost by petitioner on the completed sale, or $7,529.28. Respondent-carrier, on the other hand, contended that the proper measure was the cost of reprocessing the sugar for resale to another customer, or $488.65.2 Respondent moved for partial summary judgment only on the issue of the quantum of damages. Over

 petitioner's objection, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana granted that motion, leaving open, so far as that court was concerned, the issue of liability. The partial summary judgment, being interlocutory, of course was not then appealable. See 28 U.S.C. 1291 and 1292. 
 After a pretrial conference, the parties by their counsel entered into a stipulation of facts, App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a, and submitted to the court a ""Joint Motion for Approval of Consent Judgment."" Id., at 32a. 3 The District Court then entered its ""Consent Judgment upon Joint Stipulation of Facts,"" id., at 26a, the final paragraph of which recited: 
 ""This judgment is rendered in recognition of the reservation by the plaintiff of its right to prosecute an appeal in this action in connection with this judgment and in connection with the partial summary judgment rendered on March 14, 1979."" Id., at 27a. 
 The smaller of the two sums was then paid to petitioner. It thereupon executed a satisfaction of judgment, id., at 34a, still reciting its reservation. [Footnote 4] 

 Petitioner in due course appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Both sides devoted their briefs in that court exclusively to the liability issue.

The partial summary judgment, being interlocutory, of course was not then appealable. See 28 U.S.C. 1291 and 1292. 
 After a pretrial conference, the parties by their counsel entered into a stipulation of facts, App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a, and submitted to the court a ""Joint Motion for Approval of Consent Judgment."" Id., at 32a. 3 The District Court then entered its ""Consent Judgment upon Joint Stipulation of Facts,"" id., at 26a, the final paragraph of which recited: 
 ""This judgment is rendered in recognition of the reservation by the plaintiff of its right to prosecute an appeal in this action in connection with this judgment and in connection with the partial summary judgment rendered on March 14, 1979."" Id., at 27a. 
 The smaller of the two sums was then paid to petitioner. It thereupon executed a satisfaction of judgment, id., at 34a, still reciting its reservation. [Footnote 4] 

 Petitioner in due course appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Both sides devoted their briefs in that court exclusively to the liability issue. The Court of Appeals, however, with a short per curiam opinion, held that, on the authority of another per curiam opin- [449 U.S. 924 , 926]

 October 20, 1980
 Rehearing Denied Dec. 15, 1980. 
 See 449 U.S. 1067. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 This petition raises the significant question whether the State may deprive a divorced mother of the custody of her children through operation of a conclusive presumption that her cohabitation with an unmarried adult male constitutes custody not in the best interests of the children, however strong the contrary evidence. Because the decision below 1 conflicts with the import of relevant precedent of this Court, I dissent from the denial of a writ of certiorari. 
Page 449 U.S. 927 , 928
 In December 1976, petitioner Jacqueline was given custody of their three daughters, then aged 12, 10, and 7. Jacqueline was also awarded use of the family home and child support; Walter had visitation rights, and the children regularly spent their weekends with him. In April 1977, Jacqueline told Walter that her friend, Wayne Hammon, was going to move into the family home. Walter objected and one week later filed a custody modification petition, seeking custody of his children on the grounds that he objected to his ex-wife's nonmarital relationship and did not wish his daughters to be raised in what he regarded to be an immoral atmosphere. 
 Following a hearing at which Jacqueline, Walter, and Hammon testified, the Circuit Court modified its original decree and granted custody of the children to Walter, finding the custody change necessary for the ""moral and spiritual well-being and development"" of the children. 78 Ill.2d 337, 342, 36 Ill.Dec. 1, 2, 400 N.E.2d 421, 422 (1979). The Appellate Court reversed, reasoning that the Circuit Court made no finding and identified no evidence that Jacqueline was unfit to retain custody and, further, that there was no evidence that the change in custody was necessary to serve the best interests of the children. 
 A divided Illinois Supreme Court reversed the Appellate Court and reinstated the Circuit Court's modified custody decree. Applying the Illinois rule that a change in custody will be ordered only if necessary to serve the best interests of the child, the State Supreme Court found that Jacqueline's ostensible violation of the Illinois fornication statute 2 evinced a ""disregard for existing standards of conduct [that] instructs her children, by example, that they too, may ignore [449 U.S. 927 , 929]

 Cecil D. ANDRUS, Secretary of the Interiorv. Melton E. BAKERNo. 79-1964 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 20, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice MARSHALL and Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 The issue in this case is whether the Secretary of the Interior has applied an improper standard for determining that a mineral discovery is "" valuable"" under 30 U.S.C. 22.1 Because I believe that issue to be an important one deserving review here, and because the decision and judgment of the Court of Appeals may well thwart a proper attempt on the part of the Secretary to reject excessive mining claims while preserving the public's right to enjoy its lands, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 In 1952, respondent began to mine cinders from a cone located within a volcanic field on public land near Flagstaff, Arizona. In 1965, he applied to the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior for a patent covering five 20-acre placer mining claims for cinders on land on which he claimed to have discovered ""valuable mineral deposits."" Respondent's claims covered an estimated 15 million tons of cinders. At the request of the Forest Service of the Depart- 
Page 449 U.S. 932 , 933
 ment of Agriculture, the Bureau issued an administrative contest complaint seeking cancellation of those claims. [Footnote 2] Over the period from 1953 to 1976, respondent extracted and marketed less than one million tons; of this amount, a substantial portion was sold for purposes not cognizable under the mining laws. The Secretary considered these factors, along with the marginal profitability of the local cinders market, in concluding that respondent's total reserves far exceeded reasonable market demand for the foreseeable future. While validating two of respondent's claims, the Interior Board of Land Appeals nullified two others, reasoning that development of all four claims would be imprudent. 23 I.B.L.A. 319 (1976 ). Respondents sought judicial review in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. On cross-motions for summary judgment, that court affirmed the agency's decision. The Court of Appeals, however, vacated and remanded, holding that the Secretary had exceeded his statutory powers in relying on an ""excess reserves"" analysis to limit the patentability of a mineral claim. 613 F.2d 224 (CA9 1980). 
 Two complementary methods for determining whether a mineral deposit is of value have been developed over time. For many years, the ""prudent person"" test called for validation of mineral claims whenever extraction of the discovered deposits offered a ""reasonable prospect of success"" to "" a person of ordinary prudence."" Castle v. Womble, 19 L.D. 455, 457 (1894 ). This Court approved that test on numerous occasions, most recently in Andrus v. Charlestone Stone Products Co., 436 U.S. 604 (1978). As a refinement on what at times perhaps appeared to be an imprecise standard, the Secretary came to require an applicant to show that his claimed deposit could be extracted and marketed at a profit. In United States v. Coleman, 390 U.S. 599, 603, 1330, 20 L. Ed.2d 170 (1968), this Court reversed a Court of Appeals' conclusion to the effect that the [449 U.S. 932 , 934]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 20, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice POWELL and Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 Respondent in this case seeks injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. 1983 to restrain an alleged practice of the Los Angeles Police Department. Because I believe 
Page 449 U.S. 934 , 935
 that respondent's standing to seek this relief is open to serious question in the light of O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488d 674 (1974), and Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362 (1976), I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 In February 1977, respondent filed a seven-count complaint against the city of Los Angeles and four of its police officers. Respondent alleged that the four officers stopped his car for a minor traffic violation and that, without any provocation or reason to fear for their safety, they applied strangleholds around his neck, rendering him unconscious. He further alleged that the use of strangleholds in such non- life-threatening situations was a policy of the police department. Respondent sought damages, and injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming that the use of strangleholds in non-life-threatening situations violates the First, Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. 
 The only issue before this Court is whether in seeking injunctive and declaratory relief respondent has stated a case or controversy within the jurisdiction of the federal courts. The Court of Appeals, reversing the District Court, held that respondent did have standing. The Court of Appeals distinguished this case from O'Shea v. Littleton, supra, and Rizzo v. Goode, supra, on two grounds: First, there was a greater likelihood in this case that respondent would be subjected at some future date to the alleged illegal conduct; second, respondent did not seek ""structural relief"" requiring the federal courts to supervise the conduct of state officials, but only an injunction against the use of an established police practice.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the District Court of Appeal of Florida for the Third District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 The Court in this case denies certiorari to review what I believe is an important due process question requiring interpretation of our decisions in Keeble v. United States, 412 U.S. 205d 844 (1973), and Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625d 392 (1980). 
Page 449 U.S. 905 , 906
 The facts, taken from the state court-opinion and the undisputed allegations of the petition, may be summarized briefly. On November 7, 1972, a man was killed in Dade County, Fla. Five days later, petitioner voluntarily turned himself over to the Miami police in connection with the killing. After issuing Miranda warnings, the police took two separate statements from petitioner concerning the victim's death. Petitioner was then released. On November 29, he communicated with one of the police detectives and furnished a third statement. 
 About three and one-half years later, on June 23, 1976, petitioner and a codefendant were indicted for the capital felony of first-degree murder based on the 1972 killing. Following presentation of all the evidence, the trial court decided over petitioner's objection that it would not instruct the jury on the lesser included state offenses of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter, on the ground that the Florida statute of limitations had run on these lesser offenses. [Footnote 1] The jury was instructed solely as to first-degree murder. Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. 
 On appeal, the Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction. 362 So.2d 333 (1978). The appellate court concluded that a defendant has no state or federal constitutional right to have a court instruct on lesser offenses where ""any conviction returned as to such offense would be a nullity.""

 Bill B. MOOREFIELDv. UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE et alNo. 79-6583 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 14, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Because the decision in this case is subject to serious question under the reasoning of NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 The Secret Service maintains an open file on petitioner, who has twice been convicted of threatening to kill the President. In January 1976, petitioner filed an administrative request with the Service to inspect that file, or at least such portions of it as could be segregated from exempt portions. [Footnote 1] There were at that time no proceedings pending against petitioner. His request was denied in its entirety. [Footnote 2] This decision was 
Page 449 U.S. 909 , 910
 upheld on administrative appeal and in subsequent judicial proceedings brought under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B). During the course of these proceedings, petitioner learned that the file he sought consisted of 225 pages. Despite a request by petitioner, at no time was this file itemized and indexed in such a way as to correlate particular portions of the file with particular exemption provisions of the Act. 
 The District Court conducted an in camera inspection of the file and then granted respondents' motion for summary judgment, finding that disclosure ""would constitute a threat to ongoing enforcement activities and to certain individuals within [and] without the Secret Service."" The Court of Appeals affirmed, 611 F.2d 1021 (CA5 1980), relying on this Court's interpretation of Exemption 7(A) of the Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)( A), in Robbins Tire. 
 The Act requires that records and materials in the possession of federal agencies be made available on demand, unless the requested material falls within one of nine statutory exemptions. Exemption 7(A) states: ""This section does not apply to matters that are . . . (7) investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would (A) interfere with enforcement proceedings. . . ."" The present language of this Exemption is the result of a 1974 amendment to the Act. The Act, prior to 1974, had exempted from disclosure all ""investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes."" 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7) (1970 ed.). In Robbins Tire we surveyed the meaning and scope of Exemption 7(A) in light of the legislative history that led to its narrowing in 1974. We concluded that the purpose of the 1974 amendment had been ""to eliminate 'blanket exemptions' for Government records simply because they were found in investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes. . . ."" 437 U.S ., at 236.

 October 14, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Because the decision in this case is subject to serious question under the reasoning of NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978), I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 The Secret Service maintains an open file on petitioner, who has twice been convicted of threatening to kill the President. In January 1976, petitioner filed an administrative request with the Service to inspect that file, or at least such portions of it as could be segregated from exempt portions. [Footnote 1] There were at that time no proceedings pending against petitioner. His request was denied in its entirety. [Footnote 2] This decision was 
Page 449 U.S. 909 , 910
 upheld on administrative appeal and in subsequent judicial proceedings brought under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B). During the course of these proceedings, petitioner learned that the file he sought consisted of 225 pages. Despite a request by petitioner, at no time was this file itemized and indexed in such a way as to correlate particular portions of the file with particular exemption provisions of the Act. 
 The District Court conducted an in camera inspection of the file and then granted respondents' motion for summary judgment, finding that disclosure ""would constitute a threat to ongoing enforcement activities and to certain individuals within [and] without the Secret Service."" The Court of Appeals affirmed, 611 F.2d 1021 (CA5 1980), relying on this Court's interpretation of Exemption 7(A) of the Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)( A), in Robbins Tire. 
 The Act requires that records and materials in the possession of federal agencies be made available on demand, unless the requested material falls within one of nine statutory exemptions. Exemption 7(A) states: ""This section does not apply to matters that are . . . (7) investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would (A) interfere with enforcement proceedings. . . ."" The present language of this Exemption is the result of a 1974 amendment to the Act. The Act, prior to 1974, had exempted from disclosure all ""investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes."" 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7) (1970 ed.). In Robbins Tire we surveyed the meaning and scope of Exemption 7(A) in light of the legislative history that led to its narrowing in 1974. We concluded that the purpose of the 1974 amendment had been ""to eliminate 'blanket exemptions' for Government records simply because they were found in investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes. . . ."" 437 U.S ., at 236. [449 U.S. 909 , 911]

Because of the significance of the District Court's constitutional ruling, it appears, even before decision by the Court of Appeals, that there is a reasonable probability that this Court will grant certiorari or note probable jurisdiction, and it is not unreasonable to believe that five Members of the Court may agree with the District Court's decision.  Also, the balance of harms weighs heavily on the side of undocumented alien children, who will suffer irreparable harm from denial of public education if the stay is not vacated.

No. 78-1007
Argued November 27, 1979
Decided July 2, 1980
448 U.S. 448

Syllabus 
The ""minority business enterprise"" (MBE) provision of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 (1977 Act) requires that, absent an administrative waiver, at least 10% of federal funds granted for local public works projects must be used by the state or local grantee to procure services or supplies from businesses owned by minority group members, defined as United States citizens ""who are Negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts.""  Under implementing regulations and guidelines, grantees and their private prime contractors are required, to the extent feasible, in fulfilling the 10% MBE requirement, to seek out all available, qualified, bona fide MBE's, to provide technical assistance as needed, to lower or waive bonding requirements where feasible, to solicit the aid of the Office of Minority Business Enterprise, the Small Business Administration, or other sources for assisting MBE's in obtaining required working capital, and to give guidance through the intricacies of the bidding process.  The administrative program, which recognizes that contracts will be awarded to bona fide MBE's even though they are not the lowest bidders if their bids reflect merely attempts to cover costs inflated by the present effects of prior disadvantage and discrimination, provides for handling grantee applications for administrative waiver of the 10% MBE requirement on a case-by-case basis if infeasibility is demonstrated by a showing that, despite affirmative efforts, such level of participation cannot be achieved without departing from the program's objectives.  The program also provides an administrative mechanism to ensure that only bona fide MBE's are encompassed by the program, and to prevent unjust participation by minority firms whose access to public contracting opportunities is not impaired by the effects of prior discrimination.
Petitioners, several associations of construction contractors and subcontractors and a firm engaged in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning work, filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief in Federal District Court, alleging that they had sustained economic injury due to enforcement of the MBE requirement, and that the MBE provision, on its face, violated, inter alia, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth 
Page 448 U. S. 449
 Amendment and the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The District Court upheld the validity of the MBE program, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  448 U. S. 456-492;  448 U. S. 517-522.
584 F.2d 600, affirmed.
MR. CHIEF .JUSTICE BURGER, joined by MR. JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that the MBE provision of the 1977 Act, on its face, does not violate the Constitution.  Pp.  448 U. S. 456-492.
(a) Viewed against the legislative and administrative background of the 1977 Act, the legislative objectives of the MBE provision and of the administrative program thereunder were to ensure -- without mandating the allocation of federal funds according to inflexible percentages solely based on race or ethnicity -- that, to the extent federal funds were granted under the 1977 Act, grantees who elected to participate would not employ procurement practices that Congress had decided might result in perpetuation of the effects of prior discrimination which had impaired or foreclosed access by minority businesses to public contracting opportunities.  Pp.  448 U. S. 456-472.
(b) In considering the constitutionality of the MBE provision, it first must be determined whether the objectives of the legislation are within Congress' power.  Pp.  448 U. S. 472-480.
(i) The 1977 Act, as primarily an exercise of Congress' Spending Power under Art. I,  8, cl. 1, ""to provide for the . . . general Welfare,"" conditions receipt of federal moneys upon the receipt's compliance with federal statutory and administrative directives.  Since the reach of the Spending Power is at least as broad as Congress' regulatory powers, if Congress, pursuant to its regulatory powers, could have achieved the objectives of the MBE program, then it may do so under the Spending Power.  Pp.  448 U. S. 473-475
(ii) Insofar as the MBE program pertains to the actions of private prime contractors, including those not responsible for any violation of antidiscrimination laws, Congress could have achieved its objectives under the Commerce Clause.  The legislative history shows that there was a rational basis for Congress to conclude that the subcontracting practices of prime contractors could perpetuate the prevailing impaired access by minority businesses to public contracting opportunities, and that this inequity has an effect on interstate commerce.  Pp.  448 U. S. 475-476.
(iii) Insofar as the MBE program pertains to the actions of state and local grantees, Congress could have achieved its objectives by use of its power under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment ""to enforce, by appropriate legislation"" the equal protection guarantee of that Amendment.  Congress had abundant historical basis from which it could conclude 
Page 448 U. S. 450
 that traditional procurement practices, when applied to minority businesses, could perpetuate the effects of prior discrimination, and that the prospective elimination of such barriers to minority-firm access to public contracting opportunities was appropriate to ensure that those businesses were not denied equal opportunity to participate in federal grants to state and local governments, which is one aspect of the equal protection of the laws.  Cf., e.g., Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641; Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112.  Pp.  448 U. S. 476-478.
(iv) Thus, the objectives of the MBE provision are within the scope of Congress' Spending Power.  Cf. Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563.  Pp.  448 U. S. 479-480.
(c) Congress' use here of racial and ethnic criteria as a condition attached to a federal grant is a valid means to accomplish its constitutional objectives, and the MBE provision, on its face, does not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  448 U. S. 480-492.
(i) In the MBE program's remedial context, there is no requirement that Congress act in a wholly ""color-blind"" fashion.  Cf., e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1; McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U. S. 39; North Carolina Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U. S. 43.  Pp.  448 U. S. 482-484.
(ii) The MBE program is not constitutionally defective because it may disappoint the expectations of access to a portion of government contracting opportunities of nonminority firms who may themselves be innocent of any prior discriminatory actions.  When effectuating a limited and properly tailored remedy to cure the effects of prior discrimination, such ""a sharing of the burden"" by innocent parties is not impermissible.  Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U. S. 747,  424 U. S. 777.  Pp.  448 U. S. 484-485.
(iii) Nor is the MBE program invalid as being underinclusive in that it limits its benefit to specified minority groups, rather than extending its remedial objectives to all businesses whose access to government contracting is impaired by the effects of disadvantage or discrimination.  Congress has not sought to give select minority groups a preferred standing in the construction industry, but has embarked on a remedial program to place them on a more equitable footing with respect to public contracting opportunities, and there has been no showing that Congress inadvertently effected an invidious discrimination by excluding from coverage an identifiable minority group that has been the victim of a degree of disadvantage and discrimination equal to or greater than that suffered by the groups encompassed by the MBE program.  Pp.  448 U. S. 485-486. 
Page 448 U. S. 451

(iv) The contention that the MBE program, on its face, is overinclusive in that it bestows a benefit on businesses identified by racial or ethnic criteria which cannot be justified on the basis of competitive criteria or as a remedy for the present effects of identified prior discrimination is also without merit.  The MBE provision, with due account for its administrative program, provides a reasonable assurance that application of racial or ethnic criteria will be narrowly limited to accomplishing Congress' remedial objectives, and that misapplications of the program will be promptly and adequately remedied administratively.  In particular, the administrative program provides waiver and exemption procedures to identify and eliminate from participation MBE's who are not ""bona fide,"" or who attempt to exploit the remedial aspects of the program by charging an unreasonable price not attributable to the present effects of past discrimination.  Moreover, grantees may obtain a waiver if they demonstrate that their best efforts will not achieve or have not achieved the 10% target for minority firm participation within the limitations of the program's remedial objectives.  The MBE provision may be viewed as a pilot project, appropriately limited in extent and duration and subject to reassessment and reevaluation by the Congress prior to any extension or reenactment.  Pp.  448 U. S. 486-489.
(d) In the continuing effort to achieve the goal of equality of economic opportunity, Congress has latitude to try new techniques such as the limited use of racial and ethnic criteria to accomplish remedial objectives, especially in programs where voluntary cooperation is induced by placing conditions on federal expenditures.  When a program narrowly tailored by Congress to achieve its objectives comes under judicial review, it should be upheld if the courts are satisfied that the legislative objectives and projected administration of the program give reasonable assurance that the program will function within constitutional limitations.  Pp.  448 U. S. 490-492.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment, concluded that the proper inquiry for determining the constitutionality of racial classifications that provide benefits to minorities for the purpose of remedying the present effects of past racial discrimination is whether the classifications serve important governmental objectives and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives, University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265,  438 U. S. 359 (opinion of BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), and that, judged under this standard, the 10% minority set-aside provision of the 1977 Act is plainly constitutional, the racial classifications being substantially related to the achievement of the important and 
Page 448 U. S. 452
 congressionally articulated goal of remedying the present effects of past racial discrimination.  Pp.  448 U. S. 517-521.
BURGER, C.J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which WHITE and POWELL, JJ., joined.  POWELL, J., filed a concurring opinion, post, p.  448 U. S. 495.  MARSHALL, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which BRENNAN and BLACKMUN, J.J., joined, post p.  448 U. S. 517.

The program also provides an administrative mechanism to ensure that only bona fide MBE's are encompassed by the program, and to prevent unjust participation by minority firms whose access to public contracting opportunities is not impaired by the effects of prior discrimination.
Petitioners, several associations of construction contractors and subcontractors and a firm engaged in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning work, filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief in Federal District Court, alleging that they had sustained economic injury due to enforcement of the MBE requirement, and that the MBE provision, on its face, violated, inter alia, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth 
Page 448 U. S. 449
 Amendment and the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The District Court upheld the validity of the MBE program, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  448 U. S. 456-492;  448 U. S. 517-522.
584 F.2d 600, affirmed.
MR. CHIEF .JUSTICE BURGER, joined by MR. JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that the MBE provision of the 1977 Act, on its face, does not violate the Constitution.  Pp.  448 U. S. 456-492.
(a) Viewed against the legislative and administrative background of the 1977 Act, the legislative objectives of the MBE provision and of the administrative program thereunder were to ensure -- without mandating the allocation of federal funds according to inflexible percentages solely based on race or ethnicity -- that, to the extent federal funds were granted under the 1977 Act, grantees who elected to participate would not employ procurement practices that Congress had decided might result in perpetuation of the effects of prior discrimination which had impaired or foreclosed access by minority businesses to public contracting opportunities.  Pp.  448 U. S. 456-472.
(b) In considering the constitutionality of the MBE provision, it first must be determined whether the objectives of the legislation are within Congress' power.  Pp.  448 U. S. 472-480.
(i) The 1977 Act, as primarily an exercise of Congress' Spending Power under Art. I,  8, cl. 1, ""to provide for the . . . general Welfare,"" conditions receipt of federal moneys upon the receipt's compliance with federal statutory and administrative directives.  Since the reach of the Spending Power is at least as broad as Congress' regulatory powers, if Congress, pursuant to its regulatory powers, could have achieved the objectives of the MBE program, then it may do so under the Spending Power.  Pp.  448 U. S. 473-475
(ii) Insofar as the MBE program pertains to the actions of private prime contractors, including those not responsible for any violation of antidiscrimination laws, Congress could have achieved its objectives under the Commerce Clause.  The legislative history shows that there was a rational basis for Congress to conclude that the subcontracting practices of prime contractors could perpetuate the prevailing impaired access by minority businesses to public contracting opportunities, and that this inequity has an effect on interstate commerce.  Pp.  448 U. S. 475-476.
(iii) Insofar as the MBE program pertains to the actions of state and local grantees, Congress could have achieved its objectives by use of its power under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment ""to enforce, by appropriate legislation"" the equal protection guarantee of that Amendment.  Congress had abundant historical basis from which it could conclude 
Page 448 U. S. 450
 that traditional procurement practices, when applied to minority businesses, could perpetuate the effects of prior discrimination, and that the prospective elimination of such barriers to minority-firm access to public contracting opportunities was appropriate to ensure that those businesses were not denied equal opportunity to participate in federal grants to state and local governments, which is one aspect of the equal protection of the laws.  Cf., e.g., Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641; Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112.  Pp.  448 U. S. 476-478.
(iv) Thus, the objectives of the MBE provision are within the scope of Congress' Spending Power.  Cf. Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563.  Pp.  448 U. S. 479-480.
(c) Congress' use here of racial and ethnic criteria as a condition attached to a federal grant is a valid means to accomplish its constitutional objectives, and the MBE provision, on its face, does not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  448 U. S. 480-492.
(i) In the MBE program's remedial context, there is no requirement that Congress act in a wholly ""color-blind"" fashion.  Cf., e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg Board of Education, 402 U. S. 1; McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U. S. 39; North Carolina Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U. S. 43.  Pp.  448 U. S. 482-484.
(ii) The MBE program is not constitutionally defective because it may disappoint the expectations of access to a portion of government contracting opportunities of nonminority firms who may themselves be innocent of any prior discriminatory actions.  When effectuating a limited and properly tailored remedy to cure the effects of prior discrimination, such ""a sharing of the burden"" by innocent parties is not impermissible.  Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U. S. 747,  424 U. S. 777.  Pp.  448 U. S. 484-485.
(iii) Nor is the MBE program invalid as being underinclusive in that it limits its benefit to specified minority groups, rather than extending its remedial objectives to all businesses whose access to government contracting is impaired by the effects of disadvantage or discrimination.  Congress has not sought to give select minority groups a preferred standing in the construction industry, but has embarked on a remedial program to place them on a more equitable footing with respect to public contracting opportunities, and there has been no showing that Congress inadvertently effected an invidious discrimination by excluding from coverage an identifiable minority group that has been the victim of a degree of disadvantage and discrimination equal to or greater than that suffered by the groups encompassed by the MBE program.  Pp.  448 U. S. 485-486. 
Page 448 U. S. 451

(iv) The contention that the MBE program, on its face, is overinclusive in that it bestows a benefit on businesses identified by racial or ethnic criteria which cannot be justified on the basis of competitive criteria or as a remedy for the present effects of identified prior discrimination is also without merit.  The MBE provision, with due account for its administrative program, provides a reasonable assurance that application of racial or ethnic criteria will be narrowly limited to accomplishing Congress' remedial objectives, and that misapplications of the program will be promptly and adequately remedied administratively.  In particular, the administrative program provides waiver and exemption procedures to identify and eliminate from participation MBE's who are not ""bona fide,"" or who attempt to exploit the remedial aspects of the program by charging an unreasonable price not attributable to the present effects of past discrimination.  Moreover, grantees may obtain a waiver if they demonstrate that their best efforts will not achieve or have not achieved the 10% target for minority firm participation within the limitations of the program's remedial objectives.  The MBE provision may be viewed as a pilot project, appropriately limited in extent and duration and subject to reassessment and reevaluation by the Congress prior to any extension or reenactment.  Pp.  448 U. S. 486-489.
(d) In the continuing effort to achieve the goal of equality of economic opportunity, Congress has latitude to try new techniques such as the limited use of racial and ethnic criteria to accomplish remedial objectives, especially in programs where voluntary cooperation is induced by placing conditions on federal expenditures.  When a program narrowly tailored by Congress to achieve its objectives comes under judicial review, it should be upheld if the courts are satisfied that the legislative objectives and projected administration of the program give reasonable assurance that the program will function within constitutional limitations.  Pp.  448 U. S. 490-492.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment, concluded that the proper inquiry for determining the constitutionality of racial classifications that provide benefits to minorities for the purpose of remedying the present effects of past racial discrimination is whether the classifications serve important governmental objectives and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives, University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265,  438 U. S. 359 (opinion of BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), and that, judged under this standard, the 10% minority set-aside provision of the 1977 Act is plainly constitutional, the racial classifications being substantially related to the achievement of the important and 
Page 448 U. S. 452
 congressionally articulated goal of remedying the present effects of past racial discrimination.  Pp.  448 U. S. 517-521.

Syllabus 
At the commencement of a fourth trial on a murder charge (the defendant's conviction after the first trial having been reversed on appeal, and two subsequent retrials having ended in mistrials), the Virginia trial court granted defense counsel's motion that the trial be closed to the public without any objections having been made by the prosecutor or by appellants, a newspaper and two of its reporters who were present in the courtroom, defense counsel having stated that he did not ""want any information being shuffled back and forth when we have a recess as to . . . who testified to what.""  Later that same day, however, the trial judge granted appellants' request for a hearing on a motion to vacate the closure order, and appellants' counsel contended that constitutional considerations mandated that, before ordering closure, the court should first decide that the defendant's rights could be protected in no other way.  But the trial judge denied the motion, saying that, if he felt that the defendant's rights were infringed in any way and others' rights were not overridden, he was inclined to order closure, and ordered the trial to continue ""with the press and public excluded.""  The next day, the court granted defendant's motion to strike the prosecution's evidence, excused the jury, and found the defendant not guilty.  Thereafter, the court granted appellants' motion to intervene nunc pro tunc in the case, and the Virginia Supreme Court dismissed their mandamus and prohibition petitions and, finding no reversible error, denied their petition for appeal from the closure order.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  448 U. S. 563-581;  448 U. S. 584-598;  448 U. S. 598-601;  448 U. S. 601-604.
Reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, joined by MR JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that the right of the public and press to attend criminal trials is guaranteed under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Absent an overriding interest articulated in findings, the trial of a criminal case must be open to the public.  Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U. S. 368, distinguished.  Pp.  448 U. S. 563-581. 
Page 448 U. S. 556

(a) The historical evidence of the evolution of the criminal trial in Anglo-American justice demonstrates conclusively that, at the time this Nation's organic laws were adopted, criminal trials both here and in England had long been presumptively open, thus giving assurance that the proceedings were conducted fairly to all concerned and discouraging perjury, the misconduct of participants, or decisions based on secret bias or partiality.  In addition, the significant community therapeutic value of public trials was recognized:  when a shocking crime occurs, a community reaction of outrage and public protest often follows, and thereafter the open processes of justice serve an important prophylactic purpose, providing an outlet for community concern, hostility, and emotion.  To work effectively, it is important that society's criminal process ""satisfy the appearance of justice,"" Offutt v. United States, 348 U. S. 11,  348 U. S. 14, which can best be provided by allowing people to observe such process.  From this unbroken, uncontradicted history, supported by reasons as valid today as in centuries past, it must be concluded that a presumption of openness inheres in the very nature of a criminal trial under this Nation's system of justice.  Cf., e.g., Levine v. United States, 362 U. S. 610.  Pp.  448 U. S. 563-575.
(b) The freedoms of speech, press, and assembly, expressly guaranteed by the First Amendment, share a common core purpose of assuring freedom of communication on matters relating to the functioning of government.  In guaranteeing freedoms such as those of speech and press, the First Amendment can be read as protecting the right of everyone to attend trials so as to give meaning to those explicit guarantees; the First Amendment right to receive information and ideas means, in the context of trials, that the guarantees of speech and press, standing alone, prohibit government from summarily closing courtroom doors which had long been open to the public at the time the First Amendment was adopted.  Moreover, the right of assembly is also relevant, having been regarded not only as an independent right, but also as a catalyst to augment the free exercise of the other First Amendment rights with which it was deliberately linked by the draftsmen.  A trial courtroom is a public place where the people generally -- and representatives of the media -- have a right to be present, and where their presence historically has been thought to enhance the integrity and quality of what takes place.  Pp.  448 U. S. 575-578.
(c) Even though the Constitution contains no provision which, by its terms, guarantees to the public the right to attend criminal trials, various fundamental rights, not expressly guaranteed, have been recognized as indispensable to the enjoyment of enumerated rights.  The right to attend criminal trials is implicit in the guarantees of the First Amendment; 
Page 448 U. S. 557
 without the freedom to attend such trials, which people have exercised for centuries, important aspects of freedom of speech and of the press could be eviscerated.  Pp.  448 U. S. 579-580.
(d) With respect to the closure order in this case, despite the fact that this was the accused's fourth trial, the trial judge made no findings to support closure; no inquiry was made as to whether alternative solutions would have met the need to ensure fairness; there was no recognition of any right under the Constitution for the public or press to attend the trial; and there was no suggestion that any problems with witnesses could not have been dealt with by exclusion from the courtroom or sequestration during the trial, or that sequestration of the jurors would not have guarded against their being subjected to any improper information.  Pp.  448 U. S. 580-581.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded that the First Amendment -- of itself and as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment -- secures the public a right of access to trial proceedings, and that, without more, agreement of the trial judge and the parties cannot constitutionally close a trial to the public.  Historically and functionally, open trials have been closely associated with the development of the fundamental procedure of trial by jury, and trial access assumes structural importance in this Nation's government of laws by assuring the public that procedural rights are respected and that justice is afforded equally, by serving as an effective restraint on possible abuse of judicial power, and by aiding the accuracy of the trial factfinding process.  It was further concluded that it was not necessary to consider in this case what countervailing interests might be sufficiently compelling to reverse the presumption of openness of trials, since the Virginia statute involved -- authorizing trial closures at the unfettered discretion of the judge and parties -- violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  448 U. S. 584-598.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART concluded that the First and Fourteenth Amendments clearly give the press and the public a right of access to trials, civil as well as criminal; that such right is not absolute, since various considerations may sometimes justify limitations upon the unrestricted presence of spectators in the courtroom; but that, in the present case, the trial judge apparently gave no recognition to the right of representatives of the press and members of the public to be present at the trial.  Pp.  448 U. S. 598-601.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, while being of the view that Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, supra, was in error, both in its interpretation of the Sixth Amendment generally and in its application to the suppression hearing 
Page 448 U. S. 558
 involved there, and that the right to a public trial is to be found in the Sixth Amendment, concluded, as a secondary position, that the First Amendment must provide some measure of protection for public access to the trial, and that here, by closing the trial, the trial judge abridged these First Amendment interests of the public.  Pp.  448 U. S. 601-604.

Syllabus 
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Act) delegates broad authority to the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) to promulgate standards to ensure safe and healthful working conditions for the Nation's workers (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) being the agency responsible for carrying out this authority).  Section 3(8) of the Act defines an ""occupational safety and health standard"" as a standard that is ""reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment.""  Where toxic materials or harmful physical agents are concerned, a standard must also comply with  6(b)(5), which directs the Secretary to
""set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity.""
When the toxic material or harmful physical agent to be regulated is a carcinogen, the Secretary has taken the position that no safe exposure level can be determined, and that  6(b)(5) requires him to set an exposure limit at the lowest technologically feasible level that will not impair the viability of the industries regulated.  In this case, after having determined that there is a causal connection between benzene (a toxic substance used in manufacturing such products as motor fuels, solvents, detergents, and pesticides) and leukemia (a cancer of the white blood cells), the Secretary promulgated a standard reducing the permissible exposure limit on airborne concentrations of benzene from the consensus standard of 10 parts benzene per million parts of air (10 ppm) to 1 ppm, and prohibiting dermal contact with solutions containing benzene.  On preenforcement review, the Court of Appeals held the standard invalid because it was based on findings unsupported by the administrative record.  The court concluded that OSHA had exceeded its standard-setting authority because it had not been shown that the 1 ppm exposure limit was ""reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe and healthful employment"" as required by  3(8), and that 
Page 448 U. S. 608
  6(b)(5) did not give OSHA the unbridled discretion to adopt standards designed to create absolutely risk-free workplaces, regardless of cost.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  448 U. S. 630-662;  448 U. S. 667-671;  448 U. S. 672-688.
581 F.2d 493, affirmed.
MR. .JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, MR. .JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that the standard in question is invalid.  Pp.  448 U. S. 630-652,  448 U. S. 658-659.
(a) The Court of Appeals was correct in refusing to enforce the 1 ppm exposure limit on the ground that it was not supported by appropriate findings.  OSHA's rationale for lowering the permissible exposure limit from 10 ppm to 1 ppm was based not on any finding that leukemia has ever been caused by exposure to 10 ppm of benzene, and that it will not be caused by exposure to 1 ppm, but, rather, on a series of assumptions indicating that some leukemia might result from exposure to 10 ppm, and that the number of cases might be reduced by lowering the exposure level to 1 ppm.  Pp.  448 U. S. 630-638.
(b) By empowering the Secretary to promulgate standards that are ""reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment"" as required by  3(8), the Act implies that, before promulgating any standard, the Secretary must make a finding that the workplaces in question are not safe.  But ""safe"" is not the equivalent of ""risk-free.""  A workplace can hardly be considered ""unsafe"" unless it threatens the workers with a significant risk of harm.  Therefore, before the Secretary can promulgate any permanent health or safety standard, he must make a threshold finding that the place of employment is unsafe in the sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices.  This requirement applies to permanent standards promulgated pursuant to  6(b)(5), as well as to other types of permanent standards, there being no reason why  3(8)'s definition of a standard should not be deemed incorporated by reference into  6(b)(5).  Moreover, requiring the Secretary to make a threshold finding of significant risk is consistent with the scope of his regulatory power under  6(b)(5) to promulgate standards for ""toxic materials"" and ""harmful physical agents.""  This interpretation is supported by other provisions of the Act, such as  6(g), which requires the Secretary, in determining the priority for establishing standards, to give due regard to the urgency of the need for mandatory safety and health standards for particular industries or workplaces, and  6(b)(8), which requires the Secretary, when he substantially alters an 
Page 448 U. S. 609
 existing consensus standard, to explain how the new rule will ""better effectuate"" the Act's purposes.  Pp.  448 U. S. 639-646.
(c) The Act's legislative history also supports the conclusion that Congress was concerned not with absolute safety, but with the elimination of significant harm.  Pp. 646-652.
(d) Where the Secretary relied on a special policy for carcinogens that imposed the burden on industry of proving the existence of a safe level of exposure, thereby avoiding his threshold responsibility of establishing the need for more stringent standards, he exceeded his power.  Pp.  448 U. S. 658-659.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER and MR. JUSTICE STEWART, also concluded that:
1. The burden was on OSHA to show, on the basis of substantial evidence, that it is at least more likely than not that long-term exposure to 10 ppm of benzene presents a significant risk of material health impairment.  Here, OSHA did not even attempt to carry such burden of proof.  Imposing such a burden on OSHA will not strip it of its ability to regulate carcinogens, nor will it require it to wait for deaths to occur before taking any action.  The requirement that a ""significant"" risk be identified is not a mathematical straitjacket; OSHA is not required to support its finding that a significant risk exists with anything approaching scientific certainty; and the record in this case and OSHA's own rulings on other carcinogens indicate that there are a number of ways in which OSHA can make a rational judgment about the relative significance of the risks associated with exposure to a particular carcinogen.  Pp.  448 U. S. 652-658.
2. OSHA did not make the required finding with respect to the dermal contact ban that the ban was ""reasonably necessary and appropriate"" to remove a significant risk of harm from such contact, but, rather, acted on the basis of the absolute, no-risk policy that it applies to carcinogens under the assumptions not only that benzene in small doses is a carcinogen but also that it can be absorbed through the skin in sufficient amounts to present a carcinogenic risk.  These assumptions are not a proper substitute for the findings of significant risk of harm required by the Act.  Pp.  448 U. S. 659-662.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, agreeing that neither the airborne concentration standard nor the dermal contact standard satisfied the Act's requirements, would not hold that OSHA did not even attempt to carry its burden of proof on the threshold question whether exposure to benzene at 10 ppm presents a significant risk to human health.  He concluded that, even assuming OSHA had met such burden, the Act also requires OSHA to determine that the economic effects of its standard bear a 
Page 448 U. S. 610
 reasonable relationship to the expected benefits.  A standard is neither ""reasonably necessary"" nor ""feasible,"" as required by the Act, if it calls for expenditures wholly disproportionate to the expected health and safety benefits.  Here, although OSHA did find that the ""substantial costs"" of the benzene regulations were justified, the record contains neither adequate documentation of this conclusion nor any evidence that OSHA weighed the relevant considerations.  The agency simply announced its finding of cost justification without explaining the method by which it determined that the benefits justified the costs and their economic effects.  Pp.  448 U. S. 667-671.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST would invalidate, as constituting an invalid delegation of legislative authority to the Secretary, the relevant portion of  6(b)(5) of the Act as it applies to any toxic substance or harmful physical agent for which a safe level is, according to the Secretary, unknown or otherwise ""infeasible.""  In the case of such substances, the language of  6(b)(5) gives the Secretary absolutely no indication where on the continuum of relative safety he should set the standard.  Nor is there anything in the legislative history, the statutory context, or any other source traditionally examined by this Court, that provides specificity to the feasibility criterion in  6(b)(5).  Pp.  448 U. S. 672-688.

American Petroleum Institute
No. 78-911
Argued October 10, 1979
Decided July 2, 1980*
448 U.S. 607

Syllabus 
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Act) delegates broad authority to the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) to promulgate standards to ensure safe and healthful working conditions for the Nation's workers (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) being the agency responsible for carrying out this authority).  Section 3(8) of the Act defines an ""occupational safety and health standard"" as a standard that is ""reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment.""  Where toxic materials or harmful physical agents are concerned, a standard must also comply with  6(b)(5), which directs the Secretary to
""set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity.""
When the toxic material or harmful physical agent to be regulated is a carcinogen, the Secretary has taken the position that no safe exposure level can be determined, and that  6(b)(5) requires him to set an exposure limit at the lowest technologically feasible level that will not impair the viability of the industries regulated.  In this case, after having determined that there is a causal connection between benzene (a toxic substance used in manufacturing such products as motor fuels, solvents, detergents, and pesticides) and leukemia (a cancer of the white blood cells), the Secretary promulgated a standard reducing the permissible exposure limit on airborne concentrations of benzene from the consensus standard of 10 parts benzene per million parts of air (10 ppm) to 1 ppm, and prohibiting dermal contact with solutions containing benzene.  On preenforcement review, the Court of Appeals held the standard invalid because it was based on findings unsupported by the administrative record.  The court concluded that OSHA had exceeded its standard-setting authority because it had not been shown that the 1 ppm exposure limit was ""reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe and healthful employment"" as required by  3(8), and that 
Page 448 U. S. 608
  6(b)(5) did not give OSHA the unbridled discretion to adopt standards designed to create absolutely risk-free workplaces, regardless of cost.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  448 U. S. 630-662;  448 U. S. 667-671;  448 U. S. 672-688.
581 F.2d 493, affirmed.
MR. .JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, MR. .JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that the standard in question is invalid.  Pp.  448 U. S. 630-652,  448 U. S. 658-659.
(a) The Court of Appeals was correct in refusing to enforce the 1 ppm exposure limit on the ground that it was not supported by appropriate findings.  OSHA's rationale for lowering the permissible exposure limit from 10 ppm to 1 ppm was based not on any finding that leukemia has ever been caused by exposure to 10 ppm of benzene, and that it will not be caused by exposure to 1 ppm, but, rather, on a series of assumptions indicating that some leukemia might result from exposure to 10 ppm, and that the number of cases might be reduced by lowering the exposure level to 1 ppm.  Pp.  448 U. S. 630-638.
(b) By empowering the Secretary to promulgate standards that are ""reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment"" as required by  3(8), the Act implies that, before promulgating any standard, the Secretary must make a finding that the workplaces in question are not safe.  But ""safe"" is not the equivalent of ""risk-free.""  A workplace can hardly be considered ""unsafe"" unless it threatens the workers with a significant risk of harm.  Therefore, before the Secretary can promulgate any permanent health or safety standard, he must make a threshold finding that the place of employment is unsafe in the sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices.  This requirement applies to permanent standards promulgated pursuant to  6(b)(5), as well as to other types of permanent standards, there being no reason why  3(8)'s definition of a standard should not be deemed incorporated by reference into  6(b)(5).  Moreover, requiring the Secretary to make a threshold finding of significant risk is consistent with the scope of his regulatory power under  6(b)(5) to promulgate standards for ""toxic materials"" and ""harmful physical agents.""  This interpretation is supported by other provisions of the Act, such as  6(g), which requires the Secretary, in determining the priority for establishing standards, to give due regard to the urgency of the need for mandatory safety and health standards for particular industries or workplaces, and  6(b)(8), which requires the Secretary, when he substantially alters an

Syllabus 
Title XIX of the Social Security Act established the Medicaid program in 1965 to provide federal financial assistance to States that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.  Since 1976, versions of the so-called Hyde Amendment have severely limited the use of any federal funds to reimburse the cost of abortions under the Medicaid program.  Actions were brought in Federal District Court by appellees (including indigent pregnant women, who sued on behalf of all women similarly situated, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp., which operates hospitals providing abortion services, officers of the Women's Division of the Board of Global Ministries of the United Methodist Church (Women's Division), and the Women's Division itself), seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Hyde Amendment on grounds that it violates, inter alia, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, and that, despite the Hyde Amendment, a participating State remains obligated under Title XIX to fund all medically necessary abortions.  Ultimately, the District Court, granting injunctive relief, held that the Hyde Amendment had substantively amended Title XIX to relieve a State of any obligation to fund those medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable, but that the Amendment violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.
Held:
1. Title XIX does not require a participating State to pay for those medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable under the Hyde Amendment.  Pp.  448 U. S. 306-311.
(a) The cornerstone of Medicaid is financial contribution by both the Federal Government and the participating State.  Nothing in Title XIX as originally enacted or in its legislative history suggests that Congress intended to require a participating State to assume the full costs of providing any health services in its Medicaid plan.  To the contrary, Congress' purpose in enacting Title XIX was to provide federal financial 
Page 448 U. S. 298
 assistance for all legitimate state expenditures under an approved Medicaid plan.  Pp.  448 U. S. 308-309.
(b) Nor does the Hyde Amendment's legislative history contain any indication that Congress intended to shift the entire cost of some medically necessary abortions to the participating States, but rather suggests that Congress has always assumed that a participating State would not be required to fund such abortions once federal funding was withdrawn pursuant to the Hyde Amendment.  Pp.  448 U. S. 310-311.
2. The funding restrictions of the Hyde Amendment do not impinge on the ""liberty"" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment held in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113,  410 U. S. 168, to include the freedom of a woman to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy.  Pp.  448 U. S. 312-318.
(a) The Hyde Amendment places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy, but rather, by means of unequal subsidization of abortion and other medical services, encourages alternative activity deemed in the public interest.  Cf. Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464.  P.  448 U. S. 315.
(b) Regardless of whether the freedom of a woman to choose to terminate her pregnancy for health reasons lies at the core or the periphery of the due process liberty recognized in Wade, supra, it does not follow that a woman's freedom of choice carries with it a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself of the full range of protected choices.  Although government may not place obstacles in the path of a woman's exercise of her freedom of choice, it need not remove those not of its own creation, and indigency falls within the latter category.  Although Congress has opted to subsidize medically necessary services generally, but not certain medically necessary abortions, the fact remains that the Hyde Amendment leaves an indigent woman with at least the same range of choice in deciding whether to obtain a medically necessary abortion as she would have had if Congress had chosen to subsidize no health care costs at all.  Pp.  448 U. S. 316-317.
(c) To translate the limitation on governmental power implicit in the Due Process Clause into an affirmative funding obligation would require Congress to subsidize the medically necessary abortion of an indigent woman even if Congress had not enacted a Medicaid program to subsidize other medically necessary services.  Nothing in the Due Process Clause supports such an extraordinary result.  Pp.  448 U. S. 317-318.
3. Nor does the Hyde Amendment violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  The fact that the funding restrictions in the Hyde Amendment may coincide with the religious tenets of the Roman 
Page 448 U. S. 299
 Catholic Church does not, without more, contravene that Clause.  Pp.  448 U. S. 319-320
4. Appellees lack standing to raise a challenge to the Hyde Amendment under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.  The named appellees consisting of indigent pregnant women suing on behalf of other women similarly situated lack such standing because none alleged, much less proved, that she sought an abortion under compulsion of religious belief.  The named appellees consisting of officers of the Women's Division, although they provided a detailed description of their religious beliefs, failed to allege either that they are or expect to be pregnant or that they are eligible to receive Medicaid, and they therefore lacked the personal stake in the controversy needed to confer standing to raise such a challenge to the Hyde Amendment.  And the Women's Division does not satisfy the standing requirements for an organization to assert the rights of its membership, since the asserted claim is one that required participation of the individual members for a proper understanding and resolution of their free exercise claims.  Pp.  448 U. S. 320-321.
5. The Hyde Amendment does not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  448 U. S. 321-326.
(a) While the presumption of constitutional validity of a statutory classification that does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution disappears if the classification is predicated on criteria that are ""suspect,"" the Hyde Amendment is not predicated on a constitutionally suspect classification.  Maher v. Roe, supra.  Although the impact of the Amendment falls on the indigent, that fact does not itself render the funding restrictions constitutionally invalid, for poverty, standing alone, is not a suspect classification.  Pp.  448 U. S. 322-323.
(b) Where, as here, Congress has neither invaded a substantive constitutional right or freedom nor enacted legislation that purposefully operates to the detriment of a suspect class, the only requirement of equal protection is that congressional action be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.  The Hyde Amendment satisfies that standard, since, by encouraging childbirth except in the most urgent circumstances, it is rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of protecting potential life.  Pp.  448 U. S. 324-326.

Syllabus 
Appellees brought a class action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 to enjoin, on both federal statutory and constitutional grounds, enforcement of an Illinois statute prohibiting state medical assistance payments for all abortions except those necessary to save the life of the woman seeking the abortion.  The District Court, granting injunctive relief, held that Title XIX of the Social Security Act, which established the Medicaid program, and the regulations promulgated thereunder require a participating State under such program to provide funding for all medically necessary abortions, and that the so-called Hyde Amendment prohibiting the use of federal funds to reimburse the costs of certain medically necessary abortions does not relieve a State of its independent obligation under Title XIX to provide Medicaid funding for all medically necessary abortions.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Hyde Amendment altered Title XIX in such a way as to allow States to limit funding to the categories of abortions specified in that Amendment, but that a participating State may not, consistent with Title XIX, withhold funding of those medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is available under the Hyde Amendment, and the case was remanded to the District Court for modification of its injunction and with directions to consider the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment.  The District Court then held that both the Illinois statute and the Hyde Amendment violate the equal protection guarantee of the Constitution insofar as they deny funding for ""medically necessary abortions prior to the point of fetal viability.""
Held:
1. The District Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment, for the court acted in the absence of a case or controversy sufficient to permit an exercise of judicial power under Art. III of the Constitution.  None of the parties ever challenged the validity of the Hyde Amendment, and appellees could have been awarded all the relief sought entirely on the basis of the District Court's 
Page 448 U. S. 359
 ruling as to the Illinois statute.  The constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment was interjected as an issue only by the Court of Appeals' erroneous mandate, which could not create a case or controversy where none otherwise existed.  P.  448 U. S. 367.
2. Notwithstanding that the District Court had no jurisdiction to declare the Hyde Amendment unconstitutional, this Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1252 over the ""whole case,"" and thus may review the other issues preserved by these appeals.

No. 79-639
Argued March 24, 1980
Decided June 30, 1980
448 U.S. 371

Syllabus 
Under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, the United States pledged that the Great Sioux Reservation, including the Black Hills, would be ""set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation"" of the Sioux Nation (Sioux), and that no treaty for the cession of any part of the reservation would be valid as against the Sioux unless executed and signed by at least three-fourths of the adult male Sioux population.  The treaty also reserved the Sioux' right to hunt in certain unceded territories.  Subsequently, in 1876, an ""agreement"" presented to the Sioux by a special Commission but signed by only 10% of the adult male Sioux population, provided that the Sioux would relinquish their rights to the Black Hills and to hunt in the unceded territories, in exchange for subsistence rations for as long as they would be needed.  In 1877, Congress passed an Act (1877 Act) implementing this ""agreement"" and thus, in effect, abrogated the Fort Laramie Treaty.  Throughout the ensuing years, the Sioux regarded the 1877 Act as a breach of that treaty, but Congress did not enact any mechanism by which they could litigate their claims against the United States until 1920, when a special jurisdictional Act was passed.  Pursuant to this Act, the Sioux brought suit in the Court of Claims, alleging that the Government had taken the Black Hills without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  In 1942, this claim was dismissed by the Court of Claims, which held that it was not authorized by the 1920 Act to question whether the compensation afforded the Sioux in the 1877 Act was an adequate price for the Black Hills, and that the Sioux' claim was a moral one not protected by the Just Compensation Clause.  Thereafter, upon enactment of the Indian Claims Commission Act in 1946, the Sioux resubmitted their claim to the Indian Claims Commission, which held that the 1877 Act effected a taking for which the Sioux were entitled to just compensation, and that the 1942 Court of Claims decision did not bar the taking claim under res judicata.  On appeal, the Court of Claims, affirming the Commission's holding that a want of fair and honorable dealings on the Government's part was evidenced, ultimately held that the Sioux were entitled to an award of at least $17.5 million, without interest, as damages under the Indian Claims Commission Act, 
Page 448 U. S. 372
 for the lands surrendered and for gold taken by trespassing prospectors prior to passage of the 1877 Act.  But the court further held that the merits of the Sioux' taking claim had been reached in its 1942 decision, and that therefore such claim was barred by res judicata.  The court noted that only if the acquisition of the Black Hills amounted to an unconstitutional taking would the Sioux be entitled to interest.  Thereafter, in 1978, Congress passed an Act (1978 Act) providing for de novo review by the Court of Claims of the merits of the Indian Claims Commission's holding that the 1877 Act effected a taking of the Black Hills, without regard to res judicata, and authorizing the Court of Claims to take new evidence in the case.  Pursuant to this Act, the Court of Claims affirmed the Commission's holding.  In so affirming, the court, in order to decide whether the 1877 Act had effected a taking or whether it had been a noncompensable act of congressional guardianship over tribal property, applied the test of whether Congress had made a good faith effort to give the Sioux the full value of their land.  Under this test, the court characterized the 1877 Act as a taking in exercise of Congress' power of eminent domain over Indian property.  Accordingly, the court held that the Sioux were entitled to an award of interest on the principal sum of $17.1 million (the fair market value of the Black Hills as of 1877), dating from 1877.
Held:
1. Congress' enactment of the 1978 Act, as constituting a mere waiver of the res judicata effect of a prior judicial decision rejecting the validity of a legal claim against the United States, did not violate the doctrine of the separation of powers either on the ground that Congress impermissibly disturbed the finality of a judicial decree by rendering the Court of Claims' earlier judgments in the case mere advisory opinions or on the ground that Congress overstepped its bounds by granting the Court of Claims jurisdiction to decide the merits of the Black Hills claim, while prescribing a rule for decision that left that court no adjudicatory function to perform.  Cherokee Nation v. United States, 270 U. S. 476.  Congress, under its broad constitutional power to define and ""to pay the Debts . . . of the United States,"" may recognize its obligation to pay a moral debt not only by direct appropriation, but also by waiving an otherwise valid defense to a legal claim against the United States.  When the Sioux returned to the Court of Claims following passage of the 1978 Act, they were in pursuit of judicial enforcement of a new legal right.  Congress in no way attempted to prescribe the outcome of the Court of Claims' new review of the merits.  United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, distinguished.  Pp.  448 U. S. 390-407. 
Page 448 U. S. 373

2. The Court of Claims' legal analysis and factual findings fully support its conclusion that the 1877 Act did not effect a ""mere change in the form of investment of Indian tribal property,"" but, rather, effected a taking of tribal property which had been set aside by the Fort Laramie Treaty for the Sioux' exclusive occupation, which taking implied an obligation on the Government's part to make just compensation to the Sioux.  That obligation, including an award of interest, must now be paid.  The principles that it
""must [be] presume[d] that Congress acted in perfect good faith in the dealings with the Indians of which complaint is made, and that [it] exercised its best judgment in the premises,""
Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 553,  187 U. S. 568, are inapplicable in this case.  The question whether a particular congressional measure was appropriate for protecting and advancing a tribe's interests, and therefore not subject to the Just Compensation Clause, is factual in nature, and the answer must be based on a consideration of all the evidence presented.  While a reviewing court is not to second-guess a legislative judgment that a particular measure would serve the tribe's best interests, the court is required, in considering whether the measure was taken in pursuance of Congress' power to manage and control tribal lands for the Indians' welfare, to engage in a thorough and impartial examination of the historical record.  A presumption of congressional good faith cannot serve to advance such an inquiry.  Pp.  448 U. S. 407-423.

No. 79-448
Deeided June 30, 1980
448 U.S. 438

Syllabus 
Upon his early morning arrival at the Atlanta Airport on a eommercial flight, petitioner was seen by a federal narcotics agent to look occasionally backward at a second man.  Petitioner and the other man each carried a shoulder bag, and apparently had no other luggage.  When the two men left the terminal together, the agent asked them for identification, and, after they had consented to a search of their persons and shoulder bags, petitioner tried to run away, and before being apprehended, abandoned his bag, which was subsequently found to contain cocaine.  Prior to his trial on a charge of possessing cocaine, petitioner's motion to suppress the cocaine was granted by the Gergia trial court, but the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the stop of petitioner was permissible, since he appeared to the agent to fit the so-called ""drug courier profile.""
Held:  The agent could not, as a matter of law, have reasonably suspected petitioner of criminal activity on the basis of the observed circumstances.  Only the fact that petitioner preceded another person and occasionally looked backward at him as they proceeded through the concourse relates to their particular conduct, whereas the other circumstances describe a very large category of presumably innocent travelers.  The fact that the agent believed that petitioner and his companion were attempting to conceal the fact that they were traveling together is too slender a reed to support the seizure.

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of burglary and grand larceny in an Arkansas state court and sentenced by the jury to the maximum sentence permissible under the state recidivist statute.  On appeal, the Arkansas Supreme Court reversed, holding that evidence of certain prior felony convictions was inadmissible for the purpose of enhancing respondent's sentence, and revised the sentence to the permissible minimum.  Respondent then brought a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, alleging that his sentencing after trial had been unconstitutional, and was not remedied by the Arkansas Supreme Court's revision of it.  The District Court dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent had been denied due process of law by the failure to permit him to be resentenced by a jury, and that resentencing was required because the recidivist statute had been amended since respondent's trial and, if the amendment applied to him, would now provide a lower minimum sentence.
Held:  Where the claim that respondent is entitled to be resentenced by reason of the amended recidivist statute apparently has not been presented to the state courts, a federal court, in the absence of any reason to believe that state judicial remedies would now be unavailable, is required to stay its hand to give the State the initial opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of federal rights.  The requirement of 28 U.S.C.  2254(b) and (c) that state remedies first be pursued is particularly appropriate where, as here, the federal constitutional claim arises from the alleged deprivation by state courts of rights created under state law.

An application to stay the District Court's preliminary injunction against implementation of the labor protection arrangement provisions of the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act in connection with the liquidation in bankruptcy of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, is denied.  It appearing that a stay would set in motion a chain of events that would lead to substantial payments to employees of the railroad that would be unconstitutional and unrecoverable, a sufficient showing of irreparable damage to the estate has been made to support the preliminary injunction."|

Syllabus 
Pursuant to a contract with an organization of petitioner White Mountain Apache Tribe, petitioner Pinetop Logging Co. (Pinetop), a non-Indian enterprise authorized to do business in Arizona, felled tribal timber on the Fort Apache Reservation and transported it to the tribal organization's sawmill.  Pinetop's activities were performed solely on the reservation.  Respondents, state agencies and members thereof, sought to impose on Pinetop Arizona's motor carrier license tax, which is assessed on the basis of the carrier's gross receipts, and its use fuel tax, which is assessed on the basis of diesel fuel used to propel a motor vehicle on any highway within the State.  Pinetop paid the taxes under protest and then brought suit in state court, asserting that, under federal law, the taxes could not lawfully be imposed on logging activities conducted exclusively within the reservation or on hauling activities on Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and tribal roads.  The trial court awarded summary judgment to respondents, and the Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed in pertinent part, rejecting petitioners' preemption claim.
Held:  The Arizona taxes are preempted by federal law.  Cf. Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 380 U. S. 685.  Pp.  448 U. S. 141-153.
(a) The tradition of Indian sovereignty over the reservation and tribal members must inform the determination whether the exercise of state authority has been preempted by operation of federal law.  Where, as here, a State asserts authority over the conduct of non-Indians engaging in activity on the reservation, a particularized inquiry must be made into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake, an inquiry designed to determine whether, in the specific context, the exercise of state authority would violate federal law.  Pp.  448 U. S. 141-145.
(b) The Federal Government's regulation of the harvesting, sale, and management of tribal timber, and of the BIA and tribal roads, is so pervasive as to preclude the additional burdens sought to be imposed here by assessing the taxes in question against Pinetop for operations that are conducted solely on BIA and tribal roads within the reservation.  Pp.  448 U. S. 145-149.
(c) Imposition of the taxes in question would undermine the federal policy of assuring that the profits from timber sales would inure to the 
Page 448 U. S. 137
 Tribe's benefit; would also undermine the Secretary of the Interior's ability to make the wide range of determinations committed to his authority concerning the setting of fees and rates with respect to the harvesting and sale of tribal timber; and would adversely affect the Tribe's ability to comply with the sustained-yield management policies imposed by federal law.  Pp.  448 U. S. 149-150.
(d) Respondents' generalized interest in raising revenue is insufficient, in the context of this case, to permit its proposed intrusion into the federal regulatory scheme with respect to the harvesting and sale of tribal timber.  P.  448 U. S. 150.

Held:  Arizona had no jurisdiction to impose a tax on appellant Arizona corporation's sale of farm machinery to an Indian tribe where the sale took place on an Indian reservation, even though appellant did not have a permanent place of business on the reservation and was not licensed to trade with Indians.  Since the transaction was plainly subject to regulation under the federal statutes and implementing regulations governing the licensing of Indian traders, federal law preempts the asserted state tax.  It is irrelevant that appellant was not a licensed Indian trader, since it is the existence of the Indian trader statutes, not their administration, that preempts the field of transactions with Indians occurring on reservations.  Nor is it relevant that appellant did not maintain a permanent place of business on the reservation, since the Indian trader statutes and regulations apply no less to a nonresident who sells goods to Indians on a reservation than they do to a resident trader.

Syllabus 
Title 3 U.S.C. 271(c) provides that
""[w]hoever sells a component of a patented machine, manufacture, combination or composition, or a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process, constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer.""
Section 271(d) provides that
""[n]o patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement or contributory infringement of a patent shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of his having done one or more of the following:   (1) derived revenue from acts which if performed by another without his consent would constitute contributory infringement of the patent; (2) licensed or authorized another to perform acts which if performed without his consent would constitute contributory infringement of the patent; (3) sought to enforce his patent rights against infringement or contributory infringement.""
Respondent chemical manufacturer obtained a patent on the method or process for applying propanil, a chemical compound herbicide, to inhibit the growth of undesirable plants in rice crops.  Propanil is a nonstaple commodity that has no use except through practice of the patented method.  Petitioners manufactured and sold propanil for application to rice crops, with directions to purchasers to apply the propanil in accordance with respondent's patented method.  Respondent filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking injunctive relief and alleging that petitioners contributed to infringement of its patent rights by farmers who purchased and used petitioners' propanil, and that petitioners induced such infringement by instructing the farmers how to apply the herbicide.  Petitioners responded by requesting licenses for the patented method, but, when respondent refused to grant licenses, petitioners raised a defense of patent misuse, claiming that there had been misuse because respondent had ""tied"" the sale of patent rights to the purchase of propanil, an unpatented and unpatentable article, and because it refused to grant licenses to other propanil producers.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners on the ground that respondent was barred from obtaining relief against infringers because 
Page 448 U. S. 177
 it had attempted illegally to extend its patent monopoly.  The court ruled that the language of  271(d) specifying conduct that is deemed not to be patent abuse did not encompass the totality of respondent's conduct.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, by specifying in  271(d) conduct that is not to be deemed patent misuse, Congress conferred upon a patentee the right to exclude others and reserve to itself, if it chooses, the right to sell nonstaples used substantially only in its invention, and that, since respondent's conduct was designed to accomplish only what the statute contemplated, petitioners' misuse defense was of no avail.
Held:  Respondent has not engaged in patent misuse, either by its method of selling propanil or by its refusal to license others to sell that commodity.  Pp.  448 U. S. 187-223.
(a) Viewed against the backdrop of judicial precedent involving the doctrines of contributory infringement and patent misuse, the language and structure of  271 support respondent's contention that, because  271(d) immunizes its conduct from the charge of patent misuse, it should not be barred from seeking relief against contributory infringement.  Section 271(c) identifies the basic dividing line between contributory infringement and patent misuse, and adopts a restrictive definition of contributory infringement that distinguishes between staple and nonstaple articles of commerce.  Section 271(c)'s limitations on contributory infringement are counterbalanced by the limitations on patent misuse in  271(d), which effectively confer upon the patentee, as a lawful adjunct of his patent rights, a limited power to exclude others from competition in nonstaple goods.  Respondent's conduct is not dissimilar in either nature or effect from the three species of conduct that are expressly excluded by  271(d) from characterization as misuse.  It sells propanil, authorizes others to use it, and sues contributory infringers, all protected activities.  While respondent does not license others to sell propanil, nothing on the face of the statute requires it to do so.  And, although respondent's linkage of two protected activities -- sale of propanil and authorization to practice the patented process -- together in a single transaction is not expressly covered by  271(d), petitioners have failed to identify any way in which such ""tying"" of two expressly protected activities results in any extension of control over unpatented materials beyond what  271(d) already allows.  Pp.  448 U. S. 200-202
(b) The relevant legislative materials, especially the extensive congressional hearings that led up to the final enactment of  271 in 1952, reinforce the conclusion that  271(d) was designed to immunize from the charge of patent misuse behavior similar to that in which respondent has 
Page 448 U. S. 178
 engaged, and that, by enacting 271(c) and(d), Congress granted to patent holders a statutory right to control nonstaple goods that are capable only of infringing use in a patented invention and are essential to that invention's advance over prior art.  There is nothing in the legislative history to show that respondent's behavior falls outside  271(d)'s scope.  Pp.  448 U. S. 202-215.
(c) The above interpretation of  271(d) is not foreclosed by decisions in this Court following passage of the 1952 Patent Act.  Contrary to petitioners' assertion, this Court in those decisions did not continue to apply the holdings of Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., 320 U. S. 661, and Mercoid Corp. v. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., 320 U. S. 680 -- that even an attempt to control the market for unpatented goods having no use outside a patented invention would constitute patent misuse -- and did not effectively construe  271(d) to codify the result of the Mercoid decisions.  The staple-nonstaple distinction supplies the controlling benchmark, and ensures that the patentee's right to prevent others from contributorily infringing his patent affects only the market for the invention itself.

Syllabus 
Section 311(b)(3) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act prohibits the discharge of oil into navigable waters.  Section 311(b)(5) requires any person in charge of an onshore facility to report any such discharge to the appropriate Government agency, and a failure to report subjects the person to a fine or imprisonment.  Section 311(b)(5) also provides for a form of ""use immunity,"" by specifying that notification of the discharge or information obtained by the exploitation of such notification is not to be used against the reporting person in any criminal case, except for prosecution for perjury or for giving a false statement.  Section 311(b)(6) provides for the imposition of a ""civil penalty"" against any owner or operator of an onshore facility from which oil was discharged in violation of the Act.  When oil escaped from a drilling facility leased by respondent and spilled into a tributary of the Arkansas River system, respondent notified the Environmental Protection Agency of the discharge, and this was reported to the Coast Guard, who assessed a $500 penalty against respondent under  311(b)(6).  After his administrative appeal was denied, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking injunctive relief against enforcement of  311(b)(5) and(6) and collection of the penalty.  The Government filed a separate suit to collect the penalty, and the suits were consolidated for trial.  Prior to trial, the District Court rejected respondent's contention that the reporting requirements of  311(b)(5), as used to support a civil penalty under  311(b)(6), violated his right against compulsory self-incrimination, and ultimately the jury found that respondent's facility did, in fact, spill oil into the creek in question.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  311(b)(6) was sufficiently punitive to intrude upon the Fifth Amendment's protections against compulsory self-incrimination.
Held:
1. The penalty imposed by  311(b)(6) is civil, and hence does not trigger the protections afforded by the Constitution to a criminal defendant.  Pp.  448 U. S. 248 251.
(a) It is clear that Congress intended in  311(b)(6) to impose a civil penalty upon persons in respondent's position, and to allow imposition 
Page 448 U. S. 243
 of the penalty without regard to the procedural protections and restrictions available in criminal prosecutions.  This intent is indicated by the fact that the authorized sanction is labeled a ""civil penalty,"" and by the juxtaposition of such label with the criminal penalties set forth in  311(b)(5).  P.  448 U. S. 249.
(b) The fact that 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 makes criminal the conduct penalized in this case does not render the penalty under 311(b)(6) criminal in nature.  The placement of criminal penalties in one statute and of civil penalties in another statute enacted 70 years later tends to dilute the force of the factor -- the behavior to which the penalty applies is already a crime -- considered, inter alia, in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, as indicating that a penalty is criminal in nature.  Neither that factor nor any of the other factors set forth in Mendoza-Martinez is sufficient to render unconstitutional the congressional classification of the penalty established in  311(b)(6).  Pp.  448 U. S. 249-251.
2. The proceeding in which the penalty was imposed was not ""quasi-criminal,"" so as to implicate the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination.  Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, distinguished.  In light of overwhelming evidence that Congress intended to create a penalty civil in all respects and weak evidence of any countervailing punitive purpose or effect, it would be anomalous to hold that 311(b)(6) created a criminal penalty for the purposes of the Self-Incrimination Clause but a civil penalty for all other purposes.  Pp.  448 U. S. 251-254.

When oil escaped from a drilling facility leased by respondent and spilled into a tributary of the Arkansas River system, respondent notified the Environmental Protection Agency of the discharge, and this was reported to the Coast Guard, who assessed a $500 penalty against respondent under  311(b)(6).  After his administrative appeal was denied, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking injunctive relief against enforcement of  311(b)(5) and(6) and collection of the penalty.  The Government filed a separate suit to collect the penalty, and the suits were consolidated for trial.  Prior to trial, the District Court rejected respondent's contention that the reporting requirements of  311(b)(5), as used to support a civil penalty under  311(b)(6), violated his right against compulsory self-incrimination, and ultimately the jury found that respondent's facility did, in fact, spill oil into the creek in question.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  311(b)(6) was sufficiently punitive to intrude upon the Fifth Amendment's protections against compulsory self-incrimination.
Held:
1. The penalty imposed by  311(b)(6) is civil, and hence does not trigger the protections afforded by the Constitution to a criminal defendant.  Pp.  448 U. S. 248 251.
(a) It is clear that Congress intended in  311(b)(6) to impose a civil penalty upon persons in respondent's position, and to allow imposition 
Page 448 U. S. 243
 of the penalty without regard to the procedural protections and restrictions available in criminal prosecutions.  This intent is indicated by the fact that the authorized sanction is labeled a ""civil penalty,"" and by the juxtaposition of such label with the criminal penalties set forth in  311(b)(5).  P.  448 U. S. 249.
(b) The fact that 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 makes criminal the conduct penalized in this case does not render the penalty under 311(b)(6) criminal in nature.  The placement of criminal penalties in one statute and of civil penalties in another statute enacted 70 years later tends to dilute the force of the factor -- the behavior to which the penalty applies is already a crime -- considered, inter alia, in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, as indicating that a penalty is criminal in nature.  Neither that factor nor any of the other factors set forth in Mendoza-Martinez is sufficient to render unconstitutional the congressional classification of the penalty established in  311(b)(6).  Pp.  448 U. S. 249-251.
2. The proceeding in which the penalty was imposed was not ""quasi-criminal,"" so as to implicate the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination.  Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, distinguished.  In light of overwhelming evidence that Congress intended to create a penalty civil in all respects and weak evidence of any countervailing punitive purpose or effect, it would be anomalous to hold that 311(b)(6) created a criminal penalty for the purposes of the Self-Incrimination Clause but a civil penalty for all other purposes.  Pp.  448 U. S. 251-254.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a resident of the District of Columbia, received an award of disability benefits from the Virginia Industrial Commission under the Virginia Workmen's Compensation Act for injuries received in Virginia while employed by respondent employer (hereafter respondent), which was principally located in the District of Columbia, where petitioner was hired.  Subsequently, petitioner received a supplemental award under the District of Columbia Workmen's Compensation Act over respondent's contention that since, as a matter of Virginia law, the Virginia award excluded any other recovery ""at common law or otherwise"" on account of the injury in Virginia, the District of Columbia's obligation to give that award full faith and credit precluded a second, supplemental award in the District.  The administrative order upholding the supplemental award was reversed by the Court of Appeals, which held that the award was precluded by the Full Faith and Credit Clause.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  448 U. S. 266-286;  448 U. S. 286-290.
598 F.2d 617, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not preclude successive workmen's compensation awards, since a State has no legitimate interest within the context of the federal system in preventing another State from granting a supplemental compensation award when that second State would have had the power, as here, to apply its workmen's compensation law in the first instance.  Pp.  448 U. S. 266-286.
(a) The rule of Industrial Comm'n of Wisconsin v. McCartin, 330 U. S. 622, authorizing a State, by drafting or construing its workmen's compensation statute in ""unmistakable language,"" directly to preclude a compensation award in another State, represents an unwarranted delegation to the States of this Court's responsibility for the final arbitration of full faith and credit questions.  To vest the power of determining such extraterritorial effect in the State itself risks the very kind of parochial entrenchment on the interests of other States that it was the purpose of the Full Faith and Credit Clause and other provisions of Art. IV to prevent.  A reexamination of McCartin's ""unmistakable language"" 
Page 448 U. S. 262
 test reinforces the conclusion that it does not provide an acceptable basis on which to distinguish Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, 320 U. S. 430, wherein it was held that the Full Faith and Credit Clause precluded an employee who received a workmen's compensation award for injuries received in one State from seeking supplementary compensation in another State where he had been hired.  Pp.  448 U. S. 266-272.
(b) In view, however, of the history of subsequent state cases showing that they overwhelmingly followed McCartin and applied the ""unmistakable language"" test in permitting successive workmen's compensation awards, the principal values underlying the doctrine of stare decisis would not be served by attempting either to revive Magnolia or to preserve the coexistence of Magnolia and McCartin.  The latter attempt could only breed uncertainty and unpredictability, since the application of the ""unmistakable language"" rule necessarily depends on a determination by one state tribunal of the effect to be given to statutory language enacted by the legislature of a different State.  And the former would represent a change that would not promote stability in the law.  Moreover, since Magnolia has been so rarely followed, there is little danger that there has been any significant reliance on its rule.  Hence, a fresh examination of the full faith and credit issue is appropriate.  Pp.  448 U. S. 272-277.
(c) Since petitioner could have sought a compensation award in the first instance in either Virginia or the District of Columbia even if one statute or the other purported to confer an exclusive remedy, respondent and its insurer, for all practical purposes, would have had to measure their potential liability exposure by the more generous of the two workmen's compensation schemes.  It follows that a State's interest in limiting the potential liability of businesses within the State is not of controlling importance.  Moreover, the state interest in providing adequate compensation to the injured worker would be fully served by the allowance of successive awards.  Pp.  448 U. S. 277-280.
(d) With respect to whether Virginia's interest in the integrity of its tribunal's determinations precludes a supplemental award in the District of Columbia, the critical differences between a court of general jurisdiction and an administrative agency with limited statutory authority foreclose the conclusion that constitutional rules applicable to court judgments are necessarily applicable to workmen's compensation awards.  The Virginia Industrial Commission, although it could establish petitioner's rights under Virginia law, neither could nor purported to determine his rights under District of Columbia law.  Full faith and credit must be given to the determination that the Commission had the authority to make, but need not be given to determinations that it had no power to make.  Since it was not requested, and had no authority, to 
Page 448 U. S. 263
 pass on petitioner's rights under District of Columbia law, there can be no constitutional objection to a fresh adjudication of those rights.  While Virginia had an interest in having respondent pay petitioner the amounts specified in its award, allowing a supplementary recovery in the District of Columbia does not conflict with that interest.  And whether or not petitioner sought an award from the less generous jurisdiction in the first instance, the vindication of that State's interest in placing a ceiling on employers' liability would inevitably impinge upon the substantial interests of the second jurisdiction in the welfare and subsistence of disabled workers -- interests that a court of general jurisdiction might consider, but which must be ignored by the Virginia Industrial Commission.  Pp.  448 U. S. 280-285.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER and MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that the Virginia Workmen's Compensation Act lacks the ""unmistakable language"" which McCartin, supra, requires if a workmen's compensation award is to preclude a subsequent award in another State.

Syllabus 
Trials for capital offenses in Texas are conducted in two phases.  First, the jury considers the question of the defendant's guilt or innocence.   If the jury finds the defendant guilty, the trial court holds a separate sentencing proceeding at which additional evidence in mitigation or aggravation is admissible.  The jury is then required by statute to answer three specific questions concerning (1) whether the defendant's conduct causing the death at issue was deliberate, (2) whether the defendant's conduct in the future would constitute a continuing threat to society, and (3) whether his conduct in killing the victim was unreasonable in response to the victim's provocation, if any.  If the jury answers ""Yes"" to each of these questions, the court must impose a death sentence, but if the jury answers ""No"" to any of the questions, the court imposes a life sentence.  At the petitioner's murder trial, the Texas trial judge, pursuant to statute ( 12.31(b)), excluded from the jury a number of prospective jurors who were unwilling or unable to take an oath that the mandatory penalty of death or life imprisonment would not ""affect [their] deliberations on any issue of fact.""  The jury that was selected convicted petitioner and answered the statutory questions in the affirmative at the punishment phase, thus causing the death sentence to be imposed.  On appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected petitioner's contention that the prospective jurors had been excluded in violation of Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, wherein it was held that a State may not constitutionally execute a death sentence imposed by a jury culled of all those who revealed during voir dire examination that they had conscientious scruples against or were otherwise opposed to capital punishment.
Held:  Section 12.31(b) was applied in this case to exclude jurors in contravention of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments as construed and applied in Witherspoon, supra.  Pp.  448 U. S. 43-51.
(a) The general proposition established by Witherspoon and related cases that a juror may not be challenged for cause based on his views about capital punishment unless those views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and oath, is applicable to the bifurcated procedure employed by Texas in capital cases.  If the Texas juror is to obey his 
Page 448 U. S. 39
 oath and follow Texas law, he must be willing not only to accept that, in certain circumstances, death is an acceptable penalty, but also to answer the three statutory questions without conscious distortion or bias.  Pp  448 U. S. 43-47.
(b) Witherspoon and 12.31(b) may not coexist as separate and independent bases for excluding jurors so as to permit exclusion under 12.31(b) on grounds broader than permitted by Witherspoon.  Although the State could, consistently with Witherspoon, use 12.31(b) to exclude prospective jurors whose views on capital punishment are such as to make them unable to follow the law or obey their oaths, the use of 12.31(b) to exclude jurors on broader grounds based on their opinions concerning the death penalty is impermissible.  The appearance of neutrality created by the theoretical availability of 12.31(b) as a defense challenge to prospective jurors who favor the death penalty is not sufficiently substantial to take 12.31(b) out of Witherspoon's ambit.  Pp.  448 U. S. 47-49.
(c) As 12.31(b) was employed here, the touchstone of the inquiry was not whether putative jurors could and would follow their instructions and answer the posited questions in the affirmative if they honestly believed the evidence warranted it beyond reasonable doubt, but rather whether the fact that the imposition of the death penalty would follow automatically from affirmative answers to the questions would have any effect at all on the jurors' performance of their duties.  Such a test could, and did, exclude jurors whose only fault was to take their responsibilities with special seriousness or to acknowledge honestly that they might or might not be affected.  It does not appear that these individuals were so irrevocably opposed to capital punishment as to frustrate the State's legitimate efforts to administer its constitutionally valid death penalty scheme.  Accordingly, the Constitution disentitles the State to execute a death sentence imposed by a jury from which such prospective jurors have been excluded.  Pp.  448 U. S. 49-51.

Accordingly, the Constitution disentitles the State to execute a death sentence imposed by a jury from which such prospective jurors have been excluded.  Pp.  448 U. S. 49-51.

Syllabus 
At respondent's preliminary hearing in an Ohio state court on charges of forgery of a check in the name of one Bernard Isaacs and of possession of stolen credit cards belonging to Isaacs and his wife, respondent's counsel called as a witness the Isaacs' daughter, who testified that she had permitted respondent to use her apartment for several days while she was away.  However, she refused to admit that she had given respondent checks and the credit cards without informing him that she did not have permission to use them.  Respondent's counsel did not ask to have the witness declared hostile or to place her on cross-examination.  At respondent's subsequent criminal trial, he testified that the daughter had given him her parents' checkbook and credit cards with the understanding that he could use them.  When the daughter failed to appear at the trial despite the State's having issued five separate subpoenas to her at her parents' residence, the State offered in rebuttal the transcript of her preliminary hearing testimony, relying on an Ohio statute which permits the use of such testimony when the witness ""cannot for any reason be produced at the trial.""  At a voir dire hearing on admissibility, conducted after the defense objected to the use of the transcript as violative of the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause, the mother, as the sole witness, testified that the daughter had left home soon after the preliminary hearing; that, about a year before the trial, a San Francisco social worker had communicated with the parents about the daughter's welfare application filed there; that the last time the daughter telephoned, some seven or eight months before trial, she told her parents that she ""was traveling"" outside Ohio, but did not reveal where she was; that the mother knew of no way to reach the daughter in case of an emergency; and that she did not know of anybody who knew where the daughter was.  The trial court admitted the transcript into evidence, and respondent was convicted.  Affirming the Ohio Court of Appeals' reversal of the conviction, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the transcript was inadmissible because the daughter had not been actually cross-examined at the preliminary hearing and was absent at trial, the admission of the transcript thus having violated respondent's confrontation right.
Held:  The introduction in evidence at respondent's trial of the daughter's 
Page 448 U. S. 57
 preliminary hearing testimony was constitutionally permissible.  Pp.  448 U. S. 62-77
(a) When a hearsay declarant is not present for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause normally requires a showing that he is unavailable.  Even then, his statement is admissible only if it bears adequate ""indicia of reliability.""  Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.  In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.  Cf. Mancusi v. Stubbs, 408 U. S. 204.  Pp.  448 U. S. 62-66.
(b) The daughter's prior testimony at the preliminary hearing bore sufficient ""indicia of reliability.""  Cf. California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149.  It need not be decided whether, under Green, the mere opportunity to cross-examine satisfies the Confrontation Clause, for defense counsel tested the daughter's testimony with the equivalent of significant cross-examination.  His questioning, which was replete with leading questions, clearly partook of cross-examination as a matter of form, and comported with the principal purpose of cross-examination by challenging the daughter's veracity.  Regardless of how state law might formally characterize the questioning, it afforded substantial compliance with the purposes behind the confrontation requirement.  Nor can this case be distinguished from Green merely because the daughter was not personally available for questioning at trial or because respondent had a different lawyer at trial from the one at the preliminary hearing.  Moreover, this case does not fall among those in which a particularized search for ""indicia of reliability"" must be made.  Pp.  448 U. S. 67-73.

Syllabus 
Respondents were charged with unlawful possession of stolen mail. The checks that formed the basis of the indictment had been seized by police during a search, conducted pursuant to a warrant, of an apartment rented by one respondent's mother.  Respondents moved to suppress the checks on the ground that the affidavit supporting the application for the search warrant was inadequate to show probable cause.  The District Court granted the motion.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding, in reliance on Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257, that, since respondents were charged with crimes of possession, they were entitled to claim ""automatic standing"" to challenge the legality of the search without regard to whether they had an expectation of privacy in the premises searched.
Held:  Defendants charged with crimes of possession may only claim the benefits of the exclusionary rule if their own Fourth Amendment rights have in fact been violated.  Jones v. United States, supra, overruled.  Pp.  448 U. S. 86-95.
(a) The ""dilemma"" identified in Jones (and given as one of the two reasons for establishing the ""automatic standing"" rule as an exception to the exclusionary rule) that a defendant charged with a possessory offense might only be able to establish his standing to challenge a search and seizure by giving self-incriminating testimony admissible as evidence of his guilt, was eliminated by Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377, wherein it was held that testimony given by a defendant in support of a motion to suppress cannot be admitted as evidence of his guilt at trial.  Pp.  448 U. S. 89-90.
(b) The second reason given in Jones for the ""automatic standing"" rule that such rule would prevent the ""vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction"" whereby the Government would assert that the defendant possessed the goods in question for purposes of criminal liability while simultaneously asserting that he did not possess them for the purposes of claiming the protections of the Fourth Amendment, has likewise been eroded.  It is now the rule that a prosecutor, without legal contradiction, may simultaneously maintain that a defendant criminally possessed the seized goods but was not subject to a Fourth Amendment deprivation.   
Page 448 U. S. 84
 Rakas v. Illinois, 139 U. S. 128.  The underlying assumption for such ""vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction"" that possession of seized goods is the equivalent of Fourth Amendment ""standing"" to challenge the search creates too broad a gauge for measurement of Fourth Amendment rights.  Rather, it must be asked not merely whether the defendant has a possessory interest in the items seized, but also whether he had an expectation of privacy in the area searched.  Pp.  448 U. S. 90-93.
(c) The issue whether the prosecutor, although not permitted under Simmons v. United States, supra, to use a defendant's testimony at a suppression hearing as substantive evidence of guilt at trial, may still be permitted to use such testimony to impeach the defendant at trial, need not be resolved here, since it is an issue that more aptly relates to the proper breadth of the Simmons privilege, and not to the need for retaining automatic standing.  Pp.  448 U. S. 93-94.

Syllabus 
When police officers, armed with a warrant to arrest one Marquess, arrived at his house, another resident of the house and four visitors, including petitioner, were there.  While searching the house unsuccessfully for Marquess, several officers smelled marihuana smoke and saw marihuana seeds.  Two of the officers left to obtain a warrant to search the house, and the other officers detained the occupants, allowing them to leave only if they consented to a body search.  About 45 minutes later, the officers returned with the search warrant; the warrant was read to the remaining occupants, including petitioner, and they were also given Miranda warnings; and one Cox, an occupant, was ordered to empty her purse, which contained drugs that were controlled substances under Kentucky law.  Cox told petitioner, who was standing nearby in response to an officer's command, ""to take what was his,"" and petitioner immediately claimed ownership of the drugs.  At that time, an officer searched petitioner, finding $ 4,500 in cash and a knife, and petitioner was then formally arrested.  Petitioner was indicted for possessing with intent to sell the controlled substances recovered from Cox's purse, and the Kentucky trial court denied petitioner's motion to suppress, as fruits of an illegal detention and illegal searches, the drugs, the money, and the statements made by him when the police discovered the drugs.  Petitioner's conviction was affirmed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, and the Kentucky Supreme Court, in turn affirmed, holding that petitioner had no ""standing"" to contest the search of Cox's purse because he had no legitimate or reasonable expectation of freedom from governmental intrusion into the purse, and that the search uncovering the money in petitioner's pocket was justifiable as incident to a lawful arrest based on probable cause.
Held:
1. The conclusion that petitioner did not sustain his burden of proving that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in Cox's purse so as to allow him to challenge the validity of the search of the purse is supported by the record, which includes petitioner's admission at the suppression hearing that he did not believe that the purse would be free from governmental intrusion.  Nor was petitioner entitled to challenge 
Page 448 U. S. 99
 the search, regardless of his expectation of privacy, merely because he claimed ownership of the drugs in the purse.  While petitioner's ownership of the drugs is one fact to be considered, ""arcane"" concepts of property law do not control the ability to claim the protections of the Fourth Amendment.  Cf. Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128.  Pp.  448 U. S. 104-106.
2. Under the totality of circumstances present (the giving of Miranda warnings, the short lapse of time between petitioner's detention and his admissions being outweighed by the ""congenial atmosphere"" in the house during this interval, his admissions being apparently spontaneous reactions to the discovery of the drugs in Cox's purse, the police conduct not appearing to rise to the level of conscious or flagrant misconduct requiring prophylactic exclusion of petitioner's admissions, and petitioner not having argued that his admissions were anything other than voluntary), Kentucky carried its burden of showing that petitioner's statements to the police admitting his ownership of the drugs were acts of free will unaffected by any illegality in his detention, assuming, arguendo, that the police violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by detaining petitioner and his companions in the house while they obtained a search warrant.  Cf. Brown v. Illinois, 422 U. S. 590.  Pp.  448 U. S. 106-110.
3. The search of petitioner's person that uncovered the money and the knife was valid as incident to his formal arrest.  Once he admitted ownership of the drugs found in Cox's purse, the police had probable cause to arrest him, and where the arrest followed quickly after the search of petitioner's person it is not important that the search preceded the arrest, rather than vice versa.

No. 78-1888
Argued January 9, 1980
Decided June 25, 1980
448 U.S. 122

Syllabus 
Respondent is a recipient of benefits under Connecticut's federally funded Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program.  She brought this action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that Connecticut's AFDC regulations denied her credit for substantial portions of her actual work-related expenses, thus reducing the level of her benefits, and that such regulations violated the Social Security Act and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Ultimately, the case was settled and the District Court entered a consent decree that provided for a substantial increase in the standard allowances for work-related expenses and gave AFDC recipients the right to prove that their actual work-related expenses were in excess of the standard.  The District Court then awarded respondent's counsel a fee pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.  1988, which provides that, in any action to enforce 42 U.S.C.  1983, inter alia, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.  The court held that respondent was entitled to fees under the Act because, in addition to her statutory claim, she had alleged constitutional claims that were sufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Under  1988, the district courts' authority to award attorney's fees is not limited to cases in which  1983 is invoked as a remedy for a constitutional violation or a violation of a federal statute providing for the protection of civil or equal rights.  As the Court holds in Maine v. Thiboutot, ante p.  448 U. S. 1,  1988 applies to all types of  1983 actions, including actions based solely on Social Security Act violations.  Thus, even if respondent's claim could be characterized as arising solely out of a Social Security Act violation, this would not preclude the award of attorney's fees under  1988.  Pp.  448 U. S. 128-129.
2. The fact that respondent prevailed through a settlement rather than through litigation does not preclude her from claiming attorney's fees 
Page 448 U. S. 123
 as the ""prevailing party"" within the meaning of  1988.  And petitioner's contention that respondent did not gain sufficient relief through the consent decree to be considered the prevailing party is without merit in view of the District Court's contrary finding, which was upheld by the Court of Appeals.  Pp.  448 U. S. 129-130.
3. The District Court was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment from awarding attorney's fees against the State.  Respondent alleged constitutional violations which both courts below held to be sufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction, and the constitutional issues remained in the case until the consent decree was entered.  Under these circumstances, petitioner's Eleventh Amendment claim is foreclosed by Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678.

			"|"Maher v. Gagne
No. 78-1888
Argued January 9, 1980
Decided June 25, 1980
448 U.S. 122

Syllabus 
Respondent is a recipient of benefits under Connecticut's federally funded Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program.  She brought this action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that Connecticut's AFDC regulations denied her credit for substantial portions of her actual work-related expenses, thus reducing the level of her benefits, and that such regulations violated the Social Security Act and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Ultimately, the case was settled and the District Court entered a consent decree that provided for a substantial increase in the standard allowances for work-related expenses and gave AFDC recipients the right to prove that their actual work-related expenses were in excess of the standard.  The District Court then awarded respondent's counsel a fee pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.  1988, which provides that, in any action to enforce 42 U.S.C.  1983, inter alia, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.  The court held that respondent was entitled to fees under the Act because, in addition to her statutory claim, she had alleged constitutional claims that were sufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Under  1988, the district courts' authority to award attorney's fees is not limited to cases in which  1983 is invoked as a remedy for a constitutional violation or a violation of a federal statute providing for the protection of civil or equal rights.  As the Court holds in Maine v. Thiboutot, ante p.  448 U. S. 1,  1988 applies to all types of  1983 actions, including actions based solely on Social Security Act violations.  Thus, even if respondent's claim could be characterized as arising solely out of a Social Security Act violation, this would not preclude the award of attorney's fees under  1988.  Pp.  448 U. S. 128-129.
2. The fact that respondent prevailed through a settlement rather than through litigation does not preclude her from claiming attorney's fees 
Page 448 U. S. 123
 as the ""prevailing party"" within the meaning of  1988.  And petitioner's contention that respondent did not gain sufficient relief through the consent decree to be considered the prevailing party is without merit in view of the District Court's contrary finding, which was upheld by the Court of Appeals.  Pp.  448 U. S. 129-130.
3. The District Court was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment from awarding attorney's fees against the State.  Respondent alleged constitutional violations which both courts below held to be sufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction, and the constitutional issues remained in the case until the consent decree was entered.  Under these circumstances, petitioner's Eleventh Amendment claim is foreclosed by Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678.  In Hutto, the Court rejected the argument that the general language of the Act was insufficient to remove an Eleventh Amendment barrier, noting that ""this Court has never viewed the Eleventh Amendment as barring such awards, even in suits between States and individual litigants.""  Id. at  437 U. S. 695.

No. 79-8
Argued February 25, 1980
Decided June 23, 1980
447 U.S. 667

Syllabus 
Prior to his trial on federal criminal charges, respondent moved to suppress certain incriminating statements he had made to police officers and federal agents.  Over objections, the District Court referred the motion to a Magistrate for an evidentiary hearing pursuant to a provision of the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C.  636(b)(1), which authorizes a district court to refer such a motion to a magistrate and thereafter to determine and decide such motion based on the record developed before the magistrate, including the magistrate's proposed findings of fact and recommendations.  Section 636(b)(1) also provides that the judge shall make a ""de novo determination"" of those portions of the magistrate's report, findings, or recommendations to which objection is made, and that the judge may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the magistrate's findings or recommendations; alternatively the judge may receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate with instructions.  Based on his view of the credibility of the testimony at the hearing on respondent's motion, the Magistrate found that respondent had knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made the inculpatory statements and recommended that the motion to suppress be denied.  Over respondent's objections to the Magistrate's report, the District Court accepted the recommendation and denied the motion to suppress, stating that it had considered the transcript of the Magistrate's hearing, the parties' proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and supporting memoranda, the Magistrate's recommendation, and oral argument of counsel.  Respondent was then tried and convicted, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding, inter alia, that respondent had been deprived of due process by the District Court's failure personally to hear the controverted testimony on the motion to suppress.
Held:
1. Under the statute -- which calls for ""de novo determination,"" not a de novo hearing -- the District Court was not required to rehear the testimony on which the Magistrate based his findings and recommendations in order to make an independent evaluation of credibility.  The legislative history discloses that Congress purposefully used the word 
Page 447 U. S. 668
 determination rather than hearing, believing that Art. III was satisfied if the ultimate adjudicatory determination was reserved to the Art. III officer, and that Congress intended to permit whatever reliance the judge, in the exercise of sound judicial discretion, chose to place on the magistrate's proposed findings and recommendations.  Pp.  447 U. S. 673-676.
2. The statute strikes the proper balance between the demands of due process under the Fifth Amendment and the constraints of Art. III.  Pp.  447 U. S. 677-684.
(a) The nature of the issues presented and the interests implicated in a motion to suppress evidence do not require, as a matter of due process, that the district judge must actually hear the challenged testimony.  While the resolution of a suppression motion may determine the outcome of the case, the interests underlying a voluntariness hearing do not coincide with the criminal law objective of determining guilt or innocence, but are of a lesser magnitude than those in the criminal trial itself.  The due process rights claimed here are adequately protected by the statute, under which the district judge alone acts as the ultimate decisionmaker, with the broad discretion to accept, reject, or modify the magistrate's proposed findings, or to hear the witnesses live to resolve conflicting credibility claims.  The statutory scheme also includes sufficient procedures to alert the district court whether to exercise its discretion to conduct a hearing and view the witnesses itself.  Pp.  447 U. S. 677-681.
(b) Although the statute permits the district court to give the magistrate's proposed findings of fact and recommendations such weight as their merit commands and the sound discretion of the judge warrants, that delegation does not violate Art. III so long as the ultimate decision is made by the district court.  Congress has not sought to delegate the task of rendering a final decision on a suppression motion to a non-Art. III officer, but instead has made clear that the district court has plenary discretion whether to authorize a magistrate to hold an evidentiary hearing and that the magistrate acts subsidiary to, and only in aid of, the court, the entire process thereafter taking place under the court's total control and jurisdiction.

Syllabus 
Held:  A State may apply its workers' compensation scheme to land-based injuries that fall within the coverage of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (Act), as amended in 1972.  Pp.  447 U. S. 717-726.
(a) Under the law governing jurisdiction over marine-related injuries before 1972, nonlocal maritime injuries fell under the Act, ""maritime but local"" injuries ""upon the navigable waters of the United States,"" 33 U.S.C.  903(a), could be compensated either under the Act or under state law, and injuries suffered beyond navigable waters -- albeit within the range of federal admiralty jurisdiction -- were remediable only under state law.  Cf. Davis v. Department of Labor, 317 U. S. 249; Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co., 370 U. S. 114; Nacirema Operating Co. v. Johnson, 396 U. S. 212.  Pp.  447 U. S. 717-719.
(b) The extension of federal jurisdiction landward beyond the shoreline of the navigable waters of the United States under the 1972 amendments of the Act supplements, rather than supplants, state compensation law.  The language of the 1972 amendments cannot fairly be understood as preempting state workers' remedies from the field of the Act, and thereby resurrecting the jurisdictional monstrosity that existed before the clarifying opinions in Davis, supra, and Calbeck, supra.  Nor does the legislative history suggest a congressional decision to exclude state laws from the terrain newly occupied by the post-1972 Act.  Pp.  447 U. S. 719-722.
(c) The disparities which Congress had in view in amending the Act lay primarily in the paucity of relief under state compensation laws, and concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal compensation laws is not inconsistent with the amendments' policy of raising awards to a federal minimum.  Even though, if state remedial schemes are more generous than federal law, concurrent jurisdiction could result in more favorable awards for workers' injuries than under an exclusively federal compensation system, there is no evidence that Congress was concerned about a disparity between adequate federal benefits and superior state benefits, the quid pro quo to employers for the 1972 landward extension of the Act being simply the abolition of the longshoremen's unseaworthiness remedy.  Nor does the bare fact that the federal and state compensation 
Page 447 U. S. 716
 systems are different give rise to a conflict that, from the employer's standpoint, necessitates exclusivity for each system within a separate sphere, since, even were the Act exclusive within its field, many employers would be compelled to abide by state-imposed responsibilities lest a claim fall beyond the Act's scope.

Syllabus 
At respondent's nonjury trial for falsifying a federal income tax return by denying that he maintained a foreign bank account, respondent moved to suppress a loan guarantee agreement in which he pledged the funds in the bank account as security.  The District Court found respondent guilty on the basis of all the evidence, but then (1) found that the Government had discovered the guarantee agreement as the result of a flagrantly illegal search of a bank officer's briefcase, (2) suppressed all the Government's evidence except for respondent's tax return and related testimony, and (3) set aside the conviction for failure to demonstrate knowing falsification.  The court held, inter alia, that, although the illegal search did not violate respondent's Fourth Amendment rights, the inherent supervisory power of the federal courts required it to exclude evidence tainted by the illegal search.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Respondent lacks standing under the Fourth Amendment to suppress the documents illegally seized from the bank officer.  A defendant's Fourth Amendment rights are violated only when the challenged conduct invaded his legitimate expectation of privacy, rather than that of a third party, and respondent possessed no privacy interest in the documents seized in this case.  Cf. Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128; United States v. Miller, 425 U. S. 435.  Pp.  447 U. S. 731-733.
2. The supervisory power of the federal courts does not authorize a court to suppress otherwise admissible evidence on the ground that it was seized unlawfully from a third party not before the court.  Under the Fourth Amendment, the interest in deterring illegal searches does not justify the exclusion of tainted evidence at the instance of a party who was not the victim of the challenged practices.  And the values assigned to the competing interests of deterring illegal searches and of furnishing the trier of fact with all relevant evidence do not change because a court has elected to analyze the question under the supervisory power, instead of the Fourth Amendment.  Such power does not extend so far as to confer on the judiciary discretionary power to disregard

Syllabus 
Respondents were counsel for the plaintiffs in a civil rights class action in Federal District Court against petitioner alleging that its employment policies discriminated on the basis of race.  Because respondents failed to comply with orders relating to discovery and the filing of briefs, petitioner moved to dismiss the suit and requested an award of attorney's fees and court costs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37.  The District Court dismissed the action with prejudice and ordered respondents to pay petitioner's costs and attorney's fees for the entire lawsuit.  The court found justification for its ruling in the confluence of the civil rights statutes, 42 U.S.C.  1988, 2000e-5(k), which allow the prevailing party to recover attorney's fees ""as part of the costs"" of litigation, and 28 U.S.C.  1927, which permits a court to tax the excess ""costs"" of a proceeding against a lawyer ""who so multiplies the proceedings . . . as to increase costs unreasonably and vexatiously. . . .""  However, the Court of Appeals vacated and remanded, holding that respondents were not liable for attorney's fees and rejecting the view that the civil rights statutes could be read into  1927.
Held:
1. Title 28 U.S.C.  1927 cannot be read to support the sanction of taxing attorney's fees against counsel who unreasonably extend court proceedings, by defining the term ""costs"" therein according to the civil rights statutes as including attorney's fees.  Pp.  447 U. S. 757-763.
(a) It may be assumed that, when the first version of  1927 was enacted in 1813, Congress followed the ""American rule"" that attorney's fees ordinarily are not among the ""costs"" that a winning party may recover.  In an 1853 statute, Congress substantially reenacted the provisions now codified in  1927 as part of a uniform, comprehensive measure setting the fees and costs for all federal actions.  The history of the 1853 Act suggests that  1927 should be read together with the provisions currently codified in 28 U.S.C.  1920 which, without including attorney's fees, enumerate the costs that ordinarily may be taxed to a losing party.  Moreover, petitioner offered no evidence that Congress intended to incorporate into  1927 the attorney's fee provisions of 42 U.S.C.  1988, 2000e 5(k), which do not mention attorney liability for costs and fees.  Pp.  447 U. S. 759-761.

(b) The statutory interpretation proposed by petitioner could introduce into  1927 distinctions unrelated to its goal of controlling abuses of judicial processes.  The fee provisions of the civil rights laws are sensitive to the merits of the action and to antidiscrimination policy, restrict recovery to prevailing parties, and have been construed to treat plaintiffs and defendants somewhat differently.  In contrast,  1927 does not distinguish between winners and losers or between plaintiffs and defendants, and is indifferent to the equities of a dispute and to the values advanced by the substantive law.  Moreover, petitioner's statutory construction would create an unjustifiable two-tier system of attorney sanctions whereby lawyers in cases brought under statutes permitting the award of attorney's fees would face stiffer penalties for prolonging litigation than would other attorneys.  Pp.  447 U. S. 761-763.
2. Rule 37(b)'s sanctions for failure to comply with discovery orders, including holding parties and counsel personally liable for expenses, ""including attorney's fees,"" must be applied diligently both to penalize those whose conduct may be deemed to warrant such a sanction and to deter those who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent.  National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, 427 U. S. 639.  On remand, the District Court will have the authority to act upon petitioner's request for costs and attorney's fees under Rule 37(b).  Pp.  447 U. S. 763-764.
3. In narrowly defined circumstances, federal courts have inherent power to assess attorney's fees against counsel.  The general rule is that a litigant cannot recover his counsel fees, but that rule does not apply when the opposing party has acted in bad faith, including bad faith in the conduct of the litigation.  In view of a court's power over members of its bar, if it may tax counsel fees against a party who has litigated in bad faith, it certainly may assess those expenses against counsel who willfully abuse judicial processes.  In this case, the trial court did not make a specific finding as to whether counsel's conduct constituted or was tantamount to bad faith, a finding that should precede any sanction under the court's inherent powers.

No. 79-701

Decided June 23, 1980
447 U.S. 752

Syllabus 
Respondents were counsel for the plaintiffs in a civil rights class action in Federal District Court against petitioner alleging that its employment policies discriminated on the basis of race.  Because respondents failed to comply with orders relating to discovery and the filing of briefs, petitioner moved to dismiss the suit and requested an award of attorney's fees and court costs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37.  The District Court dismissed the action with prejudice and ordered respondents to pay petitioner's costs and attorney's fees for the entire lawsuit.  The court found justification for its ruling in the confluence of the civil rights statutes, 42 U.S.C.  1988, 2000e-5(k), which allow the prevailing party to recover attorney's fees ""as part of the costs"" of litigation, and 28 U.S.C.  1927, which permits a court to tax the excess ""costs"" of a proceeding against a lawyer ""who so multiplies the proceedings . . . as to increase costs unreasonably and vexatiously. . . .""  However, the Court of Appeals vacated and remanded, holding that respondents were not liable for attorney's fees and rejecting the view that the civil rights statutes could be read into  1927.
Held:
1. Title 28 U.S.C.  1927 cannot be read to support the sanction of taxing attorney's fees against counsel who unreasonably extend court proceedings, by defining the term ""costs"" therein according to the civil rights statutes as including attorney's fees.  Pp.  447 U. S. 757-763.
(a) It may be assumed that, when the first version of  1927 was enacted in 1813, Congress followed the ""American rule"" that attorney's fees ordinarily are not among the ""costs"" that a winning party may recover.  In an 1853 statute, Congress substantially reenacted the provisions now codified in  1927 as part of a uniform, comprehensive measure setting the fees and costs for all federal actions.  The history of the 1853 Act suggests that  1927 should be read together with the provisions currently codified in 28 U.S.C.  1920 which, without including attorney's fees, enumerate the costs that ordinarily may be taxed to a losing party.  Moreover, petitioner offered no evidence that Congress intended to incorporate into  1927 the attorney's fee provisions of 42 U.S.C.  1988, 2000e 5(k), which do not mention attorney liability for costs and fees.  Pp.  447 U. S. 759-761.

In contrast,  1927 does not distinguish between winners and losers or between plaintiffs and defendants, and is indifferent to the equities of a dispute and to the values advanced by the substantive law.

2.

No. 78-1318
Argued November 6, 1979
Decided June 23, 1980
447 U.S. 773

Syllabus 
After the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) and the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare (DPW) had revoked the authority of Town Court Nursing Center (a nursing home) to provide elderly residents of the home with nursing care at government expense under Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements, the home and several of its patients (respondents) brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that the patients were entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the revocation before the Medicaid payments were discontinued.  The District Court ultimately rejected this argument.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the patients had a constitutionally protected property interest in continued residence at the nursing home that gave them a right to a pretermination hearing on whether the home's Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements should be renewed.  In so holding, the court relied on three Medicaid provisions:  42 U.S.C.  1396a(a)(23) (1976 ed., Supp. II), which gives Medicaid recipients the right to obtain services from any qualified facility, a federal regulation prohibiting certified facilities from transferring or discharging a patient except for specified reasons, and a federal regulation prohibiting the reduction or termination of financial assistance without a hearing.
Held:  The patients have no interest in receiving benefits for care in a particular facility that entitles them, as a matter of constitutional law, to a hearing before HEW and DPW can decertify that facility.  Whatever legal rights the patients may have against the nursing home for failing to maintain its status as a qualified nursing home, the enforcement by HEW and DPW of their valid regulations did not directly affect the patients' legal rights or deprive them of any constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property.  Pp.  447 U. S. 784-790.
(a) Whether viewed singly or in combination, the Medicaid provisions relied upon by the Court of Appeals do not confer a right to continued residence in the nursing home of one's choice.  While 42 U.S.C.  1396a(a)(23) (1976 ed., Supp. II), by implication, gives recipients the right to be free from government interference with the choice to remain in a 
Page 447 U. S. 774
 home that continues to be qualified, it does not confer a right to continue to receive benefits for care in a home that has been decertified.  Although the regulations in question protect patients by limiting the circumstances under which a home may transfer or discharge a Medicaid recipient, they do not purport to limit the Government's right to make a transfer necessary by decertifying a facility.  And, since decertification does not reduce or terminate a patient's financial assistance, but merely requires him to use it for care at a different facility, regulations granting recipients the right to a hearing prior to a reduction in financial benefits are irrelevant.  Pp.  447 U. S. 785-786.
(b) This case does not involve the withdrawal of direct benefits.  Rather, it involves the Government's attempt to confer an indirect benefit on Medicaid patients by imposing and enforcing minimum standards of care on facilities like Town Court.  When enforcement of those standards requires decertification of a facility, there may be an immediate, adverse impact on some residents.  But that impact, which is an indirect and incidental result of the Government's enforcement action, does not amount to a deprivation of any interest in life, liberty, or property.  Pp.  447 U.

Syllabus 
Section 706(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Act) provides that, in the case of an alleged unlawful employment practice occurring in a State having a law prohibiting such practices, no charge may be ""filed"" with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) before the expiration of 60 days after proceedings have been commenced in the appropriate state agency unless such proceedings have been earlier terminated.  Section 706(e) requires that an unlawful employment practice charge be ""filed"" in such a State within 300 days after the alleged practice occurred or within 30 days after the aggrieved person receives notice that the state agency has terminated its proceedings, whichever is earlier.  Petitioner employer discharged respondent employee on August 29, 1975.  On June 15, 1976 -- 291 days later -- the EEOC received a letter from respondent claiming that petitioner had discriminated against him because of his religion, and this letter was promptly referred to the appropriate New York agency, which, in due course, determined that there was no merit to the charge.  Meanwhile, on August 20, 1976 -- more than 60 days after respondent's letter had been submitted to the EEOC and 357 days after respondent's discharge -- the EEOC notified petitioner that respondent had filed an employment discrimination charge.  About a year later, on August 24, 1977, the EEOC issued its determination that there was no reasonable cause to believe respondent's charge was true, and notified respondent that he had a statutory right to file a private action.  Respondent then commenced such an action 91 days later in Federal District Court.  Granting summary judgment for petitioner, the District Court held that  706(c) precluded any filing with the EEOC until a date 60 days after June 15, 1976, and, because that date was 51 days beyond  706(e)'s 300-day time limit for filing in so-called ""deferral States,"" the charge was not timely filed.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court's literal reading of the Act did not give sufficient weight to the Act's overriding purpose of insuring that employment discrimination is redressed, that it was necessary to conclude that a charge is ""filed"" for purposes of  706(e) when received, and ""filed"" as required by  706(c) when the state deferral period ends, and that therefore the letter received by the EEOC 
Page 447 U. S. 808
 on June 15, 1976, had been filed within 300 days as required by  706(e), but had not been filed during the 60-day deferral period for purposes of  706(c) .
Held:  A literal reading of  706(c) and(e) so as to give the word ""filed"" the same meaning in both subsections gives full effect to the several policies reflected in the Act.  Under this literal reading, respondent's charge was not timely filed, because it was ""filed"" on the 351st day (60 days after June 15, 1976, or the earliest date upon which the EEOC could allow the charge to be filed), by which time the applicable 300-day limitations period had run.  Pp.  447 U. S. 815-826.
(a) The Act's legislative history is entirely consistent with the wording of the Act itself, there being nothing to indicate that complainants in some States were to be allowed to proceed with less diligence than those in other States or to give deferral state complainants any advantage over nondeferral state complainants with respect to the time for filing unlawful employment practice charges.  Pp.  447 U. S. 818-824.
(b) A literal reading of the statute is not unfair to victims of employment discrimination who often proceed without the assistance of counsel.  P.  447 U. S. 825.
(c) There is no merit to respondent's argument based on the EEOC's interpretation, since that agency's interpretation cannot supersede the language chosen by Congress.  P.  447 U. S. 825.
(d) Nor is there any merit to the argument that a less literal reading of the statute allowing the EEOC to treat a letter received on the 291st day as ""filed,"" and interpreting  706(c)'s prohibition as merely requiring the EEOC to postpone any action on a charge for at least 60 days, would adequately effectuate the policy of deferring to state agencies.  Congress clearly intended to encourage the prompt processing of all employment discrimination charges.  To accept respondent's position would add a 60-day period to the schedule mandated by Congress, and would unreasonably give the word ""filed"" two different meanings in the same section of the Act.

Syllabus 
An Illinois statute generally prohibits picketing of residences or dwellings, but exempts from its prohibition peaceful picketing of a place of employment involved in a labor dispute.  Appellees were convicted in state court of violating this statute when they picketed the Mayor of Chicago's home in protest against his alleged failure to support the busing of schoolchildren to achieve racial integration.  Thereafter, appellees brought suit in Federal District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the statute is unconstitutional on its face and as applied, and an injunction prohibiting appellant and other state and local officials from enforcing the statute.  The District Court denied all relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the statute, both on its face and as applied to appellees, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:  The Illinois statute is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment since it makes an impermissible distinction between peaceful labor picketing and other peaceful picketing.  Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92.  Pp.  447 U. S. 459-471.
(a) In prohibiting peaceful picketing on the public streets and sidewalks in residential neighborhoods, the statute regulates expressive conduct that falls within the First Amendment's preserve, and, in exempting peaceful labor picketing from its general prohibition, the statute discriminates between lawful and unlawful conduct based upon the content of the demonstrator's communication.  On its face, the statute accords preferential treatment to the expression of views on one particular subject; information about labor disputes may be freely disseminated but discussion of all other issues is restricted.  The permissibility of residential picketing is thus dependent solely on the nature of the message being conveyed.  Pp.  447 U. S. 459-463.
(b) Standing alone, the State's asserted interest in promoting the privacy of the home is not sufficient to save the statute.  The statute makes no attempt to distinguish among various sorts of nonlabor picketing on the basis of the harms they would inflict on the privacy interest.  More fundamentally, the exclusion of labor picketing cannot be upheld as a means of protecting residential privacy for the simple reason that 
Page 447 U. S. 456

Syllabus 
An Illinois statute generally prohibits picketing of residences or dwellings, but exempts from its prohibition peaceful picketing of a place of employment involved in a labor dispute.  Appellees were convicted in state court of violating this statute when they picketed the Mayor of Chicago's home in protest against his alleged failure to support the busing of schoolchildren to achieve racial integration.  Thereafter, appellees brought suit in Federal District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the statute is unconstitutional on its face and as applied, and an injunction prohibiting appellant and other state and local officials from enforcing the statute.  The District Court denied all relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the statute, both on its face and as applied to appellees, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:  The Illinois statute is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment since it makes an impermissible distinction between peaceful labor picketing and other peaceful picketing.  Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92.  Pp.  447 U. S. 459-471.
(a) In prohibiting peaceful picketing on the public streets and sidewalks in residential neighborhoods, the statute regulates expressive conduct that falls within the First Amendment's preserve, and, in exempting peaceful labor picketing from its general prohibition, the statute discriminates between lawful and unlawful conduct based upon the content of the demonstrator's communication.  On its face, the statute accords preferential treatment to the expression of views on one particular subject; information about labor disputes may be freely disseminated but discussion of all other issues is restricted.  The permissibility of residential picketing is thus dependent solely on the nature of the message being conveyed.  Pp.  447 U. S. 459-463.
(b) Standing alone, the State's asserted interest in promoting the privacy of the home is not sufficient to save the statute.  The statute makes no attempt to distinguish among various sorts of nonlabor picketing on the basis of the harms they would inflict on the privacy interest.  More fundamentally, the exclusion of labor picketing cannot be upheld as a means of protecting residential privacy for the simple reason that 
Page 447 U. S. 456
 nothing in the content-based labor-nonlabor distinction has any bearing on privacy.  Pp.  447 U. S. 464-465.
(c) Similarly, the State's interest in providing special protection for labor protests cannot, without more, justify the labor picketing exemption.  Labor picketing is no more deserving of First Amendment protection than are public protests over other issues, particularly the important economic, social, and political subjects about which appellees wished to demonstrate.

This case presents the question whether Rules on Containers (Rules) in a collective bargaining agreement between the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and employer organizations in the shipping industry which were adopted in response to the technological innovation of containerized shipping are a lawful work preservation agreement.  The new technology involves the use on specially designed ships of large, reusable metal receptacles which can be moved on and off the vessel unopened and which can be attached to a truck chassis and transported intact to and from the pier, saving costs and time in loading and unloading ships and in warehousing cargo, as compared with the amount of on-pier work involved in handling loose cargo for conventional ships.  The amount of work available for longshoremen has been further reduced by the shipping companies' practice of making their containers available for loading (stuffing) and unloading (stripping) away from the pier by shippers and by freight consolidators who combine the goods of various shippers into a single shipment.  The Rules permit the great majority of containers to pass over the piers intact, reserving to the ILA the right to stuff and strip at the pier only those containers that would otherwise be stuffed or stripped ""locally"" (within a 50-mile radius of the port) by anyone except employees of the beneficial owner of the cargo, the shipping company being liable for specified liquidated damages for any container handled in violation of the Rules.  Separate unfair labor practice proceedings were brought before the National Labor Relations Board (Board) by truckers and consolidators who, because of the operation against shipping companies of the Rules' liquidated damages provisions, could no longer perform local stuffing and stripping services.  The Board concluded that the Rules were not valid work preservation clauses because the work of stuffing and stripping containers away from the pier had not traditionally been done by ILA members, but had instead been performed by employees of consolidators and truckers.  It therefore held that the Rules violated  8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, which makes unlawful those collective bargaining agreements whereby the employer agrees to cease doing business with any other person, and that union action to enforce 
Page 447 U. S. 491
 the Rules violated  8(b)(4)(b), which prohibits unions from engaging in secondary activities whose object is to force one employer to cease doing business with another.  The Court of Appeals, consolidating the cases and holding that the Board had erred as a matter of law in defining the work in controversy, vacated the Board's decisions, denied its applications for enforcement, and remanded the cases.
Held:  The Board's definition of the work in controversy in this dispute was erroneous as a matter of law.  Pp.  447 U. S. 503-513.
(a) To constitute a lawful work preservation agreement, the agreement must have as its objective the preservation of work traditionally performed by employees represented by the union, and the contracting employer must have the power to give the employees the work in question.  The first and most basic question is:  what is the ""work"" that the agreement allegedly seeks to preserve?  Cf. NLRB v. Pipefitters, 429 U. S. 507; National Woodwork Manufacturers Assn. v. NLRB, 386 U. S. 612.  Pp.  447 U. S. 504-505.
(b) Identification of the work at issue in a complex case of technological displacement requires a careful analysis of the traditional work patterns that the parties are allegedly seeking to preserve, and of how the agreement seeks to accomplish that result under the changed circumstances created by the technological advance.  The inquiry must focus on the bargaining unit employees' work, not on the work of other employees who may be doing the same or similar work, and must examine the relationship between the work as it existed before the innovation and as the agreement proposes to preserve it.  P.  447 U. S. 507.
(c) The Board's conclusion that the ""work in controversy"" was the off-pier stuffing and stripping of containers erroneously focused on the work done by the employees of truckers and consolidators after the introduction of containerized shipping.  That approach foreclosed, by definition, any possibility that the longshoremen could negotiate an agreement to permit them to play any part in the loading and unloading of containerized cargo.  The Board's determination that the traditional work of ILA members was to load and unload ships should have been only the beginning of the analysis.  The next step is to look at how the contracting parties sought to preserve that work, to the extent possible, in the face of a massive technological change that largely eliminated the need for cargo handling at intermediate stages of the intermodal transportation of goods, and to evaluate the relationship between traditional longshore work and the work which the Rules attempt to assign to ILA members.  Pp.  447 U. S. 507-510.
(d) Viewing the work allegedly to be preserved by the Rules from the proper perspective, the Board on remand will be free to determine 
Page 447 U. S. 492
 whether the Rules represent a lawful attempt to preserve traditional longshore work or whether, instead, they are tactically calculated to satisfy union goals elsewhere.  This determination must be informed by an awareness of the congressional preference for collective bargaining as the method for resolving disputes over dislocations caused by the introduction of technological innovations in the workplace, the question being not whether the Rules represent the most rational or efficient response to innovation, but whether they are a legally permissible effort to preserve jobs.  If the Board finds that the Rules have a lawful work preservation objective, it must then consider the charging parties' contention that members of the employer organization did not have the right to control the stuffing and stripping of containers.

Syllabus 
Held:  An order of appellee New York Public Service Commission that prohibits the inclusion by appellant (and other public utility companies) in monthly bills of inserts discussing controversial issues of public policy directly infringes the freedom of speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and thus is invalid.  Cf. First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765.  Pp.  447 U. S. 533-544.
(a) The restriction on bill inserts cannot be upheld on the ground that appellant, as a corporation, is not entitled to freedom of speech.
""The inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual.""
First National Bank of Boston v Bellotti, supra at  435 U. S. 777.  Pp.  447 U. S. 533-535.
(b) Nor is the state action here a valid time, place, or manner restriction.  While the validity of reasonable time, place, or manner regulations that serve a significant governmental interest and leave ample alternative channels for communication has been recognized, such regulations may not be based upon either the content or subject matter of speech.  Appellee here does not pretend that its action is unrelated to the content of bill inserts, inserts that present information to consumers on certain subjects, such as energy conservation measures, being allowed, but inserts that discuss public controversies being forbidden.  Pp.  447 U. S. 535-537.
(c) The prohibition against inserts is not a permissible subject matter regulation merely because it applies to all discussion of political controversies, whether pro or con.  The First Amendment's hostility to content-based regulation extends not only to restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic, and the regulation at issue here does not fall within the narrow exceptions to the general prohibition against subject matter distinctions.

(d) Furthermore, the state action here is not valid as a narrowly drawn prohibition serving a compelling state interest.  The prohibition 
Page 447 U. S. 531
 cannot be justified as being necessary to avoid forcing appellant's views on a captive audience, since customers may escape exposure to objectionable material simply by throwing the bill insert into a wastebasket.  Nor is the prohibition warranted as being necessary to allocate, in the public interest, the limited space in the billing envelope, there being nothing in the record to show that the bill inserts at issue would preclude the inclusion of other inserts that appellant might be ordered lawfully to include in the billing envelope.  Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, distinguished.  And the prohibition cannot be justified as being necessary to ensure that ratepayers do not subsidize the cost of the bill inserts, since there is no basis on the record to assume that appellee could not exclude the cost of the inserts from the utility's rate base.

No. 79-565

Decided June 20, 1980
447 U.S. 557

Syllabus 
Held:  A regulation of appellee New York Public Service Commission which completely bans an electric utility from advertising to promote the use of electricity violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  447 U. S. 561-572.
(a) Although the Constitution accords a lesser protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression, nevertheless the First Amendment protects commercial speech from unwarranted governmental regulation.  For commercial speech to come within the First Amendment, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.  Next, it must be determined whether the asserted governmental interest to be served by the restriction on commercial speech is substantial.  If both inquiries yield positive answers, it must then be decided whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.  Pp.  447 U. S. 561-566.
(b) In this case, it is not claimed that the expression at issue is either inaccurate or relates to unlawful activity.  Nor is appellant electrical utility's promotional advertising unprotected commercial speech merely because appellant holds a monopoly over the sale of electricity in its service area.  Since monopoly over the supply of a product provides no protection from competition with substitutes for that product, advertising by utilities is just as valuable to consumers as advertising by unregulated firms, and there is no indication that appellant's decision to advertise was not based on the belief that consumers were interested in the advertising.  Pp.  447 U. S. 566-568.
(c) The State's interest in energy conservation is clearly substantial, and is directly advanced by appellee's regulations.  The State's further interest in preventing inequities in appellant's rates -- based on the assertion that successful promotion of consumption in ""off-peak"" periods would create extra costs that would, because of appellant's rate structure, be borne by all consumers through higher overall rates -- is also substantial.  The latter interest does not, however, provide a constitutionally adequate reason for restricting protected speech because the link between the advertising prohibition and appellant's rate structure is, at most, tenuous.  Pp.  447 U. S. 568-569. 
Page 447 U. S. 558

(d) Appellee's regulation, which reaches all promotional advertising, regardless of the impact of the touted service on overall energy use, is more extensive than necessary to further the State's interest in energy conservation which, as important as it is, cannot justify suppressing information about electric devices or services that would cause no net increase in total energy use.  In addition, no showing has been made that a more limited restriction on the content of promotional advertising would not serve adequately the State's interests.  Pp.  447 U. S. 569-571.

Held:  A regulation of appellee New York Public Service Commission which completely bans an electric utility from advertising to promote the use of electricity violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  447 U. S. 561-572.
(a) Although the Constitution accords a lesser protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression, nevertheless the First Amendment protects commercial speech from unwarranted governmental regulation.  For commercial speech to come within the First Amendment, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.  Next, it must be determined whether the asserted governmental interest to be served by the restriction on commercial speech is substantial.  If both inquiries yield positive answers, it must then be decided whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.  Pp.  447 U. S. 561-566.
(b) In this case, it is not claimed that the expression at issue is either inaccurate or relates to unlawful activity.  Nor is appellant electrical utility's promotional advertising unprotected commercial speech merely because appellant holds a monopoly over the sale of electricity in its service area.  Since monopoly over the supply of a product provides no protection from competition with substitutes for that product, advertising by utilities is just as valuable to consumers as advertising by unregulated firms, and there is no indication that appellant's decision to advertise was not based on the belief that consumers were interested in the advertising.  Pp.  447 U. S. 566-568.
(c) The State's interest in energy conservation is clearly substantial, and is directly advanced by appellee's regulations.  The State's further interest in preventing inequities in appellant's rates -- based on the assertion that successful promotion of consumption in ""off-peak"" periods would create extra costs that would, because of appellant's rate structure, be borne by all consumers through higher overall rates -- is also substantial.  The latter interest does not, however, provide a constitutionally adequate reason for restricting protected speech because the link between the advertising prohibition and appellant's rate structure is, at most, tenuous.  Pp.  447 U. S. 568-569. 
Page 447 U. S. 558

(d) Appellee's regulation, which reaches all promotional advertising, regardless of the impact of the touted service on overall energy use, is more extensive than necessary to further the State's interest in energy conservation which, as important as it is, cannot justify suppressing information about electric devices or services that would cause no net increase in total energy use.  In addition, no showing has been made that a more limited restriction on the content of promotional advertising would not serve adequately the State's interests.  Pp.  447 U. S. 569-571.

Syllabus 
Safeco Title Insurance Co. does business with several title companies that derive over 90% of their gross incomes from the sale of Safeco insurance policies.  When contract negotiations between Safeco and respondent Union, the bargaining representative for certain Safeco employees, reached an impasse, the employees went on strike.  The Union picketed each of the title companies, urging customers to support the strike by canceling their Safeco policies.  Safeco and one of the title companies filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, charging that the Union had engaged in an unfair labor practice by picketing in order to promote a secondary boycott against the title companies.  The Board agreed and ordered the Union to cease picketing.  The Board held that the Union's secondary picketing violated  8(b)(4)(ii)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to coerce a person not party to a labor dispute with the object of ""forcing or requiring [him] to cease . . . dealing in the [primary] produc[t] . . . or to cease doing business with"" the primary employer.  The Court of Appeals set aside the Board's order.  Although the court held that the title companies were neutral parties entitled to the benefit of  8(b)(4)(ii)(B), it concluded that the Union's activity was lawful product picketing.
Held:
The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  447 U. S. 611-616;  447 U. S. 616-618;  447 U. S. 618-619.

MR. JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that respondent Union's secondary picketing violated  8(b)(4)(ii)(B).  NLRB v. Fruit Packers, 377 U. S. 58, distinguished.  Secondary product picketing, such as respondent Union conducted, that reasonably can be expected to threaten neutral parties with ruin or substantial loss does not square with  8(b)(4)(ii)(B)'s 
Page 447 U. S. 608
 language or purpose.  Since successful secondary picketing would put the title companies to a choice between their survival and the severance of their ties with Safeco, the picketing plainly violated the statutory ban on the coercion of neutral parties with the object of forcing them to cease dealing in the primary product or to cease doing business with the primary employer.  Pp.  447 U. S. 611-615.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE STEWART, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded in Part III that, as applied to picketing that predictably encourages consumers to boycott a secondary business,  8(b)(4)(ii)(B) imposes no unconstitutional restrictions upon speech protected by the First Amendment.  P.  447 U. S. 616.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in the result, expressed a reluctance to hold unconstitutional Congress' striking of the delicate balance between union freedom of expression and the ability of neutral employers, employees, and consumers to remain free from coerced participation in industrial strife.  Pp.  447 U. S. 616-618.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that the statute in question is consistent with the First Amendment because the restrictions on picketing it imposes are sufficiently justified by the purpose to avoid embroiling neutrals in a third party's labor dispute.  Pp.  447 U. S. 618-619.

No. 78-6621
Argued February 20, 1980
Decided June 20, 1980
447 U.S. 625

Syllabus 
Under Alabama law, felony murder is a lesser included offense of the capital crime of robbery-intentional killing.  Under the Alabama death penalty statute, the trial judge is prohibited from giving the jury the option of convicting the defendant of the lesser included offense; instead, the jury must either convict the defendant of the capital crime, in which case it must impose the death penalty, or acquit him.  If the defendant is convicted, the trial judge must hold a hearing to consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and may then refuse to impose the death sentence and instead sentence the defendant to life imprisonment.  Petitioner was convicted of robbery-intentional killing, and the jury accordingly imposed the death sentence, which the Alabama trial court refused to overturn.  At petitioner's trial, his own testimony established his participation in the robbery, but he denied killing, or any intent to kill, the victim.  Because of the statutory prohibition, the trial court did not instruct the jury as to the lesser included offense of felony murder.  The Alabama appellate courts upheld the conviction and death sentence, rejecting petitioner's constitutional attack on the statutory prohibition on lesser included offense instructions.
Held:  The death sentence may not constitutionally be imposed after a jury verdict of guilt of a capital offense where the jury was not permitted to consider a verdict of guilt of a lesser included offense.  Pp.  447 U. S. 633-646.
(a) Providing the jury with the ""third option"" of convicting on a lesser included offense ensures that the jury will accord the defendant the full benefit of the reasonable doubt standard.  This procedural safeguard is especially important in cases such as this one.  For when the evidence establishes that the defendant is guilty of a serious, violent offense but leaves some doubt as to an element justifying conviction of a capital offense, the failure to give the jury such a ""third option"" inevitably enhances the risk of an unwarranted conviction.  Such a risk cannot be tolerated in a case in which the defendant's life is at stake.  Pp.  447 U. S. 633-638.
(b) Alabama's argument that, in the context of an apparently mandatory death penalty statute, the preclusion of lesser included offense instructions heightens, rather than diminishes, the reliability of the guilt determination, must be rejected.  The unavailability of lesser included 
Page 447 U. S. 626
 offense instructions and the apparently mandatory nature of the death penalty both interject irrelevant considerations into the factfinding process, diverting the jury's attention from the central issue of whether the State has satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of a capital crime.  Thus, on the one hand, the unavailability of the ""third option"" may encourage the jury to convict for an impermissible reason -- its belief that the defendant is guilty of some serious crime and should be punished.  On the other hand, the apparently mandatory nature of the death penalty may encourage the jury to acquit for an equally impermissible reason -- that, whatever his crime, the defendant does not deserve death.  While, in any particular case, these two extraneous factors may favor the defendant or the prosecution or may cancel each other out, in every case, they introduce a level of uncertainty and unreliability into the factfinding process that cannot be tolerated in a capital case.  Pp.  447 U. S. 638-643.
(c) The jury's ""option"" of refusing to return any verdict at all, thus causing a mistrial, is not an adequate substitute for proper instructions on lesser included offenses.  Nor does the fact that the trial judge has the ultimate sentencing power compensate for the risk that the jury may return an improper verdict because of the unavailability of the ""third option.""  If the jury finds the defendant guilty only of a lesser included offense, the judge would not have the opportunity to impose the death sentence.  Moreover, the jury's verdict must have a tendency to motivate the judge to impose the same sentence that the jury did.  Under these circumstances, it cannot be presumed that a post-trial hearing will always correct whatever mistakes occurred in the performance of the jury's factfinding function.  Pp.  447 U. S. 643-646.

447 U.S. 649

Syllabus 
When an interstate shipment of several securely sealed packages containing 8-millimeter films depicting homosexual activities was mistakenly delivered by a private carrier to a third party rather than to the consignee, employees of the third party opened each of the packages, finding individual film boxes, on one side of which were suggestive drawings, and on the other were explicit descriptions of the contents.  One employee opened one or two of the boxes and attempted without success to view portions of the film by holding it up to the light.  After the Federal Bureau of Investigation was notified and picked up the packages, agents viewed the films with a projector without first making any effort to obtain a warrant or to communicate with the consignor or the consignee of the shipment.  Thereafter, petitioners were indicted on federal obscenity charges relating to the interstate transportation of certain of the films in the shipment, a motion to suppress and return the films was denied, and petitioners were convicted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, and rehearing was denied.
Held:  The judgments are reversed.  Pp.  447 U. S. 653-660;  447 U. S. 660-662.
Certiorari dismissed in part; 592 F.2d 788 and 597 F.2d 63, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concluded that, even though the nature of the contents of the films was indicated by descriptive material on their individual containers, the Government's unauthorized screening of the films constituted an unreasonable invasion of their owner's constitutionally protected interest in privacy.  It was a search; there was no warrant; the owner had not consented; and there were no exigent circumstances.  Cf. Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557,  394 U. S. 569 (STEWART, J., concurring in result).  Pp.  447 U. S. 653-660.
(a) The fact that FBI agents were lawfully in possession of the boxes of film did not give them authority to search their contents.  An officer's authority to possess a package is distinct from his authority to examine its contents, and when the contents of the package are books or other materials arguably protected by the First Amendment, and the basis 
Page 447 U. S. 650
 for the seizure is disapproval of the message contained therein, it is especially important that the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement be scrupulously observed.  Pp.  447 U. S. 654-655.
(b) Nor does the fact that the packages and one or more of the boxes had been opened by a private party before they were acquired by the FBI excuse the failure to obtain a search warrant.  Even though some circumstances -- for example, if the results of the private search are in plain view when materials are turned over to the Government -- may justify the Government's reexamination of the materials, the Government may not exceed the scope of the private search unless it has the right to make an independent search.  Here, the private party had not actually viewed the films, and prior to the Government screening one could only draw inferences about what was on the films.  Thus, the projection of the films was a significant expansion of the previous search by a private party, and therefore must be characterized as a separate search, which was not supported by any exigency or by a warrant even though one could have easily been obtained.  Pp.  447 U. S. 656-657.
(c) The fact that the cartons of film boxes, which cartons were securely wrapped and had no markings indicating the character of their contents, were unexpectedly opened by a third party before the shipment was delivered to its intended consignee, thus uncovering the descriptive labels on the film boxes, does not alter the consignor's legitimate expectation of privacy in the films.  The private search merely frustrated that expectation in part, and did not strip the remaining unfrustrated portion of that expectation of all Fourth Amendment protection.  Pp.  447 U. S. 658-659.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring in part and in the judgment, agreed that the Government's warrantless projection of the films constituted a search that infringed petitioners' Fourth Amendment interests even though the Government had acquired the films from a private party, but disagreed with the suggestion that it is an open question whether the Government's projection of the films would have infringed any Fourth Amendment interest if private parties had projected the films before turning them over to the Government.  The notion that private searches insulate from Fourth Amendment scrutiny subsequent governmental searches of the same or lesser scope is inconsistent with traditional Fourth Amendment principles, and even if the private parties in this action had projected the films before turning them over to the Government, the Government still would have been required to obtain a warrant for its subsequent screening of them.  Pp.  447 U. S. 660-662
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL concurred in the judgment.

(c) The fact that the cartons of film boxes, which cartons were securely wrapped and had no markings indicating the character of their contents, were unexpectedly opened by a third party before the shipment was delivered to its intended consignee, thus uncovering the descriptive labels on the film boxes, does not alter the consignor's legitimate expectation of privacy in the films.  The private search merely frustrated that expectation in part, and did not strip the remaining unfrustrated portion of that expectation of all Fourth Amendment protection.  Pp.  447 U. S. 658-659.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring in part and in the judgment, agreed that the Government's warrantless projection of the films constituted a search that infringed petitioners' Fourth Amendment interests even though the Government had acquired the films from a private party, but disagreed with the suggestion that it is an open question whether the Government's projection of the films would have infringed any Fourth Amendment interest if private parties had projected the films before turning them over to the Government.  The notion that private searches insulate from Fourth Amendment scrutiny subsequent governmental searches of the same or lesser scope is inconsistent with traditional Fourth Amendment principles, and even if the private parties in this action had projected the films before turning them over to the Government, the Government still would have been required to obtain a warrant for its subsequent screening of them.  Pp.  447 U. S. 660-662
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL concurred in the judgment.

Syllabus 
As the result of an accident in which an automobile driven by respondent struck and killed two children, respondent was convicted for failing to reduce speed to avoid the accident in violation of an Illinois statute.  Subsequently, based on the same accident, respondent was charged with involuntary manslaughter under another Illinois statute.  Ultimately, after the Illinois trial and intermediate appellate courts had held that the manslaughter prosecution was barred on statutory grounds, the Illinois Supreme Court held that it was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as applied to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the court reasoning that, because the lesser offense required no proof beyond that necessary for a conviction of the greater offense of involuntary manslaughter, the greater offense was the ""same"" as the lesser-included offense.
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not necessarily prohibit Illinois from prosecuting respondent for involuntary manslaughter.  Pp.  447 U. S. 415-421.
(a) Whether the offense of failing to reduce speed to avoid an accident is the ""same offense"" for double jeopardy purposes as the manslaughter charges, depends on whether each statute in question requires proof of a fact which the other does not.  Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299.  Pp.  447 U. S. 415-416.
(b) Thus, if manslaughter by automobile does not always entail proof of a failure to reduce speed, then the two offenses are not the ""same"" under the Blockburger test.  And the mere possibility that the State will seek to rely on all of the ingredients necessarily included in the traffic offense to establish an element of its manslaughter case would not be sufficient to bar the latter prosecution.  Pp.  447 U. S. 416-419.
(c) But if, as a matter of Illinois law, a careless failure to reduce speed is always a necessary element of manslaughter by automobile, then the two offenses are the ""same"" under Blockburger and respondent's trial on the latter charge would constitute double jeopardy.  Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161.  In any event, if in the pending manslaughter prosecution Illinois relies on and proves a failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident as the reckless act necessary to prove manslaughter, respondent would have a substantial claim of double jeopardy.  Pp.  447 U. S. 419-421. 
Page 447 U. S. 411

(d) Because the relationship under Illinois law between the crimes of involuntary manslaughter and a careless failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident is unclear, and because the reckless act or acts the State will rely on to prove manslaughter are still unknown, the Illinois Supreme Court's judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings.

Syllabus 
For more than 50 years, South Dakota has operated a cement plant that produced cement for both state residents and out-of-state buyers.  In 1978, because of a cement shortage, the State Cement Commission announced a policy to confine the sale of cement by the state plant to residents of the State.  This policy forced petitioner ready-mix concrete distributor, one of the out-of-state buyers, to cut its production severely.  Petitioner then brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging the policy.  The court granted injunctive relief on the ground that the policy violated the Commerce Clause.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the State had simply acted in a proprietary capacity.
Held:  South Dakota's resident-preference program for the sale of cement does not violate the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  447 U. S. 434-447.
(a) ""Nothing in the purposes animating the Commerce Clause prohibits a State, in the absence of congressional action, from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others.""  Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794,  426 U. S. 810.  Pp.  447 U. S. 434-436.
(b) The Commerce Clause responds principally to state taxes and regulatory measures impeding free private trade in the national marketplace, and there is no indication of a constitutional plan to limit the ability of the States themselves to operate freely in the free market.  Restraint in this area is also counseled by considerations of state sovereignty, each State's role as guardian and trustee for its people, and the recognized right of a trader to exercise discretion as to the parties with whom he will deal.  Moreover, state proprietary activities often are burdened with the same restrictions as private market participants.  And, as this case illustrates, the competing considerations in cases involving state proprietary action often will be subtle, complex, politically charged, and difficult to assess under traditional Commerce Clause analysis.  Given these factors, the adjustment of interests in this context is, as a rule, better suited for Congress than this Court.  Pp.  447 U. S. 436-439.
(c) The arguments for invalidating South Dakota's resident-preference program -- that the State, having long exploited the interstate market for cement, should not be permitted to withdraw from it when a shortage 
Page 447 U. S. 430
 arises; that the program responds solely to the nongovernmental objective of protectionism; that hoarding may have undesirable consequences; that the program places South Dakota suppliers of  ready-mix concrete at a competitive advantage in the out-of-state market; and that, if South Dakota had not acted, free market forces would have generated an appropriate level of supply at free market prices for all buyers in the region -- are weak, at best.  Whatever residual force inheres in them is more than offset by countervailing considerations of policy and fairness.  To invalidate the program would discourage similar state projects and rob South Dakota of the intended benefit of its foresight, risk, and industry.  Pp.  447 U. S. 440-447.

Syllabus 
After respondent was indicted for armed robbery of a bank, and while he was in jail pending trial, Government agents contacted an informant who was then an inmate confined in the same cellblock as respondent.  An agent instructed the informant to be alert to any statements made by federal prisoners but not to initiate conversations with or question respondent regarding the charges against him.  After the informant had been released from jail, he reported to the agent that he and respondent had engaged in conversation and that respondent made incriminating statements about the robbery.  The informant was paid for furnishing the information.  At respondent's trial, which resulted in a conviction, the informant testified about the incriminating statements that respondent had made to him.  Respondent moved to vacate his sentence on the ground that the introduction of the informant's testimony interfered with and violated his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel.  The District Court denied the motion, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Government's actions impaired respondent's Sixth Amendment rights under Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201.
Held:  Respondent's statements to the informant should not have been admitted at trial.  By intentionally creating a situation likely to induce respondent to make incriminating statements without the assistance of counsel, the Government violated respondent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  Under the facts -- particularly the facts that the informant was acting under instructions as a paid informant for the Government while ostensibly no more than a fellow inmate, and that respondent was in custody and under indictment at the time -- incriminating statements were ""deliberately elicited"" from respondent within the meaning of Massiah.  Since respondent was unaware that the informant was acting for the Government, he cannot be held to have waived his right to the assistance of counsel.  Pp.  447 U. S. 269-275.

Syllabus 
While petitioner's appeal from his felony conviction -- based on a nonunanimous six-person jury verdict -- was pending in the Louisiana Supreme Court, Burch v. Louisiana, 441 U. S. 130, was decided, holding unconstitutional those provisions of the Louisiana Constitution and Code of Criminal Procedure that sanctioned conviction of a nonpetty offense by a nonunanimous jury of six.  The Louisiana Supreme Court thereafter affirmed petitioner's conviction, holding that the rule of Burch v. Louisiana, supra, should not be applied retroactively to cases tried by juries empaneled prior to the date of that decision.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  447 U. S. 327-337; 337.
371 So.2d 746, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that the constitutional principle announced in Burch v. Louisiana, supra, that conviction of a nonpetty criminal offense in a state court by a nonunanimous six-person jury violates the accused's right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, should be given retroactive application.  Pp.  447 U. S. 327-337.
(a) The test for deciding whether a new constitutional doctrine should be applied retroactively contemplates the consideration of (i) the purpose to be served by the new doctrine; (ii) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards; and (iii) the impact on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.  Foremost among these factors is the first, and controlling significance will be given to factors (ii) and (iii) only when factor (i) does not clearly favor retroactivity or prospectivity.  Pp.  447 U. S. 327-329.
(b) Burch established that the concurrence of six jurors was constitutionally required to preserve the substance of the jury trial right and assure the reliability of the jury's verdict.  The Burch rule's purpose to eliminate a practice that threatened the jury's ability properly to perform its function of determining the truth in serious criminal cases clearly requires retroactive application.  Pp.  447 U. S. 330-334.
(c) Due regard for the State's good faith reliance on the old standards and the impact of retroactivity on the administration of justice does not

Syllabus 
While petitioner's appeal from his felony conviction -- based on a nonunanimous six-person jury verdict -- was pending in the Louisiana Supreme Court, Burch v. Louisiana, 441 U. S. 130, was decided, holding unconstitutional those provisions of the Louisiana Constitution and Code of Criminal Procedure that sanctioned conviction of a nonpetty offense by a nonunanimous jury of six.  The Louisiana Supreme Court thereafter affirmed petitioner's conviction, holding that the rule of Burch v. Louisiana, supra, should not be applied retroactively to cases tried by juries empaneled prior to the date of that decision.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  447 U. S. 327-337; 337.
371 So.2d 746, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that the constitutional principle announced in Burch v. Louisiana, supra, that conviction of a nonpetty criminal offense in a state court by a nonunanimous six-person jury violates the accused's right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, should be given retroactive application.  Pp.  447 U. S. 327-337.
(a) The test for deciding whether a new constitutional doctrine should be applied retroactively contemplates the consideration of (i) the purpose to be served by the new doctrine; (ii) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards; and (iii) the impact on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.  Foremost among these factors is the first, and controlling significance will be given to factors (ii) and (iii) only when factor (i) does not clearly favor retroactivity or prospectivity.  Pp.  447 U. S. 327-329.
(b) Burch established that the concurrence of six jurors was constitutionally required to preserve the substance of the jury trial right and assure the reliability of the jury's verdict.  The Burch rule's purpose to eliminate a practice that threatened the jury's ability properly to perform its function of determining the truth in serious criminal cases clearly requires retroactive application.  Pp.  447 U. S. 330-334.
(c) Due regard for the State's good faith reliance on the old standards and the impact of retroactivity on the administration of justice does not

Here, the element of justifiable reliance on pre-Burch standards is minimal, since, unlike other cases that have been accorded prospective effect only, Burch did not overrule any prior decisions of this Court or invalidate a practice of heretofore unquestioned legitimacy.

No. 76885
Argued March 26, 1980

447 U.S. 343

Syllabus 
Upon the conviction of petitioner, a twice previously convicted felon, in an Oklahoma trial court, the jury imposed a 40-year sentence pursuant to instructions to do so under a provision of the state habitual offender statute mandating such a sentence.  Thereafter, this provision was declared unconstitutional by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in another case, but that court nevertheless affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence, holding that he was not prejudiced by the impact of the invalid statute because his sentence was within the range of punishment that could have been imposed in any event.
Held:  The State deprived petitioner of due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Under Oklahoma statutes, a convicted defendant is entitled to have his punishment fixed by the jury, and the jury, if it had been correctly instructed, could have imposed any sentence of not less than 10 years.  Thus, the possibility that the jury would have returned a sentence of less than 40 years is substantial, and it is incorrect to say that petitioner could not have been prejudiced by the instruction requiring imposition of a 40-year prison sentence.  Petitioner's interest in the exercise of the jury's discretion in imposing punishment is not merely a matter of state procedural law, but is a liberty interest that the Fourteenth Amendment preserves against arbitrary deprivation by the State.  And the argument that, in view of the Court of Criminal Appeals' statutory authority to revise judgents on appeal, petitioner had no absolute right to a sentence imposed by a jury, is unpersuasive.  Pp.  447 U. S. 345-347.

Syllabus 
The principal question in this action is whether the general rule under federal reclamation laws limiting irrigation water deliveries from reclamation projects to 160 acres under single ownership applies to certain private lands in Imperial Valley, Cal., being irrigated with Colorado River water through the irrigation system constructed pursuant to the Boulder Canyon Project Act (Project Act).  When the Project Act became effective in 1929, a large acreage was already being irrigated by water delivered by the Imperial Irrigation District (District) through a privately owned irrigation system.  Under the Project Act and a 1932 implementing contract, the United States constructed and the District agreed to pay for a new irrigation system.  The Project Act, which implemented and ratified the seven-State Colorado River Compact (Compact) allocating the river's waters, provides in  6 that project works shall be used for ""irrigation and domestic uses and satisfaction of present perfected rights in pursuance of"" the Compact, and in  14 provides that the reclamation law ""shall govern the construction, operation, and management of the works herein authorized, except as otherwise herein provided.""  Section 46 of the Omnibus Adjustment Act of 1926 (1926 Act), a reclamation law, forbids delivery of reclamation project water to any irrigable land held in private ownership by one owner in excess of 160 acres.  In contracting with the District for the building of the new irrigation system, the United States represented that the Project Act did not impose acreage limitations on lands that already had vested or present rights to Colorado River waters, and the United States officially adhered to that position until repudiating it in 1964.  When the District refused to accept the Government's new position, the United States, in 1967, instituted the instant District Court proceedings for a declaratory judgment that the excess-acreage limitation of  46 of the 1926 Act applies to all private lands in the District, whether or not they had been irrigated in 1929.  Meanwhile, in original proceedings involving the determination of how the state-allocated waters under the 
Page 447 U. S. 353
 Compact and the Project Act should be divided, this Court recognized that a significant limitation on the power of the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) under the Project Act was the requirement that he satisfy present perfected rights, and defined such rights under  6 as those that had been acquired in accordance with state law and that had been perfected as of 1929 by the actual diversion of a specific quantity of water and its application to a defined area of land.  Arizona v. California, 373 U. S. 373 U.S. 546;  376 U. S. 376 U.S. 340.  And by a supplemental decree,  439 U. S. 439 U.S. 419, this Court adjudged the District to have a present perfected right to a specified quantity of diversions from the mainstream or the quantity of water necessary to irrigate a specified number of acres, whichever was less.  The District Court ruled against the Government in the instant action and, when the Government chose not to appeal, denied a motion to intervene for purpose of appeal that had been filed by respondents, a group of Imperial Valley residents who desired to purchase the excess lands that might become available at prices below the market value for irrigated land if  46 were held applicable.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the appealing intervenors had standing under Art. III and that the 160-acre limitation of  46 of the 1926 Act applied to Imperial Valley.
Held:
1. Since it is unlikely that any of the owners of excess lands would sell land at below current market prices absent the applicability of  46, whereas it is likely that such lands would become available at less than market prices if  46 were applied, the Court of Appeals properly concluded that respondents had a sufficient stake in the outcome of the controversy to afford them standing to appeal the District Court's decision, even though they could not with certainty establish that they would be able to purchase excess lands if  46 were held applicable.  Pp.  447 U. S. 366-368.
2. Contrary to the Court of Appeals' conclusion,  6 of the Project Act precludes application of the 160-acre limitation of  46 of the 1926 Act to the lands under irrigation in Imperial Valley in 1929.  Section 46 cannot be applied consistently with  6 on the alleged ground that the perfected rights in Imperial Valley were owned by the District, not individual landowners, who were merely members of a class for whose benefit the water rights had been acquired and held in trust, and who had no right under the law to a particular proportion of the District's water.  Such theory fails to take adequate account of  6 and its implementation in this Court's opinion and decrees in Arizona v. California, which recognized that  6 was an unavoidable limitation on the Secretary's power and that, in satisfying ""present perfected rights,"" the Secretary 
Page 447 U. S. 354
 must take account of state law.  Prior to 1929 and ever since, the District, in exercising its rights as trustee, delivered water to individual farmer beneficiaries without regard to the amount of land under single ownership, and, as a matter of state law, not only did the District's water right entitle it to deliver water to the farms in the District regardless of size, but also the right was equitably owned by the beneficiaries to whom the District was obligated to deliver water.  Pp. 36374.
3. There is nothing in the Project Act's legislative history to cast doubt on the foregoing construction of the Act or to suggest that Congress intended  14, by bringing the 1926 Act into play to interfere with the delivery of water to those lands already under irrigation in Imperial Valley and having present perfected rights that the Secretary was bound to recognize.  Moreover, the contemporary construction of the Project Act by the parties to the 1932 contract was that the acreage limitation did not apply to lands in the District presently being irrigated, and this contemporaneous view of the Act, which supports the foregoing construction of the legislation, was not officially repudiated by the Secretary until 1964.  Pp.  447 U. S. 374-378.
4. Further questions involving the applicability of acreage limitations to approximately 14,000 acres in addition to those that were under irrigation in 1929, and the determination whether a live dispute remains in light of the foregoing ""perfected rights"" holding, should be considered initially by the courts below.  Pp. 378-379.
559 F.2d 509, and 595 F.2d 524 and 525, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.

Section 406 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (Act) provides that
""[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this title is punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which may not exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy""
(the ""target offense"").  Petitioner and others were convicted of  violating  406 by conspiring to violate  401(a)(1) of the Act by knowingly manufacturing, distributing, and possessing a controlled substance.  In accordance with the provisions of  401(b)(1)(B) prescribing penalties for violations of  401(a)(1), petitioner was sentenced to a term of imprisonment, a fine, and a 5-year special parole term to be served upon completion of the term of imprisonment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction, and thereafter he filed an action under 28 U.S.C.  2255 to vacate his sentence, claiming that the sentence was unlawful because  406 does not authorize the imposition of a special parole term.  The District Court held that petitioner had been properly sentenced, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 406 of the Act does not authorize the imposition of a special parole term even though that sanction is included within the penalty provision of the target offense.  Pp.  447 U. S. 387-401.
(a) A ""plain meaning"" interpretation of the term ""imprisonment"" in  406 does not support the position that the term means a term of incarceration plus special parole made applicable by the target offense's penalty provisions.  Moreover, the structure of the Act read as a whole supports the conclusion that  406 defines the types of punishment authorized for conspirators -- imprisonment, fine, or both -- and sets maximum limits on those sanctions through reference to the penalty provisions of the target offense, but does not incorporate by reference any provisions for special parole.  Pp.  447 U. S. 388-390.
(b) Nor does the Act's legislative history demonstrate that Congress intended that the penalties authorized for substantive offenses, and those for conspiracies to commit them, were to be identical, thus authorizing 
Page 447 U. S. 382
 special parole terms for conspiracy convictions.  Instead, the history supports the view that  406 authorizes two types of sanctions -- fines and imprisonment -- and fixes the maximum amount of each that may be imposed by reference to the target offense's penalty provisions.  Pp.  447 U. S. 391-398.
(c) A reading of  406 to include the special parole provisions of target offenses cannot be supported on the ground that Congress' principal objective in enacting the Act's penalty provisions -- to deter professional criminals from engaging in drug trafficking for profit -- renders it unreasonable to ascribe to Congress the intent to authorize special parole for isolated substantive offenses while withholding this sentencing tool for conspiracies.  A comparison of those drug offenses for which Congress clearly authorized special parole terms with those for which it clearly did not does not reveal a coherent pattern based on the asserted justification for escalated sanctions.  Moreover, since  406 deals with both conspiracies and attempts, and prescribes an identical range of punishment for both, it is not surprising that Congress would provide for less stringent sanctions to be imposed for violations of  406 than for a completed substantive offense.

Syllabus 
At respondent's murder trial in a Michigan court resulting in his conviction, he was asked on cross-examination why he told the jury on direct examination a different story about stealing the murder victim's car than he had told the police officers following his arrest after being given Miranda warnings.  After his conviction was affirmed on appeal, respondent unsuccessfully sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the cross-examination violated due process under the rule of Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610.
Held:  The cross-examination did not violate due process. Doyle, which held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits impeachment on the basis of a defendant's silence following Miranda warnings, does not apply to cross-examination, such as occurred here, that merely inquires into prior inconsistent statements.  Such questioning makes no unfair use of silence, because a defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving Miranda warnings has not been induced to remain silent.
Certiorari granted; 610 F.2d 417, reversed.

No. 78-630
Argued October 9, 1979
Decided June 10, 1980*
447 U.S. 134

Syllabus 
These cases concern challenges of several Indian Tribes to efforts by the State of Washington to apply various state taxes and other laws to transactions and activities occurring on Indian reservations.  Washington imposes a cigarette excise tax on the ""sale, use, consumption, handling, possession or distribution"" of cigarettes within the State.  It also imposes a general retail sales tax on sales of personal property, including cigarettes.  The State sought to compel Indian retailers to collect both taxes with respect to sales of cigarettes to non-Indians, and the latter tax with respect to sales of other goods as well.  In addition, the State sought to apply its motor vehicle excise tax and mobile home, camper, and trailer taxes -- which are imposed for the privilege of using the covered vehicles in the State -- to vehicles owned by the Tribes or their members and used both on and off the reservation.  Finally, the State took steps to assume civil and criminal jurisdiction over the affected reservations.  The Indian Tribes involved in this litigation have each adopted ordinances imposing their own taxes upon on-reservation sales of cigarettes.  In actions brought in Federal District Court, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the state sales and cigarette taxes, and in particular against the State's seizure of untaxed cigarettes destined for delivery to the reservations, contending that those taxes could not lawfully be applied to tribal cigarette sales.  In addition, the Tribes challenged the State's efforts to apply its vehicle excise taxes to Indian-owned vehicles, and asserted that the State's assumption of jurisdiction was invalid.  The complaints alleged, inter alia, that the challenged taxes were contrary to the Indian Commerce Clause.  Because injunctive relief against enforcement of state statutes was sought, a three-judge District Court was convened pursuant to the then applicable requirement of 28 U.S.C.  2281 (1970 ed.) that an injunction restraining the enforcement of any state statute shall not be granted 
Page 447 U. S. 135
 by any district court upon the ground of the statute's unconstitutionality unless the application therefor is heard and determined by a three-judge court.  After a consolidated proceeding, the District Court held that (1) it had jurisdiction as a three-judge court; (2) the cigarette tax could not be applied to on-reservation transactions because it was preempted by the tribal taxing ordinance and constituted an impermissible interference with tribal self-government; (3) the retail sales tax could not be applied to tribal cigarette sales; (4) the State could not impose certain recordkeeping requirements on the Tribes in connection with various tax-exempt sales; (5) the vehicle excise taxes could not be imposed on vehicles owned by the Tribes and their members; and (6) the State's assumption of civil and criminal jurisdiction over certain of the Tribes was unconstitutional.  The court enjoined enforcement of the statutes it had invalidated, and the State moved unsuccessfully for a new trial.
Held:
1. The Tribes' Commerce Clause claims are not ""insubstantial,"" and are not rendered inescapably frivolous by the decisions in Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145, and McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S. 164, so as to defeat application of  2281.  In addition, the Tribes' attack on the official seizure of cigarettes bound for the reservations also triggers the three-judge requirement of  2281.  Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction over the appeals under 28 U.S.C.  1253, which authorizes a direct appeal to this Court from an order granting an injunction in a suit ""required by any Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges.""  Pp.  447 U. S. 145-149.
2. The State's motion for a new trial on issues other than the motor vehicle tax and assumption of jurisdiction issues rendered nonfinal the disposition of all issues between the parties, and thus the State's appeal from the District Court's resolution of those two issues was timely under 28 U.S.C.  2101(b), where it was filed within 60 days of the denial of the motion for a partial new trial but more than 60 days after the District Court's decision on those two issues.  Accordingly, the appeal from such decision is properly before this Court.  Pp.  447 U. S. 149-150.
3. The imposition of Washington's cigarette and sales taxes on on-reservation purchases by nonmembers of the Tribes is valid.  Pp.  447 U. S. 150-162.
(a) The Tribes have the power to impose their cigarette taxes on nontribal purchases, since the power to tax transactions occurring on trust lands and significantly involving a tribe or its members is a fundamental attribute of sovereignty which the tribes retain unless divested 
Page 447 U. S. 136
 of it by federal law or necessary implication of their dependent status.  Here, there is no federal statute showing any congressional departure from the view that tribes have such power, and tribal powers are not implicitly divested by virtue of the tribes' dependent status.  Pp.  447 U. S. 152-154.
(b) But the Tribes' involvement in the operation and taxation of cigarette marketing on the reservation does not oust the State from any power to exact its sales and cigarette taxes from nonmembers purchasing cigarettes at tribal smokeshops.  Principles of federal Indian law, whether stated in terms of preemption, tribal self-government, or otherwise, do not authorize Indian tribes to market an exemption from state taxation to persons who would normally do their business elsewhere.  Federal statutes, such as the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the Indian Financing Act of 1974, and the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, while evidencing a congressional concern with fostering tribal self-government and economic development, do not go so far as to grant tribal enterprises selling goods to nonmembers an artificial competitive advantage over all other businesses in a State.  Washington does not infringe the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them merely because the result of imposing taxes will be to deprive the Tribes of revenues which they currently are receiving.  Pp.  447 U. S. 154-157.
(c) The Indian Commerce Clause does not, of its own force, automatically bar all state taxation of matters significantly touching the political and economic interests of the Tribes.  That Clause may have a more limited role to play in preventing undue discrimination against, or burdens on, Indian commerce, but Washington's taxes are applied in a nondiscriminatory manner to all transactions within the State, and do not burden commerce that would exist on the reservations without respect to the tax exemption.  Although the result of these taxes will be to lessen or eliminate tribal commerce with nonmembers, that market existed in the first place only because of a claimed exemption for these very taxes.  Such taxes do not burden commerce that would exist on the reservations without respect to the tax exemption.  P.  447 U. S. 157.
(d) The Tribes failed to show that business at the smokeshops would be significantly reduced by a state tax without a credit as compared to a state tax with a credit.  Pp.  447 U. S. 157-158.
(e) There is no direct conflict between the state taxes and the Tribes' cigarette ordinances so as to warrant invalidation of the state taxes on grounds of preemption or violation of the principle of tribal self-government.  Pp.  447 U. S. 158-159.
(f) The State may validly require, as a minimal burden, the tribal smokeshops to affix tax stamps purchased from the State to individual 
Page 447 U. S. 137
 packages of cigarettes prior to the time of sale to nonmembers of the Tribe.  Cf. Moe v. Salish & Kootenai Tribes, 425 U. S. 463.  P.  447 U. S. 159.
(g) The State's recordkeeping requirements are valid in toto.  The Tribes failed to demonstrate that such requirements for exempt sales are not reasonably necessary as a means of preventing fraudulent transactions.  Pp.  447 U. S. 159-160.
(h) The State's interest in taxing nontribal purchasers outweighs any tribal interest that may exist in preventing the State from imposing its taxes.  Pp.  447 U. S. 160-161.
(i) The State's interest in enforcing its taxes is sufficient to justify its seizure of unstamped cigarettes as contraband if the Tribes do not cooperate in collecting the taxes.  Pp.  447 U. S. 161-162.
4. The motor vehicle and mobile home, camper, and trailer taxes cannot properly be imposed upon vehicles owned by the Tribes or their members and used both on and off the reservations.  Moe, supra.  Pp.  447 U. S. 162-164.
5. The District Court erred in holding that the State's assumption of civil and criminal jurisdiction over the Makah and Lummi Reservations was unlawful.  Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation, 439 U. S. 463, controlling.  P.  447 U. S. 164.

Argued February 27, 1980
Decided June 10, 1980
447 U.S. 191

Syllabus 
The Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (Act) provides that any person who leaves a permanent job to enter the military, satisfactorily completes military service, and applies for re-employment within 90 days of being discharged from the military must be reinstated to the former job ""without loss of seniority,"" 38 U.S.C.  2021(b)(1).  Upon being honorably discharged from military service, petitioner made timely application for reinstatement with respondent, his former employer.  Because respondent was then in the process of laying off employees, petitioner was reinstated in layoff status.  While laid off, he received weekly payments under the supplemental unemployment benefits (SUB) plan created by the applicable steel industry collective bargaining agreement.  Under the plan, an employee is entitled to receive SUB payments only if he has completed two years of continuous service prior to being laid off, and the amount of the weekly benefit is determined by his hourly wage rate, the number of his dependents, the amount of state unemployment compensation he is receiving, and the level of funding remaining in the plan.  The length of time during which an employee receives SUB payments is determined by the number of credit units he has accumulated before being laid off, with one-half credit being accrued for each week in which he worked ""any"" hours, or was paid for ""any"" hours not worked (such as for vacation or jury duty), or lost ""any"" hours because he was performing certain union duties or was on disability leave.  The plan also provides that, if an employee enters the Armed Services, only the credit units credited to him at the time of his entry into the service shall be credited to him upon reinstatement as an employee with unbroken continuous service, except as may otherwise be required by law.  Petitioner received SUB payments for only 25 weeks, whereas, if he had been employed by respondent during his period of military service, he would have been entitled to 52 weeks of payments.  Alleging that respondent violated his statutory reemployment rights by refusing to consider his military service time in computing the amount of SUB payments to which he was entitled, petitioner, represented by the Department of Justice pursuant to the Act, filed an action 
Page 447 U. S. 192
 in Federal District Court, which ultimately held that SUB payments were not a perquisite of seniority entitled to statutory protection.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  SUB payments provided pursuant to the steel industry collective bargaining agreement are perquisites of seniority to which a returning veteran is entitled under the Act.  Pp.  447 U. S. 195-206.
(a) Under the Act, which is to be liberally construed for the returning veteran's benefit, the veteran steps back on the seniority escalator at the precise point he would have occupied had he kept his position with his employer continuously during the period of military service.  Cf. Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U. S. 275.  In determining whether a particular benefit qualifies as a perquisite of seniority under the Act, first, there must be a reasonable certainty that the benefit would have accrued if the employee had not gone into the military service, and, second, the ""real nature"" of the benefit must be ""a reward for length of service,"" rather than ""a form of short-term compensation for services rendered.""  Alabama Power Co. v. Davis, 431 U. S. 581,  431 U. S. 589.  Pp.  447 U. S. 195-198.

No. 79-81

447 U.S. 191

Syllabus 
The Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (Act) provides that any person who leaves a permanent job to enter the military, satisfactorily completes military service, and applies for re-employment within 90 days of being discharged from the military must be reinstated to the former job ""without loss of seniority,"" 38 U.S.C.  2021(b)(1).  Upon being honorably discharged from military service, petitioner made timely application for reinstatement with respondent, his former employer.  Because respondent was then in the process of laying off employees, petitioner was reinstated in layoff status.  While laid off, he received weekly payments under the supplemental unemployment benefits (SUB) plan created by the applicable steel industry collective bargaining agreement.  Under the plan, an employee is entitled to receive SUB payments only if he has completed two years of continuous service prior to being laid off, and the amount of the weekly benefit is determined by his hourly wage rate, the number of his dependents, the amount of state unemployment compensation he is receiving, and the level of funding remaining in the plan.  The length of time during which an employee receives SUB payments is determined by the number of credit units he has accumulated before being laid off, with one-half credit being accrued for each week in which he worked ""any"" hours, or was paid for ""any"" hours not worked (such as for vacation or jury duty), or lost ""any"" hours because he was performing certain union duties or was on disability leave.  The plan also provides that, if an employee enters the Armed Services, only the credit units credited to him at the time of his entry into the service shall be credited to him upon reinstatement as an employee with unbroken continuous service, except as may otherwise be required by law.  Petitioner received SUB payments for only 25 weeks, whereas, if he had been employed by respondent during his period of military service, he would have been entitled to 52 weeks of payments.  Alleging that respondent violated his statutory reemployment rights by refusing to consider his military service time in computing the amount of SUB payments to which he was entitled, petitioner, represented by the Department of Justice pursuant to the Act, filed an action 
Page 447 U. S. 192
 in Federal District Court, which ultimately held that SUB payments were not a perquisite of seniority entitled to statutory protection.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  SUB payments provided pursuant to the steel industry collective bargaining agreement are perquisites of seniority to which a returning veteran is entitled under the Act.  Pp.  447 U. S. 195-206.
(a) Under the Act, which is to be liberally construed for the returning veteran's benefit, the veteran steps back on the seniority escalator at the precise point he would have occupied had he kept his position with his employer continuously during the period of military service.  Cf. Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U. S. 275.  In determining whether a particular benefit qualifies as a perquisite of seniority under the Act, first, there must be a reasonable certainty that the benefit would have accrued if the employee had not gone into the military service, and, second, the ""real nature"" of the benefit must be ""a reward for length of service,"" rather than ""a form of short-term compensation for services rendered.""  Alabama Power Co. v. Davis, 431 U. S. 581,  431 U. S. 589.  Pp.  447 U. S. 195-198.
(b) The SUB plan satisfies the reasonable certainty prong of the Alabama Power test, since, if petitioner had remained continuously employed by respondent instead of entering the military, he would have accumulated credits from the date he was hired until the date he was laid off.  The plan also satisfies the second prong of the test, because supplemental unemployment benefits are not a form of deferred short-term compensation, but are a reward for length of service closely analogous to traditional forms of seniority.

447 U.S. 207

Syllabus 
Appellant, a vertically integrated petroleum company doing business in several States, was organized, during the years in question in this case, into three levels of management, one of which was responsible for directing the operating activities of the company's functional departments.  Transfers of products and supplies among the three major functional departments -- Exploration and Production, Refining, and Marketing -- were theoretically based on competitive wholesale prices.  Appellant had no exploration and production or refining operations in Wisconsin and carried out only marketing in that State.  During the years in question, appellant filed income tax returns in Wisconsin using a separate geographical system of accounting which reflected only the Wisconsin marketing operations and showed a loss for each year, thus resulting in no taxes being due, but appellee Wisconsin Department of Revenue, upon auditing the returns, assessed taxes, based on appellant's total income, pursuant to Wisconsin's tax apportionment statute.  Ultimately, after appellant's application for abatement had proceeded through administrative and judicial review, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that appellant's Wisconsin marketing operations were an integral part of one unitary business, and that therefore its total corporate income was subject to the statutory apportionment formula.  The court further held that situs income derived from crude oil produced by appellant outside Wisconsin and transferred to its own refineries, and thus part of the unitary stream of income, was apportionable under the Wisconsin statute despite appellant's separate functional accounting system, and that taxation of such situs income did not impermissibly burden interstate commerce.
Held:
1. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not prevent Wisconsin from applying its statutory apportionment formula to appellant's total income.  Pp.  447 U. S. 219-225.
(a) The Due Process Clause imposes two requirements for state taxation of the income of a corporation operating in interstate commerce:  a ""minimal connection"" or ""nexus"" between the corporation's interstate activities and the taxing State, and ""a rational relationship between the 
Page 447 U. S. 208
 income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise.""  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S. 425,  445 U. S. 436-437.  Such a nexus is established if the corporation ""avails itself of the substantial privilege of carrying on business' within the State.""  Id. at  445 U. S. 437.  Here, appellant concededly avails itself of that privilege through its marketing operations within Wisconsin.  Pp.  447 U. S. 219-220.
(b) Appellant's use of separate functional accounting by which it shows what portion of its income is derived from exploration and production and from refining -- functions occurring outside Wisconsin -- does not demonstrate that application of the Wisconsin apportionment statute violated the Due Process Clause.  A company's internal accounting techniques are not binding on a State for tax purposes, and are not required to be accepted as a matter of constitutional law for such purposes.  Pp.  447 U. S. 220-223.
(c) The ""linchpin of apportionability"" for state income taxation of an interstate enterprise is the ""unitary business principle.""  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, supra at  445 U. S. 439.  If a company is a unitary business, then a State may apply an apportionment formula to the taxpayer's total income in order to obtain a ""rough approximation"" of the corporate income that is ""reasonably related to the activities conducted within the taxing State.""  Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267,  437 U. S. 273.  Here, the evidence fully supports the conclusion that appellant's marketing operations in Wisconsin were an integral part of such a unitary business.  And appellant's use of separate functional accounting, and its decision for purposes of corporate accountability to assign wholesale market values to interdepartmental transfers of products and supplies, do not defeat the clear and sufficient nexus between appellant's interstate activities and the taxing State.  Pp.  447 U. S. 223-225.
2. Similarly, the Due Process Clause did not preclude Wisconsin from subjecting to taxation under its statutory apportionment formula appellant's income derived from extraction of oil and gas located outside the State which was used by the Refining Department, and the State was not required to allocate such income to the situs State.  There was a unitary stream of income, of which the income derived from internal transfers of raw materials from exploration and production to refining was a part.  This was a sufficient nexus to satisfy the Due Process Clause, and there was also the necessary ""rational relationship"" between the income attributed to the State by the apportionment formula and the intrastate value of the business.  Pp.  447 U. S. 225-227.
3. The Commerce Clause did not require Wisconsin to allocate all income derived from appellant's exploration and production function to the situs State, rather than include such income in the apportionment 
Page 447 U. S. 209
 formula.  The Wisconsin taxing statute, as applied, did not subject interstate business to an unfair burden of multiple taxation.  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, supra.  The State sought to tax income, not property ownership, and it was the risk of multiple taxation that was being asserted, actual multiple taxation not having been shown.  The Commerce Clause did not require that any income which appellant was able to separate through accounting methods and attribute to exploration and production of crude oil and gas be allocated to the States in which those production centers were located.  The geographic location of such raw materials did not alter the fact that such income was part of the unitary business of appellant's interstate enterprise and was subject to fair apportionment among all States to which there was a sufficient nexus with the interstate activities.  Pp.  447 U. S. 227-230.
90 Wis.2d 700, 281 N.W.2d 94, affirmed.

447 U.S. 231

Syllabus 
At his trial in a Michigan state court for first-degree murder, petitioner testified that he acted in self-defense.  On cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned petitioner about the fact that he was not apprehended until he surrendered to governmental authorities about two weeks after the killing, and, in closing argument, again referred to petitioner's prearrest silence, thereby attempting to impeach petitioner's credibility by suggesting that he would have spoken out if he had killed in self-defense.  Petitioner was convicted of manslaughter, and, after his conviction was affirmed in the state courts, he sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, contending that his constitutional rights were violated when the prosecutor questioned him concerning prearrest silence.  The District Court denied relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The Fifth Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, is not violated by the use of prearrest silence to impeach a criminal defendant's credibility.  While the Fifth Amendment prevents the prosecution from commenting on the silence of a defendant who asserts the right to remain silent during his criminal trial, it is not violated when a defendant who testifies in his own defense is impeached with his prior silence.  Impeachment follows the defendant's own decision to cast aside his cloak of silence and advances the truthfinding function of the criminal trial.  Cf. Raffel v. United States, 271 U. S. 494; Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222; Brown v. United States, 356 U. S. 148.  Pp.  447 U. S. 235-238.
2. Nor does the use of prearrest silence to impeach a defendant's credibility deny him the fundamental fairness guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Common law traditionally has allowed witnesses to be impeached by their previous failure to state a fact in circumstances in which that fact naturally would have been asserted.  And each jurisdiction may formulate its own rules of evidence to determine when prior silence is so inconsistent with present statements that impeachment by reference to such silence is probative.  In this case, in which no governmental action induced petitioner to remain silent before arrest, Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610, is inapplicable.  Pp.  447 U. S. 238-240. 
Page 447 U. S. 232

3. A state court is not required to allow impeachment through the use of prearrest silence.  Each jurisdiction is free to formulate evidentiary rules defining the situations in which silence is viewed a more probative than prejudicial.  Pp.  447 U. S. 240-241.

Syllabus 
After appellants had acquired five acres of unimproved land in appellee city for residential development, the city was required by California law to prepare a general plan governing land use and the development of open-space land.  In response, the city adopted zoning ordinances that placed appellants' property in a zone in which property may be devoted to one-family dwellings, accessory buildings, and open-space uses, with density restrictions permitting appellants to build between one and five single-family residences on their tract.  Without having sought approval for development of their tract under the ordinances, appellants brought suit against the city in state court, alleging that the city had taken their property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the zoning ordinances were facially unconstitutional.  The city's demurrer claiming that the complaint failed to state a cause of action was sustained by the trial court, and the California Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The zoning ordinances, on their face, do not take appellants' property without just compensation.  Pp.  447 U. S. 260-263.
(a) The ordinances substantially advance the legitimate governmental goal of discouraging premature and unnecessary conversion of open-space land to urban uses and are proper exercises of the city's police power to protect its residents from the ill effects of urbanization.  Pp.  447 U. S. 261-262.

(c) Although the ordinances limit development, they neither prevent the best use of appellants' land nor extinguish a fundamental attribute of ownership.  Since, at this juncture, appellants are free to pursue their reasonable investment expectations by submitting a development plan to the city, it cannot be said that the impact of the ordinances has denied them the ""justice and fairness"" guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

Syllabus 
The issue presented at this stage of this original action is whether -- for purposes of determining California's ownership under the Submerged Lands Act of submerged lands and natural resources lying within three geographical miles seaward of the California coastline -- the coastline follows the mean lower low-water line along the natural shore, or whether it follows the seaward edge of 15 piers and the Rincon Island complex projecting into the sea from the shore.  Rincon Island, a privately owned artificial ""island"" used to service offshore oil facilities, is erected upon foundations resting on the ocean floor, has a dock on the seaward side, and is connected to the mainland by a causeway structure under which water flows freely.  Neither the causeway nor the island have had any noticeable effect on the shoreline, and the complex is not a coast protective work.  The piers in question, some of which are privately owned and some of which are operated by the State as docking facilities or for recreational purposes, are all attached to the mainland; water flows freely underneath each; they have no effect on the shoreline, and are not coast protective works.  The Special Master concluded that the piers and the Rincon Island complex do not constitute extensions of the coast, and that the coastline follows the natural coast in the vicinity of these structures.  California filed an exception to the Master's report.
Held:   The Special Master's conclusion is proper.  Under the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, which is used for guidance

			"|"United States v. California, 447 U.S. 1 (1980)
No. 5, Orig.
Argued March 17, 1980
Decided June 9, 1980
447 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
The issue presented at this stage of this original action is whether -- for purposes of determining California's ownership under the Submerged Lands Act of submerged lands and natural resources lying within three geographical miles seaward of the California coastline -- the coastline follows the mean lower low-water line along the natural shore, or whether it follows the seaward edge of 15 piers and the Rincon Island complex projecting into the sea from the shore.  Rincon Island, a privately owned artificial ""island"" used to service offshore oil facilities, is erected upon foundations resting on the ocean floor, has a dock on the seaward side, and is connected to the mainland by a causeway structure under which water flows freely.  Neither the causeway nor the island have had any noticeable effect on the shoreline, and the complex is not a coast protective work.  The piers in question, some of which are privately owned and some of which are operated by the State as docking facilities or for recreational purposes, are all attached to the mainland; water flows freely underneath each; they have no effect on the shoreline, and are not coast protective works.  The Special Master concluded that the piers and the Rincon Island complex do not constitute extensions of the coast, and that the coastline follows the natural coast in the vicinity of these structures.  California filed an exception to the Master's report.
Held:   The Special Master's conclusion is proper.  Under the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, which is used for guidance 
Page 447 U. S. 2
 in defining ""coastline"" for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act, the general rule expressed in Art. 3 therein is that the
""normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal State.""
Although the type of construction of the open piers involved here, being elevated above the ocean's surface on pilings, does not, without more, require a determination adverse to California, the absence of a ""lower low-water line"" deprives them of a ""normal baseline,"" and precludes them from falling within the ambit of Art. 3.

447 U.S. 10

Syllabus 
Petitioner was indicted for, inter alia, aiding and abetting a named Internal Revenue Service agent in accepting unlawful compensation, in violation of 26 U.S.C.  7214(a)(2) and 18 U.S.C.  2, which provides that whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.  Prior to the indictment, the IRS agent was acquitted of certain of the  7214(a)(2) violations which petitioner was accused of aiding and abetting.  Petitioner moved to dismiss his indictment as to aiding and abetting these violations on the ground that, since the agent had been acquitted of such violations, petitioner could not be convicted of aiding and abetting them.  The District Court denied the motion, and after trial petitioner was convicted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  A defendant accused of aiding and abetting in the commission of a federal offense may properly be convicted despite the prior acquittal of the alleged actual perpetrator of the offense.  Pp.  447 U. S. 14-26.
(a) Read against its common law background, 18 U.S.C.  2 evinces a clear congressional intent to permit such a conviction.  The section gives general effect to what had always been the common law rule for second-degree principals (principals who were actually or constructively present at the scene of the crime and aided and abetted its commission) and for all misdemeanants.  The legislative history of  2 confirms this understanding.  With the enactment of  2, all participants in conduct violating a federal criminal statute are ""principals,"" and, as such, they are punishable for their criminal conduct, the fate of other participants being irrelevant.  Pp.  447 U. S. 15-20.
(b) The Government is not barred, under the doctrine of nonmutual collateral estoppel, from relitigating the issue of whether the IRS agent accepted unlawful compensation.  Application of that doctrine is not appropriate here.  In a criminal case, the Government is often without the kind of ""full and fair opportunity to litigate"" that is a prerequisite of estoppel.  The application of collateral estoppel in criminal cases is also complicated by rules of evidence and exclusion unique to criminal law.  Finally, in this case the important federal interest in the enforcement

Syllabus 
A Florida statute ( 659.141(1)) prohibits out-of-state banks, bank holding companies, and trust companies from owning or controlling a business within the State that sells investment advisory services.  Another statute ( 660.10) prohibits all corporations except state-chartered banks and trust companies and national banks located in Florida from performing certain trust and fiduciary functions.  Appellee out-of-state bank holding company's proposal to operate appellee investment management subsidiary in Florida was rejected by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the ground that it was prohibited by  659.141(1).  Appellees then brought suit in Federal District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging, inter alia, that  659.141(1) violates the Commerce Clause and that the joint operation of that section with  660.10 constitutes a similar violation, since, but for the existence of such statutes, authority would be sought to establish a subsidiary trust company in Florida.  The District Court held that the statutes violate the Commerce Clause, because in combination they discriminate against out-of-state bank holding companies and are ""parochial legislation"" that ""must be deemed per se unconstitutional.""  The court also held that the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 does not foster or permit the types of discrimination against out-of-state bank holding companies reflected in the Florida statutes.  The court granted declaratory relief against both statutes, but enjoined only the enforcement of  659.141(1).
Held:
1. Section 659.141(1) directly burdens interstate commerce in a manner that contravenes the Commerce Clause's implicit limitation on state power.  Pp.  447 U. S. 37-49.
(a) While banking and related financial activities are of profound local concern, it does not follow that these same activities lack important interstate attributes that establish Congress' power to regulate commerce and that also support constitutional limitations on the powers of the States.  Such limitations clearly apply in this case.  Pp.  447 U. S. 38-39. 
Page 447 U. S. 28

(b) The District Court properly concluded that  659.141(1) is ""parochial"" in the sense that it overtly prevents foreign enterprises from competing in local markets.  Under that section, discrimination against affected business organizations is not evenhanded, because only banks, bank holding companies, and trust companies with principal operations outside Florida are prohibited from operating investment subsidiaries or giving investment advice within the State.  It follows that  659.141(1) discriminates among affected business entities according to the extent of their contacts with the local economy.  Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, 437 U. S. 117, distinguished.  And the disparate treatment of out-of-state bank holding companies cannot be justified as an incidental burden necessitated by legitimate local concerns, such as discouraging economic concentration or protecting the citizenry against fraud, or by an asserted interest in promoting local control over financial institutions.  Pp.  447 U. S. 39-44.
(c) Neither  3(d) of the Bank Holding Company Act -- which prohibits bank holding companies from acquiring banking subsidiaries in other States without local authorization -- nor  7 of that Act -- which reserves to the States a general power to enact regulations applicable to bank holding companies -- authorizes a State to prohibit out-of-state holding companies from acquiring local investment subsidiaries.  The only authority  3(d) grants to the States is the authority to permit expansion of banking across state lines where it would be otherwise federally prohibited.  Moreover, the Act's structure reveals that  3(d) applies only to holding company acquisitions of banks.  Section 7 was intended to preserve existing state regulations of bank holding companies and to define the extent of the Act's preemptive effect on state law, and there is nothing in  7's language or legislative history to indicate that it was also intended to extend to the States new powers to regulate banking that they would not have possessed absent federal legislation.  Section 7 applies only to state legislation that operates within the boundaries marked by the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  447 U. S. 44-49.
2. Since the constitutionality of  660.10 was neither fully placed in issue nor fully determined by the District Court's decision, the validity of that section's limitation on the types of corporations that may perform trust responsibilities is not properly before this Court at this stage of the proceedings; hence, the District Court's judgment with respect to  660.10 is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.  Moreover, the amendment, in the interim, of  3(d) of the Bank Holding Company Act so as apparently to prohibit appellee bank holding company from establishing a Florida trust subsidiary raises new jurisdictional 
Page 447 U. S. 29
 and substantive questions that should be addressed in the first instance by the District Court.  Pp.  447 U. S. 50-53.

Syllabus 
Section 706(k) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that in ""any action or proceeding under this title"" the court may allow attorney's fees to ""the prevailing party,"" other than the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the United States.  Alleging that petitioners had denied her employment because of her race, respondent filed an employment discrimination charge with the EEOC, which, as required by Title VII, forwarded the complaint to the appropriate New York administrative agency.  Respondent was represented by counsel throughout administrative and judicial proceedings in the state system, which proceedings ultimately resulted in affirmance of the state agency's order directing petitioners to offer respondent employment and pay back wages, but not awarding attorney's fees.  Meanwhile, the EEOC reassumed jurisdiction and, under  706(f) of Title VII, issued a right-to-sue letter to respondent, who filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging a claim under Title VII, inter alia, and seeking appropriate relief, including attorney's fees.  Petitioners having agreed to comply with the state agency's order, the District Court dismissed the federal action, except for respondent's request for attorney's fees, including fees for her attorney's services in the state proceedings.  The court later denied the fee request, ruling that, although the EEOC's issuance of a right-to-sue letter had forced respondent to preserve her rights by filing a complaint in federal court, the mere filing of a federal suit did not entitle an aggrieved party to attorney's fees, and that respondent had the option of pursuing her state administrative remedies without incurring any expenses for legal services, since state law provides that the case in support of the complaint is to be presented to the administrative hearing examiner by one of the state agency's attorneys.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Sections 706(f) and 706(k) of Title VII authorize a federal court action to recover an award of attorney's fees for work done by the prevailing complainant in state administrative and judicial proceedings to which the complainant was referred pursuant to the provisions of Title VII, and no special circumstances exist in this case that would justify denial of a fee award.  Pp.  447 U. S. 60-71. 
Page 447 U. S. 55

(a) Congress' use of the broadly inclusive disjunctive phrase ""any action or proceeding"" in  706(k) indicates an intent to subject the losing party to an award of attorney's fees and costs that includes expenses incurred for administrative proceedings.  Other provisions of the statute that interact with  706(k), the purpose of  706(k) to facilitate the bringing of discrimination complaints, the humanitarian remedial policies of Title VII, and the statute's structure of cooperation between federal and state enforcement authorities -- calling for deferral to state proceedings, with proceedings before the EEOC and in federal courts being supplements to available state remedies -- all point to the conclusion that fee awards are authorized for work done in state administrative or judicial proceedings as, well as in federal proceedings.  Since Congress intended to authorize fee awards for work done in administrative proceedings,  706(f)(1)'s authorization of a civil suit in federal court encompasses a suit solely to obtain an award of attorney's fees for legal work done in state or local proceedings.  Pp.  447 U. S. 666.
(b) Awarding fees for work done in state proceedings for which the State does not authorize fees does not infringe on the State's powers under the Tenth Amendment, since Congress' power under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment is broad, and overrides any interest the State might have in not authorizing awards for fees.  Nor is there any merit in the argument that Congress' intent to preempt the state law has not been clearly expressed.  Section 706(k) does not ""preempt"" state law, since  706(f)(1) merely provides a supplemental right to sue in federal court if satisfactory relief is not obtained in state forums, and one aspect of complete relief is an award of attorney's fees, which Congress considered necessary for the fulfillment of federal goals.  And even if it can be said that  706(k) preempts the state rule, Congress' intent to achieve this result is manifest.  Furthermore, the availability under New York law of an agency attorney to present the case in support of the complaint at the public hearing is not a ""special circumstance"" depriving a prevailing complainant of a fee award, since a private attorney is needed to assist the complainant during administrative procedures before and after the public hearing stage, and even if an agency attorney appears at the public hearing, he does not represent the complainant's interests, but rather those of the State.

No. 79-289
Argued March 18, 1980
Decided June 9, 1980
447 U.S. 74

Syllabus 
Soon after appellees had begun soliciting in appellant privately owned shopping center's central courtyard for signatures from passersby for petitions in opposition to a United Nations resolution, a security guard informed appellees that they would have to leave because their activity violated shopping center regulations prohibiting any visitor or tenant from engaging in any publicly expressive activity that is not directly related to the center's commercial purposes.  Appellees immediately left the premises and later filed suit in a California state court to enjoin the shopping center and its owner (also an appellant) from denying appellees access to the center for the purpose of circulating their petitions.  The trial court held that appellees were not entitled under either the Federal or California Constitution to exercise their asserted rights on the shopping center property, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed.  The California Supreme Court reversed, holding that the California Constitution protects speech and petitioning, reasonably exercised, in shopping centers even when the center is privately owned, and that such result does not infringe appellants' property rights protected by the Federal Constitution.
Held:
1. This case is properly before this Court as an appeal under 28 U.S.C.  1257(2).  A state constitutional provision is a ""statute"" within the meaning of  1257(2), and in deciding that the State Constitution gave appellees the right to solicit signatures on appellants' property, the California Supreme Court rejected appellants' claim that recognition of such a right violated their ""right to exclude others,"" a fundamental component of their federally protected property rights.  Pp.  447 U. S. 79-80.
2. State constitutional provisions, as construed to permit individuals reasonably to exercise free speech and petition rights on the property of a privately owned shopping center to which the public is invited, do not violate the shopping center owner's property rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments or his free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  447 U. S. 88.
(a) The reasoning in Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 -- which 
Page 447 U. S. 75
 held that the First Amendment does not prevent a private shopping center owner from prohibiting the distribution on center premises of handbills unrelated to the center's operations -- does not ex proprio vigore limit a State's authority to exercise its police power or its sovereign right to adopt in its own constitution individual liberties more expansive than those conferred by the Federal Constitution.  And a State, in the exercise of its police power, may adopt reasonable restrictions on private property so long as the restrictions do not amount to a taking without just compensation or contravene any other federal constitutional provision.  Pp.  447 U. S. 80-81.
(b) The requirement that appellants permit appellees to exercise state-protected rights of free expression and petition on shopping center property does not amount to an unconstitutional infringement of appellants' property rights under the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment, appellants having failed to demonstrate that the ""right to exclude others"" is so essential to the use or economic value of their property that the state-authorized limitation of it amounted to a ""taking.""  Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S. 164, distinguished.  And there is no merit to appellants' argument that they have been denied property without due process of law, where they have failed to show that the due process test whereby the challenged law must not be unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious and the means selected must have a real and substantial relation to the objective to be obtained, is not satisfied by the State's asserted interest in promoting more expansive rights of free speech and petition than conferred by the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  447 U. S. 82-85.
(c) Nor have appellants' First Amendment rights been infringed by the California Supreme Court's decision.  The shopping center, by choice of its owner, is not limited to the personal use of appellants, and the views expressed by members of the public in passing out pamphlets or seeking signatures for a petition thus will not likely be identified with those of the owner.  Furthermore, no specific message is dictated by the State to be displayed on appellants' property, and appellants are free to publicly dissociate themselves from the views of the speakers or handbillers.

Argued April 14, 1980

447 U.S. 102

Syllabus 
Section 6(b)(1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) requires that, at least 30 days prior to the ""public disclosure of any information"" pertaining to a consumer product obtained by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission) pursuant to its information-gathering authority, the Commission must notify the manufacturer and provide it with a summary of the information to be disclosed, if the product is to be designated or described in such a way as to permit the public to ascertain readily the manufacturer's identity; that the manufacturer be given a reasonable opportunity to submit comments regarding the information; and that the Commission ""take reasonable steps to assure"" that such information is ""accurate"" and that disclosure is ""fair in the circumstances and reasonably related to effectuating the purposes"" of the CPSA.  In the instant case, the Commission, upon receiving Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and without complying with  6(b)(1), decided to release certain accident reports that it had obtained from respondent manufacturers and that were accompanied, for the most part, by claims of confidentiality.  The District Court permanently enjoined the Commission from disclosing the materials, rejecting its contention that  6(b)(1) applies only when the Commission affirmatively undertakes to disclose information to the public, but not when it merely complies with a request for information under the FOIA.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held. Section 6(b)(1) governs the disclosure of records by the Commission pursuant to a request under the FOIA.  Pp.  447 U. S. 108-124.
(a) Nothing in  6(b)(1)'s language, or in any other provision of the CPSA, supports the claim that  6(b)(1) is limited to disclosures initiated by the Commission, a disclosure pursuant to the FOIA being accurately characterized as a ""public disclosure"" within the plain meaning of  6(b)(1).  Moreover,  6(b)(2), which contains specific exceptions to  6(b)(1)'s requirements, does not include the disclosure of information in response to an FOIA request.  And  25(c) of the CPSA -- designating certain reports as ""public information"" notwithstanding that they might be exempted from disclosure under the FOIA, 
Page 447 U. S. 103
 and thus within the scope of  6(a)(1), which incorporates by reference the exemptions of the FOIA -- specifically makes the disclosure of the information subject to the limitations of  6(b) whether it be ""affirmatively"" released by the Commission or released pursuant to an FOIA request.  Pp.  447 U. S. 108-110.
(b) Neither the legislative history of the CPSA prior to its enactment nor subsequent legislative and administrative interpretations of  6(b)(1) warrant construing  6(b)(1) as being limited to the Commission's ""affirmative"" disclosures.  Pp.  447 U. S. 110-120.
(c) Applicability of  6(b)(1) to FOIA requests is not precluded on the alleged ground that the Commission would be unable to comply with FOIA time requirements for handling disclosure requests and administrative appeals from refusals to disclose.  Such an argument assumes that the Commission must comply with FOIA time limitations, but its Exemption 3 states that the FOIA does not apply to matters that are specifically exempted from disclosure by another statute which requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or which establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.  Here,  6(b)(1) sets forth sufficiently definite standards to fall within the scope of Exemption 3.  Pp.  447 U. S. 121-123.
(d) The argument that requiring the Commission to comply with  6(b)(1) in meeting FOIA requests will impose insurmountable burdens on the agency is entirely speculative.  Moreover, any increased burdens imposed on the Commission were intended by Congress in striking an appropriate balance between the interests of consumers and the need for fairness and accuracy with respect to information disclosed by the Commission, and thus the claim of undue burdens is properly addressed to Congress, not this Court.  Pp.  447 U. S. 123-124.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 9, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Connecticut. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 The Due Process Clause forbids the use for impeachment purposes of evidence that a defendant remained silent after receiving the Miranda warnings at the time of his arrest. Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976). At petitioner's criminal trial, the prosecutor repeatedly brought before the jury the fact that petitioner had not furnished police officers with his alibi at the time of his arrest. Respondent concedes, and the Supreme Court of Connecticut agreed, that such use of petitioner's post-arrest silence violated petitioner's constitutional rights. Nevertheless, the court sustained the conviction, over Justice Bogdanski's dissent, on the ground that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. I share Justice Bogdanski's "" unreasonable"" belief that the violation of petitioner's rights was not constitutionally harmless. A finding of harmless error on this record, in my view, can be nothing other than a means of avoiding the requirements of the Constitution in order to sustain the conviction of a defendant the court believed was factually guilty. 
Page 447 U.S. 912 , 913
 Petitioner's defense was that he was in the company of his wife and was nowhere near the scene of the alleged crimes at the time they were committed. Petitioner's wife testified to that effect, and petitioner's testimony corroborated hers. On cross-examination, the prosecutor repeatedly forced petitioner to admit that he had not given his story to the police after receiving Miranda warnings. The cross-examination which the Connecticut Supreme Court held to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt was as follows: 
 ""Q. Did you ever recall telling the police officer that you had gone to court in Stamford on June 8th [the date of the alleged offense]? 
 ""A. Yes. 
 * * * * * 
 ""Q. Did you ever tell the police officer on June 15th [the date petitioner was arrested] that you were home from 6:45 to 8:55 in the morning?

 ""Q. Did you tell them that you were wearing red pants, red T- shirt and blue jacket, white, red and blue sneakers, at 6:15 on June-

No. 78-1815
Argued January 15, 1980
Decided June 2, 1980
446 U.S. 657

Syllabus 
The general mining law of 1872 permits citizens to explore the public domain and search for minerals and, if they discover ""valuable mineral deposits,"" to obtain title to the land on which such deposits are located.  The Mineral Leasing Act (Act), enacted in 1920, withdrew oil shale from the general mining law and provided that thereafter oil shale would be subject to disposition only through leases, except that a savings clause preserved valid claims existent at the date of passage of the Act.  Upon complaints by the Department of the Interior (Department) alleging that respondents' claims for oil shale deposits located prior to the Act were invalid, a hearing examiner ruled the claims valid on the ground that the Department's 1927 decision in Freeman v. Summers, 52 L.D. 201, wherein it was held that ""present marketability"" is not a prerequisite to the patentability of oil shale deposits as ""valuable mineral deposits,"" compelled the conclusion that oil shale is a valuable mineral subject to appropriation under the mining laws, despite substantial evidence that oil shale operations were commercially infeasible.  The Board of Land Appeals reversed, holding that oil shale claims located prior to 1920 failed the test of value because, at the time of location, there did not appear as a present fact a reasonable prospect of success in developing an operating mine that would yield a reasonable profit.  It rejected prior departmental precedent, particularly Freeman v. Summers, as being inconsistent with the general mining law, and therefore unsound.  On appeal, the District Court reversed and held the claims valid, finding that Congress had implicitly ""ratified"" the rule of Freeman v. Summers, and that, in any event, the Department was estopped from departing from the longstanding Freeman standard.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The oil shale deposits in question are ""valuable mineral deposits"" patentable under the Act's savings clause.  The Act's history and the developments subsequent to its passage indicate that the Government should not be permitted to invalidate pre-1920 oil shale claims by imposing a present marketability requirement on such claims.  The Department's original position, as set forth in Instructions, issued shortly after the Act became law, authorizing the General Land Office 
Page 446 U. S. 658
 to begin adjudicating applications for patents for pre-1920 oil shale claims, and later enunciated in Freeman v. Summers, is the correct view of the Act as it applies to the patentability of pre-1920 oil shale claims.  Pp.  446 U. S. 663-673.

The general mining law of 1872 permits citizens to explore the public domain and search for minerals and, if they discover ""valuable mineral deposits,"" to obtain title to the land on which such deposits are located.  The Mineral Leasing Act (Act), enacted in 1920, withdrew oil shale from the general mining law and provided that thereafter oil shale would be subject to disposition only through leases, except that a savings clause preserved valid claims existent at the date of passage of the Act.  Upon complaints by the Department of the Interior (Department) alleging that respondents' claims for oil shale deposits located prior to the Act were invalid, a hearing examiner ruled the claims valid on the ground that the Department's 1927 decision in Freeman v. Summers, 52 L.D. 201, wherein it was held that ""present marketability"" is not a prerequisite to the patentability of oil shale deposits as ""valuable mineral deposits,"" compelled the conclusion that oil shale is a valuable mineral subject to appropriation under the mining laws, despite substantial evidence that oil shale operations were commercially infeasible.  The Board of Land Appeals reversed, holding that oil shale claims located prior to 1920 failed the test of value because, at the time of location, there did not appear as a present fact a reasonable prospect of success in developing an operating mine that would yield a reasonable profit.  It rejected prior departmental precedent, particularly Freeman v. Summers, as being inconsistent with the general mining law, and therefore unsound.  On appeal, the District Court reversed and held the claims valid, finding that Congress had implicitly ""ratified"" the rule of Freeman v. Summers, and that, in any event, the Department was estopped from departing from the longstanding Freeman standard.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The oil shale deposits in question are ""valuable mineral deposits"" patentable under the Act's savings clause.  The Act's history and the developments subsequent to its passage indicate that the Government should not be permitted to invalidate pre-1920 oil shale claims by imposing a present marketability requirement on such claims.  The Department's original position, as set forth in Instructions, issued shortly after the Act became law, authorizing the General Land Office 
Page 446 U. S. 658
 to begin adjudicating applications for patents for pre-1920 oil shale claims, and later enunciated in Freeman v. Summers, is the correct view of the Act as it applies to the patentability of pre-1920 oil shale claims.  Pp.  446 U. S. 663-673.

Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) makes it unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any security ""(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, or (2) to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact . . or (3) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.""  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act) makes it unlawful to use, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security, ""any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance"" in violation of such regulations as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may prescribe, and Rule 10b-5 was promulgated to implement this section.  Section 20(b) of the 1933 Act and  21(d) of the 1934 Act authorize the SEC to seek injunctive relief against violations of the respective Acts, and further provide that, ""upon a proper showing,"" a district court shall grant the injunction.  Pursuant to  20(b) and 21(d), the SEC filed a complaint in a District Court against petitioner, a managerial employee of a broker-dealer, alleging that he had violated, and aided and abetted violations of,  17(a) of the 1933 Act,  10(b) of the 1934 Act, and SEC Rule 10b, in connection with his firm's sales campaign for certain securities.  Concluding that there was scienter on petitioner's part, the District Court found that he had committed and aided and abetted the violations as alleged.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, declining to decide whether petitioner's conduct would support a finding of scienter and holding instead that, when the SEC is seeking injunctive relief, proof of negligence alone will suffice.
Held:  The SEC is required to establish scienter as an element of a civil enforcement action to enjoin violations of  10(b) of the 1934 Act, Rule 105, and  17(a)(1) of the 1933 Act, but need not establish scienter as an element of an action to enjoin violations of  17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the 1933 Act.

Syllabus 
Appellant Virginia Supreme Court, which claims inherent authority to regulate and discipline attorneys, also has statutory authority to do so.  Pursuant to these powers, the court promulgated the Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility (Code) and organized the Virginia State Bar to act as an administrative agency of the court to report and investigate violations of the Code.  The statute reserves to the state courts the sole power to adjudicate alleged violations of the Code, and the Supreme Court and other state courts of record have independent authority on their own to initiate proceedings against attorneys.  When one of the appellees sought to prepare a legal services directory, the attorneys who were canvassed refused to supply the requested information for fear of violating the Code's prohibition against attorney advertising (DR 2-102(A)(6)).  Appellees then brought an action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against, inter alios, the Virginia Supreme Court and its chief justice (also an appellant) in both his individual and official capacities, seeking a declaration that the defendants had violated appellees' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to gather, publish, and receive factual information concerning the attorneys involved, and a permanent injunction against the enforcement and operation of DR 2-102(A)(6).  Ultimately, after the Virginia Supreme Court declined to amend DR 2-102(A)(6) despite the State Bar's recommendation to do so and despite the intervening decision in Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U. S. 350, holding that enforcement of a ban on attorney advertising would violate the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of attorneys seeking to advertise fees charged for certain routine legal services, the District Court declared DR 2-102(A)(6) unconstitutional on its face and permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing it.  The court further held that the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, which provides that, in any action to enforce 42 U.S.C.  1983, inter alia, a district court, in its discretion, may award the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs, authorized in proper circumstances 
Page 446 U. S. 720
 the award of fees against the Virginia Supreme Court and the chief justice in his official capacity, and that here such an award was not unjust because the Supreme Court had denied the State Bar's petition to amend the Code and had also failed to amend it to conform to the holding in Bates, supra.
Held:
1. In promulgating the Code, the Virginia Supreme Court acts in a legislative capacity, and in that capacity the court and its members are immune from suit.  Pp.  446 U. S. 731-734.
2. But the court and its chief justice were properly held liable in their enforcement capacities.  Since the state statute gives the court independent authority on its own to initiate proceedings against attorneys, the court and its members were proper defendants in a suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, just as other enforcement officers and agencies are.  Pp.  446 U. S. 734-737.
3. The District Court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees against the Virginia Supreme Court premised on acts or omissions for which appellants enjoy absolute legislative immunity.  There is nothing in the legislative history of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act to suggest that Congress intended to permit an award of attorney's fees to be premised on acts for which defendants would enjoy absolute immunity.

Syllabus 
An Oklahoma statute provides that an action shall not be deemed to be ""commenced"" for purposes of the statute of limitations until service of summons on the defendant, but further provides ( 97) that, if the complaint is filed within the limitations period, the action is deemed to have commenced from the date of that filing if the plaintiff serves the defendant within 60 days, even though such service occurs outside the limitations period.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 3 provides that a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint.  In this case, petitioner's personal injury action, based on diversity of citizenship, was brought against respondent m Federal District Court in Oklahoma, and, although the complaint was filed within Oklahoma's 2-year statute of limitations, service on respondent was not effectuated until after the 2-year limitation period and the 60-day service period specified in  97 had expired.  The District Court dismissed the complaint as barred by the Oklahoma statute of limitations, holding that  97 was an integral part of such statute and that, therefore, under Ragan v. Merchants Transfer & Warehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530, state law, not Rule 3, applied.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The action is barred by the Oklahoma statute of limitations.  Ragan, supra.  Pp.  446 U. S. 744-753.
(a) The scope of Rule 3 is not sufficiently broad to control the issue before the District Court.  Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, distinguished.  There is no indication that the Rule was intended to toll a state statute of limitations, much less that it purported to displace state tolling rules for purposes of state statutes of limitations.  In diversity actions, Rule 3 governs the date from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules begin to run, but does not affect state statutes of limitations.  Pp.  446 U. S. 748-751.
(b) In contrast to Rule 3, the Oklahoma statute is a statement of a substantive decision by that State that actual service on, and accordingly actual notice to, the defendant is an integral part of the policies (establishment of a deadline after which the defendant may legitimately have peace of mind, and recognition that, after a certain period of time, it is unfair to require the defendant to attempt to piece together his defense to an old claim) served by the statute of limitations.

The Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 (Act) permits the award of a reasonable attorney's fee to the ""prevailing party"" as part of the taxable costs in a suit brought under any of several specified civil rights statutes.  Respondents brought suit under certain of those statutes, alleging that their constitutional rights had been violated by petitioners, and seeking damages.  The District Court directed verdicts for petitioners, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial, and also awarded to respondents their costs on appeal, including attorney's fees which it believed to he authorized by the Act.
Held:  Respondents were not ""prevailing"" parties in the sense intended by the Act.  While Congress contemplated the award of fees pendente lite in some cases, it intended to permit such an interlocutory award only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims, either in the trial court or on appeal.  Respondents have not prevailed on the merits of any of their claims, since the Court of Appeals held only that they were entitled to a trial of their cause.  Nor may they fairly be said to have ""prevailed"" by reason of the Court of Appeals' other interlocutory dispositions that affected only the extent of discovery, since such determinations might affect the disposition on the merits, but were themselves not matters on which a party could ""prevail"" for purposes of shifting his counsel fees to the opposing party under the Act.

Nor may they fairly be said to have ""prevailed"" by reason of the Court of Appeals' other interlocutory dispositions that affected only the extent of discovery, since such determinations might affect the disposition on the merits, but were themselves not matters on which a party could ""prevail"" for purposes of shifting his counsel fees to the opposing party under the Act.
Certiorari granted in part; 60 F.2d 600, reversed in part."|

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 2, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, an inmate at the Stateville Correctional Center in Joliet, Ill., filed pro se a civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging that the defendants he named (the warden and three officers of the prison guard) had deprived him of his constitutional rights by failing to afford him appropriate medical treatment for glaucoma, a sight- threatening eye condition. According to appointed counsel's statement of the case, petitioner's condition, while made known to the prison authorities at the beginning of his incarceration, did not receive the attention of an eye doctor during his first four months at Stateville, and he was denied the medication that eventually was prescribed for him until he was hospitalized some eight months after entering the prison. Pet. for Cert. 2. After being released from the hospital, petitioner continually had to prod the guards to give him his medicine, and they sometimes denied it to him. His eyes were permanently injured. Ibid. 
 The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois initially granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on all of petitioner's claims. Although granting leave to proceed in forma pauperis, that court failed to act upon petitioner's motion, under 28 U.S. C. 1915(d), for the appointment of counsel. [Footnote 1] The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, after appointing counsel 
Page 446 U.S. 989 , 990
 to represent petitioner on appeal, reversed the District Court's judgment in part, remanding the case for further proceedings on petitioner's claim that respondents intentionally had deprived him of medication. 
 On remand, petitioner again moved the District Court for the appointment of counsel, and, unlike the Court of Appeals, the District Court denied his motion. Petitioner presented his own case in a 4-day jury trial. At the conclusion of his presentation of evidence, the District Court granted directed verdicts in favor of the warden and two of the guards, who evidently had little responsibility for petitioner's treatment on a day-to-day basis. Petitioner based his case against the fourth defendant, Lt. James L. Rickman, on allegations that this officer had sometimes denied petitioner medication on weekends. The case was submitted to the jury but they were unable to reach a verdict. Following a second trial, during which petitioner again represented himself, the jury found for Rickman. 
 Petitioner appealed a second time, and the Court of Appeals again appointed counsel to represent him. Petitioner argued that the District Court's failure to appoint counsel to represent him at trial had been an abuse of discretion and reversible error because his claim in fact was colorable (as evidenced by the Court of Appeals' earlier reversal of the District Court's entry of summary judgment), because the trial issues were factually and legally complex, because the constitutional right at stake was serious, and because the presence of counsel would have substantially aided petitioner in presenting his case. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, holding, in an unpublished opinion, that the decision to appoint counsel for a civil rights litigant proceeding in forma pauperis rests with the discretion of the trial court. It repeated the standard it had articulated in earlier cases, that ""[o]nly when a 'denial [of counsel] would result in fundamental unfairness impinging on due process rights' . . . will an appeals court overturn a decision of the district court [446 U.S. 989 , 991]

No. 78-1821
Argued February 19, 1980
Decided May 27, 1980
446 U.S. 544

Syllabus 
Respondent, prior to trial in Federal District Court on a charge of possessing heroin with intent to distribute it, moved to suppress the introduction in evidence of the heroin on the ground that it had been acquired through an unconstitutional search and seizure by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents.  At the hearing on the motion, it was established that, when respondent arrived at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport on a flight from Los Angeles, two DEA agents, observing that her conduct appeared to be characteristic of persons unlawfully carrying narcotics, approached her as she was walking through the concourse, identified themselves as federal agents, and asked to see her identification and airline ticket.  After respondent produced her driver's license, which was in her name, and her ticket, which was issued in another name, the agents questioned her briefly as to the discrepancy and as to how long she had been in California.  After returning the ticket and driver's license to her, one of the agents asked respondent if she would accompany him to the airport DEA office for further questions, and respondent did so.  At the office, the agent asked respondent if she would allow a search of her person and handbag and told her that she had the right to decline the search if she desired.  She responded:  ""Go ahead,"" and handed her purse to the agent.  A female police officer, who arrived to conduct the search of respondent's person, also asked respondent if she consented to the search, and respondent replied that she did.  When the policewoman explained that respondent would have to remove her clothing, respondent stated that she had a plane to catch, and was assured that, if she was carrying no narcotics, there would be no problem.  Respondent began to disrobe without further comment, and took from her undergarments two packages, one of which appeared to contain heroin, and handed them to the policewoman.  Respondent was then arrested for possessing heroin.  The District Court denied the motion to suppress, concluding that the agents' conduct in initially approaching the respondent and asking to see her ticket and identification was a permissible investigative stop, based on facts justifying a suspicion of criminal activity, that respondent had accompanied the agents to the DEA office voluntarily, and that respondent voluntarily consented to the 
Page 446 U. S. 545
 search in the DEA office.  Respondent was convicted after trial, but the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that respondent had not validly consented to the search.
Held:  The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.  Pp.  446 U. S. 550-560;  446 U. S. 560-566.
596 F.2d 706, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to parts I, II-B, II-C, and III, concluding:
1. Respondent's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated when she went with the agents from the concourse to the DEA office.  Whether her consent to accompany the agents was in fact voluntary or was the product of duress or coercion is to be determined by the totality of all the circumstances.  Under this test, the evidence -- including evidence that respondent was not told that she had to go to the office, but was simply asked if she would accompany the officers, and that there were neither threats nor any show of force -- was plainly adequate to support the District Court's finding that respondent voluntarily consented to accompany the officers.  The facts that the respondent was 22 years old, had not been graduated from high school, and was a Negro accosted by white officers, while not irrelevant, were not decisive.  Cf. Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218.  Pp.  446 U. S. 557-558.
2. The evidence also clearly supported the District Court's view that respondent's consent to the search of her person at the DEA office was freely and voluntarily given.  She was plainly capable of a knowing consent, and she was twice expressly told by the officers that she was free to withhold consent, and only thereafter explicitly consented to the search.  The trial court was entitled to view her statement, made when she was told that the search would require the removal of her clothing, that ""she had a plane to catch"" as simply an expression of concern that the search be conducted quickly, not as indicating resistance to the search.  Pp.  446 U. S. 558-559.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, joined by MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded in Part II-A, that no ""seizure"" of respondent, requiring objective justification, occurred when the agents approached her on the concourse and asked questions of her.  A person has been ""seized"" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave, and as long as the person to whom questions are put remains free to disregard the questions and walk away, there has been no intrusion upon that person's liberty or privacy as would require some particularized and objective justification.  Nothing in the record suggests that respondent had any objective reason to believe that 
Page 446 U. S. 546
 she was not free to end the conversation in the concourse and proceed on her way.  Pp.  446 U. S. 551-557.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that the question whether the DEA agents ""seized"" respondent within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment should not be reached, because neither of the courts below considered the question; and that, assuming that the stop did constitute a seizure, the federal agents, in light of all the circumstances, had reasonable suspicion that respondent was engaging in criminal activity and, therefore, did not violate the Fourth Amendment by stopping her for routine questioning.  Pp.  446 U. S. 560-566.
STEWART, J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered an opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-B, II-C, and III, in which BURGER, C.J., and BLACKMUN, POWELL, and REHNQUIST , JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part II-A, in which REHNQUIST, J., joined.

No. 78-1918
Argued January 16, 1980
Decided May 27, 1980
446 U.S. 578

Syllabus 
As authorized by the Clean Air Act (Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided, on the basis of correspondence with respondents, that certain equipment at a power generating facility of respondent PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG), was subject to certain ""new source"" performance standards regarding air pollution that had been promulgated by the EPA Administrator.  PPG then filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for review of the EPA's decision under  307(b)(1) of the Act, which provides for direct review in a federal court of appeals of certain locally and regionally applicable actions taken by the Administrator under specifically enumerated provisions of the Act, and of ""any other final action of the Administrator under [the] Act . . . which is locally or regionally applicable.""  Because of its uncertainty as to the proper forum for judicial review, PPG also filed suit for injunctive relief against the Administrator in a Federal District Court, which suit was stayed pending the disposition of the present case.  The Court of Appeals dismissed PPG's petition for lack of jurisdiction under  307(b)(1).
Held:  The phrase ""any other final action"" in  307(b)(1) is to be construed in accordance with its literal meaning so as to reach any action of the Administrator that is final, not just final actions of the Administrator similar to actions under the specifically enumerated provisions that precede the catchall phrase in the statute.  Pp.  446 U. S. 586-594.
(a) The rule of ejusdem generis does not apply to  307(b)(1) so as to limit ""any other final action"" to actions similar to those under the specifically enumerated provisions on the theory that the latter actions (unlike the Administrator's informal decision here) must be based on administrative proceedings reflecting at least notice and opportunity for a hearing.  At least one of the specifically enumerated provisions in  307(b)(1) does not require the Administrator to act only after notice and opportunity for a hearing, and thus, even if the rule of ejusdem generis were applied, it would not significantly narrow the ambit of ""any other final action"" under  307(b)(1).  Moreover, 
Page 446 U. S. 579
 the rule of ejusdem generis is only an instrumentality for ascertaining the correct meaning of words when there is uncertainty, and the phrase ""any other final action"" offers no indication whatever that Congress intended such a limiting construction of  307(b)(1).  Pp.  446 U. S. 587-589.
(b) Nothing in the legislative history supports a conclusion that the phrase ""any other final action"" in  307(b)(1) means anything other than what it says, or that Congress did not intend the phrase to enlarge the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals to include the review of case based on an administrative record reflecting less than notice and an opportunity fr a hearing.  Pp.  446 U. S. 589-59.
(c) The argument that, as a matter of policy, the basic purpose of  307(b)(1) -- to provide prompt preenforcement review of EPA action -- would be better served by providing in cases such as this for review in a district court, rather than a court of appeals, is an argument to be addressed to Congress, not to this Court.  Pp.  446 U. S. 592-594.

			"|"Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc.
No. 78-1918
Argued January 16, 1980
Decided May 27, 1980
446 U.S. 578

Syllabus 
As authorized by the Clean Air Act (Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided, on the basis of correspondence with respondents, that certain equipment at a power generating facility of respondent PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG), was subject to certain ""new source"" performance standards regarding air pollution that had been promulgated by the EPA Administrator.  PPG then filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for review of the EPA's decision under  307(b)(1) of the Act, which provides for direct review in a federal court of appeals of certain locally and regionally applicable actions taken by the Administrator under specifically enumerated provisions of the Act, and of ""any other final action of the Administrator under [the] Act . . . which is locally or regionally applicable.""  Because of its uncertainty as to the proper forum for judicial review, PPG also filed suit for injunctive relief against the Administrator in a Federal District Court, which suit was stayed pending the disposition of the present case.  The Court of Appeals dismissed PPG's petition for lack of jurisdiction under  307(b)(1).
Held:  The phrase ""any other final action"" in  307(b)(1) is to be construed in accordance with its literal meaning so as to reach any action of the Administrator that is final, not just final actions of the Administrator similar to actions under the specifically enumerated provisions that precede the catchall phrase in the statute.  Pp.  446 U. S. 586-594.
(a) The rule of ejusdem generis does not apply to  307(b)(1) so as to limit ""any other final action"" to actions similar to those under the specifically enumerated provisions on the theory that the latter actions (unlike the Administrator's informal decision here) must be based on administrative proceedings reflecting at least notice and opportunity for a hearing.  At least one of the specifically enumerated provisions in  307(b)(1) does not require the Administrator to act only after notice and opportunity for a hearing, and thus, even if the rule of ejusdem generis were applied, it would not significantly narrow the ambit of ""any other final action"" under  307(b)(1).  Moreover, 
Page 446 U. S. 579
 the rule of ejusdem generis is only an instrumentality for ascertaining the correct meaning of words when there is uncertainty, and the phrase ""any other final action"" offers no indication whatever that Congress intended such a limiting construction of  307(b)(1).  Pp.  446 U. S. 587-589.
(b) Nothing in the legislative history supports a conclusion that the phrase ""any other final action"" in  307(b)(1) means anything other than what it says, or that Congress did not intend the phrase to enlarge the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals to include the review of case based on an administrative record reflecting less than notice and an opportunity fr a hearing.  Pp.  446 U. S. 589-59.
(c) The argument that, as a matter of policy, the basic purpose of  307(b)(1) -- to provide prompt preenforcement review of EPA action -- would be better served by providing in cases such as this for review in a district court, rather than a court of appeals, is an argument to be addressed to Congress, not to this Court.  Pp.  446 U. S. 592-594.

Held:  The Buy Indian Act, which permits the Secretary of the Interior to purchase ""the products of Indian industry . . . in open market,"" does not authorize the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to enter into road construction contracts with Indian-owned companies without first advertising for bids pursuant to Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (FPASA).  There is no such authority even if the Buy Indian Act's language ""the products of Indian industry"" could be construed to embrace road construction, since, while negotiated procurements ""otherwise authorized by law"" are one of the specified exceptions to Title III's broad directive in 41 U.S.C.  252(c) that all procurement by the covered executive agencies (including the BIA) proceed through advertising, such exception is omitted from the list of the exceptions specified in  252(e) to the requirement that  252(c) not be construed to permit any road construction contract to be negotiated without advertising.  From this omission, only one inference can be drawn:  Congress meant to bar the negotiation of road construction projects under the authority of laws like the Buy Indian Act.  Pp.  446 U. S. 612-619.

Syllabus 
After respondent and another man (McLeroth) arrived at the Miami Airport on a flight from Peru, a customs officer searched McLeroth and found cocaine sewed into makeshift pockets in a T-shirt he was wearing.  When McLeroth implicated respondent, respondent was arrested and his luggage was searched without a warrant.  A T-shirt from which pieces had been cut that matched the pieces sewn to McLeroth's T-shirt was found in the luggage and seized.  The seized T-shirt was suppressed prior to respondent's trial on federal drug charges.  At the trial, McLeroth, who had pleaded guilty, testified against respondent, asserting that respondent had supplied him with the altered T-shirt and had sewed the makeshift pockets shut.  Respondent, taking the stand in his own defense, acknowledged, in his direct testimony, McLeroth's prior testimony that the cocaine was ""taped or draped around his body,"" but denied that he had ""ever engage[d] in that kind of activity"" with McLeroth.  On cross-examination, the Government called attention to these answers and then asked whether respondent had anything to do with sewing the makeshift pockets on McLeroth's T-shirt.  Respondent denied that he had.  And when the Government asked him whether he had a T-shirt with pieces missing in his luggage and whether the seized T-shirt was in his luggage, respondent replied to both questions:  ""Not to my knowledge.""  After rebuttal testimony for the Government, the seized T-shirt was admitted into evidence over objection, the jury being instructed that the rebuttal evidence was to be considered only for impeaching respondent's credibility.  Respondent's conviction was reversed by the Court of Appeals, which held that illegally seized evidence may be used for impeachment only if the evidence contradicts a particular statement made by a defendant in the course of his direct examination.
Held:  A defendant's statements made in response to proper cross-examination reasonably suggested by the defendant's direct examination are subject to otherwise proper impeachment by the Government, albeit by evidence that has been illegally obtained and is inadmissible as substantive evidence of guilt.  Cf. Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222; Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714.  Here, respondent's testimony on direct examination could easily be understood as a denial of any connection with

Syllabus

Held:  In an action brought under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against a public official whose position might entitle him to qualified immunity, the plaintiff is not required to allege that the defendant acted in bad faith in order to state a claim for relief, but the burden is on the defendant to plead good faith as an affirmative defense.  By  1983's plain terms, the plaintiff is required to make only two allegations in order to state a cause of action under the statute:  (1) that some person deprived him of a federal right, and (2) that such person acted under color of state or territorial law.  This allocation of the burden of pleading is supported by the nature of the qualified immunity defense, since whether such immunity has been established depends on facts peculiarly within the defendant's knowledge and control, the applicable test focusing not only on whether he has an objectively reasonable basis for his belief that his conduct was lawful, but also on whether he has a subjective belief.

Argued February 27, 1980
Decided May 19, 1980*
446 U.S. 398

Syllabus 
Upon their joint trial in Federal District Court, petitioners were convicted of, inter alia, armed assault on federal officers -- petitioner LaRocca as the actual triggerman and petitioner Busic as an aider and abettor, and thus derivatively a principal under 18 U.S.C.  2 -- in violation of 18 U.S.C.  111, which makes it unlawful to assault a federal officer and which provides for enhanced punishment when the assaulter ""uses"" a deadly weapon.  In addition, LaRocca was convicted of using, and Busic of carrying, a firearm in the commission of the armed assault, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  924(c), which authorizes the imposition of enhanced penalties on a defendant who ""uses"" ( 924 (c)(1)) or ""carries"" ( 924(c)(2)) a firearm while committing a federal felony.  Each petitioner's sentence included 5 years on possession of firearms and the assault charges, and 20 years for the  924(c) violations.  The Court of Appeals ultimately held that, while LaRocca's sentence could not be enhanced under both  111 and  924(c)(1) for ""using"" a firearm, he could be sentenced under either at the Government's election, but that, since the  924(c) charge against Busic alleged not that he ""used"" a firearm, but rather that he ""carried"" one, his sentence was valid.
Held:  Section 924(c) may not be applied to a defendant who uses a firearm in the course of a felony that is proscribed by a statute which itself authorizes enhancement if a dangerous weapon is used.  The sentence received by such a defendant may be enhanced only under the enhancement provision in the statute defining the felony he committed.  Pp.  446 U. S. 403-411.
(a) This result is supported not only by Simpson v. United States, 435 U. S. 6, but also by the legislative history of  924(c) and the canons of statutory construction that ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity, and that a more specific statute (18 U.S.C.  111 here) will be given precedence over a more general one ( 924(c)), even if, as here, the general provision was enacted later.  To the extent that this construction may lead to irrational sentencing patterns in which some less severe crimes are punished 
Page 446 U. S. 399
 more than other more severe crimes, it is the Congress, not this Court, that must take corrective action.  Pp.  446 U. S. 403-410.
(b) his holding not only makes it clear that petitioner LaRocca may not be sentenced under  924(c)(1) for using his gun to assault federal officers, but also applies to petitioner Busic's case.  Nor can Busic's sentence be sustained by arguing that a person who carries a gun in the commission of a  111 violation may be sentenced under  924(c)(2) because the enhancement provision of  111 does not apply to those who carry but do not use their weapons.  The fact is that Busic is being punished for using a weapon.  Through the combination of  111 and 18 U.S.C.  2, he was found guilty as a principal of using a firearm to assault federal agents.

(b) his holding not only makes it clear that petitioner LaRocca may not be sentenced under  924(c)(1) for using his gun to assault federal officers, but also applies to petitioner Busic's case.  Nor can Busic's sentence be sustained by arguing that a person who carries a gun in the commission of a  111 violation may be sentenced under  924(c)(2) because the enhancement provision of  111 does not apply to those who carry but do not use their weapons.  The fact is that Busic is being punished for using a weapon.  Through the combination of  111 and 18 U.S.C.  2, he was found guilty as a principal of using a firearm to assault federal agents.

446 U.S. 420

Syllabus 
Under a provision of the Georgia Code, a person convicted of murder may be sentenced to death if it is found beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense
""was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim.""
(This statutory aggravating circumstance was held not to be unconstitutional on its face in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153.)  Upon a jury trial in a Georgia state court, petitioner was convicted of two counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault.  The evidence showed that, after his wife, who was living with her mother, had rebuffed his efforts for a reconciliation, petitioner went to his mother-in-law's trailer; fired a shotgun through the window, killing his wife instantly; proceeded into the trailer, striking and injuring his fleeing daughter with the barrel of the gun; and then shot and instantly killed his mother-in-law.  Petitioner then called the sheriff's office and, when officers arrived, acknowledged his responsibility, directed an officer to the murder weapon, and later told an officer, ""I've done a hideous crime.""  At the sentencing phase of the trial, the judge quoted to the jury the statutory provision in question, and the jury imposed death sentences on both murder convictions, specifying that the aggravating circumstance as to each conviction was that the offense ""was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman.""  The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's judgments in all respects, rejecting petitioner's contention that the statutory provision was unconstitutionally vague and holding that the evidence supported the jury's finding of the statutory aggravating circumstance.
Held:  The judgment is reversed insofar as it leaves standing the death sentences, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  446 U. S. 427-433;  446 U. S. 433-442.
243 Ga. 302, 253 S.E.2d 710, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, joined by MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that, in affirming the death sentences in this case the Georgia Supreme Court adopted such a broad and vague construction of the statute in question as to violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  446 U. S. 427-433.
(a) If a State wishes to authorize capital punishment, it has a constitutional responsibility to tailor and apply its law in a manner that 
Page 446 U. S. 421
 avoids the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death penalty, and thus it must define the crimes for which death may be imposed in a way that obviates standardless sentencing discretion.  Cf. Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238; Gregg v. Georgia, supra.  Pp.  446 U. S. 427-48.
(b) In earlier decisions interpreting the statutory provision, the Georgia Supreme Court concluded that (i) the evidence that the offense was ""outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman"" must demonstrate ""torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim,"" (ii) the phrase ""depravity of mind"" comprehended only the kind of mental state that led the murderer to torture or to commit an aggravated battery before killing his victim, and (iii) the word ""torture"" must be construed in pari materia with ""aggravated battery,"" so as to require evidence of serious physical abuse of the victim before death.  Pp.  446 U. S. 429-432.
(c) However, the Georgia courts did not so limit the statute in the present case.  Petitioner did not torture or commit an aggravated battery upon his victims, or cause either of them to suffer any physical injury preceding their deaths.  Nor can the death sentences be upheld on the ground that the murders were ""outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that [they] involved . . . depravity of mind.""  Petitioner's crimes cannot be said to have reflected a consciousness materially more ""depraved"" than that of any person guilty of murder.  Pp.  446 U. S. 432-433.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring in the judgment, expressed his continuing belief that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and also agreed with the plurality that the Georgia Supreme Court's construction of the statutory provision at issue here was unconstitutionally vague under Gregg v. Georgia, supra.  He further concluded that, even under the prevailing view that the death penalty may, in some circumstances, constitutionally be imposed, it is not enough for a reviewing court to apply a narrowing construction to otherwise ambiguous statutory language, it being necessary that the jury be instructed on the proper, narrow construction of the statute, and that developments since Gregg and its progeny strongly suggest that appellate courts are incapable of guaranteeing the kind of objectivity and evenhandedness that the Court contemplated in Gregg.

446 U.S. 478

Syllabus 
Pursuant to New York statutes requiring that chiropractic practitioners obtain a state license either by passing an examination or obtaining a waiver of the examination requirement from petitioner Board of Regents (Board), respondent practitioner applied to the Board for a waiver of the examination requirement.  In November, 1971, the Board notified respondent that her waiver application was denied, but respondent was not afforded an evidentiary hearing or given a statement of reasons for the denial.  In January, 1972, respondent commenced state court proceedings, attacking the Board's decision as arbitrary and capricious but not raising any constitutional challenge to the decision.  Ultimately, in November, 1975, the New York Court of Appeals affirmed an order holding that the Board had not abused its discretion in denying respondent's waiver Application.  In June, 1976, respondent instituted this action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that petitioners' refusal to grant her a license violated due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Holding that the  1983 action was not barred by the applicable 3-year New York statute of limitations even though respondent's claim arose in November, 1971, when her waiver application was denied by the Board, the District Court concluded that it was appropriate to adopt a federal rule to toll the running of the statute of limitations during the pendency of respondent's state court litigation.  Under the New York tolling rule, the time for filing an action is not tolled during the period in which a litigant pursues a related but independent cause of action.  On the merits of the federal constitutional claim, the District Court held that respondent was entitled to a hearing before the Board on her eligibility for waiver of the examination requirement.  The Court of Appeals affirmed as to both the statute of limitations issue and the merits.
Held:  Respondent's action was barred by the New York statute of limitations.  The federal courts were obligated not only to apply the analogous New York statute of limitations to respondent's federal constitutional claims, but also to apply the New York rule for tolling that statute of limitations.

 Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S. 454; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167.  Pp.  446 U. S. 483-492.
(a) Under 42 U.S.C.  1988, federal courts are instructed to refer to state statutes when federal law provides no rule of decision for actions brought under  1983, and  1988 authorizes federal courts to disregard an otherwise applicable state rule of law only if the state law is ""inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.""  Since Congress did not establish a statute of limitations or a body of tolling rules applicable to federal court actions under  1983, the analogous state statute of limitations and the coordinate tolling rules are binding rules of law in most cases.  This ""borrowing"" of the state statute of limitations includes rules of tolling unless they are ""inconsistent"" with federal law.  Pp.  446 U. S. 483-486.
(b) New York's tolling rule is not ""inconsistent"" with the policies of deterrence and compensation underlying  1983.  Neither of these policies is significantly affected by New York's rule, since plaintiffs can still readily enforce their claims, thereby recovering compensation and fostering deterrence, simply by commencing their actions within three years.  And there is no need for nationwide uniformity so as to warrant displacement of state statutes of limitations for civil rights actions.  Nor are policies of federalism undermined by adoption of the New York rule.  When Congress establishes a remedy (such as  1983) separate and independent from other remedies that might also be available, a state rule which does not allow a plaintiff to litigate such alternative claims in succession, without risk of time bar, is not ""inconsistent.""

Syllabus 
Section 7 of the Taylor Grazing Act, as amended in 1936, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), in his discretion, to classify, as proper not only for homesteading but also for satisfaction of any outstanding ""lieu"" rights, both lands within federal grazing districts and any unappropriated and unreserved public lands withdrawn by Executive Order from ""settlement, location, sale or entry"" pending a determination of the best use of the lands, and to open all such lands to ""selection.""  Section 7 further provides that such lands shall not be subject to disposition until they have been classified.  Pursuant to  7, the Secretary refused Utah's selection of extremely valuable oil shale lands located within federal grazing districts in lieu of and as indemnification for original school land grants of significantly lesser value that were frustrated by federal preemption or private entry prior to being surveyed.  In so acting, the Secretary followed the policy that, in the exercise of his discretion under  7, indemnity applications involving grossly disparate values would be refused.  Utah filed suit in Federal District Court, which, upon stipulated facts, entered summary judgment for the State.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that  7 gave the Secretary no authority to classify land as eligible for selection, and that Utah had a right to select indemnity land of equal acreage without regard to the relative values of the original school land grants and the indemnity selections.
Held:  Section 7 confers on the Secretary the authority, in his discretion, to classify lands within a federal grazing district as proper for school indemnity selection.  His ""grossly disparate value"" policy is a lawful exercise of the broad discretion vested in him by  7, and is a valid ground for refusing to accept Utah's selections.  Such policy is wholly faithful to Congress' consistent purpose, in providing for indemnity selections, of giving the States a rough equivalent of the school land grants in place that were lost through preemption or private entry prior to survey.

 Supreme Court of the United States

 On writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Louisiana.

 Mr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 The New Orleans, La., police received an anonymous telephone call informing them that a black male wearing a yellow shirt and blue pants and armed with a handgun could be found sitting in Sander's Bar. A radio dispatch went out, and Officer Williams proceeded to the bar. Of the 10 or 12 persons in the bar, petitioner was the only one wearing a yellow shirt and blue pants. Officer Williams approached petitioner, directed him to stand, and frisked him. The 
Page 446 U.S. 958 , 959
 officer detected a gun in petitioner's pants pocket; he removed a .38 caliber revolver and arrested petitioner who was charged with violation of Louisiana law by possession of a firearm after having been previously convicted of a felony. 
 In sustaining the trial court's denial of petitioner's motion to suppress the gun as illegally seized, the Louisiana Supreme Court noted that the Fourth Amendment would render the evidence inadmissible if the officer did not have sufficient knowledge of facts and circumstances to amount to reasonable cause for an investigatory detention. The court also noted that Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143 ( 1972), recognized that an informer's tip can provide a police officer with reasonable cause to detain and question a suspect. But the court noted further the difference between this case and Adams, for the narrow issue presented here was whether an informer's tip could provide reasonable cause if the tip was anonymous. According to the court, if the information received from the anonymous tipster carried enough indicia of reliability, such as specificity of the information and corroboration by independent police work, the anonymous tip was sufficient. Moreover, prompt police action was justified where the information would indicate an immediate and real danger to the public. 
 We have not directly decided whether an anonymous tip may furnish reasonable suspicion for a stop and frisk. We have emphasized the specificity of the information provided, the independent corroboration by the police officer, and the danger to the public. See, e. g., Adams, supra; Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307 ( 1959). But in the decided cases, these factors were not the only indicia of reliability. The informers in Adams and Draper were known to the officer and were known to have provided reliable information in the past. The same cannot be said of an anonymous tipster. 
 Arguably, the decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court is inconsistent with our prior cases which require that reason- [446 U.S. 958 , 960]

Syllabus 
After filing suit in a New York state court against petitioner shipowner to recover damages, on grounds of negligence and unseaworthiness, for personal injuries sustained while working aboard petitioner's vessel in New York waters, respondent husband sought leave to amend his complaint to add his spouse as a plaintiff for loss of society.  The trial court denied the motion to amend, but the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court reversed and granted the motion to amend, reasoning that the case was controlled by Sea-Land Services, Inc. v. Gaudet, 414 U. S. 573, which held that, under the nonstatutory maritime wrongful death remedy, the widow of a longshoreman mortally injured aboard a vessel in state territorial waters could recover damages for the loss of her deceased husband's society.  The New York Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  446 U. S. 277-286;  446 U. S. 286.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded:
1. The Court of Appeals' judgment upholding the legal tenability of the wife's claim for loss of society, although not ""final"" or within a categorical exception to strict finality when originally entered, will, as a practical matter, be treated as falling within such an exception where, after certiorari was granted in this Court, the case, including the loss of society claim, was tried and respondent husband prevailed, the appeal from the trial verdict will not challenge the element thereof awarding damages for loss of society, and no federal issue other than whether the wife has a cause of action under general maritime law for loss of society remains.  Pp.  446 U. S. 277-279.
2. General maritime law authorizes the wife of a harbor worker injured nonfatally aboard a vessel in state territorial waters to maintain an action for damages for the loss of her husband's society.  Although Sea-Land Services, Inc. v. Gaudet, supra, upheld a claim for loss of society in the context of a wrongful death action, it provides the conclusive decisional recognition of a right to recover for such loss, there being no apparent reason to differentiate between fatal and nonfatal injuries in authorizing the recovery of damages for loss of society.  Nor

446 U.S. 291

Syllabus 
Shortly after a taxicab driver, who had been robbed by a man wielding a sawed-off shotgun, identified a picture of respondent as that of his assailant, a Providence, R.I., patrolman spotted respondent, who was unarmed, on the street, arrested him, and advised him of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  When other police officers arrived at the arrest scene, respondent was twice again advised of his Miranda rights, and he stated that he understood his rights and wanted to speak with a lawyer.  Respondent was then placed in a police car to be driven to the central station in the company of three officers, who were instructed not to question respondent or intimidate him in any way.  While en route to the station, two of the officers engaged in a conversation between themselves concerning the missing shotgun.  One of the officers stated that there were ""a lot of handicapped children running around in this area"" because a school for such children was located nearby, and ""God forbid one of them might find a weapon with shells and they might hurt themselves.""  Respondent interrupted the conversation, stating that the officers should turn the car around so he could show them where the gun was located.  Upon returning to the scene of the arrest where a search for the shotgun was in progress, respondent was again advised of his Miranda rights, replied that he understood those rights, but that he ""wanted to get the gun out of the way because of the kids in the area in the school,"" and then led the police to the shotgun.  Before trial on charges of kidnaping, robbery, and murder of another taxicab driver, the trial court denied respondent's motion to suppress the shotgun and the statement he had made to the police regarding its discovery, ruling that respondent had waived his Miranda rights, and respondent was subsequently convicted.  The Rhode Island Supreme Court set aside the conviction and held that respondent was entitled to a new trial, concluding that respondent had invoked his Miranda right to counsel and that, contrary to Miranda's mandate that, in the absence of counsel, all custodial interrogation then cease, the police officers in the vehicle had ""interrogated"" respondent without a valid waiver of his right to counsel.
Held:  Respondent was not ""interrogated"" in violation of his right under Miranda to remain silent until he had consulted with a lawyer.  Pp.  446 U. S. 297-303. 
Page 446 U. S. 292

(a) The Miranda safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent.  That is to say, the term ""interrogation"" under Miranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.  The latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police.  Pp.  446 U. S. 298-302.
(b) Here, there was no express questioning of respondent; the conversation between the two officers was, at least in form, nothing more than a dialogue between them to which no response from respondent was invited.  Moreover, respondent was not subjected to the ""functional equivalent"" of questioning, since it cannot be said that the officers should have known that their conversation was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from respondent.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that the officers were aware that respondent was peculiarly susceptible to an appeal to his conscience concerning the safety of handicapped children, or that the police knew that respondent was unusually disoriented or upset at the time of his arrest.  Nor does the record indicate that, in the context of a brief conversation, the officers should have known that respondent would suddenly be moved to make a self-incriminating response.  While it may be said that respondent was subjected to ""subtle compulsion,"" it must also be established that a suspect's incriminating response was the product of words or actions on the part of the police that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response, which was not established here.

|446 u.s. 318|"General Telephone Company of the Northwest, Inc. v.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
No. 79-488
Argued March 25, 26, 1980
Decided May 12, 1980
446 U.S. 318

Syllabus 
Section 706(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 empowers the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) ""to prevent any person from engaging in any unlawful practice"" as set forth in Title VII.  Section 706(f)(1) authorizes the EEOC, after unlawful employment practice charges against a private employer are filed with it and it is unable to secure a conciliation agreement, to bring a civil action against the employer.  And  706(g), in addition to providing for injunctive relief, provides for reinstatement or hiring of aggrieved employees with or without backpay.  On the basis of sex discrimination charges filed by four employees of petitioner employer, the EEOC brought suit in Federal District Court under  706(f)(1), alleging discrimination against female employees in four States and seeking injunctive relief and backpay for the women affected by the challenged practices.  The EEOC did not seek class certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, and petitioner employer moved to dismiss the class action aspects of the complaint.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals, on interlocutory appeal, affirmed.
Held:  The EEOC may seek class-wide relief under  706(f)(1) without being certified as the class representative under Rule 23.  Pp.  446 U. S. 323-334.
(a) The language of  706(a),(f)(1), and (g) clearly authorizes the procedure that the EEOC followed in this case.  Pp.  446 U. S. 323-325.
(b) This understanding of the statute is supported by the purpose of the 1972 amendments to Title VII of securing more effective enforcement of Title VII by adding  706(f)(1) to authorize a civil enforcement suit by the EEOC as a supplement to the preexisting private action.  Under  706(f)(1), Congress sought to implement the public interest, as well as to bring about more effective enforcement of private rights.  The private action rights under  706(f)(1) suggest that the EEOC is not merely a proxy for the victims of discrimination, and that the EEOC's enforcement suits should not be considered representative actions subject to Rule 23.  When the EEOC acts, albeit at the behest of and for the benefit of specific individuals, it acts also to vindicate the public interest in preventing employment discrimination.  Pp.  446 U. S. 325-326. 
Page 446 U. S. 319

(c) Prior to 1972, the only civil actions authorized other than private lawsuits were actions by the Attorney General upon reasonable cause to suspect ""a pattern or practice"" of discrimination, and such actions were brought in the name of the United States -- not as a representative of the persons aggrieved -- without obtaining certification under Rule 23, even though specific relief was awarded to individuals not parties to the suit.  The 1972 amendments transferred the Attorney General's authority to bring ""pattern or practice"" suits to the EEOC, and Congress intended the EEOC to proceed in the same manner.  Pp.  446 U. S. 327-329.
(d) Forcing EEOC civil actions into the Rule 23 model would, in many cases, distort the Rule as it is commonly interpreted, and, in others, foreclose enforcement actions not satisfying prevailing Rule 23 standards as to numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation, but seemingly authorized by  706(f)(1).  The undesirability of doing either supports the conclusion that the procedural requirements of the Rule do not apply.  Pp.  446 U. S. 329-331.
(e) Departure from the statutory design is not warranted on the theory that Rule 23 should be invoked in order to secure a judgment in the EEOC's suit that will be binding upon all individuals with similar grievances in the class or subclasses that might be certified.  It would not be consistent with the remedial purpose of the statutes to bind all ""class"" members with discrimination grievances against an employer by the relief obtained under an EEOC judgment or settlement against the employer, especially in view of the possible differences between the public and private interests involved.  However, the courts are not powerless to prevent undue hardship to the defendant, and, where the EEOC has prevailed in its action, the court may reasonably require any individual who claims under its judgment to relinquish his right to bring a separate private action.

			"|"General Telephone Company of the Northwest, Inc. v.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
No. 79-488
Argued March 25, 26, 1980
Decided May 12, 1980
446 U.S. 318

Syllabus 
Section 706(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 empowers the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) ""to prevent any person from engaging in any unlawful practice"" as set forth in Title VII.  Section 706(f)(1) authorizes the EEOC, after unlawful employment practice charges against a private employer are filed with it and it is unable to secure a conciliation agreement, to bring a civil action against the employer.  And  706(g), in addition to providing for injunctive relief, provides for reinstatement or hiring of aggrieved employees with or without backpay.  On the basis of sex discrimination charges filed by four employees of petitioner employer, the EEOC brought suit in Federal District Court under  706(f)(1), alleging discrimination against female employees in four States and seeking injunctive relief and backpay for the women affected by the challenged practices.  The EEOC did not seek class certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, and petitioner employer moved to dismiss the class action aspects of the complaint.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals, on interlocutory appeal, affirmed.
Held:  The EEOC may seek class-wide relief under  706(f)(1) without being certified as the class representative under Rule 23.  Pp.  446 U. S. 323-334.
(a) The language of  706(a),(f)(1), and (g) clearly authorizes the procedure that the EEOC followed in this case.  Pp.  446 U. S. 323-325.
(b) This understanding of the statute is supported by the purpose of the 1972 amendments to Title VII of securing more effective enforcement of Title VII by adding  706(f)(1) to authorize a civil enforcement suit by the EEOC as a supplement to the preexisting private action.  Under  706(f)(1), Congress sought to implement the public interest, as well as to bring about more effective enforcement of private rights.  The private action rights under  706(f)(1) suggest that the EEOC is not merely a proxy for the victims of discrimination, and that the EEOC's enforcement suits should not be considered representative actions subject to Rule 23.  When the EEOC acts, albeit at the behest of and for the benefit of specific individuals, it acts also to vindicate the public interest in preventing employment discrimination.  Pp.  446 U. S. 325-326. 
Page 446 U. S. 319

(c) Prior to 1972, the only civil actions authorized other than private lawsuits were actions by the Attorney General upon reasonable cause to suspect ""a pattern or practice"" of discrimination, and such actions were brought in the name of the United States -- not as a representative of the persons aggrieved -- without obtaining certification under Rule 23, even though specific relief was awarded to individuals not parties to the suit.  The 1972 amendments transferred the Attorney General's authority to bring ""pattern or practice"" suits to the EEOC, and Congress intended the EEOC to proceed in the same manner.  Pp.  446 U. S. 327-329.
(d) Forcing EEOC civil actions into the Rule 23 model would, in many cases, distort the Rule as it is commonly interpreted, and, in others, foreclose enforcement actions not satisfying prevailing Rule 23 standards as to numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation, but seemingly authorized by  706(f)(1).  The undesirability of doing either supports the conclusion that the procedural requirements of the Rule do not apply.  Pp.  446 U. S. 329-331.
(e) Departure from the statutory design is not warranted on the theory that Rule 23 should be invoked in order to secure a judgment in the EEOC's suit that will be binding upon all individuals with similar grievances in the class or subclasses that might be certified.  It would not be consistent with the remedial purpose of the statutes to bind all ""class"" members with discrimination grievances against an employer by the relief obtained under an EEOC judgment or settlement against the employer, especially in view of the possible differences between the public and private interests involved.  However, the courts are not powerless to prevent undue hardship to the defendant, and, where the EEOC has prevailed in its action, the court may reasonably require any individual who claims under its judgment to relinquish his right to bring a separate private action.  Pp.  446 U. S. 332-333.
599 F.2d 322, affirmed.

446 U.S. 335

Syllabus 
Two privately retained lawyers represented respondent and two others charged with the same murders.  Respondent, who was tried first, made no objection to the multiple representation.  The defense rested at the close of the prosecutor's case, and respondent was convicted.  The two codefendants later were acquitted at separate trials.  Respondent then sought collateral relief under Pennsylvania law, alleging that he had not received effective assistance of counsel because his lawyers represented conflicting interests.  After a hearing at which both defense lawyers testified, the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas denied relief.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed, finding no multiple representation and concluding that the decision to rest the defense was a reasonable trial tactic.  Respondent next sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, but the court accepted the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's conclusion that respondent's lawyer did not represent the other defendants, and further concluded that respondent had adduced no evidence of a conflict of interest.  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.  It held that the participation of the two lawyers in all three trials established as a matter of law that both lawyers represented all three defendants, and that the possibility of conflict among the interests represented by these lawyers established a violation of respondent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals did not exceed the proper scope of review when it rejected the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's conclusion that the two lawyers had not undertaken multiple representation.  The Pennsylvania court's conclusion was a mixed determination of law and fact not covered by 28 U.S.C.  2254(d), which provides that a state court's determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue shall be presumed to be correct.  Pp  446 U. S. 341-342.
2. A state criminal trial, a proceeding initiated and conducted by the State itself, is an action of the State within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.  If a defendant's retained counsel does not provide the adequate legal assistance guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, a 
Page 446 U. S. 336
 serious risk of injustice infects the trial itself.  When the State obtains a conviction through such a trial, it is the State that unconstitutionally deprives the defendant of his liberty.  Thus, there is no merit to petitioners' claim that failings of retained counsel cannot provide the basis for federal habeas corpus relief.  Pp.  446 U. S. 342-345.
3. Respondent is not entitled to federal habeas corpus relief upon showing that the state trial court failed to inquire into the potential for conflicts of interest and that his lawyers had a possible conflict of interests.  Pp.  446 U. S. 345-350.
(a) The Sixth Amendment requires a state trial court to investigate timely objections to multiple representation.  But unless the state trial court knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists, the court itself need not initiate an inquiry into the propriety of multiple representation.  Under the circumstances of this case, the Sixth Amendment imposed upon the trial court no affirmative duty to inquire.  Pp.  446 U. S. 345-348.
(b) Unless the trial court fails to afford a defendant who objects to multiple representation an opportunity to show that potential conflicts impermissibly imperil his right to a fair trial, a reviewing court cannot presume that the possibility for conflict resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel.  In such a case, a defendant must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected the adequacy of his representation.  Pp.  446 U. S. 348-350.
(c) The possibility of a conflict of interest is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction.  In order to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment, a defendant must show that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer's performance.  P.  446 U. S. 350.

No. 78-1557
Argued January 7, 1980
Decided May 12, 1980
446 U.S. 359

Syllabus 
As one of the means of protecting the interests of beneficiaries under private pension plans for employees, Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) created a plan termination insurance program that became effective in four successive stages.  Section 4022(a) of Title IV provides that, if benefits are ""nonforfeitable,"" they are insured by respondent Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), and, under  4062(b) of that Title, PBGC has a right to reimbursement from the employer for insurance paid to cover nonforfeitable benefits.  Section 3 of Title I of ERISA provides that,
""[f]or purposes of this title [t]he term 'nonforfeitable' when used with respect to a pension benefit or right means a claim obtained by a participant or his beneficiary to that part of an immediate or deferred benefit under a pension plan which arises from the participant's service, which is unconditional, and which is legally enforceable against the plan.""
Petitioner employer, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, established a pension plan covering employees represented by respondent union at one of petitioner's plants, and this plan contained a clause limiting benefits, upon termination of the plan, to the assets in the pension fund.  Petitioner, upon closing such plant, terminated the pension plan the day before January 1, 1976, the date on which much of ERISA became effective, at which time the pension fund assets were sufficient to pay only about 35% of the vested benefits to those employees entitled thereto.  Petitioner thereafter filed an action against the PBGC in Federal District Court seeking a declaration that it has no liability under ERISA for any failure of the pension plan to pay all of the vested benefits in full, and an order enjoining the PBGC from taking actions inconsistent with that declaration.  Granting summary judgment for petitioner, the District Court held that the limitation of liability clause in the plan was valid on the date of termination, and that such clause prevented the benefits at issue from being characterized as ""nonforfeitable.""  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding, in reliance on the Title I definition of ""nonforfeitability,"" that the limitation of liability clause merely 
Page 446 U. S. 360
 affected the extent to which the benefits could be collected, without qualifying the employees' rights against the plan.
Held:  The plan's limitation of liability clause does not prevent the vested benefits from being characterized as ""nonforfeitable,"" and thus covered by the insurance program.  Petitioner's argument that the Title I definition of ""nonforfeitable"" determines which benefits are insured under Title IV, that, thus, benefits are not insured unless they are ""unconditional"" and ""legally enforceable against the plan,"" that, because of the limitation of liability clause such elements of the definition are not satisfied, and that therefore the benefits are forfeitable, and necessarily uninsurable, is without merit.  Such argument is not supported by a literal reading of the definition on which it relies, and it is inconsistent with t.he clear language, structure, and purpose of Title IV.  Pp.  446 U. S. 370-386.
(a) To view the term ""nonforfeitable"" as describing the quality of the participant's right to a pension, rather than a limit on the amount he may collect, is consistent with the Title I definition of such term, and accords with the interpretation of the term in Title IV adopted by the PBGC, the agency responsible for administering the Title IV insurance program.  Pp.  446 U. S. 370-374.
(b) There is no evidence that Congress intended to exclude otherwise vested benefits from the insurance program solely because the employer had disclaimed liability for any deficiency in the pension fund.  To the contrary,  4062(b), the reimbursement provision, makes it clear that Congress was not only worried about plan terminations resulting from business failures, but was also concerned about the termination of underfunded plans, such as the one here, by solvent employers.  And the fact that the provision of  4062(b) limiting the amount of employer liability for reimbursement to 30% of the employer's net worth would be meaningless unless the employer has disclaimed direct liability demonstrates that Congress did not intend such a disclaimer to render otherwise vested benefits ""forfeitable"" within the meaning of  4022.  Pp.  446 U. S. 374-382
(c) Petitioner's proposed construction of the statute, whereby cost-free terminations of pension plans would be authorized prior to January 1, 1976, with full liability for all promised benefits thereafter, would distort the orderly phase-in of the statutory program designed by Congress.  It appears that Congress intended to discourage unnecessary terminations even during the phase-in period, and to place a reasonable ceiling on the potential cost of a termination during the principal life of ERISA -- the period after January 1, 1976.

In holding that certain witnesses' in-court identifications of respondent at his state trial were tainted by pretrial identifications resulting from impermissibly suggestive photographic arrays, the Court of Appeals reasoned that photographic identification, as opposed to less suggestive procedures, was not necessary under the circumstances, and that there was a very substantial likelihood of misidentification due to the procedures employed.  Given the tension between the Court of Appeals' analysis and this Court's decisions indicating that reliability, not necessity, is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony, and given the apparent conflict between the Court of Appeals' decision and a decision of another Court of Appeals, it appears that four Members of this Court are likely to vote to grant certiorari in this case.

An application for a stay, pending consideration of a petition for certiorari, of a California Supreme Court order in connection with the extradition to Arkansas of respondent, who had escaped from an Arkansas prison, is granted.  The order, inter alia, directed the California Superior Court to conduct hearings to determine if the Arkansas prison was presently operated in conformance with the Eighth Amendment and stayed execution of the Governor of California's warrant of extradition pending final determination of the proceeding.  A stay of the order is warranted since the Governor of California had granted the request for extradition, which was in compliance with federal standards; the proper forum for respondent's challenge to Arkansas prison conditions was in the Arkansas courts; and the order was very much at odds with principles set forth in this Court's decisions governing judicial proceedings in extradition cases.

Syllabus 
Under  16(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (Act), sums collected as civil penalties for the unlawful employment of child labor are returned to the Employment Standards Administration (ESA) of the Department of Labor in reimbursement for the costs of determining violations and assessing penalties.  An Assistant Regional Administrator determined that violations of child labor provisions of the Act had occurred at restaurants managed by appellee and assessed a fine against appellee, including an amount for willful violation.  After appellee filed exceptions to the Assistant Regional Administrator's determination and assessment, a hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge, who accepted the Assistant Regional Administrator's contention that violations had occurred, but found that the violations were not willful, and reduced the total assessment accordingly.  Appellee then filed suit in Federal District Court, contending that  16(e) violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment for appellee, holding that the reimbursement provision of  16(e) created an impermissible risk of bias on the part of the Assistant Regional Administrator because a regional office's greater effort in uncovering violations could lead to an increased amount of penalties and a greater share of reimbursements for that office, and thus  16(e) could distort the Assistant Regional Administrator's objectivity in assessing penalties.
Held:  The reimbursement provision of  16(e) does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by creating an impermissible risk of bias in the Act's enforcement and administration.  Pp.  446 U. S. 242-252.
(a) Strict due process requirements as to the neutrality of officials performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions, cf. Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510; Ward v. Monroeville, 409 U. S. 57, are not applicable to the determinations of the assistant regional administrator, whose functions resemble those of a prosecutor more closely than those of a judge.  In an adversary system, prosecutors are permitted to be zealous in their 
Page 446 U. S. 239
 enforcement of the law.  Although traditions of prosecutorial discretion do not immunize from judicial scrutiny enforcement decisions that are contrary to law, rigid standards of neutrality cannot be the same for administrative prosecutor as for judges.  Pp.  446 U. S. 242-250.
(b) It is unnecessary in this case to determine with precision what limit there may be on a financial or personal interest of one who performs a prosecutorial function, for here the influence alleged to impose bias is exceptionally remote.  No governmental official stands to profit economically from vigorous enforcement of child labor provisions; there is no realistic possibility that the assistant regional administrator's judgment will be distorted by the prospect of institutional gain as a result of zealous enforcement efforts; and ESA's administration of the Act has minimized any potential for bias.  On this record, the possibility that an assistant regional administrator might be tempted to devote an unusually large quantity of resources to enforcement efforts in the hope that he would ultimately obtain a higher total allocation of federal funds to his office is too remote to violate the constraints applicable to the financial or personal interest of officials charged with prosecutorial or plaintiff-like functions.

Syllabus 
Held:
1. As the Special Master recommended, the United States is not obligated to account for and pay Louisiana either the value of the use of Louisiana's share of impounded funds that have been awarded and paid to the State under mineral leases on lands off its Gulf Coast, or interest upon that portion of those funds.  The Interim Agreement that the parties entered into in response to this Court's ruling enjoining them from leasing wells in the disputed tidelands area except by agreement provided only that the payments made to the United States on each lease within the disputed area were to be impounded ""in a separate fund in the Treasury of the United States"" and, upon determination of the ownership of the lands, were to be taken from that fund and paid to the party entitled to them.  The agreement contains no provision for the payment of interest or for the use of the funds or for investment, and there is nothing in the agreement's use of the word ""impound,"" or in Louisiana's characterization of the arrangement as an escrow, to imply an obligation on the United States' part to pay interest or to pay for the use of the money.  The impoundment of the funds having served its intended purpose, and all payments due Louisiana from the impounded funds having been made, the United States has fulfilled the obligations imposed upon it by the agreement.  Pp.  446 U. S. 261-266.
2. Contrary to the Special Master's recommendations, Louisiana is obligated to account to the United States for revenues derived by the State from mineral leases on areas within the zone contiguous to the coastline (Zone 1) adjudicated to the United States.  The provision of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act authorizing the United States to make an agreement with a State as to existing mineral leases and the issuance of new leases ""pending the settlement or adjudication"" of a controversy as to ultimate ownership, and stating that payments made pursuant to such an agreement shall be considered as compliance with certain lease validation requirements of the Act, does not govern payments made by Louisiana's lessees in Zone 1 so as to foreclose any federal claim with respect to those payments.  The provision means no more than that a lessee is not in default so long as the agreement remains in effect and he makes the required payments, and there is no 
Page 446 U. S. 254
 basis for reading into the provision a waiver by the United States of Louisiana's independent duty to account, or a waiver of any claim for money due the United States.  The State's obligation does not derive from the Act, but was imposed by this Court's 1950 decree specifying that the United States was entitled to an accounting from Louisiana of all sums received by the State from lands adjudicated to the United States, was not waived by the Interim Agreement, and is not excused by the above provision of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.  Pp.  446 U. S. 266-272.
3. The Court accepts, upon acquiescence of the parties, the Special Master's recommendations that Louisiana has no obligation to account for and pay to the United States money collected by the State as severance taxes on minerals removed from areas adjudicated to the United States.

 In 1971, respondents in these cases instituted an action seeking the desegregation of the schools in the city of Wilmington, Del. The litigation has now culminated in a countywide remedy more Draconian than any ever approved by this Court. The order provides for the dissolution of the county's 11 independent school boards, most of which were locally elected. In their place, the District Court ""created"" a single countywide school system, to be run by court-appointed officials for five years. Within this judicial school district, which comprises in excess of 60% of all the public school students in the State of Delaware, every single student will be reassigned away from his or her local school for a period of no less than three years and for as long as nine years. The plan is designed to accomplish a racial balance in each and every school, in every grade, in all of the former 11 districts, mirroring the racial balance of the total area involved.

I think this Court should grant certiorari to review the District Court's imposition of this remedy, even accepting as settled the finding that there was an interdistrict violation warranting an interdistrict remedy.

No. 79-105
Argued January 14, 1980
Decided April 22, 1980
446 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Petitioner brought a diversity action in Federal District Court against respondent, seeking damages and reformation with regard to a certain series of contracts between the parties.  Various claims were asserted, including a $19 million claim for amounts due on the contracts already performed.  Respondent filed counterclaims.  The facts as to most of the claims and counterclaims are in dispute, but the sole dispute as to petitioner's claim for the $19 million balance due concerns the application of a release clause in each of the contracts.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner for $19 million, plus prejudgment interest at the statutory rate of 6%, notwithstanding the release clause.  Petitioner then moved for a certification of this judgment as a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), which provides that, when more than one claim is presented in an action, whether as a claim or counterclaim, a district court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.  The court granted the motion and directed entry of final judgment for petitioner after determining that there was ""no just reason for delay"" and finding, inter alia, that certification would not result in unnecessary appellate review; that the claims finally adjudicated were separate from 
Page 446 U. S. 2
 any of the other claims or counterclaims; that the nature of the claims was such that no appellate court would have to decide the same issues more than once even if there were subsequent appeals; that petitioner would suffer severe financial loss from nonpayment of the $19 million judgment because current interest rates were higher than the statutory prejudgment rates; and that the solvency of the parties was not a significant factor, since each appeared to be financially sound.  Dismissing the case for want of an appealable order, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court had abused its discretion by granting the Rule 54(b) certification, since the possibility of a setoff required that the status quo be maintained unless petitioner could show harsh or unusual circumstances and since no such showing had been made.
Held:  The District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting petitioner's motion for certification under Rule 54(b).  Pp.  446 U. S. 7-13.
(a) In deciding whether there are just reasons to delay an appeal of individual final judgments in a setting such as this, a district court must take into account the interests of sound judicial administration, as well as the equities involved.  Hence, it was proper for the District Court here to consider such factors as whether the claims under review were separable from the others remaining to be adjudicated and whether the nature of the claims already determined was such that no appellate court would have to decide the same issues more than once even if there were subsequent appeals.  The mere presence of nonfrivolous counterclaims does not render a Rule 54(b) certification inappropriate.  Pp.  446 U. S. 8-9.
(b) The Court of Appeals' holding that the status quo had to be maintained absent a showing by petitioner of harsh or unusual circumstances reflects a misinterpretation of the standard of review for Rule 54(b) certifications and a misperception of the appellate function in such cases.  Pp.  446 U. S. 9-10.
(c) The proper standard against which a district court's exercise of discretion in granting a Rule 54(b) certification is to be judged is the interest of sound judicial administration.  Under this standard, although the court of appeals must scrutinize the district court's evaluation of such factors as the interrelationship of the claims so as to prevent piecemeal appeals, once such juridical concerns have been met, the district court's discretionary judgment should be given substantial deference, and the court of appeals should disturb the district court's assessment of the equities only if it can say that the district judge's conclusion was clearly unreasonable.  Pp.  446 U. S. 10-11.
(d) The question before the District Court here came down to which of the parties should get the benefit of the difference between the prejudgment 
Page 446 U. S. 3
 and market rates of interest on the debts admittedly owing and adjudged to be due while unrelated claims were litigated.  While the possibility of a setoff against the amount respondent owed petitioner was not an insignificant factor, the District Court took this into account when it determined that both litigants appeared to be financially sound, and that petitioner would be able to satisfy a judgment on the counterclaims if any were entered.  Pp.  446 U. S. 11-12.

Petitioner brought a diversity action in Federal District Court against respondent, seeking damages and reformation with regard to a certain series of contracts between the parties.  Various claims were asserted, including a $19 million claim for amounts due on the contracts already performed.  Respondent filed counterclaims.  The facts as to most of the claims and counterclaims are in dispute, but the sole dispute as to petitioner's claim for the $19 million balance due concerns the application of a release clause in each of the contracts.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner for $19 million, plus prejudgment interest at the statutory rate of 6%, notwithstanding the release clause.  Petitioner then moved for a certification of this judgment as a final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), which provides that, when more than one claim is presented in an action, whether as a claim or counterclaim, a district court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.  The court granted the motion and directed entry of final judgment for petitioner after determining that there was ""no just reason for delay"" and finding, inter alia, that certification would not result in unnecessary appellate review; that the claims finally adjudicated were separate from 
Page 446 U. S. 2
 any of the other claims or counterclaims; that the nature of the claims was such that no appellate court would have to decide the same issues more than once even if there were subsequent appeals; that petitioner would suffer severe financial loss from nonpayment of the $19 million judgment because current interest rates were higher than the statutory prejudgment rates; and that the solvency of the parties was not a significant factor, since each appeared to be financially sound.  Dismissing the case for want of an appealable order, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court had abused its discretion by granting the Rule 54(b) certification, since the possibility of a setoff required that the status quo be maintained unless petitioner could show harsh or unusual circumstances and since no such showing had been made.
Held:  The District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting petitioner's motion for certification under Rule 54(b).  Pp.  446 U. S. 7-13.
(a) In deciding whether there are just reasons to delay an appeal of individual final judgments in a setting such as this, a district court must take into account the interests of sound judicial administration, as well as the equities involved.  Hence, it was proper for the District Court here to consider such factors as whether the claims under review were separable from the others remaining to be adjudicated and whether the nature of the claims already determined was such that no appellate court would have to decide the same issues more than once even if there were subsequent appeals.  The mere presence of nonfrivolous counterclaims does not render a Rule 54(b) certification inappropriate.  Pp.  446 U. S. 8-9.
(b) The Court of Appeals' holding that the status quo had to be maintained absent a showing by petitioner of harsh or unusual circumstances reflects a misinterpretation of the standard of review for Rule 54(b) certifications and a misperception of the appellate function in such cases.  Pp.  446 U. S. 9-10.
(c) The proper standard against which a district court's exercise of discretion in granting a Rule 54(b) certification is to be judged is the interest of sound judicial administration.  Under this standard, although the court of appeals must scrutinize the district court's evaluation of such factors as the interrelationship of the claims so as to prevent piecemeal appeals, once such juridical concerns have been met, the district court's discretionary judgment should be given substantial deference, and the court of appeals should disturb the district court's assessment of the equities only if it can say that the district judge's conclusion was clearly unreasonable.  Pp.  446 U. S. 10-11.
(d) The question before the District Court here came down to which of the parties should get the benefit of the difference between the prejudgment 
Page 446 U. S. 3
 and market rates of interest on the debts admittedly owing and adjudged to be due while unrelated claims were litigated.  While the possibility of a setoff against the amount respondent owed petitioner was not an insignificant factor, the District Court took this into account when it determined that both litigants appeared to be financially sound, and that petitioner would be able to satisfy a judgment on the counterclaims if any were entered.  Pp.  446 U. S. 11-12.

Syllabus 
Respondent brought suit in Federal District Court in Indiana on behalf of her deceased son's estate, alleging that her son, while a prisoner in a federal prison in Indiana, suffered personal injuries from which he died because petitioner prison officials violated, inter alia, his Eighth Amendment rights by failing to give him proper medical attention.  Asserting jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1331(a), respondent claimed compensatory and punitive damages.  The District Court held that the allegations pleaded a violation of the Eighth Amendment's proscription against cruel and unusual punishment, thus giving rise to a cause of action for damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, under which it was established that victims of a constitutional violation by a federal official have a right to recover damages against the official in federal court despite the absence of any statute conferring such a right.  But the court dismissed the complaint on the ground that, although the decedent could have maintained the action if he had survived, the damages remedy, as a matter of federal law, was limited to that provided by Indiana's survivorship and wrongful death laws, which the court construed as making the damages available to the decedent's estate insufficient to meet  1331(a)'s $10,000 jurisdictional amount requirement.  While otherwise agreeing with the District Court, the Court of Appeals held that the latter requirement was satisfied because, whenever a state survivorship statute would abate a Bivens-type action, the federal common law allows survival of the action.
Held:
1. A Bivens remedy is available to respondent even though the allegations could also support a suit against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).  Pp.  446 U. S. 18-23.
(a) Neither of the situations in which a cause of action under Bivens may be defeated are present here.  First, the case involves no special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress, petitioners not enjoying such independent status in our 
Page 446 U. S. 15
 constitutional scheme as to suggest that judicially created remedies against them might be inappropriate.  Second, there is no explicit congressional declaration that persons injured by federal officers' violations of the Eighth Amendment may not recover damage's from the officers, but must be remitted to another remedy, equally effective in Congress' view.  There is nothing in the FTCA or its legislative history to show that Congress meant to preempt a Bivens remedy or to create an equally effective remedy for constitutional violations.  Rather, in the absence of a contrary expression from Congress, the FTCA's provision creating a cause of action against the United States for intentional torts committed by federal law enforcement officers, contemplates that victims of the kind of intentional wrongdoing alleged in the complaint in this case shall have an action under the FTCA against the United States as well as a Bivens action against the individual officials alleged to have infringed their constitutional rights.  Pp.  446 U. S. 18-20.
(b) The following factors also support the conclusion that Congress did not intend to limit respondent to an FTCA action:  (i) the Bivens remedy, being recoverable against individuals, is a more effective deterrent than the FTCA remedy against the United States; (ii) punitive damages may be awarded in a Bivens suit, but are statutorily prohibited in an FTCA suit; (iii) a plaintiff cannot opt for a jury trial in an FTCA action, as he may in a Bivens suit; and (iv) an action under the FTCA exists only if the State in which the alleged misconduct occurred would permit a cause of action for that misconduct to go forward.  Pp.  446 U. S. 20-23.
2. Since Bivens actions are a creation of federal law, the question whether respondent's action survived her son's death is a question of federal law.  Only a uniform federal rule of survivorship will suffice to redress the constitutional deprivation here alleged and to protect against repetition of such conduct.  Robertson v. Wegmann, 436 U.

Syllabus 
Mobile, Ala., is governed by a Commission consisting of three members elected at large who jointly exercise all legislative, executive, and administrative power in the city.  Appellees brought a class action in Federal District Court against the city and the incumbent Commissioners on behalf of all Negro citizens of the city, alleging, inter alia, that the practice of electing the City Commissioners at large unfairly diluted the voting strength of Negroes in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  Although finding that Negroes in Mobile ""register and vote without hindrance,"" the District Court nevertheless held that the at-large electoral system violated the Fifteenth Amendment and invidiously discriminated against Negroes in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and ordered that the Commission be disestablished and replaced by a Mayor and a Council elected from single-member districts.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  446 U. S. 61-80;  446 U. S. 80-83;  446 U. S. 83-94.
571 F.2d 238, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded:
1. Mobile's at-large electoral system does not violate the rights of the city's Negro voters in contravention of the Fifteenth Amendment.  Racially discriminatory motivation is a necessary ingredient of a Fifteenth Amendment violation.  The Amendment does not entail the right to have Negro candidates elected, but prohibits only purposefully discriminatory denial or abridgment by government of the freedom to vote ""on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.""  Here, having found that Negroes in Mobile register and vote without hindrance, the courts below erred in believing that appellants invaded the protection of the Fifteenth Amendment.  Pp.  446 U. S. 61-65.
2. Nor does Mobile's at-large electoral system violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  446 U. S. 65-80. 
Page 446 U. S. 56

(a) Only if there is purposeful discrimination can there be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  And this principle applies to claims of racial discrimination affecting voting just as it does to other claims of racial discrimination.  Pp.  446 U. S. 66-68.
(b) Disproportionate effects alone are insufficient to establish a claim of unconstitutional racial vote dilution.  Where the character of a law is readily explainable on grounds apart from race, as would nearly always be true where, as here, an entire system of local governance is brought into question, disproportionate impact alone cannot be decisive, and courts must look to other evidence to support a finding of discriminatory purpose.  Pp.  446 U. S. 68-70.
(c) Even assuming that an at-large municipal electoral system such as Mobile's is constitutionally indistinguishable from the election of a few members of a state legislature in multimember districts, it is clear that the evidence in this case fell far short of showing that appellants ""conceived or operated [a] purposeful devic[e] to further racial . . . discrimination,"" Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124,  403 U. S. 149.  Pp.  446 U. S. 70-74.
(d) The Equal Protection Clause does not require proportional representation as an imperative of political organization.  While the Clause confers a substantive right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other qualified voters, this right does not protect any ""political group,"" however defined, from electoral defeat.  Since Mobile is a unitary electoral district and the Commission elections are conducted at large, there can be no claim that the ""one person, one vote"" principle has been violated, and therefore nobody's vote has been ""diluted"" in the sense in which that word was used in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533.  Pp.  446 U. S. 75-80.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded that the relief afforded appellees by the District Court was not commensurate with the sound exercise of judicial discretion.  The court at least should have considered alternative remedial orders to converting Mobile's government to a mayor-council system, and, in failing to do so, the court appears to have been overly concerned with eliminating at-large elections per se, rather than with structuring an electoral system that provided an opportunity for black voters to participate in the city's government on an equal footing with whites.  Pp.  446 U. S. 80-83.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that the proper standard for adjudging the constitutionality of a political structure, such as Mobile's, that treats all individuals as equals but adversely affects the political strength of an identifiable minority group, is the same whether the minority is identified by a racial, ethnic, religious, or economic characteristic; that Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, suggests that the standard asks 
Page 446 U. S. 57
 (1) whether the political structure is manifestly not the product of a routine or traditional decision, (2) whether it has a significant adverse impact on a minority group, and (3) whether it is unsupported by any neutral justification and thus was either totally irrational or entirely motivated by a desire to curtail the political strength of the minority; and that the standard focuses on the objective effects of the political decision, rather than the subjective motivation of the decisionmaker.  Under this standard, the choice to retain Mobile's commission form of government must be accepted as constitutionally permissible even though the choice may well be the product of mixed motivation, some of which is invidious.  Pp.  446 U. S. 83-94.
STEWART, J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered an opinion, in which BURGER, C.J., and POWELL and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined.  BLACKMUN, J., filed an opinion concurring in the result, post, p.  446 U. S. 80.  STEVENS, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, post, p.  446 U. S. 83.  BRENNAN, J., post, p.  446 U.

No. 79-381
Argued February 25, 1980

446 U.S. 142

Syllabus 
Held:  The provision of the Missouri workers' compensation laws denying a widower benefits on his wife's work-related death unless he either is mentally or physically incapacitated or proves dependence on his wife's earnings, but granting a widow death benefits without her having to prove dependence on her husband's earnings, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  446 U. S. 147-152.
(a) The statute indisputably mandates gender-based discrimination and discriminates against both men and women.  It discriminates against a woman, since, in the case of her death, benefits are payable to her spouse only if he meets the incapacity or dependency tests, whereas death benefits are automatically paid to a widow because dependency on her husband is conclusively presumed, a female wage earner thus being provided with less protection for her spouse on her work-related death than is provided for the widow of a deceased male wage earner.  And the statute discriminates against a man who survives his wife's dying in a work-related accident because to receive benefits he, in contrast to a widow, must prove incapacity or dependency.  Pp.  446 U. S. 147-149.
(b) To be justified, gender-based discriminations must serve important governmental objectives and the discriminatory means employed must be substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.  Here, the claimed justification for not treating men and women alike -- that women are generally dependent on male wage earners and that it is more efficient to presume dependency in the case of women than to engage in case-by-case determination, whereas individualized inquiries in the few cases in which men might be dependent are not prohibitively costly -- is unsubstantiated, and thus cannot save the gender-based discrimination in question.

No. 78-1840
Argued October 10, 1979
Decided April 22, 1980
446 U.S. 156

Syllabus 
In 1966, appellant city of Rome, Ga., made certain changes in its electoral system, including provisions for majority, rather than plurality, vote for each of the nine members of the City Commission; for three numbered posts within each of the three (reduced from nine) wards; and for staggered terms for the commissioners and for members of the Board of Education from each ward; and a requirement that members of the Board reside in the wards from which they were elected.  In addition, the city made 60 annexations between November 1, 1964, and February 10, 1975.  Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Act) requires preclearance by the Attorney General of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia of any change in a ""standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting"" made after November 1, 1964, by jurisdictions that fall within the coverage formula set forth in  4(b) of the Act.  Section 5 further provides that the Attorney General may clear a voting practice only if it ""does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.""  Georgia was designated a covered jurisdiction in 1965, and the municipalities of that State accordingly must comply with the preclearance procedure.  Eventually, after at first having failed to do so, Rome submitted the annexations and the 1966 electoral changes for preclearance, but the Attorney General declined to preclear the above-enumerated electoral changes, concluding that, in a city such as Rome, in which the population is predominately white and racial bloc voting has been common, such electoral changes would deprive Negro voters of the opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice.  The Attorney General also refused to preclear 13 of the 60 annexations, finding that the city had not carried its burden of proving that the disapproved annexations would not dilute the Negro vote.  Subsequently, however, in response to the city's motion for reconsideration, the Attorney General agreed to preclear the 13 annexations for Board of Education elections, but still refused to preclear them for City Commission elections.  The city and two of its officials then filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking relief from the Act based on a variety 
Page 446 U. S. 157
 of claims.  A three-judge court rejected the city's arguments and granted summary judgment for the defendants, finding that the disapproved electoral changes and annexations, while not made for any discriminatory purpose, did have a discriminatory effect.  The court refused to allow the city to ""bail out"" of the Act's coverage pursuant to  4(a), which allows a covered jurisdiction to escape  5's preclearance requirement by bringing a declaratory judgment action and proving that no ""test or device"" has been used in the jurisdiction during the 17 years preceding the filing of the action ""for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.""
Held:
1. The city may not use  4(a)'s ""bailout"" procedure.  In  4(a)'s terms, the issue depends on whether the city is either a ""State with respect to which the determinations have been made"" under  4(b) or a ""political subdivision with respect to which such determinations have been made as a separate unit,"" and here the city fails to meet the definition of either term, since  4(b)'s coverage formula has never been applied to it.  The city comes within the Act only because it is part of a covered State, and, hence, any ""bailout"" action to exempt the city must be filed by, and seek to exempt all of, the State.  Moreover, the legislative history precludes any argument that  4(a)'s ""bailout"" procedure, made available to a covered ""State,"" was also implicitly made available to political units in the State.  Pp.  446 U. S. 162-169.
2. The 60-day period under the Attorney General's regulation requiring requests for reconsideration of his refusal to preclear electoral changes to be decided within 60 days of their receipt, commences anew when the submitting jurisdiction deems its initial submission on a reconsideration motion to be inadequate and decides to supplement it.  Thus, here, where the city, less than 60 days prior to the Attorney General's decision on the city's reconsideration motion, submitted, on its own accord, affidavits to supplement the motion, the Attorney General's response was timely.  A contrary ruling that the 60-day period ran continuously from the date of the initial submission of the reconsideration motion would mean that the Attorney General would, in some cases, be unable to give adequate consideration to materials submitted in piecemeal fashion, and might be able to respond only by denying the reconsideration motion.  Pp.  446 U. S. 170-172.
3. By describing in  5 the elements of discriminatory purpose and effect in the conjunctive, Congress plainly intended that a voting practice not be precleared unless both discriminatory purpose and effect are absent.  Furthermore, Congress recognized this when, in 1975, it extended the Act for another seven years.  Pp.  446 U. S. 172-173. 
Page 446 U. S. 158

4. The Act does not exceed Congress' power to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment.  Under  2 of that Amendment, Congress may prohibit practices that, in and of themselves, do not violate  1 of the Amendment, so long as the prohibitions attacking racial discrimination in voting are ""appropriate.""  Here, the Act's ban on electoral changes that are discriminatory in effect is an appropriate method of promoting the Fifteenth Amendment's purposes, even if it is assumed that  1 prohibits only intentional discrimination in voting.  South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301.  Congress could rationally have concluded that, because electoral changes by jurisdictions with a demonstrable history of intentional racial discrimination in voting create a risk of purposeful discrimination, it was proper to prohibit changes that have a discriminatory impact.  Pp.  446 U. S. 173-178.
5. The Act does not violate principles of federalism.  Principles of federalism that might otherwise be an obstacle to congressional authority are necessarily overridden by the power to enforce the Civil War Amendments ""by appropriate legislation,"" Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, such Amendments being specifically designed as an expansion of federal power and an intrusion on state sovereignty.  Accordingly, Congress had the authority to regulate state and local voting through the provisions of the Act.  Pp.  446 U. S. 178-180.
6. There is no merit to appellants' contention that the Act and its preclearance requirement had outlived their usefulness by 1975, when Congress extended the Act for another seven years.  In view of Congress' considered determination that at least another seven years of statutory remedies were necessary to counter the perpetuation of 95 years of pervasive voting discrimination, the extension of the Act was plainly a constitutional method of enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment.  Pp.  446 U. S. 180-182
7. Nor is there any merit to the individual appellants' argument that, because no elections have been held in appellant city since 1974, their First, Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendment rights as private citizens of the city have been abridged.  Under circumstances where, upon the Attorney General's refusal to preclear the electoral changes, the city could have conducted elections under its prior electoral scheme, the city's failure to hold elections can only be attributed to its own officials, and not the operation of the Act.  Pp.  446 U. S. 182-183.
8. The District Court's findings that the city had failed to prove that the 1966 electoral changes and the annexations disapproved by the Attorney General did not have a discriminatory effect are not clearly erroneous.  Pp.  446 U. S. 183-187.

No. 78-1779
Argued January 8, 1980
Decided April 16, 1980
445 U.S. 622

Syllabus 
After the City Council of respondent city moved that reports of an investigation of the city police department be released to the news media and turned over to the prosecutor for presentation to the grand jury and that the City Manager take appropriate action against the persons involved in the wrongful activities brought out in the investigative reports, the City Manager discharged petitioner from his position as Chief of Police.  No reason was given for the dismissal, and petitioner received only a written notice stating that the dismissal was made pursuant to a specified provision of the city charter.  Subsequently, petitioner brought suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against the city, the respondent City Manager, and the respondent members of the City Council in their official capacities, alleging that he was discharged without notice of reasons and without a hearing in violation of his constitutional rights to procedural and substantive due process, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court, after a bench trial, entered judgment for respondents.  The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed, holding that, although the city had violated petitioner's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, nevertheless all the respondents, including the city, were entitled to qualified immunity from liability based on the good faith of the city officials involved.

The principle of sovereign immunity from which a municipality's immunity for ""governmental"" functions derives cannot serve as the basis for the qualified privilege respondent city claims under  1983, since sovereign immunity insulates a municipality from unconsented suits altogether, the presence or absence of good faith being irrelevant, and since the municipality's ""governmental"" immunity is abrogated by the sovereign's enactment of a statute such as  1983 making it amenable to suit.  And the doctrine granting a municipality immunity for ""discretionary"" functions, which doctrine merely prevented courts from substituting their own judgment on matters within the lawful discretion of the municipality, cannot serve as the foundation for a good faith immunity under  1983, since a municipality has no ""discretion"" to violate the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  445 U. S. 644-650.
(d) Rejection of a construction of  1983 that would accord municipalities a qualified immunity for their good faith constitutional violations is compelled both by the purpose of  1983 to provide protection to those persons wronged by the abuse of governmental authority and to deter future constitutional violations, and by considerations of public policy.  In view of the qualified immunity enjoyed by most government officials, many victims of municipal malfeasance would be left remediless if the city were also allowed to assert a good faith defense.  The concerns that justified decisions conferring qualified immunities on various government officials -- the injustice, particularly in the absence of bad faith, of subjecting the official to liability, and the danger that the threat of such liability would deter the official's willingness to execute his office effectively -- are less compelling, if not wholly inapplicable, when the liability of the municipal entity is at issue.

No. 78-1779
Argued January 8, 1980
Decided April 16, 1980
445 U.S. 622

Syllabus 
After the City Council of respondent city moved that reports of an investigation of the city police department be released to the news media and turned over to the prosecutor for presentation to the grand jury and that the City Manager take appropriate action against the persons involved in the wrongful activities brought out in the investigative reports, the City Manager discharged petitioner from his position as Chief of Police.  No reason was given for the dismissal, and petitioner received only a written notice stating that the dismissal was made pursuant to a specified provision of the city charter.  Subsequently, petitioner brought suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against the city, the respondent City Manager, and the respondent members of the City Council in their official capacities, alleging that he was discharged without notice of reasons and without a hearing in violation of his constitutional rights to procedural and substantive due process, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court, after a bench trial, entered judgment for respondents.  The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed, holding that, although the city had violated petitioner's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, nevertheless all the respondents, including the city, were entitled to qualified immunity from liability based on the good faith of the city officials involved.
Held:  A municipality has no immunity from liability under  1983 flowing from its constitutional violations, and may not assert the good faith of its officers as a defense to such liability.  Pp.  445 U. S. 635-658.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted under the District of Columbia Code of the separate statutory offenses of rape and of killing the same victim in the perpetration of the rape.  Under the Code, the latter offense is a species of first-degree murder, but the statute, although requiring proof of a killing and of the commission or attempted commission of rape, does not require proof of an intent to kill.  Petitioner was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment of 20 years to life for first-degree murder, and of 15 years to life for rape.  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences, rejecting petitioner's contention that his sentence for rape was improper because that offense merged for purposes of punishment with the felony murder offense, and thus that the imposition of cumulative punishments for the two offenses was contrary to the federal statutes and to the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Held:  The Court of Appeals was mistaken in believing that Congress authorized consecutive sentences in the circumstances of this case, and that error denied petitioner his right to be deprived of liberty as punishment for criminal conduct only to the extent authorized by Congress.  Pp.  445 U. S. 686-695.
(a) The customary deference ordinarily afforded by this Court to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals' construction of local federal legislation is inappropriate with respect to the statutes involved in this case, because petitioner's claim under the Double Jeopardy Clause, which protects against multiple punishments for the same offense, cannot be separated entirely from a resolution of the question of statutory construction.  If a federal court exceeds its own authority by imposing multiple punishments not authorized by Congress, it violates not only the specific guarantee against double jeopardy, but also the constitutional principle of separation of powers in a manner that trenches particularly harshly on individual liberty.  Pp.  445 U. S. 688-690.
(b) Neither of the provisions of the District of Columbia Code specifying the separate offenses involved here indicates whether Congress authorized consecutive sentences where both statutes have been offended in a single criminal episode.  However, another Code section, when construed in light of its history and its evident purpose, indicates 
Page 445 U. S. 685
 that multiple punishments cannot be imposed for two offenses arising out of the same criminal transaction unless each offense ""requires proof of a fact which the other does not.""  The statute embodies in this respect the rule of statutory construction stated in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299,  284 U. S. 304, and, in this case, leads to the conclusion that Congress did not authorize consecutive sentences for rape and for a killing committed in the course of the rape, since it is plainly not the case that each provision ""requires proof of a fact which the other does not.""

Syllabus 
The Carey Act of 1894, in order to aid covered States in the reclamation of desert lands, ""authorize[s] and empower[s]"" the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), with the President's approval, upon proper application by a State to donate, grant, and patent such desert lands, not exceeding a specified acreage, as the State should cause to be irrigated, reclaimed, and occupied, provided however, that the lands may be restored to the public domain if the requirements as to reclamation are not satisfied within stated time limits.  Under 43 U.S.C.  643, the Secretary was also authorized, upon request of a State, to withdraw desert lands temporarily from the public domain prior to the State's submission of a formal plan under the Carey Act.  Acting pursuant to 43 U.S.C.  643, Idaho requested that a certain tract of land be temporarily withdrawn from the public domain pending the submission of a proposed development plan under the Act.  The Idaho Office of the Bureau of Land Management rejected the application in part because some of the lands requested had already been withdrawn for other purposes, including a portion being used as a stock driveway.  Idaho appealed to the Interior Board of Land Appeals with respect to the lands previously withdrawn for stock-driveway purposes, and also petitioned the Board for reclassification of the stock-driveway lands as suitable for use under the Act.  Ultimately, the Board affirmed the rejection of Idaho's Carey Act application and returned the case to the Bureau of Land Management for initial action on the petition for reclassification of the stock-driveway lands and for further action on the remaining lands covered by the application for temporary withdrawal.  Meanwhile, Idaho filed suit in Federal District Court for a declaration of its rights under the Act.  That court held that the State was entitled to up to 2.4 million acres of desert land for which the Secretary was obligated to contract with the State pursuant to the terms of the Act; that the Act, however, was not a grant in praesenti, and the State did not have an absolute right to the particular desert lands that it happened to select; and that, if the lands had been withdrawn for another public use pursuant to another statute, the State's remedy was to request reclassification, which the Secretary could not arbitrarily deny.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
Page 445 U. S. 716

Held:
1. There is a real case or controversy with respect to the issue presented in the United States' petition for certiorari as to whether, under the Act, the State was entitled to 2.4 million acres of desert land which the Secretary then must reserve from appropriation to other public or private uses, and not just as to the State's entitlement to the lands that had been withdrawn for stock-driveway purposes and that were involved in its Interior Department appeal.  Throughout the administrative and judicial proceedings, the parties have taken contrary positions as to whether the State is absolutely entitled to select and have withdrawn under the Act up to 2.4 million acres of desert land regardless of whether the lands it designates have already been withdrawn for other purposes, provided only that statutory preconditions are satisfied.  Pp.  445 U. S. 722-725.
2. It is apparent from the language and legislative history of the Act that Congress did not intend to reserve any specific number of acres of desert land for any State under the Act, and the Act does not prevent the Secretary from committing otherwise available parts of the public domain for any of the uses authorized under the various statutes relating to the use and management of the public lands.  The Act does not oblige the Secretary automatically to contract for lands chosen by the State even if its application otherwise conforms to the statute.  Hence, even though a State's selection has not been withdrawn for other uses, the Secretary need not always approve the application.  Pp. 725-731.

Syllabus 
Section 1 of the Indian General Allotment Act of 1877 authorizes the President to allot to each Indian residing on a reservation specified acreage of agricultural and grazing land within the reservation;  2 provides that all such allotments shall be selected by the Indians so as to include improvements made by them; and  5 provides that the United States shall retain title to such allotted lands in trust for the benefit of the allottees.  Pursuant to the Act, the Government allotted all of the Quinault Reservation's land in trust to individual Indians.  Respondents, individual allottees of land in that Reservation, the Quinault Tribe, which now holds some allotments, and an association of allottees, brought actions, consolidated in the Court of Claims, to recover damages from the Government for alleged mismanagement of timber resources found on the Reservation.  Denying the Government's motion to dismiss the actions on the alleged ground that it had not waived its sovereign immunity with respect to the asserted claims, the Court of Claims held that the General Allotment Act created a fiduciary duty on the United States' part to manage the timber resources properly, and constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity against a suit for money damages as compensation for breaches of that duty.
Held:  The General Allotment Act cannot be read as establishing that the United States has a fiduciary responsibility for management of allotted forest lands, and thus does not provide respondents with a cause of action for the damages sought.  Pp.  445 U. S. 538-546.
(a) Neither the Tucker Act, under which the individual claimants premised jurisdiction in the Court of Claims, nor  24 of the Indian Claims Commission Act, on which jurisdiction over the Tribe's claim was based, confers a substantive right against the United States to recover money damages.  Pp.  445 U. S. 538-540.
(b) The General Allotment Act created only a limited trust relationship between the United States and the allottee that does not impose any duty upon the Government to manage timber resources.  The language of  5 of the Act must be read in pari materia with the language of  1 and 2, both of which indicate that the Indian allottee, and not a representative of the United States, is responsible for using the land for agricultural or grazing purposes.  The Act's legislative history also 
Page 445 U. S. 536
 indicates that the trust Congress placed on allotted lands is of limited scope, it appearing that, when Congress enacted the Act, it intended that the United States hold the lands in trust not because it wished the Government to control use of the lands and be subject to money damages for breaches of fiduciary duty, but simply because it wished to prevent alienation of the lands and to ensure that allottees would be immune from state taxation.  Furthermore, certain events surrounding and following the Act's passage indicate that it should not be read as authorizing, much less requiring, the Government to manage timber resources for the benefit of Indian allottees.

 indicates that the trust Congress placed on allotted lands is of limited scope, it appearing that, when Congress enacted the Act, it intended that the United States hold the lands in trust not because it wished the Government to control use of the lands and be subject to money damages for breaches of fiduciary duty, but simply because it wished to prevent alienation of the lands and to ensure that allottees would be immune from state taxation.  Furthermore, certain events surrounding and following the Act's passage indicate that it should not be read as authorizing, much less requiring, the Government to manage timber resources for the benefit of Indian allottees.

Held:  The District Court properly considered, as one factor in imposing consecutive sentences on petitioner who had pleaded guilty to two counts of using a telephone to facilitate the distribution of heroin, petitioner's refusal to cooperate with Government officials investigating a related criminal conspiracy to distribute heroin in which he was a confessed participant.  Pp.  445 U. S. 556-562.
(a) No misinformation of constitutional magnitude was present in this case; petitioner rebuffed repeated requests for his cooperation over a period of three years, and concedes that cooperation with the authorities is a ""laudable endeavor"" that bears a ""rational connection to a defendant's willingness to shape up and change his behavior.""  By declining to cooperate, petitioner rejected an obligation of community life that should be recognized before rehabilitation can begin, and protected his former partners in crime, thereby preserving his ability to resume criminal activities upon release.  Pp.  445 U. S. 556-558.
(b) Nor can petitioner's failure to cooperate be justified on the basis of fears of physical retaliation and self-incrimination, or on the ground that the District Court punished him for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  These arguments were raised for the first time in petitioner's appellate brief, neither petitioner nor his lawyer having offered any explanation to the sentencing court, even though it was known that petitioner's intransigency would be used against him.  Although the requirement of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, of specific warnings creates a limited exception to the rule that the privilege against self-incrimination is not self-executing, and must be claimed, the exception does not apply outside the context of the inherently coercive custodial interrogation for which it was designed, and here there was no custodial interrogation.  Petitioner volunteered his confession at his first interview with investigators, after Miranda warnings had been given and at a time when he was free to leave.  For the next three years, until the time when he received the sentence he now challenges, neither he nor his counsel -- who were both fully apprised that the extent of petitioner's cooperation could be expected to affect his sentence -- ever claimed that petitioner's unwillingness to cooperate

These appeals challenge the constitutionality of New York statutes authorizing police officers to enter a private residence without a warrant and with force, if necessary, to make a routine felony arrest.  In each of the appeals, police officers, acting with probable cause but without warrants, had gone to the appellant's residence to arrest the appellant on a felony charge and had entered the premises without the consent of any occupant.  In each case, the New York trial judge held that the warrantless entry was authorized by New York statutes and refused to suppress evidence that was seized upon the entry.  Treating both cases as involving routine arrests in which there was ample time to obtain a warrant, the New York Court of Appeals, in a single opinion, ultimately affirmed the convictions of both appellants.
Held:  The Fourth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the police from making a warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect's home in order to make a routine felony arrest.  Pp.  445 U. S. 583-603.
(a) The physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.  To be arrested in the home involves not only the invasion attendant to all arrests, but also an invasion of the sanctity of the home, which is too substantial an invasion to allow without a warrant, in the absence of exigent circumstances, even when it is accomplished under statutory authority and when probable cause is present.  In terms that apply equally to seizures of property and to seizures of persons, the Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house.  Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.  Pp  445 U. S. 583-590.
(b) The reasons for upholding warrantless arrests in a public place, cf. United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, do not apply to warrantless invasions of the privacy of the home.  The common law rule on warrantless home arrests was not as clear as the rule on arrests in public places; the weight of authority as it appeared to the Framers of the 
Page 445 U. S. 574
 Fourth Amendment was to the effect that a warrant was required for a home arrest, or, at the minimum, that there were substantial risks in proceeding without one.  Although a majority of the States that have taken a position on the question permit warrantless home arrests even in the absence of exigent circumstances, there is an obvious declining trend, and there is by no means the kind of virtual unanimity on this question that was present in United States v. Watson, supra, with regard to warrantless public arrests.  And, unlike the situation in Watson, no federal statutes have been cited to indicate any congressional determination that warrantless entries into the home are ""reasonable.""  Pp.  445 U. S. 590-601.
(c) For Fourth Amendment purposes, an arrest warrant founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to believe the suspect is within.  Pp.  445 U. S. 602-603.

Syllabus 
Respondents, both Republicans, brought suit in Federal District Court to enjoin petitioner, a Democrat, who had recently been appointed Public Defender of Rockland County, N.Y. by the Democrat-dominated county legislature, from discharging respondents from their positions as Assistant Public Defenders.  Finding that respondents had been satisfactorily performing their jobs and had been selected for termination solely because they were Republicans, and that an assistant public defender is neither a policymaker nor a confidential employee, the District Court held that petitioner could not terminate respondents' employment consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and granted injunctive relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The First and Fourteenth Amendments protect respondents from discharge solely because of their political beliefs.  Pp.  445 U. S. 513-520.
(a) To prevail in this type of action, there is no requirement that dismissed government employees prove that they, or other employees, have been coerced into changing, either actually or ostensibly, their political allegiance.  Rather, it was sufficient for respondents here to prove that they were about to be discharged ""solely for the reason that they were not affiliated with or sponsored by the Democratic Party.""  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347,  427 U. S. 350.  Pp.  445 U. S. 513-517.
(b) The issue is not whether the label ""policymaker"" or ""confidential"" fits the particular public office in question, but rather whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the office.  Here, it is manifest that the continued employment of an assistant public defender cannot properly be conditioned upon his allegiance to the political party in control of the county government.  The primary, if not the only, responsibility of an assistant public defender is to represent individual citizens in controversy with the State.  Whatever policymaking occurs in his office must relate to individual clients' needs, and not to any partisan political interests.  Similarly, although an assistant is bound to obtain access to confidential information arising out of various attorney-client relationships, that information has no bearing on partisan political concerns.  Under these circumstances, 
Page 445 U. S. 508
 it would undermine, rather than promote, the effective performance of an assistant public defender's office to make his tenure dependent on his allegiance to the dominant political party.  Pp.  445 U. S. 517-520.

Syllabus 
Immediately after being assaulted and robbed at gunpoint, the victim notified the police and gave them a full description of her assailant.  Several days later, respondent, who matched the suspect's description, was seen by the police around the scene of the crime.  After an attempt to photograph him proved unsuccessful, respondent was taken into custody, ostensibly as a suspected truant from school, and was detained at police headquarters, where he was briefly questioned, photographed, and then released.  Thereafter, the victim identified respondent's photograph as that of her assailant.  Respondent was again taken into custody and at a court-ordered lineup was identified by the victim.  Respondent was then indicted for armed robbery and other offenses.  On respondent's pretrial motion to suppress all identification testimony, the trial court found that respondent's initial detention at the police station constituted an arrest without probable cause, and accordingly ruled that the products of that arrest -- the photographic and lineup identifications -- could not be introduced at trial, but further held that the victim's ability to identify respondent in court was based upon independent recollection untainted by the intervening identifications, and that therefore such testimony was admissible.  At trial, the victim once more identified respondent as her assailant, and respondent was convicted of armed robbery.  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the in court identification testimony should have been excluded as a product of the violation of respondent's Fourth Amendment rights.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  445 U. S. 470-477;  445 U. S. 477;  445 U. S. 477-479.
389 A.2d 277, reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C, concluding that:
The in-court identification need not be suppressed as the fruit of respondent's concededly unlawful arrest, but is admissible because the police's knowledge of respondent's identity and the victim's independent recollections of him both antedated the unlawful arrest, and were thus untainted by the constitutional violation.  Pp.  445 U. S. 470-474,  445 U. S. 477. 
Page 445 U. S. 464

(a) The victim's presence in the courtroom at respondent's trial was not the product of any police misconduct. Her identity was known long before there was any official misconduct, and her presence in court was thus not traceable to any Fourth Amendment violation.  Pp.  445 U. S. 471-472.
(b) Nor did the illegal arrest infect the victim's ability to give accurate identification testimony.  At trial, she merely retrieved her mnemonic representation of the assailant formed at the time of the crime, compared it to the figure of respondent in the courtroom, and positively identified him as the robber.  Pp.  445 U. S. 472-473.
(c) Insofar as respondent challenges his own presence at trial, he cannot claim immunity from prosecution simply because his appearance in court was precipitated by an unlawful arrest.  Respondent is not himself a suppressible ""fruit,"" and the illegality of his detention cannot deprive the Government of the opportunity to prove his guilt through the introduction of evidence wholly untainted by the police misconduct.  P.  445 U. S. 474.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Part II-D that the Court need not decide whether respondent's person should be considered evidence, and therefore a possible ""fruit"" of police misconduct, since the Fourth Amendment violation in question yielded nothing of evidentiary value that the police did not already have.  Respondent's unlawful arrest served merely to link together two extant ingredients in his identification.  While the exclusionary rule enjoins the Government from benefiting from evidence it has unlawfully obtained, it does not reach backward to taint information that was in official hands prior to any illegality.

No. 78-1155
Argued December 3, 1979
Decided March 25, 1980
445 U.S. 480

Syllabus 
Appellee, a convicted felon, was transferred from state prison to a mental hospital pursuant to a Nebraska statute ( 83-180(1)) which provides that, if a designated physician or psychologist finds that a prisoner ""suffers from a mental disease or defect"" that ""cannot be given proper treatment"" in prison, the Director of Correctional Services may transfer the prisoner to a mental hospital.  In an action challenging the constitutionality of  83-180(1) on procedural due process grounds, the District Court declared the statute unconstitutional as applied to appellee, holding that transferring him to the mental hospital without adequate notice and opportunity for a hearing deprived him of liberty without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, and that such transfers must be accompanied by adequate notice, an adversary hearing before an independent decisionmaker, a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the decision, and the availability of appointed counsel for indigent prisoners.  The court permanently enjoined the State from transferring appellee (who meanwhile had been transferred back to prison) to the mental hospital without following the prescribed procedures.  Subsequently, appellee was paroled on condition that he accept mental treatment, but he violated that parole and was returned to prison.  Relying on appellee's history of mental illness and the State's representation that he was a serious threat to his own and others' safety, the District Court held that the parole and revocation thereof did not render the case moot, because appellee was still subject to being transferred to the mental hospital.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed as modified.  Pp.  445 U. S. 486-497;  445 U. S. 497-500.
Affirmed as modified.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, IV-A, and V, concluding that:
1. The District Court properly found that the case is not moot.  The reality of the controversy between appellee and the State has not been lessened by the cancellation of his parole and his return to prison, where he is protected from further transfer by the District Court's judgment 
Page 445 U. S. 481
 and injunction.  Under these circumstances, it is not ""absolutely clear,"" absent the injunction, that the State's alleged wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.  Pp.  445 U. S. 486-487.
2. The involuntary transfer of appellee to a mental hospital implicates a liberty interest that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  445 U. S. 487-494.
(a) The District Court properly identified a liberty interest rooted in  83-180(1), under which a prisoner could reasonably expect that he would not be transferred to a mental hospital without a finding that he was suffering from a mental illness for which he could not secure adequate treatment in prison.  The State's reliance on the opinion of a designated physician or psychologist for determining whether the conditions warranting transfer exist neither removes the prisoner's interest from due process protection nor answers the question of what process is due under the Constitution.  Pp.  445 U. S. 488-491.
(b) The District Court was also correct in holding that, independently of  83-180(1), the transfer of a prisoner from a prison to a mental hospital must be accompanied by appropriate procedural protections.  Involuntary commitment to a mental hospital is not within the range of conditions of confinement to which a prison sentence subjects an individual.  While a conviction and sentence extinguish an individual's right to freedom from confinement for the term of his sentence, they do not authorize the State to classify him as mentally ill and to subject him to involuntary psychiatric treatment without affording him additional due process protections.  Here, the stigmatizing consequences of a transfer to a mental hospital for involuntary psychiatric treatment, coupled with the subjection of the prisoner to mandatory behavior modification as a treatment for mental illness, constitute the kind of deprivations of liberty that requires procedural protections.  Pp. 491-494.
3. The District Court properly identified and weighed the relevant factors in arriving at its judgment.  Pp.  445 U. S. 495-496.
(a) Although the State's interest in segregating and treating mentally ill patients is strong, the prisoner's interest in not being arbitrarily classified as mentally ill and subjected to unwelcome treatment is also powerful, and the risk of error in making the determinations required by  83-180(1) is substantial enough to warrant appropriate procedural safeguards against error.  P.  445 U. S. 495.
(b) The medical nature of the inquiry as to whether or not to transfer a prisoner to a mental hospital does not justify dispensing with due process requirements.  P.  445 U. S. 495. 
Page 445 U. S. 482

(c) Because prisoners facing involuntary transfer to a mental hospital are threatened with immediate deprivation of liberty interests, and because of the risk of mistaken transfer, the District Court properly determined that certain procedural protections, including notice and an adversary hearing, were appropriate in the circumstances present in this case.  Pp.  445 U. S. 495-496.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Part IV-B that it is appropriate that counsel be provided to indigent prisoners whom the State seeks to treat as mentally ill.  Such a prisoner has an even greater need for legal assistance than does a prisoner who is illiterate and uneducated, because he is more likely to be unable to understand or exercise his rights.  Pp.  445 U. S. 496-497.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL concluded that, although the State is free to appoint a licensed attorney to represent a prisoner who is threatened with involuntary transfer to a mental hospital, it is not constitutionally required to do so, and that due process will be satisfied so long as such a prisoner is provided qualified and independent assistance.  Pp.  445 U. S. 497-500.

445 U.S. 326

Syllabus 
Respondents, holders of credit cards issued by petitioner bank, sued petitioner for damages in Federal District Court, seeking to represent both their own interests and those of a class of similarly situated credit card customers.  The complaint, based on the National Bank Act, alleged that usurious finance charges had been made against the accounts of respondents and the putative class.  The District Court denied respondents' motion to certify the class, ruling that the circumstances did not meet all the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).  After the Court of Appeals denied respondents' motion for interlocutory appeal, petitioner tendered to each respondent the maximum amount that each could have recovered, but respondents refused to accept the tender.  The District Court, over respondents' objections, then entered judgment in their favor on the basis of the tender and dismissed the action, the amount of the tender being deposited by petitioner in the court's registry.  Respondents thereafter sought review of the class certification ruling, and the Court of Appeals concluded, inter alia, that the case had not been mooted by the entry of judgment in respondents' favor and reversed the adverse certification ruling.
Held:  Neither petitioner's tender nor the District Court's entry of judgment in favor of respondents over their objections mooted their private case or controversy, and their individual interest in the litigation -- as distinguished from whatever may be their representative responsibilities to the putative class -- is sufficient to permit their appeal of the adverse certification ruling.  Pp.  445 U. S. 331-340.
(a) In an appropriate case, appeal may be permitted from an adverse ruling collateral to the judgment on the merits at the behest of the party who has prevailed on the merits, so long as that party retains a stake in the appeal satisfying Art. III's case or controversy requirements.  Here, neither the rejected tender nor the dismissal of the action over respondents' objections mooted their claim on the merits so long as they retained an economic interest in class certification.  Pp.  445 U. S. 332-335.
(b) The denial of class certification is an example of a procedural ruling, collateral to the merits of a litigation, that is appealable after 
Page 445 U. S. 327
 the entry of final judgment.  The denial of certification stands as an adjudication of one of the issues litigated.  Respondents have asserted throughout this appellate litigation a continuing individual interest in the resolution of the class certification question in their desire to shift part of the costs of litigation to those who will share in its benefits if the class is certified and ultimately prevails.  Thus, they are entitled to have this portion of the District Court's judgment reviewed.

Syllabus 
A federal indictment charged respondent, then a Tennessee state senator, with accepting money as fees for using his public office to block the extradition of a defendant from Tennessee to Illinois, and for agreeing to introduce state legislation which would enable four persons to obtain master electricians' licenses they had been unable to obtain by way of existing examination processes.  The District Court granted respondent's motion to suppress all evidence relating to his legislative activities, holding that, as a state senator, respondent was entitled to a judicially created evidentiary privilege.  The District Court relied on Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which provides in relevant part that ""the privilege of a witness . . . shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's recognition of a privilege and its suppression of certain items of evidence; it held that other items of evidence were insufficiently related to the legislative process to be protected by the privilege.
Held:  In a federal criminal prosecution against a state legislator, there is no legislative privilege barring the introduction of evidence of the legislative acts of the legislator.  Pp.  445 U. S. 366-374.
(a) Rule 501's language and legislative history do not support respondent's arguments that a speech or debate type privilege for state legislators in federal criminal cases is an established part of the federal common law, and is therefore applicable through the Rule, or that such a privilege is compelled by principles of federalism.  Rule 501 requires the application of federal privilege law in criminal cases brought in federal court, and thus the fact that there is an evidentiary privilege under the Tennessee Constitution which respondent could assert in a state criminal prosecution does not compel an analogous privilege in a federal prosecution.  Pp.  445 U. S. 366-368.
(b) The historical antecedents and policy considerations which inspired the Speech or Debate Clause of the Federal Constitution do not require recognition of a comparable evidentiary privilege for state legislators in federal prosecutions.  The first rationale underlying the Speech or Debate Clause, resting solely on the separation of powers 
Page 445 U. S. 361
 doctrine, gives no support to the grant of a privilege to state legislators in federal prosecutions.  As to the second rationale underlying the Speech or Debate Clause, that is, the need to insure legislative independence, this Court's decisions on immunity of state officials from suit have drawn the line at civil actions.  Cf., e.g., Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367; O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488.  Where important federal interests are at stake, as in the enforcement of federal criminal statutes, principles of comity must yield.  Recognition of an evidentiary privilege for state legislators for their legislative acts would impair the legitimate interest of the Federal Government in enforcing its criminal statutes, with only speculative benefits to the state legislative process.  Pp.  445 U. S. 368-373.
(c) Congress has not chosen either to provide that a state legislator prosecuted under federal law should be accorded the same evidentiary privileges as a Member of Congress or to direct federal courts to apply to a state legislator the same evidentiary privileges available in a prosecution of a similar charge in the state courts.

In connection with an investigation of hazards in the operation of television receivers, respondent Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) obtained various accident reports from television manufacturers, including petitioners.  Respondents Consumers Union of the United States, Inc., and Public Citizen's Health Research Group (requesters) sought disclosure of the accident reports under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and the CPSC determined that the reports did not fall within any of the FOIA's exemptions and notified the requesters and the manufacturers that it would release the material on a specified date.  Petitioners then filed suits in various Federal District Courts to enjoin disclosure of the allegedly confidential reports, which suits were consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware.  While those suits were pending, the requesters filed the instant action against the CPSC, its Chairman, Commissioners, and Secretary, and petitioners in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking release of the accident reports under the FOIA.  That court dismissed the complaint while a motion for a preliminary injunction was still pending in Delaware, observing that the CPSC had assured the court that disclosure would be made as soon as the agency was not enjoined from doing so, and concluding, inter alia, that there was no Art. III case or controversy between the requesters and the federal defendants, and therefore no jurisdiction.  Ultimately, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that there was a case or controversy between the requesters and the CPSC as to the scope and effect of the proceedings in Delaware, and that a permanent injunction which meanwhile had been issued in the Delaware proceedings did not foreclose the requesters' FOIA suit.
Held:
1. There is a case or controversy as required to establish jurisdiction pursuant to Art. III even though the CPSC agrees with the requesters that the documents should be released under the FOIA.  While there is no case or controversy when the parties desire ""precisely the same result,"" here the parties do not desire ""precisely the same result,"" since 
Page 445 U. S. 376
 the CPSC contends that the Delaware injunction prevents it from releasing the documents, whereas the requesters believe that an equitable decree obtained by the manufacturers in a suit in which the requesters were not parties cannot deprive them of their rights under the FOIA.  Pp.  445 U. S. 382-383.
2. Information may not be obtained under the FOIA when the agency holding the material has been enjoined from disclosing it by a federal district court.  The Act gives federal district courts jurisdiction to order the production of ""improperly"" withheld agency records, but here the CPSC has not ""improperly"" withheld the accident reports.  The Act's legislative history shows that Congress was largely concerned with the unjustified suppression of information by agency officials in the exercise of their discretion, but here the CPSC had no discretion to exercise, since its sole basis for not releasing the documents was the injunction issued by the Federal District Court in Delaware.  The CPSC was required to obey the injunction out of respect for judicial process, and there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Congress intended to require an agency to commit contempt of court in order to release documents.

Syllabus 
Respondent, after twice being denied parole from a federal prison, brought suit against petitioners in Federal District Court challenging the validity of the United States Parole Commission's Parole Release Guidelines.  The District Court denied respondent's request for certification of the suit as a class action on behalf of a class of ""all federal prisoners who are or who will become eligible for release on parole,"" and granted summary judgment for petitioners on the merits.  Respondent was released from prison while his appeal to the Court of Appeals was pending, but that court held that this did not render the case moot, and went on to hold, with respect to the question whether the District Court had erroneously denied class certification, that class certification would not be inappropriate, since the problems of overbroad classes and of a potential conflict of interest between respondent and other members of the putative class could be remedied by the mechanism of subclasses.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reversed the denial of class certification and remanded the case to the District Court for an initial evaluation sua sponte of the proper subclasses.
Held:  An action brought on behalf of a class does not become moot upon expiration of the named plaintiff's substantive claim, even though class certification has been denied, since the proposed representative of the class retains a ""personal stake"" in obtaining class certification sufficient to assure that Art. III values are not undermined.  If the appeal from denial of the class certification results in reversal of the denial, and a class subsequently is properly certified, the merits of the class claim then may be adjudicated pursuant to the holding in Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, that mootness of the named plaintiff's individual claim after a class has been duly certified does not render the action moot.  Pp.  445 U. S. 395-408.
(a) The fact that a named plaintiff's substantive claims are mooted due to an occurrence other than a judgment on the merits, cf. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103; Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, ante p.  445 U. S. 326, does not mean that all other issues in the case are mooted.  A plaintiff who brings a class action presents two separate issues, one 
Page 445 U. S. 389
 being the claim on the merits and the other being the claim that he is entitled to represent a class.  ""The denial of class certification stands as an adjudication of one of the issues litigated,"" Roper, ante at  445 U. S. 336, and, in determining whether the plaintiff may continue to press the class certification claim after the claim on the merits ""expires,"" the nature of the ""personal stake"" in the class certification claim must be examined.  P.  445 U. S. 402.
(b) The imperatives of a dispute capable of judicial resolution -- sharply presented issues in a concrete factual setting and self-interested parties vigorously advocating opposing positions -- can exist with respect to the class certification issue notwithstanding that the named plaintiff's claim on the merits has expired.  Such imperatives are present in this case, where the question whether class certification is appropriate remains as a concrete, sharply presented issue and respondent continues vigorously to advocate his right to have a class certified.  Pp.  445 U. S. 403-404.
(c) Respondent was a proper representative for the purpose of appealing the ruling denying certification of the class that he initially defined, and hence it was not improper for the Court of Appeals to consider whether the District Court should have granted class certification.  P.  445 U. S. 407.
(d) The Court of Appeals' remand of the case for consideration of subclasses was a proper disposition, except that the burden of constructing subclasses is not upon the District Court, but upon the respondent.  Pp.  445 U. S. 407-408.

Syllabus 
Appellant is a corporation organized under the laws of New York, where it has its principal place of business and its ""commercial domicile.""  It does business in many States, including Vermont, where it engages in the wholesale and retail marketing of petroleum products.  Vermont imposed a corporate income tax, calculated by means of an apportionment formula, upon ""foreign source"" dividend income received by appellant from its subsidiaries and affiliates doing business abroad.  Appellant challenged the tax on the grounds, inter alia, that it violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause, but the tax ultimately was upheld by the Vermont Supreme Court.
Held:
1. The tax does not violate the Due Process Clause.  There is a sufficient ""nexus"" between Vermont and appellant to justify the tax, and neither the ""foreign source"" of the income in question nor the fact that it was received in the form of dividends from subsidiaries and affiliates precludes its taxability.  Appellant failed to establish that its subsidiaries and affiliates engage in business activities unrelated to its sale of petroleum products in Vermont, and accordingly it has failed to sustain its burden of proving that its ""foreign source"" dividends are exempt, as a matter of due process, from fairly apportioned income taxation by Vermont.  Pp.  445 U. S. 436-442.
2. Nor does the tax violate the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  445 U. S. 442-449.
(a) The tax does not impose a burden on interstate commerce by virtue of its effect relative to appellant's income tax liability in other States.  Assuming that New York, the State of ""commercial domicile,"" has the authority to impose some tax on appellant's dividend income, there is no reason why that power should be exclusive when the dividends reflect income from a unitary business, part of which is conducted in other States.  The income bears relation to benefits and privileges conferred by several States, and, in these circumstances, apportionment, rather than allocation, is ordinarily the accepted method of taxation.  Vermont's interest in taxing a proportionate share of appellant's dividend 
Page 445 U. S. 426
 income thus is not overridden by any interest of the State of ""commercial domicile.""  Pp.  445 U. S. 443-446.
(b) Nor does the tax impose a burden on foreign commerce.  Appellant's argument that the risk of multiple taxation abroad requires allocation of ""foreign source"" income to a single situs at home, is without merit in the present context.  That argument attempts to focus attention on the effect of foreign taxation when the effect of domestic taxation is the only real issue; its logic is not limited to dividend income, but would apply to any income arguably earned from foreign commerce, so that acceptance of the argument would make it difficult for state taxing authorities to determine whether income does or does not have a foreign source; the argument underestimates this Court's power to correct discriminatory taxation of foreign commerce that results from multiple state taxation; and its acceptance would not guarantee a lesser domestic tax burden on dividend income from foreign sources.  Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, which concerned property taxation of instrumentalities of foreign commerce, does not provide an analogy for this case.  Pp.  445 U.

Section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), ""after opportunity for public hearing,"" to issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant upon condition that such discharge will meet all applicable requirements of the FWPCA or such conditions as the Administrator determines are necessary to carry out the Act's goals and objectives.  Implementing regulations provide for public notice of the proposed issuance, denial, or modification of a permit; direct the EPA Regional Administrator to hold a public hearing on the proposed action if he finds a significant degree of public interest; and permit any interested person to request an ""adjudicatory hearing"" after the EPA's determination to take the proposed action.  Such a request will be granted if it ""[s]ets forth material issues of fact relevant to the questions of whether a permit should be issued, denied or modified.""  Respondent city of Los Angeles (city) owns a sewage treatment plant that is operated under permits issued by the EPA pursuant to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), established by the FWPCA.  The city's current permit, as issued in 1975, conditioned continued discharges from the sewage treatment plant into the Pacific Ocean on the city's compliance with a schedule for achieving full secondary treatment of wastewater by October 1, 1979.  In April, 1977, the EPA advised the city that it proposed to extend the expiration date of the 1975 permit for a second time, to December 17, 1979, with all other terms and conditions of the permit to remain unchanged.  Notice of the proposed action was published in the Los Angeles Times, but neither the city nor any other party, including respondent Pacific Legal Foundation, requested a hearing or filed comments on the proposed extension, and the EPA Regional Administrator determined that public interest in the modification proposal was insufficient to warrant a public hearing.  After respondent Kilroy's post-determination request for an adjudicatory hearing was denied on the ground that it did not set forth material 
Page 445 U. S. 199
 issues of fact relevant to the question whether the permit should be extended, respondents filed petitions with the Court of Appeals seeking review of the Regional Administrator's action.  The Court of Appeals held that the EPA had failed to provide the ""opportunity for public hearing"" required by  402(a)(1) when it extended the federal permit, and remanded for a ""proper hearing.""  In so holding, the court concluded that the EPA is required to justify every failure to hold a hearing on a permit action by proof that the material facts supporting the action ""are not subject to dispute.""
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the EPA is required to hold a public hearing on every NPDES permit action it takes unless it can show that the material facts supporting its action ""are not subject to dispute.""  Rather, the implementing regulations in question are fully consistent with the FWPCA's purpose to provide the public with an ""opportunity"" for a hearing concerning agency actions respecting water pollution control, and are valid.  Pp.  445 U. S. 213-216.
2. Respondents have failed to demonstrate that the regulations in question were not applied properly in the context of this case.  Pp.  445 U. S. 216-220.
(a) Under the circumstances presented here, it was reasonable for the Regional Administrator to extend the permit's expiration date without further public hearing, on the grounds that the public had not exhibited a significant degree of interest in the proposed action, and that information pertinent to such a decision would not have been adduced if a hearing had been held.  Pp.  445 U. S. 216-218.
(b) The form of notice by newspaper publication was adequate.  The city's argument that the notice was inadequate because its understanding of the compliance schedules was contrary to the EPA's was not pertinent to the agency's decision to extend the permit's expiration date.  Pp.  445 U. S. 218-219.
(c) The EPA did not err in failing to hold an adjudicatory hearing on the issues raised in respondent Kilroy's request because that request did not set forth material issues of fact pertinent to the question whether the permit's expiration date should be extended.  Pp.  445 U. S. 219-220.

The city's argument that the notice was inadequate because its understanding of the compliance schedules was contrary to the EPA's was not pertinent to the agency's decision to extend the permit's expiration date.  Pp.  445 U. S. 218-219.
(c) The EPA did not err in failing to hold an adjudicatory hearing on the issues raised in respondent Kilroy's request because that request did not set forth material issues of fact pertinent to the question whether the permit's expiration date should be extended.  Pp.  445 U. S. 219-220.

Syllabus 
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits the use
""in connection with the purchase or sale of any security . . . [of] any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [Securities and Exchange] Commission may prescribe.""
Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), promulgated under  10(b), makes it unlawful for any person to ""employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,"" or to
""engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.""
Petitioner, who was employed by a financial printer that had been engaged by certain corporations to print corporate takeover bids, deduced the names of the target companies from information contained in documents delivered to the printer by the acquiring companies and, without disclosing his knowledge, purchased stock in the target companies and sold the shares immediately after the takeover attempts were made public.  After the SEC began an investigation of his trading activities, petitioner entered into a consent decree with the SEC in which he agreed to return his profits to the sellers of the shares.  Thereafter, petitioner was indicted and convicted for violating  10(b) of the Act and SEC Rule 10b-5.  The District Court's charge permitted the jury to convict the petitioner if it found that he willfully failed to inform sellers of target company securities that he knew of a forthcoming takeover bid that would make their shares more valuable.  Petitioner's conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
Held:  Petitioner's conduct did not constitute a violation of  10(b), and hence his conviction was improper.  Pp.  445 U. S. 225-237.
(a) Administrative and judicial interpretations have established that silence in connection with the purchase or sale of securities may operate as a fraud actionable under  10(b) despite the absence of statutory language or legislative history specifically addressing the legality of nondisclosure.  However, such liability is premised upon a duty to disclose (such as that of a corporate insider to shareholders of his corporation) 
Page 445 U. S. 223
 arising from a relationship of trust and confidence between parties to a transaction.  Pp.  445 U. S. 225-230.
(b) Here, petitioner had no affirmative duty to disclose the information as to the plans of the acquiring companies.  He was not a corporate insider, and he received no confidential information from the target companies.  Nor could any duty arise from petitioner's relationship with the sellers of the target companies' securities, for he had no prior dealings with them, was not their agent, was not a fiduciary, and was not a person in whom the sellers had placed their trust and confidence.  A duty to disclose under  10(b) does not arise from the mere possession of nonpublic market information.  Pp.  445 U. S. 231-235.
(c) This Court need not decide whether petitioner's conviction can be supported on the alternative theory that he breached a duty to the acquiring corporation, since such theory was not submitted to the jury.  The jury instructions demonstrate that petitioner was convicted merely because of his failure to disclose material, nonpublic information to sellers from whom he bought the stock of target corporations.  The conviction cannot be affirmed on the basis of a theory not presented to the jury.  Pp.  445 U. S. 235-237.

445 U.S. 263

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who previously on two separate occasions had been convicted in Texas state courts and sentenced to prison for felonies (fraudulent use of a credit card to obtain $80 worth of goods or services, and passing a forged check in the amount of $28.36), was convicted of a third felony, obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses, and received a mandatory life sentence pursuant to Texas' recidivist statute.  After the Texas appellate courts had rejected his direct appeal as well as his subsequent collateral attacks on his imprisonment, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, claiming that his life sentence was so disproportionate to the crimes he had committed as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court rejected this claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, attaching particular importance to the probability that petitioner would be eligible for parole within 12 years of his initial confinement.
Held:  The mandatory life sentence imposed upon petitioner does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  445 U. S. 268-285.
(a) Texas' interest here is not simply that of making criminal the unlawful acquisition of another person's property, but is, in addition, the interest, expressed in all recidivist statutes, in dealing in a harsher manner with those who by repeated criminal acts have shown that they are incapable of conforming to the norms of society as established by its criminal law.  The Texas recidivist statute thus is nothing more than a societal decision that, when a person, such as petitioner, commits yet another felony, he should be subjected to the serious penalty of life imprisonment, subject only to the State's judgment as to whether to grant him parole.  Pp.  445 U. S. 276-278.
(b) While petitioner's inability to enforce any ""right"" to parole precludes treating his life sentence as equivalent to a 12 years' sentence, nevertheless, because parole is an established variation on imprisonment, a proper assessment of Texas' treatment of petitioner could not ignore the possibility that he will not actually be imprisoned for the rest of his life.  Pp.  445 U. S. 280-281. 
Page 445 U. S. 264

(c) Texas is entitled to make its own judgment as to the line dividing felony theft from petty larceny, subject only to those strictures of the Eighth Amendment that can be informed by objective factors.  Moreover, given petitioner's record, Texas was not require to treat him in the same manner as it might treat him were this his first ""petty property offense.""  Pp.  445 U. S. 284-285.

Argued November 28, 1979
Decided March 18, 1980
445 U.S. 308

Syllabus 
Held:  A Texas public nuisance statute, construed as authorizing state judges, on the basis of a showing that a theater exhibited obscene films in the past, to enjoin its future exhibition of films not yet found to be obscene, is unconstitutional as authorizing an invalid prior restraint.   The statute cannot be considered to be valid on the asserted ground that it constitutes no greater a prior restraint than any criminal statute, since presumably an exhibitor would be subject to contempt proceedings for violating a preliminary restraining order under the statute even if the film is ultimately found to be nonobscene, whereas nonobscenity would be a defense to any criminal prosecution.  Nor is the statute saved merely because the temporary restraint is entered by a state trial judge, rather than an administrative censor.  That a judge might be thought more likely than an administrative censor to determine accurately that a work is obscene does not change the unconstitutional character of the restraint if erroneously entered.  Thus, the absence of any special safeguards governing the entry and review of orders restraining the exhibition of named or unnamed motion pictures, without regard to the context in which they are displayed, precludes the enforcement of the nuisance statute against motion picture exhibitors.  Cf. Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51; Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioners seek to present two questions for decision: (a) whether the District Court properly found systemwide segregative intent on the part of petitioner school Board, and, (b) ""[w]hether the systemwide student reassignment plan ordered by the District Court, whereby every grade in every school must have a ratio of black and white students in approximate proportion to the systemwide ratio, exceeded the violation found, particularly where the evidence showed that Cleveland's residential areas are highly segregated by race."" Pet. for Cert. 3. With respect to the first issue of systemwide desegregation, the District Court found as follows in its exhaustive opinion: 
Page 445 U.S. 935 , 936
 more than 200 enumerated actions cited in the liability opinion for which the explanations of the defendants either were not credible or were not legally permissible. In these instances, the Court finds that the defendants acted (1) not only with awareness of the natural, probable, and foreseeable consequences of their acts, (2) but also with the purpose and intent to maintain racial segregation."" Reed v. Rhodes, 455 F.Supp. 546, 555 (N.D.Ohio 1978).
 The Court of Appeals affirmed this conclusion of the District Court in this language: 
 ""Our review of this record supports the District Judge's findings of fact in this regard and we find no fault in his conclusions of law, as stated above. The findings of fact certainly cannot be termed clearly erroneous, and the conclusions of law which pertain to his 1973 findings and his 1964 findings are both entirely consistent with the opinions of the Supreme Court in Columbus Board of Education v. Penick [439 U.S. 1348] ( 1979), and Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman [439 U.S. 1357, 99 S. Ct. 27] (1979)."" Reed v. Rhodes, 607 F.2d 714, 717 (C. A. [Footnote 6] 1979). 
 The Court of Appeals, I think, was undoubtedly correct in upholding this District Court's finding of systemwide segregative intent on the basis of this Court's decisions last Term in the Columbus and Dayton cases . I would therefore not vote to grant the petition on this first issue. 
 The Court of Appeals, however, devoted virtually no attention to the second issue-the propriety of the remedy imposed by the District Court. In the Court of Appeals' opinion, which comprises 46 pages of the appendix to the petition, less than 4 are devoted to the propriety of the remedy decreed, and none of those 4 pages deal with whether the remedy was appropriate, conceding that a systemwide remedy could be imposed. The court focused solely on the legitimacy [445 U.S. 935 , 937]

Penick [439 U.S. 1348] ( 1979), and Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman [439 U.S. 1357, 99 S. Ct. 27] (1979)."" Reed v. Rhodes, 607 F.2d 714, 717 (C. A. [Footnote 6] 1979). 
 The Court of Appeals, I think, was undoubtedly correct in upholding this District Court's finding of systemwide segregative intent on the basis of this Court's decisions last Term in the Columbus and Dayton cases . I would therefore not vote to grant the petition on this first issue. 
 The Court of Appeals, however, devoted virtually no attention to the second issue-the propriety of the remedy imposed by the District Court. In the Court of Appeals' opinion, which comprises 46 pages of the appendix to the petition, less than 4 are devoted to the propriety of the remedy decreed, and none of those 4 pages deal with whether the remedy was appropriate, conceding that a systemwide remedy could be imposed. The court focused solely on the legitimacy [445 U.S. 935 , 937]

Syllabus 
A California statute requires all wine producers and wholesalers to file fair trade contracts or price schedules with the State.  If a producer has not set prices through a fair trade contract, wholesalers must post a resale price schedule, and are prohibited from selling wine to a retailer at other than the price set in a price schedule or fair trade contract.  A wholesaler selling below the established prices faces fines or license suspension or revocation.  After being charged with selling wine for less than the prices set by price schedules and also for selling wines for which no fair trade contract or schedule had been filed, respondent wholesaler filed suit in the California Court of Appeal asking for an injunction against the State's wine pricing scheme.  The Court of Appeal ruled that the scheme restrains trade in violation of the Sherman Act, and granted injunctive relief, rejecting claims that the scheme was immune from liability under that Act under the ""state action"" doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, and was also protected by  2 of the Twenty-first Amendment, which prohibits the transportation or importation of intoxicating liquors into any State for delivery or use therein in violation of the State's laws.
Held:
1. California's wine pricing system constitutes resale price maintenance in violation of the Sherman Act, since the wine producer holds the power to prevent price competition by dictating the prices charged by wholesalers.  And the State's involvement in the system is insufficient to establish antitrust immunity under Parker v. Brown, supra.  While the system satisfies the first requirement for such immunity that the challenged restraint be ""one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,"" it does not meet the other requirement that the policy be ""actively supervised"" by the State itself.  Under the system, the State simply authorizes price setting and enforces the prices established by private parties, and it does not establish prices, review the reasonableness of price schedules, regulate the terms of fair trade contracts, monitor market conditions, or engage in any ""pointed reexamination""

 of the program.  The national policy in favor of competition cannot be thwarted by casting such a gauzy cloak of state involvement over what is essentially a private price-fixing arrangement.  Pp.  445 U. S. 102-106.
2. The Twenty-first Amendment does not bar application of the Sherman Act to California's wine pricing system.  Pp.  445 U. S. 106-114.
(a) Although, under that Amendment, States retain substantial discretion to establish liquor regulations over and above those governing the importation or sale of liquor and the structure of the liquor distribution system, those controls may be subject to the federal commerce power in appropriate situations.  Pp.  445 U. S. 106-110.
(b) There is no basis for disagreeing with the view of the California courts that the asserted state interests behind the resale price maintenance system of promoting temperance and protecting small retailers are less substantial than the national policy in favor of competition.  Such view is reasonable, and is supported by the evidence, there being nothing to indicate that the wine pricing system helps sustain small retailers or inhibits the consumption of alcohol by Californians.

Syllabus 
After initially invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination while being questioned before a federal grand jury, respondent ultimately testified when the Government granted him immunity in accordance with 18 U.S.C.  6002, which provides that, when a witness is compelled to testify over his claim of a Fifth Amendment privilege, no testimony or other information compelled under the order to testify may be used against the witness in any criminal case, ""except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order.""  Respondent was later indicted and convicted under 18 U.S.C.  1623(a) (1976 ed., Supp. II) for false swearing in his grand jury testimony with regard to certain statements.  At trial, respondent objected to the use of any of his immunized testimony except the portions charged in the indictment as false, but the District Court admitted other portions of the testimony as being relevant to prove that he had knowingly made the charged false statements.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, because such immunized testimony did not constitute the ""corps delicti"" or ""core"" of the false-statements offense, it could not be introduced.
Held:  Because proper invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination allows a witness to remain silent, but not to swear falsely, neither  6002 nor the Fifth Amendment precludes the use of respondent's immunized grand jury testimony at a subsequent prosecution for making false statements, so long as that testimony conforms to otherwise applicable rules of evidence.  Pp.  445 U. S. 121-132.
(a) Section 6002's language makes no distinction between truthful and untruthful statements made during the course of immunized testimony, but, rather, creates a blanket exemption from the bar against the use of such testimony where the witness is subsequently prosecuted for making false statements.  And  6002's legislative history shows that Congress intended the perjury and false-declarations exception to be interpreted as broadly as constitutionally permissible.  Thus, it is evident that Congress intended to permit the use of both truthful and false statements made during the course of immunized testimony if such use was not prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  445 U. S. 121-123. 
Page 445 U. S. 116

(b) It is analytically incorrect to equate the benefits of remaining silent as a result of invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege with the protections conferred by the privilege -- protections that may be invoked with respect to matters that pose substantial and real hazards of subjecting a witness to criminal liability at the time he asserts the privilege. For a grant of immunity to provide protection ""coextensive"" with that of the Fifth Amendment, it need not treat the witness as if he had remained silent.  Here, the Fifth Amendment does not prevent the use of respondent's immunized testimony at his trial for false swearing because, at the time he was granted immunity, the privilege would not have protected him against false testimony that he later might decide to give.

Syllabus 
Henry Kissinger served as an Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs from 1969 to 1975 and as Secretary of State from 1973 to 1977.  Throughout these periods, his secretaries monitored his telephone conversations and recorded their contents either by shorthand or on tape.  The stenographic notes or tapes were used to prepare summaries and sometimes verbatim transcripts of the conversations (hereafter notes or telephone notes).  In 1976, after the notes had been moved from Kissinger's office in the State Department to a private estate in New York, he donated them to the Library of Congress, subject to an agreement restricting public access to them for a specified period, and they were transported to the Library.  Three requests for the notes were made to the State Department under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA):  (1) a request by a newspaper columnist (Safire), at a time when the notes were still located in Kissinger's State Department office, for any notes covering certain dates in which Safire's name appeared or in which Kissinger discussed information ""leaks"" with certain White House officials; (2) a request by the Military Audit Project, after the notes had been transferred to the Library of Congress, for all notes made while Kissinger was Secretary of State; and (3) a request at about the same time by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and others for notes made both while Kissinger was Presidential Assistant and while he was Secretary of State.  The State Department denied the first request on the ground that the requested notes had been made while Kissinger was Presidential Assistant, and therefore were not agency records subject to FOIA disclosure.  The second and third requests were denied on the grounds both that the requested notes were not agency records and that their deposit with the Library of Congress prior to the requests terminated the State Department's custody and control. During this period when he was no longer Secretary of State, Kissinger refused the Government Archivist's 
Page 445 U. S. 137
 requests for return of the notes.  Suits were filed by the various FOIA requesters against Kissinger, the Library of Congress, the Secretary of State, and the State Department, seeking enforcement of the FOIA requests and a declaratory judgment that the telephone notes were agency records that had been unlawfully removed and were being improperly withheld.  The District Court ruled in the plaintiffs' favor as to the notes made while Kissinger was Secretary of State, but denied relief as to the notes made while he was Presidential Assistant, finding that the former notes were ""agency records"" subject to disclosure under the FOIA, and that Kissinger had wrongfully removed them from the State Department in violation of the Federal Records Disposal Act.  An order was entered requiring the Library of Congress to return the Secretary of State notes to the State Department and requiring the Department to determine which of the notes are exempt from disclosure under the FOIA and to provide the required materials to the plaintiffs.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The District Court had no authority to order transfer of the notes, including those made while Kissinger was Secretary of State, from the Library of Congress to the State Department at the behest of the named plaintiffs.  Pp.  445 U. S. 146-155.
(a) No provision of either the Federal Records Act of 1950, which establishes a records management program for federal agencies, or the complementary Records Disposal Act, which provides the exclusive means for record disposal, expressly confers a right of action on private parties, nor can such a right of action be implied.   The language of these Acts merely ""proscribes certain conduct,"" and does not ""create or alter civil liabilities,"" Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11,  444 U. S. 19, and the Records Act also expressly provides administrative remedies for violations of the Act.  Moreover, the legislative history of the Acts confirms that congressional silence as to a private right of action was purposeful, indicating that their purpose was not to benefit private parties, but solely to benefit the agencies themselves and the Federal Government as a whole.  Thus, regardless of whether Kissinger had violated these Acts, Congress has not vested federal courts with jurisdiction to adjudicate that question upon suit by a private party, such responsibility being vested in the administrative authorities.  Pp.  445 U. S. 147-150.
(b) Nor does the FOIA furnish the congressional intent to permit private actions to recover records wrongfully removed from Government custody.  Under this Act, federal jurisdiction is dependent upon a showing that an agency has (1) ""improperly"" (2) ""withheld"" (3) ""agency 
Page 445 U. S. 138
 records.""  Here, the State Department, a covered agency, has not ""withheld"" agency records within the meaning of the FOIA, since Congress did not mean that an agency improperly withholds a document that has been removed from the agency's possession prior to the filing of the FOIA request, the agency in such case having neither the custody nor control necessary to enable it to withhold.  And an agency's failure to sue a third party to obtain possession is not a withholding under the Act.  This conclusion that possession or control is a prerequisite to FOIA disclosure is reinforced by an examination of the Act's purposes, from which it is apparent that Congress never intended, when it enacted the FOIA, to displace the statutory scheme embodied in the Federal Records and Records Disposal Acts providing for administrative remedies to safeguard against wrongful removal of agency records as well as to retrieve wrongfully removed records.  Pp.  445 U. S. 150-154.
(c) Under the circumstances of this case, where Kissinger had refused the Archivist's requests for return of the documents and he and the Library of Congress as his donee are holding the documents in question under a claim of right, the State Department cannot be said to have had possession or control of the documents at the time the requests were received, and therefore it did not withhold any agency records, an indispensable prerequisite to liability in a suit under the FOIA.  Pp. 154-155.
2. Safire's request sought disclosure of documents that were not ""agency records"" within the meaning of the FOIA.  While the FOIA makes the ""Executive Office of the President"" an agency subject to the Act, the legislative history makes it clear that the ""Executive Office"" does not include the Office of the President.  Thus, since Safire's request sought notes made by Kissinger while acting in his capacity as Presidential Assistant, the requested notes were not ""agency records"" when they were made.  Pp.  445 U. S. 155-157.
191 U.S.App.D.C. 213, 589 F.2d 1116, affirmed in part and reversed in part.

This conclusion that possession or control is a prerequisite to FOIA disclosure is reinforced by an examination of the Act's purposes, from which it is apparent that Congress never intended, when it enacted the FOIA, to displace the statutory scheme embodied in the Federal Records and Records Disposal Acts providing for administrative remedies to safeguard against wrongful removal of agency records as well as to retrieve wrongfully removed records.  Pp.  445 U. S. 150-154.
(c) Under the circumstances of this case, where Kissinger had refused the Archivist's requests for return of the documents and he and the Library of Congress as his donee are holding the documents in question under a claim of right, the State Department cannot be said to have had possession or control of the documents at the time the requests were received, and therefore it did not withhold any agency records, an indispensable prerequisite to liability in a suit under the FOIA.  Pp. 154-155.
2. Safire's request sought disclosure of documents that were not ""agency records"" within the meaning of the FOIA.  While the FOIA makes the ""Executive Office of the President"" an agency subject to the Act, the legislative history makes it clear that the ""Executive Office"" does not include the Office of the President.  Thus, since Safire's request sought notes made by Kissinger while acting in his capacity as Presidential Assistant, the requested notes were not ""agency records"" when they were made.  Pp.  445 U. S. 155-157.

Decided March 3, 1980
445 U.S. 169

Syllabus 
Under federal grants awarded by the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases (NIAMDD) (a federal agency), the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a group of private physicians and scientists, conducted a long-term study of the effectiveness of certain diabetes treatment regimens.  Pertinent federal regulations authorized some supervision of UGDP and gave NIAMDD the right of access to, or permanent custody of, the raw data generated by UGDP.  However, the day-to-day administration of grant-supported activities was in UGDP's hands, and NIAMDD did not exercise its right to review or obtain custody of the raw data, which remained at all times in UGDP's possession and under its ownership.  The UGDP's reports on the results of its study, indicating that the use of certain drugs in diabetes treatment increased the risk of heart disease, ultimately resulted in proceedings by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to restrict the labeling and use of the drugs.  After both UGDP and HEW denied petitioners' request for access to the UGDP raw data underlying its published reports, petitioners filed suit in Federal District Court to require HEW to make the raw data available under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which empowers federal courts to order an ""agency"" to produce ""agency records improperly withheld"" from an individual requesting access.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, holding that HEW properly denied the request on the ground that the data did not constitute ""agency records"" under the FOIA.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  HEW need not produce the requested data because they are not ""agency records"" within the meaning of the FOIA.  Data generated by a privately controlled organization which has received federal grants (grantee), but which data has not at any time been obtained by the agency, are not ""agency records"" accessible under the FOIA.  Pp  445 U. S. 177-187.
(a) There is no merit to petitioners' claim that the data were at least records of UGDP, and that the federal funding and supervision of UGDP alone provide the close connection necessary to render its 
Page 445 U. S. 170
 records ""agency records"" as that term is used in the FOIA.  While ""agency record"" is not defined in the Act, Congress excluded private grantees from FOIA disclosure obligations by excluding them from the Act's definition of ""agency,"" an action consistent with its prevalent practice of preserving the autonomy of federal grantees and their records.  Since Congress found that federal funding and supervision (short of Government control) did not justify direct access to the grantee's records, it cannot be concluded that those identical activities were intended to permit indirect access through an expansive definition of ""agency records.""  Pp.  445 U. S. 178-182.
(b) Nor may a broad definition of ""agency records"" be invoked so as to include all documents created by a private grantee to which the Government has access and which the Government has used.  Such a broad definition is not supported by either the language, structure, or legislative history of the FOIA.  Instead, Congress contemplated that an agency must first either create or obtain a record as a prerequisite to its becoming an ""agency record"" within the meaning of the FOIA.  This conclusion is also supported by other Acts in which Congress has associated creation or acquisition with the concept of a governmental record.  Although, in this case, HEW has a right of access to the data, and a right if it so chooses to obtain permanent custody of the UGDP records, in this context, the FOIA applies to records which have been, in fact, obtained, and not to records which merely could have been obtained.  Without first establishing that the agency has created or obtained the document, the agency's reliance on or use of the document is similarly irrelevant.  Pp.  445 U. S. 182-186.

Argued October 29, 30, 1979
Decided February 27, 1980
445 U.S. 40

Syllabus 
Prior to his trial with others on federal drug charges, petitioner advised the District Court that the Government intended to call his wife (who had been named in the indictment as an unindicted coconspirator) as an adverse witness and asserted a privilege to prevent her from testifying.  The District Court ruled that confidential communications between petitioner and his wife were privileged, and therefore inadmissible, but the wife was permitted to testify to any act she observed before or during the marriage and to any communication made in the presence of a third person.  Primarily on the basis of his wife's testimony, petitioner was convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contention that the admission of his wife's adverse testimony, over his objection, contravened the decision in Hawkins v. United States, 358 U. S. 74, barring the testimony of one spouse against the other unless both consent.
Held:  The Court modifies the Hawkins rule so that the witness-spouse alone has a privilege to refuse to testify adversely; the witness may be neither compelled to testify nor foreclosed from testifying.  Here, petitioner's spouse chose to testify against him; that she did so after a grant of immunity and assurances of lenient treatment does not render her testimony involuntary, and thus petitioner's claim of privilege was properly rejected.  Pp.  445 U. S. 43-53.
(a) The modern justification for the privilege against adverse spousal testimony is its perceived role in fostering the harmony and sanctity of the marriage relationship.  While this Court, in Hawkins, supra, reaffirmed the vitality of the common law privilege in the federal courts, it made clear that its decision was not meant to ""foreclose whatever changes in the rule may eventually be dictated by reason and experience.'""  358 U.S. at  358 U. S. 79.  Pp.  445 U. S. 43-46.
(b) Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence acknowledges the federal courts' authority to continue the evolutionary development of testimonial privileges in federal criminal trials ""governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted . . . in the light of reason and experience.""  P.  445 U. S. 47.
(c) Since 1958, when Hawkins was decided, the trend in state law 
Page 445 U. S. 41
 has been toward divesting the accused of the privilege to bar adverse spousal testimony.  Pp.  445 U. S. 48-50.
(d) Information privately disclosed between husband and wife in the confidence of the marital relationship is privileged under the independent rule protecting confidential marital communications, Blau v. United States, 340 U. S. 332; and the Hawkins privilege, which sweeps more broadly than any other testimonial privilege, is not limited to confidential communications, but is invoked to also exclude evidence of criminal acts and of communications in the presence of third persons.  The ancient foundations for so sweeping a privilege -- whereby a woman was regarded as a chattel and denied a separate legal identity -- have long since disappeared, and the contemporary justification for affording an accused such a privilege is unpersuasive.  When one spouse is willing to testify against the other in a criminal proceeding -- whatever the motivation -- there is probably little in the way of marital harmony for the privilege to preserve.  Consideration of the foundations for the privilege and its history thus shows that ""reason and experience"" no longer justify so sweeping a rule as that found acceptable in Hawkins.  Pp.  445 U.

Syllabus 
Held:  Even though petitioner's extant prior state court felony conviction may be subject to collateral attack under Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, it could properly be used as a predicate for his subsequent conviction for possession of a firearm in violation of  1202(a)(1) of Title VII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.  Pp.  445 U. S. 60-68.
(a) The plain meaning of  1202(a)(1)'s sweeping language proscribing the possession of firearms by any person who ""has been convicted by a court of the United States or of a State . . . of a felony,"" is that the fact of a felony conviction imposes firearm disability until the conviction is vacated or the felon is relieved of his disability by some affirmative action.  Other provisions of the statute demonstrate and reinforce its broad sweep, and there is nothing in  1202(a)(1)'s legislative history to suggest that Congress was willing to allow a defendant to question the validity of his prior conviction as a defense to a charge under  1202(a)(1).  Moreover, the fact that there are remedies available to a convicted felon -- removal of the firearm disability by a qualifying pardon or the Secretary of the Treasury's consent, as specified in the Act, or a challenge to the prior conviction in an appropriate court proceeding -- suggests that Congress intended that the defendant clear his status before obtaining a firearm, thereby fulfilling Congress' purpose to keep firearms away from persons classified as potentially irresponsible and dangerous.  Pp.  445 U. S. 60-65.
(b) The firearm regulatory scheme at issue here is consonant with the concept of equal protection embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, since Congress could rationally conclude that any felony conviction, even an allegedly invalid one, is a sufficient basis on which to prohibit the possession of a firearm.  And use of an uncounseled felony conviction as the basis for imposing a civil firearms disability, enforceable by criminal sanction, is not inconsistent with Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.

445 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Section 11(c)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Act) prohibits an employer from discharging or discriminating against any employee who exercises ""any right afforded by"" the Act.  Respondent Secretary of Labor promulgated a regulation providing that, among other rights protected by the Act, is the right of an employee to choose not to perform his assigned task because of a reasonable apprehension of death or serious injury coupled with a reasonable belief that no less drastic alternative is available.  Claiming that a suspended wire mesh screen in petitioner's manufacturing plant used to protect employees from objects occasionally falling from an overhead conveyor was unsafe, two employees of petitioner refused to comply with their foreman's order to perform their usual maintenance duties on the screen.  They were then ordered to punch out without working or being paid for the remainder of their shift, and subsequently received written reprimands, which were placed in their employment files.  Thereafter, respondent brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging that petitioner's actions against the two employees constituted discrimination in violation of  11(c)(1) of the Act, and seeking injunctive and other relief.  While finding that the implementing regulation justified the employees' refusals to obey their foreman's order, the District Court 
Page 445 U. S. 2
 nevertheless denied relief, holding that the regulation was inconsistent with the Act, and therefore invalid.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, agreeing that the employees' actions were justified under the regulation but disagreeing with the conclusion that the regulation was invalid.
Held:  The regulation in question was promulgated by respondent in the valid exercise of his authority under the Act, and constitutes a permissible gloss on the Act, in light of the Act's language, structure, and legislative history.  Pp.  445 U. S. 8-22.
(a) The regulation clearly conforms to the Act's fundamental objective of preventing occupational deaths and serious injuries.

			"|"Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall
No. 78-1870
Argued January 9, 1980
Decided February 26, 1980
445 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Section 11(c)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Act) prohibits an employer from discharging or discriminating against any employee who exercises ""any right afforded by"" the Act.  Respondent Secretary of Labor promulgated a regulation providing that, among other rights protected by the Act, is the right of an employee to choose not to perform his assigned task because of a reasonable apprehension of death or serious injury coupled with a reasonable belief that no less drastic alternative is available.  Claiming that a suspended wire mesh screen in petitioner's manufacturing plant used to protect employees from objects occasionally falling from an overhead conveyor was unsafe, two employees of petitioner refused to comply with their foreman's order to perform their usual maintenance duties on the screen.  They were then ordered to punch out without working or being paid for the remainder of their shift, and subsequently received written reprimands, which were placed in their employment files.  Thereafter, respondent brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging that petitioner's actions against the two employees constituted discrimination in violation of  11(c)(1) of the Act, and seeking injunctive and other relief.  While finding that the implementing regulation justified the employees' refusals to obey their foreman's order, the District Court 
Page 445 U. S. 2
 nevertheless denied relief, holding that the regulation was inconsistent with the Act, and therefore invalid.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, agreeing that the employees' actions were justified under the regulation but disagreeing with the conclusion that the regulation was invalid.
Held:  The regulation in question was promulgated by respondent in the valid exercise of his authority under the Act, and constitutes a permissible gloss on the Act, in light of the Act's language, structure, and legislative history.  Pp.  445 U. S. 8-22.
(a) The regulation clearly conforms to the Act's fundamental objective of preventing occupational deaths and serious injuries.  Moreover, the regulation is an appropriate aid to the full effectuation of the Act's ""general duty"" clause, which requires an employer to furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment free from recognized hazards that are causing or likely to cause death or serious injury to the employees.  The regulation thus, on its face, appears to further the Act's overriding purpose and rationally complements its remedial scheme.  Pp.  445 U. S. 11-13.
(b) The facts that Congress, at the time it was considering passage of the Act, rejected a so-called ""strike with pay"" provision (whereby an obligation would be imposed on employers to continue to pay employees who absented themselves from work for reasons of safety), and also rejected a provision that would have given the Labor Department, in imminent danger situations, the power temporarily to shut down all or part of an employer's plant, do not indicate a congressional intent incompatible with an administrative interpretation of the Act such as is embodied in the regulation at issue.  In contrast to the ""strike with pay"" provision, the regulation does not require employers to pay workers who refuse to perform assigned tasks in face of imminent danger, but simply provides that, in such case, the employer may not ""discriminate"" against the employees involved.  And in contrast to the ""shutdown"" provision, the regulation accords no authority to Government officials, but simply permits private employees to avoid workplace conditions that they believe pose grave dangers to their own safety, and does not empower such employees to order their employers to correct the hazardous condition.

Syllabus 
Held:  Under the provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act whereby a deceased federal employee's legitimate children under 18 years of age qualify for survivors' benefits but ""recognized natural"" children under 18 may recover only if they ""lived with the employee . . . in a regular parent-child relationship,"" a recognized natural child is entitled to survivors' benefits when the child has lived with the deceased employee in a ""regular parent-child relationship,"" regardless of whether the child was living with the employee at the time of his death.  This construction of the statutory provisions is fair and reasonable in light of the language, purpose, and history of the enactment and avoids a serious constitutional question under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Even if the ""lived with"" requirement is assumed to serve as a device to thwart fraudulent claims of dependency or parentage or to promote efficient administration by facilitating the prompt identification of eligible annuitants, to construe the provision as applying only to illegitimate children living with the employee at the time of death would raise serious equal protection problems that this Court must seek to avoid by adopting a saving statutory construction not at odds with fundamental legislative purposes.

 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.

 Virginia corporation with its principal place of business in Charleston, W. Va., to sell structural assemblies for incorporation by respondent into the outlet works of a dam and reservoir in Virginia. Aside from the contacts arising from the negotiation, execution, and performance of this contract, respondent has never had any connection with the State of Wisconsin. Petitioner's agent initiated the negotiations by visiting respondent's offices in West Virginia and delivering a quotation. The quotation provided that ""[a]ny order arising out of this proposal . . . is subject to home office acceptance at Milwaukee, Wisconsin."" Respondent then mailed petitioner its purchase order referring to petitioner's quotation. Petitioner signed the purchase order in Milwaukee and returned it to respondent together with a proposed modification, which became part of the contract, when respondent treated the modified order as effective. During the course of their negotiations both parties initiated other communications between their respective offices either by telephone or by mail. 
 The contract provided that the goods were to be shipped ""F. O. B.

According to petitioner, Pet. for Cert. 4, the total contract price was $1,281,750.00. Petitioner proceeded to manufacture the goods at its plant in Wisconsin and ship them to the project site in Virginia. Respondent asserted that some of the goods were defective and withheld part of the purchase price. 
 Petitioner thereupon filed the present action in a Wisconsin state court to recover the unpaid balance on the contract. It alleged personal jurisdiction under Wisconsin's long-arm statute, Wis.Stat. 801.05, 801. 11 (1975), which has been interpreted to reach as far as due process will allow, Flambeau Plastics Corp. v.

444 U.S. 527

Syllabus 
In No. 77-1546, respondents, who had been among those subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury in Florida investigating a possible conspiracy to cause a riot, brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against petitioners (the then United States Attorney and Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida, and a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent) and a Department of Justice attorney, individually and in their official capacities, alleging a conspiracy to deprive respondents of various statutory and constitutional rights, and seeking damages and a declaratory judgment.  Petitioners, each of whom resided in Florida, were served by certified mail, and the Department of Justice attorney, who resided in the District of Columbia, was served personally.  Respondents relied on  2 of the Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962 (Act), 28 U.S.C.  1391(e), which provides in part that
""[a] civil action in which a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof acting in his official capacity or under color of legal authority . . . may, except as otherwise provided by law, be brought in any judicial district in which (1) a defendant in the action resides, or (2) the cause of action arose . . . or (4) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action,""
and that delivery of the summons and complaint to the officer in such an action may be made by certified mail beyond the territorial limits of the district in which the action is brought.  The District Court dismissed the action, ruling that venue was improper and that the court lacked in personam jurisdiction over petitioners.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  2 permits damages actions against federal officials to be brought in any district in which any one defendant resides, and that, since the Department of Justice attorney was a resident of the District of Columbia, venue there was proper.  In No. 78-303, respondents, whose mail between the United States and the Soviet Union had allegedly been opened by the Central Intelligence 
Page 444 U. S. 528
 Agency, brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against petitioners (the then Director and Deputy Director of the CIA) and others, in their individual and official capacities, alleging that interference with respondents' mail violated their constitutional rights and seeking damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.  Petitioners and the other defendants were served outside of Rhode Island by certified mail.  The District Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, and insufficiency of process, but certified the questions involved for an immediate appeal.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order as to petitioners, who were CIA officials when the complaint was filed, but reversed as to those defendants who had left their Government positions at the time of filing, holding that  2 applied to damages actions against federal officials in their individual capacities and provided the mechanism for obtaining personal jurisdiction over them, and that accordingly venue was proper in Rhode Island because one of the respondents resided there.
Held:  Section 2 of the Act does not apply to actions for money damages brought against federal officials in their individual capacities.  Pp.  444 U. S. 533-545.
(a) Section 2's language ""is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof acting in his official capacity or under color of legal authority"" can reasonably be read as describing the character of the defendant at the time of suit, and, so read, limits a covered ""civil action"" to one against a federal official who is at that time acting, or failing to act, in an official or apparently official way.  Such a ""civil action"" is that referred to in  1 of the Act, 28 U.S.C.  1361, which gives district courts jurisdiction of
""any action in the nature of.mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.""
Pp.  444 U. S. 535-536.
(b) The Act's legislative history clearly indicates that Congress intended nothing more than to provide nationwide venue for the convenience of individual plaintiffs in actions that are nominally against an individual officer but are in reality against the Government.  A suit for money damages which must be paid out of the pocket of the private individual who happens to be -- or formerly was -- employed by the Government plainly is not one ""essentially against the United States,"" and thus is not encompassed by the venue provisions of  2.  Pp.  444 U. S. 536-543.
(c) If  2 were construed to govern damages actions against federal officers individually, suits could be brought against those officers while in Government service -- and could be pressed even after the officer has 
Page 444 U. S. 529
 left service -- in any one of the 95 federal districts covering the 50 states and other areas within federal jurisdiction.  This would place federal officers, solely by reason of their Government service, in a very different posture in personal damages suits from that of all other persons, since, under 28 U.S.C.  1391(b), damages suits against private persons must be brought in the district where all the defendants reside or in which the claim arose.  Such was not the intent of Congress.  Pp.  444 U. S. 544-545.

""any action in the nature of.mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.""
Pp.  444 U. S. 535-536.
(b) The Act's legislative history clearly indicates that Congress intended nothing more than to provide nationwide venue for the convenience of individual plaintiffs in actions that are nominally against an individual officer but are in reality against the Government.  A suit for money damages which must be paid out of the pocket of the private individual who happens to be -- or formerly was -- employed by the Government plainly is not one ""essentially against the United States,"" and thus is not encompassed by the venue provisions of  2.  Pp.  444 U. S. 536-543.
(c) If  2 were construed to govern damages actions against federal officers individually, suits could be brought against those officers while in Government service -- and could be pressed even after the officer has 
Page 444 U. S. 529
 left service -- in any one of the 95 federal districts covering the 50 states and other areas within federal jurisdiction.  This would place federal officers, solely by reason of their Government service, in a very different posture in personal damages suits from that of all other persons, since, under 28 U.S.C.  1391(b), damages suits against private persons must be brought in the district where all the defendants reside or in which the claim arose.  Such was not the intent of Congress.  Pp.  444 U. S. 544-545.

Syllabus 
Respondents financed their purchases of automobiles through standard retail installment contracts that were assigned to petitioner finance company.  Each contract provided that respondents were to pay a precomputed finance charge, and, as required by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and implementing Federal Reserve Board (FRB) Regulation Z, the front page of each contract disclosed and explained certain features of the contract, including a disclosure that the buyer could prepay his obligations under the contract in full at any time prior to maturity of the final installment and that, if he did so, he would receive a rebate of the unearned portion of the finance charge.  The face of the contract also stated that temporary default on a particular installment would result in a delinquency charge, but no mention was made of a clause in the contract giving the creditor a right to accelerate payment of the entire debt upon the buyer's default.  Respondents thereafter brought separate suits in District Court, alleging, inter alia, that petitioner finance company had violated TILA and Regulation Z by failing to disclose on the front page of the contract that the creditor retained the right to accelerate payment of the debt.  The District Court, in two of the suits, held that facial disclosure of the acceleration clauses was mandated by the provisions of TILA, 15 U.S.C.  1638(a)(9), 1639(a) (7), that compel publication of ""default, delinquency, or similar charges payable in the event of late payments.""  On a consolidated appeal, the Court of Appeals agreed that TILA imposes a general acceleration clause disclosure requirement, but rather than holding that acceleration is a default charge, the Court of Appeals based its decision on the principle that, under Regulation Z, the creditor must disclose whether a rebate of unearned interest will be made upon acceleration, and also must disclose the method by which the amount of unearned interest will be computed if the debt is accelerated.  In so 
Page 444 U. S. 556
 holding, the court rejected the FRB staff's contrary interpretation of the pertinent statutory and regulatory provisions that specific disclosure of an acceleration rebate policy is only necessary when that policy varies from the custom with respect to voluntary prepayment rebates.
Held:  TILA does not mandate a general rule of disclosure for acceleration clause.  Pp.  444 U. S. 559-570.
(a) The issue of acceleration disclosure is not governed by clear expression in the statute or regulations.  An acceleration clause cannot be equated with a ""default, delinquency, or similar charg[e],"" subject to disclosure under  1638(a)(9) and 1639(a)(7) and Regulation Z, and the prepayment rebate disclosure requirement of Regulation Z also fails to afford direct support for an invariable specific acceleration disclosure rule.  Pp.  444 U. S. 559-562.
(b) In the absence of an express statutory mandate that acceleration procedures be invariably disclosed, a high degree of deference to the FRB staff's consistent administrative interpretation that the statute and regulations impose no such uniform requirement is warranted.  Although the staff might have decided that acceleration rebates are so analytically distinct from identical voluntary prepayment rebates as to warrant separate disclosure, it was reasonable to conclude, alternatively, that ordinary consumers would be concerned chiefly about differing financial consequences.

Argued November 28, 1979

444 U.S. 572

Syllabus 
Petitioner Seatrain Shipbuilding Corp. (Seatrain) received a construction differential subsidy (CDS) under Title V of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (Act), to construct a supertanker, and, as required by  506 of the Act, Seatrain and petitioner Polk Tanker Corp., the initial owner of the vessel, agreed to operate it exclusively in foreign trade except as otherwise authorized in  506.  When the vessel was completed, petitioners asked the Secretary of Commerce to terminate all restrictions on the vessel's operation in domestic trade in exchange for their fully secured note repaying in full the vessel's CDS.  The Secretary granted their application.  Thereafter, certain competitors in the domestic trade (respondents) brought suit in District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the Secretary from granting a permanent release from the  506 ""foreign trade only"" requirement.  The District Court held, inter alia, that the Secretary had the authority permanently to release vessels from trade restrictions imposed pursuant to  506 in exchange for full CDS repayment, but remanded the case to the Secretary for consideration of the competitive consequences of granting the release in question.  Apparently relying on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), the court subsequently certified its decision as a ""final judgment.""  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that by specifying certain exceptions to the ""foreign trade only"" requirement,  506 occupied the field and impliedly prohibited the Secretary from making any other exceptions under the Act's more general provisions.
Held:
1. The District Court's determination that the Secretary was empowered to waive permanently the restrictions required by  506 was a ""final decision"" certifiable under Rule 54(h) and appealable to the Court of Appeals under 28 U.S.C.  1291, and thus this Court has jurisdiction to hear the case.  Although respondents' claim that the Secretary's waiver of  506 restrictions as to petitioners' vessel was an abuse of discretion caused the District Court to remand to the agency for consideration of the economic consequences of granting the release, respondents' request for a general declaration that the Secretary lacks

 authority to grant a permanent release from  506 restrictions under any circumstances was finally decided, and meets the case or controversy requirement of Art. III of the Constitution.  Pp.  444 U. S. 579-584.
2. The Act empowers the Secretary to approve ""full repayment/permanent release"" transactions of the type at issue here.  On the face of the statute, the Secretary's broad contracting powers and discretion to administer the Act seem to comprehend the authority to grant permanent releases.  The specific exceptions to the ""foreign trade only"" requirement in  506 speak only to temporary releases from that requirement, and nothing in  506, or in any other provision of Title V of the Act, either expressly or implicitly addresses the issue of permanent revocation of a CDS contract.

444 U.S. 598

Syllabus 
As an exception to the rule making it unlawful for an employer to engage in practices, procedures, or tests that operate to ""freeze"" the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices,  703 (h) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different standards of compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority system if such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of race.  A multiemployer brewery industry collective bargaining agreement accorded greater benefits, with respect to hiring and layoffs, to ""permanent"" than to ""temporary"" employees, and provided that a temporary employee must work at least 45 weeks in a single calendar year before he can become a permanent employee.  Respondent Bryant (hereafter respondent), a Negro, brought a class action in District Court against petitioner association, petitioner employers, and several labor unions, alleging, inter alia, that the defendants had discriminated against him and other Negroes in violation of Title VII, and, in particular, that the agreement's 45-week requirement had operated to preclude him and the members of his class from achieving, or from a reasonable opportunity of achieving, permanent employee status.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the 45-week requirement was not a ""seniority system"" or part of a ""seniority system"" within the meaning of  703(h), and accordingly remanded the case to the District Court to enable respondent to prove that such requirement has had a discriminatory impact on Negroes.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the 45-week requirement is not a component of a ""seniority system"" within the meaning of  703(h). The fact that the system created by the agreement establishes two parallel seniority ladders, one allocating benefits due temporary employees and the other identifying the benefits owed permanent employees, does not prevent it from being a ""seniority system"" within the meaning of  703(h).  The 45-week requirement, correspondingly, serves the needed function of establishing the threshold requirement for entry into the permanent employee seniority track.  Cf.  431 U. S.  
Page 444 U. S. 599
 United States, 431 U. S. 324.  Unlike such criteria as educational standards, aptitude or physical tests, or standards that give effect to subjectivity, but like any ""seniority"" rule, the 45-week requirement focuses on length of employment.  Moreover, the requirement does not distort the operation of the basic system established by the agreement, which rewards employment longevity with heightened benefits, since, as a general rule, the more seniority a temporary employee accumulates, the more likely it is that he will be able to satisfy the 45-week requirement.

Syllabus 
Petitioner village has an ordinance prohibiting door-to-door or on-street solicitation of contributions by charitable organizations that do not use at least 75 percent of their receipts for ""charitable purposes,"" such purposes being defined to exclude solicitation expenses, salaries, overhead, and other administrative expenses.  After petitioner denied respondent Citizens for a Better Environment (CBE) (a nonprofit environmental protection organization) a solicitation permit because it could not meet the ordinance's 75-percent requirement, CBE sued petitioner in Federal District Court, alleging that such requirement violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court granted summary judgment for CBE.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's argument that summary judgment was inappropriate because there was an unresolved factual dispute as to the true character of CBE's organization, and holding that, since CBE challenged the facial validity of the ordinance on First Amendment grounds, the facts as to CBE's internal affairs and operations were immaterial, and therefore not an obstacle to the granting of summary judgment.  The court concluded that, even if the 75-percent requirement might be valid as applied to other types of charitable solicitation, the requirement was unreasonable on its face because it barred solicitation by advocacy-oriented organizations even where the contributions would be used for reasonable salaries of those who gathered and disseminated information relevant to the organization's purpose.
Held:  The ordinance in question is unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  444 U. S. 628-639.
(a) Charitable appeals for funds, on the street or door to door, involve a variety of speech interests -- communication of information, dissemination and propagation of views and ideas, and advocacy of causes -- that are within the First Amendment's protection.  While soliciting financial support is subject to reasonable regulation, such regulation must give due regard to the reality that solicitation is characteristically intertwined with informative and perhaps persuasive speech seeking support for particular causes or for particular views on economic, 
Page 444 U. S. 621
 political, or social issues, and to the reality that without solicitation the flow of such information and advocacy would likely cease.  Moreover, since charitable solicitation does more than inform private economic decisions and is not primarily concerned with providing information about the characteristics and costs of goods and services, it is not dealt with as a variety of purely commercial speech.  Pp.  444 U. S. 628-632.
(b) The Court of Appeals was free to inquire whether the ordinance was overbroad, a question of law that involved no dispute about CBE's characteristics, and thus properly proceeded to rule on the merits of the summary judgment. CBE was entitled to its judgment of facial invalidity if the ordinance purported to prohibit canvassing by a substantial category of charities to which the 75-percent limitation could not be applied consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, even if there was no demonstration that CBE itself was one of these organizations.  Pp.  444 U. S. 633-635.
(c) The 75-percent limitation is a direct and substantial limitation on protected activity that cannot be sustained unless it serves a sufficiently strong, subordinating interest that petitioner is entitled to protect.  Here, petitioner's proffered justifications that such limitation is intimately related to substantial governmental interests in preventing fraud and protecting public safety and residential privacy are inadequate, and such interests could be sufficiently served by measures less destructive of First Amendment interests.

No. 78-1369
Argued November 27, 1979
Decided February 20, 1980
444 U.S. 646

Syllabus 
After a New York statute that appropriated public funds to reimburse both church-sponsored and secular nonpublic schools for performing various services mandated by the State, including the administration, grading, and reporting of the results of tests, both state-prepared and teacher-prepared tests, had been held to be violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment in Levitt v. Committee for Public Education, 413 U. S. 472, the New York Legislature enacted a new statute directing payment to nonpublic schools of the costs incurred by them in complying with certain state-mandated requirements, including requirements as to testing (pupil evaluation, achievement, and scholarship and college qualification tests) and as to reporting and recordkeeping.  The new statute, unlike the earlier version, also provides a means by which state funds are audited, thus ensuring that only the actual costs incurred in providing the covered secular services are reimbursed out of state funds.  The District Court ultimately upheld the new statute.
Held:  The New York statute does not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  444 U. S. 653-662.
(a) A legislative enactment does not contravene the Establishment Clause if it has a secular legislative purpose, if its principal or primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion, and if it does not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.  P.  444 U. S. 653.
(b) The New York statute has the secular purpose of providing educational opportunity of a quality that will prepare New York citizens for the challenges of American life.  The statutory plan calls for tests that are prepared by the State and administered on the premises by personnel of the nonpublic schools, which, however, have no control over the contents of the tests.  Although some of the tests are graded by nonpublic school personnel, in view of the nature of the tests, which deal only with secular academic matters, the grading by nonpublic school employees affords no control to the school over the outcome of 
Page 444 U. S. 647
 any of the tests, and there is no substantial risk that the examinations can be used for religious educational purposes.  While the recordkeeping and reporting services for which the State reimburses the nonpublic school pertain to furnishing information regarding the student body, faculty, support staff, physical facilities, curriculum, and student attendance, and thus are related to the educational program, nevertheless they are not part of the teaching process, and cannot be used to foster an ideological outlook.  Thus, reimbursement for the costs of so complying with state law has primarily a secular, rather than a religious, purpose and effect.  Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, controlling.  Pp.  444 U. S. 654-657.
(c) The New York statute is not invalid simply because it provides for direct cash reimbursement to the nonpublic school for administering the state-prescribed examinations and for grading some of them.  Grading the secular tests furnished by the State is a function that has a secular purpose and primarily a secular effect, and this is not changed simply because the State pays the school for performing the grading function, rather than paying state employees or some independent service to perform the task.  The same results obtain as to reimbursement for the recordkeeping and reporting functions, because they also have neither a religious purpose nor a primarily religious effect.  Pp.  444 U. S. 657-659.
(d) The New York law provides ample safeguards against excessive or misdirected reimbursement.  The services for which the private schools are reimbursed are discrete and clearly identifiable, and the statutory reimbursement process is straightforward and susceptible to the routinization that characterizes most reimbursement schemes.  On its face, therefore, the New York plan suggests no excessive entanglement, and the bad faith upon which any future excessive entanglement would be predicated will not be read into the plan as an inevitability.  Pp.  444 U. S. 659-661.
(e) The decision in Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, is not to be interpreted as holding that any aid to even secular educational functions of a sectarian school is forbidden, or, more broadly still, that any aid to a sectarian school is suspect, since its religious teaching is so pervasively intermixed with each of its activities.  The District Court in the instant case properly put the Meek case and the Wolman case, supra, together and sustained the reimbursements involved here because it had been shown with sufficient clarity that they would serve the State's legitimate secular ends without any appreciable risk of being used to transmit or teach religious views.

No. 78-857
Argued October 10, 1979
Decided February 20, 1980*
444 U.S. 672

Syllabus 
Yeshiva University Faculty Association (Union) filed a representation petition with the National Labor Relations Board (Board), seeking certification as bargaining agent for the full-time faculty members of certain schools of Yeshiva University, a private university.  The University opposed the petition on the ground that all of its faculty members are managerial or supervisory personnel, and hence not employees within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act (Act).  The evidence at hearings before the Board's hearing officer showed, inter alia, that a central administrative hierarchy serves all of the University's schools, with University-wide policies being formulated by the central administration upon approval of the Board of Trustees.  However, the individual schools within the University are substantially autonomous, and the faculty members at each school effectively determine its curriculum, grading system, admission and matriculation standards, academic calendars, and course schedules.  Also, the overwhelming majority of faculty recommendations as to faculty hiring, tenure, sabbaticals, termination, and promotion are implemented.  The Board granted the Union's petition and directed an election.  Summarily rejecting the University's contention that its faculty members are managerial employees, the Board held that the faculty members are professional employees entitled to the Act's protection.  After the Union won the election and was certified, the University refused to bargain.  In subsequent unfair labor practice proceedings, the Board ordered the University to bargain and sought enforcement in the Court of Appeals, which denied the petition.  The court agreed that the faculty members are professional employees under  2(12) of the Act, found that the Board had ignored ""the extensive control of Yeshiva's faculty"" over academic and personnel decisions, as well as its ""crucial role . . . in determining other central policies of the institution,"" and accordingly held that the faculty members are endowed with ""managerial status"" sufficient to remove them from the Act's coverage. 
Page 444 U. S. 673

Held:  The University's full-time faculty members are managerial employees excluded from the Act's coverage.  Pp.  444 U. S. 679-691.
(a) The authority structure of a university does not fit neatly into the statutory scheme, because authority in the typical ""mature"" private university is divided between a central administration and one or more collegial bodies.  The absence of explicit congressional direction does not preclude the Board from reaching any particular type of employment, and the Board has approved the formation of bargaining units composed of faculty members on the ground that they are ""professional employees"" under  2(12) of the Act.  Nevertheless professionals may be exempted from coverage under the judicially implied exclusion for ""managerial employees"" when they are involved in developing and implementing employer policy.  Pp.  444 U. S. 679-682.
(b) Here, application of the managerial exclusion to the University's faculty members is not precluded on the theory that they are not aligned with management because they are expected to exercise ""independent professional judgment"" while participating in academic governance and to pursue professional values, rather than institutional interests.  The controlling consideration is that the faculty exercises authority which in any other context unquestionably would be managerial, its authority in academic matters being absolute.  The faculty's professional interests -- as applied to governance at a university like Yeshiva which depends on the professional judgment of its faculty to formulate and apply policies -- cannot be separated from those of the institution, and thus it cannot be said that a faculty member exercising independent judgment acts primarily in his own interest, and does not represent the interest of his employer.  Pp.  444 U. S. 682-690.
(c) The deference ordinarily due the Board's expertise does not require reversal of the Court of Appeals' decision.  This Court respects the Board's expertise when its conclusions are rationally based on articulated facts and consistent with the Act, but here the Board's decision satisfies neither criterion.

Syllabus 
Section 7602 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 authorizes the Internal Revenue Service to summon individuals to ""appear,"" and ""to produce such books, papers, records, or other data, and to give such testimony,"" as may be relevant to a tax investigation.  During an investigation of respondent's income tax liability, in an effort to determine whether deposits in certain bank accounts not registered in respondent's name represented income attributable to him, an IRS agent issued a summons requiring respondent to appear and execute handwriting exemplars of the various signatures appearing on the bank signature cards.  When respondent refused to comply with the summons, the United States brought suit to enforce it.  The District Court held that the summons should be enforced, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the summons authority under  7602 does not authorize the IRS to compel the execution of handwriting exemplars.
Held:  The IRS is empowered to compel handwriting exemplars under its summons authority conferred by  7602.  Pp.  444 U. S. 710-719.
(a) While  7602's language may not be explicit in authorizing handwriting exemplars, the duty to appear and give testimony has traditionally encompassed a duty to provide some forms of nontestimonial, physical evidence, including handwriting exemplars.  By imposing an obligation to produce documents as well as to appear and give testimony,  7602's language suggests an intention to codify a broad testimonial obligation, including an obligation to provide some physical evidence relevant and material to a tax investigation.  From this authority to compel the production of some physical evidence, it can properly be concluded that the authority extends to the execution of handwriting exemplars, one variety of physical evidence.  Pp.  444 U. S. 712-714.
(b) This Court has consistently construed congressional intent to require that, if the claimed summons authority is necessary for the effective performance of congressionally imposed responsibilities to enforce the Internal Revenue Code, that authority should be upheld absent express statutory prohibition or substantial countervailing congressional policies.  Pp.  444 U. S. 714-716. 
Page 444 U. S. 708

(c) The authority claimed here is necessary for the effective exercise of the IRS's enforcement responsibilities.  Handwriting exemplars are often an important evidentiary component in establishing liability, the use of such exemplars being an effective method for determining whether a particular name is an alias of a taxpayer.  Pp.  444 U. S. 716-717.
(d) Moreover, the authority claimed here is entirely consistent with the statutory language, and is not in derogation of any countervailing policies or any constitutional rights, compulsion of handwriting exemplars being neither a search or seizure subject to Fourth Amendment protections nor testimonial evidence protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.

Syllabus 
Petitioner company called for the redemption of certain convertible debentures, fixing a date by which debenture holders could convert their debentures into shares of petitioner's stock and after which debenture holders could only redeem their debentures for slightly more than face value.  After the deadline expired, some of the nonconverting debenture holders brought a class action against petitioner, claiming that it had violated federal and state laws by failing to give reasonably adequate notice of the redemption.  The District Court ultimately entered judgment against petitioner, establishing the amount of its liability to the class as a whole, and fixing the amount that each class member could recover on a principal amount of $100 in debentures, with each individual recovery to carry its proportionate share of the total amount allowed for attorney's fees, expenses, and disbursements.  Petitioner appealed only the judgment's provision as to attorney's fees, contending that such fees should be awarded only from the portion of the fund actually claimed by class members, not from the unclaimed portion of the judgment fund.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, since each class member had a present vested interest in the class recovery and could collect his share of the judgment upon request, absentee class members had received a benefit within the meaning of the common fund doctrine, which allows the assessment of attorney's fees against a common fund created by the lawyers' efforts.
Held:
1. The attorney's fee award in this case is a proper application of the common fund doctrine, which rests on the perception that persons who obtain the benefit of a lawsuit without contributing to its costs are unjustly enriched at the successful litigants' expense.  The criteria for application of the doctrine are satisfied when, as here, each member of a certified class has an undisputed and mathematically ascertainable claim to part of a lump sum judgment recovered on his behalf.  In this case, absentee class members need prove only their membership in the injured class to claim their logically ascertainable shares of the judgment fund.  Their right to share the harvest of the suit upon proof of their identity, whether or not they exercise it, is a benefit in the fund created by the efforts of the class representatives and their counsel, and 
Page 444 U. S. 473
 unless absentees contribute to the payment of attorney's fees incurred on their behalves, they will pay nothing for the creation of the fund, and their representatives may bear additional costs.  This inequity is rectified by the District Court's judgment requiring every class member to share attorney's fees to the same extent that he can share the recovery.  Pp.  444 U. S. 478-481.
2. The common fund doctrine, as applied in this case, is entirely consistent with the American rule against taxing the losing party with the victor's attorney's fees.  The class members, whether or not they assert their rights, are at least the equitable owners of their respective shares in the recovery, whereas petitioner's present interest is limited to its stake in resisting third-party claims against the fund in view of petitioner's colorable claim for the return of any unclaimed money.  Although petitioner itself cannot be obliged to pay fees a.warded to the class lawyers, its latent claim against unclaimed money may not defeat each class member's equitable obligation to share the expenses of litigation.  Pp.  444 U. S. 481-482.

After the deadline expired, some of the nonconverting debenture holders brought a class action against petitioner, claiming that it had violated federal and state laws by failing to give reasonably adequate notice of the redemption.  The District Court ultimately entered judgment against petitioner, establishing the amount of its liability to the class as a whole, and fixing the amount that each class member could recover on a principal amount of $100 in debentures, with each individual recovery to carry its proportionate share of the total amount allowed for attorney's fees, expenses, and disbursements.  Petitioner appealed only the judgment's provision as to attorney's fees, contending that such fees should be awarded only from the portion of the fund actually claimed by class members, not from the unclaimed portion of the judgment fund.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, since each class member had a present vested interest in the class recovery and could collect his share of the judgment upon request, absentee class members had received a benefit within the meaning of the common fund doctrine, which allows the assessment of attorney's fees against a common fund created by the lawyers' efforts.
Held:
1. The attorney's fee award in this case is a proper application of the common fund doctrine, which rests on the perception that persons who obtain the benefit of a lawsuit without contributing to its costs are unjustly enriched at the successful litigants' expense.  The criteria for application of the doctrine are satisfied when, as here, each member of a certified class has an undisputed and mathematically ascertainable claim to part of a lump sum judgment recovered on his behalf.  In this case, absentee class members need prove only their membership in the injured class to claim their logically ascertainable shares of the judgment fund.  Their right to share the harvest of the suit upon proof of their identity, whether or not they exercise it, is a benefit in the fund created by the efforts of the class representatives and their counsel, and 
Page 444 U. S. 473
 unless absentees contribute to the payment of attorney's fees incurred on their behalves, they will pay nothing for the creation of the fund, and their representatives may bear additional costs.  This inequity is rectified by the District Court's judgment requiring every class member to share attorney's fees to the same extent that he can share the recovery.  Pp.  444 U. S. 478-481.
2. The common fund doctrine, as applied in this case, is entirely consistent with the American rule against taxing the losing party with the victor's attorney's fees.  The class members, whether or not they assert their rights, are at least the equitable owners of their respective shares in the recovery, whereas petitioner's present interest is limited to its stake in resisting third-party claims against the fund in view of petitioner's colorable claim for the return of any unclaimed money.  Although petitioner itself cannot be obliged to pay fees a.warded to the class lawyers, its latent claim against unclaimed money may not defeat each class member's equitable obligation to share the expenses of litigation.  Pp.  444 U. S. 481-482.

 Aaron E. HENRY et al.v. State of MISSISSIPPINo. 79-504No.79-528 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 19, 1980
 The judgment is affirmed.
 Mr. Justice STEVENS, concurring in the judgment. 
 In 1965, a three-judge District Court was convened in Mississippi to deal with allegations of malapportionment in Mississippi's State Legislature. By 1975, an acceptable reapportionment plan still had not been formulated; nevertheless, quadrennial elections were held under a court-ordered plan. [Footnote 1] In 1978, the Mississippi Legislature enacted a statutory reapportionment plan, which was submitted to the Attorney General of the United States for preclearance under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 1973 et seq. When the Attorney General objected to the plan, the State brought this action in a three-judge District Court in the District of Columbia, seeking a declaratory judgment that the plan was in compliance with the Act. In 1979, while the Voting Rights Act case was still pending, the three-judge court in Mississippi entered a judgment putting into 
Page 444 U.S. 1050 , 1051
 effect a reapportionment plan agreed to by all parties. Connor v. Finch, 469 F.Supp. 693 (SD Miss.). That plan was essentially a modified version of the statutory plan. 
 Under the Voting Rights Act the task confronting the District of Columbia court was to determine whether the statutory plan had the purpose or effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. 42 U.S.C. 1973c. An impermissible effect is created whenever a reapportionment plan has the effect of diluting existing black voting strength. See Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 141, 1363. The District of Columbia court compared the statutory reapportionment plan to the 1979 court-ordered plan in order to determine whether any prohibited retrogression had occurred. Concluding that it had not and that there was no purpose to discriminate evident in the statutory plan, the court granted the State a declaratory judgment approving the plan. Both the United States and intervenors (black voters in Mississippi) appealed. The Court today affirms, without opinion. 
 In my judgment the only significant issue presented on appeal is whether the statutory plan had the impermissible effect of diluting black voting strength. In his dissenting opinion Mr. Justice MARSHALL presents a persuasive case that there were significant discrepancies between the statutory plan and the 1979 court-ordered plan. Because I believe that the 1979 plan was not the proper benchmark to be used in determining whether there was an impermissible effect, I have no occasion to comment on his conclusion that the differences between the two plans were sufficient to constitute a ""dilution"" of black voting strength. 
 As a technical matter, the court-ordered plan was the plan ""in effect"" at the time the District of Columbia court decided the case. [Footnote 2] Nevertheless, all of the parties to both actions realized that the statutory plan would be used in the 1979 [444 U.S. 1050 , 1052]

 February 19, 1980
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.
 Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Mr. Justice POWELL joins, dissenting. 
 An obviously carefully considered opinion of the Court of Appeals comprising 99 pages in a separate appendix to the petition for certiorari in this case, dealing as it does with the complexities, refinements, and contradictions embodied in the decisional law construing 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act is obviously not an attractive candidate for review under our discretionary certiorari jurisdiction. Nonetheless, I do not 
Page 444 U.S. 1093 , 1094
 think we may ""let this cup pass from us"" unless we are prepared to forgo the opportunity to review some propositions enunciated by the Court of Appeals in this case which strike me as little less than bizarre. 
 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN would grant certiorari and set the cases for oral argument. 
 One of the principal issues decided by the Court of Appeals was the obligation of respondent and cross-petitioner Kodak to ""predisclose"" information about its camera and film system to competing camera manufacturers prior to offering such camera and film for sale to the public. As to the camera market issues, the Court of Appeals held that Kodak had no such obligation, but as to the photofinishing and photofinishing equipment markets, the Court of Appeals held that Kodak violated 2 of the Sherman Act by using its market power over films and cameras to obtain a competitive advantage with respect to photofinishing and photofinishing equipment. 603 F.2d 263, 279-285, 304. And as to the joint development project, the court held that Kodak violated 1 of the Sherman Act by including in the agreement a nondisclosure provision, even though Kodak made an investment of millions of dollars in the project that presumably was essential to its success. 
 To one not schooled in the niceties of antitrust litigation, the notion that a statute designed to foster competition requires one competitor to disclose to another, in advance of marketing a product to the general public, its plan to introduce the new product, is difficult to fathom. And this Court has held as recently as United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563 (1966), that it is not a violation of 2 of the Sherman Act for a business with monopoly power to achieve ""growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident."" 384 U.S., at 570-571-1704. I should think this reasoning is equally applicable to the alleged violation of 1 of the Sherman Act which the Court of Appeals also dealt with in its opinion. [444 U.S. 1093 , 1095]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Mr. Justice POWELL joins, dissenting. 
 This case presents an issue of great importance, which cannot help but become greater as time goes on and more and more administrative proceedings are conducted either directly under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, or similar provisions in new Acts of Congress for review of agency action. That question is the degree to which an agency, which publishes a rule for notice and comment under 
Page 444 U.S. 1096 , 1097
 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act and very substantially changes the rule in response to the comments it receives, is obliged to publish the revised rule to allow another opportunity for notice and comment. In deciding this case, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit was fully aware of the problems that could result from a complete ""about face"" by the administrative agency, see BASF Wyandotte Corp. v. Costle, 598 F.2d 637 (1979), as can be seen from this portion of the first paragraph of its opinion concluding the respondent had complied with the Administrative Procedure Act: 
 Petitioner claims that the differences between the effluent limitations imposed in the original regulations and the ones finally promulgated were so great as to make impossible any such judgment by a reviewing court in the absence of further opportunity for notice and comment on the revised regulations. The Court of Appeals' conclusion to the contrary is a carefully reasoned one, and I am not at this point willing to say that I disagree with it. But when we consider the very significant effects that a ""rulemaking"" procedure may have upon the parties involved, see United States v. Florida East Coast R. Co., 410 U.S. 224, 244-245, 820-821 (1973), I think this Court should grant certiorari to examine the question. It is the sort of question upon which there will never be a [444 U.S. 1096 , 1098]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal of California, Second Appellate District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Mr. Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting. 
 I believe that this case presents the substantial question whether the ruling of the California Court of Appeal is consistent with this Court's decision in D. H. Overmyer Co. v. Frick Co., 405 U.S. 174 (1972). See also Isbell v. County of Sonoma, 21 Cal. 3d 61, 145 Cal.Rptr. 368, 577 P.2d 188, cert. denied as out of time, 439 U.S. 996 (1978). 
Page 444 U.S. 1098 , 1099
 The case concerns an agreement of paternity signed by the alleged father of the unborn child of a welfare recipient. The mother-to-be applied for welfare assistance and informed county employees that respondent was the father of her unborn child. At the request of the District Attorney's office, respondent came to that office and spoke with Juanita Hickman, a family support officer. 
 Although respondent expressed some doubts, he told Hickman that ""more than likely I am the father."" Hickman explained to respondent that he could sign an agreement of paternity which would be filed in court and which would result in a judgment of paternity and an order to pay child support. He was advised, alternatively, that if he was not certain he was the father, the office would institute a paternity action and serve him with a summons and complaint; he then would have 30 days to answer and a trial would follow. Respondent signed a paternity agreement, prepared by Hickman. It was filed with the Ventura County Superior Court. The pertinent part of the agreement read: 
 ""It is hereby agreed by plaintiff, through C. STANLEY TROM, District Attorney for the County of Ventura, and Rudy Castro, Jr., defendant, that the following facts are true and that a judgment be entered against the defendant in accordance with this agreement.

 COUNTY OF VENTURAv. Rudy CASTRO, JrNo. 79-633 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 19, 1980
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal of California, Second Appellate District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
 Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Mr. Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting. 
 I believe that this case presents the substantial question whether the ruling of the California Court of Appeal is consistent with this Court's decision in D. H. Overmyer Co. v. Frick Co., 405 U.S. 174 (1972). See also Isbell v. County of Sonoma, 21 Cal. 3d 61, 145 Cal.Rptr. 368, 577 P.2d 188, cert. denied as out of time, 439 U.S. 996 (1978).

 The case concerns an agreement of paternity signed by the alleged father of the unborn child of a welfare recipient. The mother-to-be applied for welfare assistance and informed county employees that respondent was the father of her unborn child. At the request of the District Attorney's office, respondent came to that office and spoke with Juanita Hickman, a family support officer. 
 Although respondent expressed some doubts, he told Hickman that ""more than likely I am the father."" Hickman explained to respondent that he could sign an agreement of paternity which would be filed in court and which would result in a judgment of paternity and an order to pay child support. He was advised, alternatively, that if he was not certain he was the father, the office would institute a paternity action and serve him with a summons and complaint; he then would have 30 days to answer and a trial would follow. Respondent signed a paternity agreement, prepared by Hickman. It was filed with the Ventura County Superior Court. The pertinent part of the agreement read: 
 ""It is hereby agreed by plaintiff, through C. STANLEY TROM, District Attorney for the County of Ventura, and Rudy Castro, Jr., defendant, that the following facts are true and that a judgment be entered against the defendant in accordance with this agreement.

444 U.S. 286

Syllabus 
A products liability action was instituted in an Oklahoma st,ate court by respondents husband and wife to recover for personal injuries sustained in Oklahoma in an accident involving an automobile that had been purchased by them in New York while they were New York residents and that was being driven through Oklahoma at the time of the accident.  The defendants included the automobile retailer and its wholesaler (petitioners), New York corporations that did no business in Oklahoma.  Petitioners entered special appearances, claiming that Oklahoma's exercise of jurisdiction over them would offend limitations on the State's jurisdiction imposed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The trial court rejected petitioners' claims, and they then sought, but were denied, a writ of prohibition in the Oklahoma Supreme Court to restrain respondent trial judge from exercising in personam jurisdiction over them.
Held:  Consistently with the Due Process Clause, the Oklahoma trial court may not exercise in personam jurisdiction over petitioners.  Pp.  444 U. S. 291-299.
(a) A state court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only so long as there exist ""minimum contacts"" between the defendant and the forum State.  International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310.  The defendant's contacts with the forum State must be such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, id. at  326 U. S. 316, and the relationship between the defendant and the forum must be such that it is ""reasonable . . . to require the corporation to defend the particular suit which is brought there,"" id. at  326 U. S. 317.  The Due Process Clause
""does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties, or relations.""
Id. at  326 U. S. 319.  Pp.  444 U. S. 291-294.
(b) Here, there is a total absence in the record of those affiliating circumstances that are a necessary predicate to any exercise of state court jurisdiction.  Petitioners carry on no activity whatsoever in Oklahoma; they close no sales and perform no services there, avail 
Page 444 U. S. 287
 themselves of none of the benefits of Oklahoma law, and solicit no business there either through salespersons or through advertising reasonably calculated to reach that State.  Nor does the record show that they regularly sell cars to Oklahoma residents, or that they indirectly, through others, serve or seek to serve the Oklahoma market.  Although it is foreseeable that automobiles sold by petitioners would travel to Oklahoma and that the automobile here might cause injury in Oklahoma, ""foreseeability"" alone is not a sufficient benchmark for personal jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause.  The foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is not the mere likelihood that a product will find its way into the forum State, but rather is that the defendant's conduct and connection with the forum are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.  Nor can jurisdiction be supported on the theory that petitioners earn substantial revenue from goods used in Oklahoma.  Pp.  444 U. S. 295-299.

No. 78-952
Argued October 3, 1979
Decided January 21, 1980
444 U.S. 320

Syllabus 
While a resident of Indiana, appellee was injured in an accident in Indiana while riding as a passenger in a car driven by appellant Rush, also an Indiana resident.  After moving to Minnesota, appellee commenced this action against Rush in a Minnesota state court, alleging negligence and seeking damages.  As Rush had no contacts with Minnesota that would support in personam jurisdiction, appellee attempted to obtain quasi in rem jurisdiction by garnishing the contractual obligation of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (State Farm) to defend and indemnify Rush in connection with such a suit.  State Farm, which does business in Minnesota, had insured the car, owned by Rush's father, under a liability insurance policy issued in Indiana.  Rush was personally served in Indiana, and after State Farm's response to the garnishment summons asserted that it owed the defendant nothing, appellee moved the trial court for permission to file a supplemental complaint making the garnishee, State Farm, a party to the action.  Rush and State Farm moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the defendant.  The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and granted the motion for leave to file the supplemental complaint.  The Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed, ultimately holding that the assertion of quasi in rem jurisdiction under the Minnesota garnishment statute complied with the due process standards enunciated in Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186.
Held:  A State may not constitutionally exercise quasi in rem jurisdiction over a defendant who has no forum contacts by attaching the contractual obligation of an insurer licensed to do business in the State to defend and indemnify him in connection with the suit.  Pp.  444 U. S. 327-333.
(a) A State may exercise jurisdiction over an absent defendant only if the defendant has certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.  International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310.  In determining whether a particular exercise of state court jurisdiction is consistent with due process, the inquiry must focus on ""the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.""  Shaffer v. Heitner, supra at  433 U. S. 204.  P. 327.
(b) Here, the only affiliating circumstance offered to show a relationship among Rush, Minnesota, and this lawsuit is that Rush's insurance 
Page 444 U. S. 321
 company does business in the State. However, the fictional presence in Minnesota of State Farm's policy obligation to defend and indemnify Rush -- derived from combining the legal fiction that assigns a situs to a debt, for garnishment purposes, wherever the debtor is found with the legal fiction that a corporation is ""present,"" for jurisdictional purposes, wherever it does business -- cannot be deemed to give the State the power to determine Rush's liability for the out-of-state accident.  The mere presence of property in a State does not establish a sufficient relationship between the owner of the property and the State to support the exercise of jurisdiction over an unrelated cause of action, and it cannot be said that the defendant engaged in any purposeful activity related to the forum that would make the exercise of jurisdiction fair, just, or reasonable merely because his insurer does business there.  Nor does the policy provide significant contacts between the litigation and the forum, for the policy obligations pertain only to the conduct, not the substance, of the litigation.  Pp.  444 U. S. 327-330.
(c) Moreover, the requisite minimum contacts with the forum cannot be established under an alternative approach attributing the insurer's forum contacts to the defendant by treating the attachment procedure as the functional equivalent of a direct action against the insurer, and considering the insured a ""nominal defendant"" in order to obtain jurisdiction over the insurer.  The State's ability to exert its power over the ""nominal defendant"" is analytically prerequisite to the insurer's entry into the case as a garnishee, and if the Constitution forbids the assertion of jurisdiction over the insured based on the policy, then there is no conceptual basis for bringing the ""garnishee"" into the action.  Nor may the Minnesota court attribute State Farm's contacts to Rush by considering the ""defending parties"" together and aggregating their forum contacts in determining whether it has jurisdiction.  The parties' relationships with each other may be significant in evaluating their ties to the forum, but the requirements of International Shoe must be met as to each defendant over whom a state court exercises jurisdiction.  Pp.  444 U. S. 330-332.

Syllabus 
Air Force regulations require members of that service to obtain approval from their commanders before circulating petitions on Air Force bases.  Respondent Air Force Reserve officer was removed from active duty for distributing on an Air Force base petitions to Members of Congress and the Secretary of Defense, which complained about Air Force grooming standards, without having obtained approval of the base commander as required by the regulations.  Respondent then brought suit in District Court challenging the validity of the regulations.  That court granted summary judgment for respondent, declaring the regulations facially invalid, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The regulations are not invalid on their face.  Pp.  444 U. S. 353-361.
(a) Such regulations do not violate the First Amendment.  Greer v. Spock, 424 U. S. 828.  They protect a substantial Government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression -- the interest in maintaining the respect for duty and discipline so vital to military effectiveness -- and restrict speech no more than is reasonably necessary to protect such interest.  Since a military commander is charged with maintaining morale, discipline, and readiness, he must have authority over the distribution of materials that could affect adversely these essential attributes of an effective military force.  Pp.  444 U. S. 353-358.
(b) Nor do the regulations violate 10 U.S.C.  1034, which proscribes unwarranted restrictions on a serviceman's right to communicate with a Member of Congress.  As  1034's legislative history makes clear, Congress enacted the statute to ensure that an individual member of the Armed Services could write to his elected representatives without sending his communication through official channels, and not to protect the circulation of collective petitions within a military base.  Permitting an individual serviceman to submit a petition directly to any Member of Congress serves  1034's legislative purpose without unnecessarily endangering a commander's ability to preserve morale and good order among his troops.

No. 78-990
Argued November 7, 1979
Decided January 21, 1980*
444 U.S. 394

Syllabus 
Upon being apprehended after their escape from the District of Columbia jail, respondents were indicted for violating 18 U.S.C.  751(a), which governs escape from federal custody.  At the trial of respondents Cooley, Bailey, and Walker, the District Court, after respondents had adduced evidence of conditions in the jail and their reasons for not returning to custody, rejected their proffered jury instruction on duress as a defense, ruling that they had failed as a matter of law to present evidence sufficient to support such a defense because they had not turned themselves in after they had escaped the allegedly coercive conditions, and, after receiving instructions to disregard the evidence of the jail conditions, the jury convicted respondents of violating  751(a).  At respondent Cogdell's trial, the District Court ruled that, absent testimony of what he did between the time of his escape and his apprehension, he could not present evidence of conditions at the jail, and he was also convicted by the jury of violating  751(a).  The Court of Appeals reversed each respondent's conviction and remanded for new trials, holding that the District Court should have allowed the respective juries to consider the evidence of coercive conditions at the jail in determining whether respondents had formulated the requisite intent to sustain a conviction under  751(a), which required the prosecution to prove that a particular defendant left federal custody voluntarily, without permission, and ""with an intent to avoid confinement,"" an escapee not acting with the requisite intent if he escaped in order to avoid ""non-confinement conditions"" as opposed to ""normal aspects of confinement.'""  The court further held that, since respondents had been indicted for fleeing and escaping on or about a certain date, and not for leaving and staying away from custody, and since the jury instructions gave the impression that respondents were being tried only for leaving the jail on a certain date, and not for failing to return at some later date, neither respondents nor the juries were acquainted with the proposition that the escapes in question were continuing 
Page 444 U. S. 395
 offenses, an omission which constituted a violation of respondents' right to a jury trial.
Held:
1. The prosecution fulfills its burden under  751(a) if it demonstrates that an escapee knew his actions would result in his leaving physical confinement without permission.  Nothing in  751(a)'s language or legislative history indicates that Congress intended to require such a heightened standard of culpability or such a narrow definition of confinement as the Court of Appeals required.  Pp.  444 U. S. 403-409.
2. In order to be entitled to an instruction on duress or necessity as a defense to a charge of escape, an escapee must first offer evidence justifying his continued absence from custody as well as his initial departure, and an indispensable element of such an offer is testimony of a bona fide effort to surrender or return to custody as soon as the claimed duress or necessity had lost its coercive force.  On the record here, such evidence and testimony were lacking, and hence respondents were not entitled to any instruction on duress or necessity.  Pp.  444 U. S. 409-415.
(a) Escape from federal custody as defined in  751(a) is a continuing offense, and an escapee can be held liable for failure to return to custody as well as for his initial departure.  Pp.  444 U. S. 413-414.
(b) But there was no significant ""variance"" in the indictments here merely because respondents were not indicted under a theory of escape as a continuing offense and because the District Court did not explain such theory to the juries.  The indictments, which tracked closely  751(a)'s language, were sufficient under the standard deeming an indictment sufficient
""if it, first, contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs the defendant of the charge against which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense,""
Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87,  418 U. S. 117.  And it was unnecessary for the District Court to elaborate for the juries' benefit on the continuing nature of the charged offense where the evidence failed as a matter of law in a crucial particular to reach the minimum threshold that would have required an instruction on respondents' theory of the case generally.  Pp.  444 U. S. 414-415.
3. If an affirmative defense consists of several elements and testimony supporting one element is, as here, insufficient to sustain it even if believed, the trial court and jury need not be burdened with testimony supporting other elements of the defense.  If it were held that the juries in these cases should have been subjected to a potpourri of evidence as to the jail conditions even though a critical element of the proffered defense of duress or necessity was absent, every trial

Congress enacted  1034 to ensure that an individual member of the Armed Forces could write to his elected representatives without sending his communication through official channels.  Permitting an individual member of the Armed Forces to submit a petition directly to any Member of Congress serves the purpose of  1034 without unnecessarily endangering a commander's ability to preserve morale and good order among his troops.

Syllabus 
Section 349(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides that
""a person who is a national of the United States whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by . . . taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof.""
Section 349(c) provides that the party claiming that such loss of citizenship occurred must ""establish such claim by a preponderance of the evidence,"" and that a person who commits any act of expatriation
""shall be presumed to have done so voluntarily, but such presumption may be rebutted upon a showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the act or acts committed or performed were not done voluntarily.""
Appellee, who was a citizen of both the United States and Mexico at birth, subsequently obtained a certificate of Mexican citizenship after executing an application in which he swore allegiance to Mexico and expressly renounced his United States citizenship.  Thereafter, the Department of State issued a certificate of loss of nationality, and the Board of Appellate Review of the Department of State affirmed.  Appellee then brought suit for a declaration of his United States nationality, but the District Court concluded that the United States had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that appellee had knowingly and voluntarily taken an oath of allegiance to Mexico and renounced allegiance to the United States, thus voluntarily relinquishing United States citizenship pursuant to  349(a)(2).  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that Congress had no power to legislate the evidentiary standard contained in  349(c), and that the Constitution required that proof be not merely by a preponderance of the evidence, but by ""clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.""
Held:
1. In establishing loss of citizenship, the Government must prove an intent to surrender United States citizenship, not just the voluntary commission of an expatriating act such as swearing allegiance to a foreign nation.  Congress does not have any general power to take away an American citizen's citizenship without his ""assent,"" which means an intent to relinquish citizenship, whether the intent is expressed in 
Page 444 U. S. 253
 words or is found as a fair inference from his conduct.  The expatriating acts specified in  349(a) cannot be treated as conclusive evidence of the indispensable voluntary assent of the citizen.  The trier of fact must, in the end, conclude that the citizen not only voluntarily committed the expatriating act prescribed in the statute, but also intended to relinquish his citizenship.  Cf. Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U. S. 253.  Pp.  444 U. S. 258-263.
2. However, the Constitution permits Congress to prescribe the standard of proof in expatriation proceedings.  The specific evidentiary standard provided in  349(c) is not invalid under either the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Although the Due Process Clause imposes requirements of proof beyond a preponderance of the evidence in criminal and involuntary commitment contexts, nevertheless expatriation proceedings are civil in nature, and do not threaten a loss of liberty, and thus Congress did not exceed its powers by requiring proof of an intentional expatriating act by only a preponderance of evidence.  Pp.  444 U. S. 264-267.
3. Nor is the presumption of voluntariness provided in  349(c) constitutionally infirm.  While the statute provides that any of the statutory expatriating acts, if proved, is presumed to have been committed voluntarily, it does not also direct a presumption that the act has been performed with the intent to relinquish United States citizenship, which matter remains the burden of the party claiming expatriation to prove by a preponderance of the evidence.  Section 349(c) and its legislative history make clear that Congress preferred the ordinary rule that voluntariness of an act is presumed and that duress is an affirmative defense to be proved by the party asserting it, and to invalidate the rule here would give the Citizenship Clause far more scope in this context than the relevant circumstances that brought the Fourteenth Amendment into being would suggest appropriate.

			"|"Vance v. Terrazas
No. 71143
Argued October 30, 1979
Decided January 15, 1980
444 U.S. 252

Syllabus 
Section 349(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides that
""a person who is a national of the United States whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by . . . taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof.""
Section 349(c) provides that the party claiming that such loss of citizenship occurred must ""establish such claim by a preponderance of the evidence,"" and that a person who commits any act of expatriation
""shall be presumed to have done so voluntarily, but such presumption may be rebutted upon a showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the act or acts committed or performed were not done voluntarily.""
Appellee, who was a citizen of both the United States and Mexico at birth, subsequently obtained a certificate of Mexican citizenship after executing an application in which he swore allegiance to Mexico and expressly renounced his United States citizenship.  Thereafter, the Department of State issued a certificate of loss of nationality, and the Board of Appellate Review of the Department of State affirmed.  Appellee then brought suit for a declaration of his United States nationality, but the District Court concluded that the United States had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that appellee had knowingly and voluntarily taken an oath of allegiance to Mexico and renounced allegiance to the United States, thus voluntarily relinquishing United States citizenship pursuant to  349(a)(2).  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that Congress had no power to legislate the evidentiary standard contained in  349(c), and that the Constitution required that proof be not merely by a preponderance of the evidence, but by ""clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.""
Held:
1. In establishing loss of citizenship, the Government must prove an intent to surrender United States citizenship, not just the voluntary commission of an expatriating act such as swearing allegiance to a foreign nation.  Congress does not have any general power to take away an American citizen's citizenship without his ""assent,"" which means an intent to relinquish citizenship, whether the intent is expressed in 
Page 444 U. S. 253
 words or is found as a fair inference from his conduct.  The expatriating acts specified in  349(a) cannot be treated as conclusive evidence of the indispensable voluntary assent of the citizen.  The trier of fact must, in the end, conclude that the citizen not only voluntarily committed the expatriating act prescribed in the statute, but also intended to relinquish his citizenship.  Cf. Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U. S. 253.  Pp.  444 U. S. 258-263.
2. However, the Constitution permits Congress to prescribe the standard of proof in expatriation proceedings.  The specific evidentiary standard provided in  349(c) is not invalid under either the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Although the Due Process Clause imposes requirements of proof beyond a preponderance of the evidence in criminal and involuntary commitment contexts, nevertheless expatriation proceedings are civil in nature, and do not threaten a loss of liberty, and thus Congress did not exceed its powers by requiring proof of an intentional expatriating act by only a preponderance of evidence.  Pp.  444 U. S. 264-267.
3. Nor is the presumption of voluntariness provided in  349(c) constitutionally infirm.  While the statute provides that any of the statutory expatriating acts, if proved, is presumed to have been committed voluntarily, it does not also direct a presumption that the act has been performed with the intent to relinquish United States citizenship, which matter remains the burden of the party claiming expatriation to prove by a preponderance of the evidence.  Section 349(c) and its legislative history make clear that Congress preferred the ordinary rule that voluntariness of an act is presumed and that duress is an affirmative defense to be proved by the party asserting it, and to invalidate the rule here would give the Citizenship Clause far more scope in this context than the relevant circumstances that brought the Fourteenth Amendment into being would suggest appropriate.  Pp.  444 U. S. 267-270.

No. 78-1268
Argued November 5, 1979
Decided January 15, 1980
444 U.S. 277

Syllabus 
Appellants' decedent, a 15-year-old girl, was murdered by a parolee five months after he was released from prison despite his history as a sex offender.  Appellants brought an action in a California court under state law and 42 U.S.C.  1983, claiming that appellee state officials, by their action in releasing the parolee, subjected the decedent to a deprivation of her life without due process of law, and were therefore liable in damages for the harm caused by the parolee.  The trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that a California statute granting public employees absolute immunity from liability for any injury resulting from parole release determinations provided appellees with a complete defense to appellants' state law claims, and that appellees enjoyed quasi-judicial immunity from liability under 42 U.S.C.  1983.
Held:
1. The California immunity statute is not unconstitutional when applied to defeat a tort claim arising under state law.  Pp.  444 U. S. 280-283.
(a) The statute, which merely provides a defense to potential state tort law liability, did not deprive appellants' decedent of her life without due process of law because it condoned a parole decision that led indirectly to her death.  A legislative decision that has an incremental impact on the probability that death will result in any given situation cannot be characterized as state action depriving a person of life just because it may set in motion a chain of events that ultimately leads to the random death of an innocent bystander.  P.  444 U. S. 281.
(b) Even if the statute can be characterized as a deprivation of property, the State's interest in fashioning its own rules of tort law is paramount to any discernible federal interest, except perhaps an interest in protecting the individual citizen from wholly arbitrary or irrational state action.  The statute is not irrational, because the California Legislature could reasonably conclude that judicial review of parole decisions ""would inevitably inhibit the exercise of discretion,"" and that this inhibiting effect could impair the State's ability to implement a parole program designed to promote rehabilitation of inmates,  
Page 444 U. S. 278
 as well as. security within prisons by holding out a promise of potential rewards.  Pp.  444 U. S. 281-283.
2. Appellants did not allege a claim for relief under federal law.  Pp.  444 U. S. 283-285.
(a) The Fourteenth Amendment protected appellants' decedent only from deprivation by the State of life without due process of law, and although the decision to release the parolee from prison was action by the State, the parolee's action five months later cannot be fairly characterized as state action.  Pp.  444 U. S. 284-285.
(b) Regardless of whether, as a matter of state tort law, the parole board either had a ""duty"" to avoid harm to the parolee's victim or proximately caused her death, appellees did not ""deprive"" appellants' decedent of life within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.  P.  444 U. S. 285.
(c) Under the particular circumstances where the parolee was in no sense an agent of the parole board, and the board was not aware that appellants' decedent, as distinguished from the public at large, faced any special danger, appellants' decedent's death was too remote consequence of appellees' action to hold them responsible under  1983.

Syllabus 
The Court of Appeals, in affirming petitioner's conviction, accepted the Government's position that there had been no violation of the Department of Justice's ""Petite"" policy -- whereby United States attorneys are forbidden to prosecute any person if the allegedly criminal behavior was an ingredient of a previous state prosecution against that person (as in the instant case), except where federal prosecution is specifically authorized in advance by the Department itself upon a finding that the prosecution will serve compelling interests of federal law enforcement.

Argued November 6, 1979
Decided January 8, 1980
444 U.S. 232

Syllabus 
Petitioners, claiming individually and on behalf of a certain class of real estate purchasers and sellers, instituted this private antitrust action in Federal District Court against respondents, certain real estate firms and trade associations and a class consisting of real estate brokers who had transacted realty brokerage business in the Greater New Orleans area during the four years preceding the filing of the complaint.  Petitioners alleged, inter alia, that respondents had engaged in a price-fixing conspiracy in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act through an agreement to conform to a fixed rate of brokerage commissions on sales of residential property.  The complaint also included allegations that respondents' activities were ""within the flow of interstate commerce and have an effect upon that commerce,"" and that respondents assisted their clients in securing financing and title insurance which came from sources outside the State.  Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under the Sherman Act, contending that their activities were purely local in nature, and did not substantially affect interstate commerce.  The District Court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint, holding that, under Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, there must be a substantial volume of interstate commerce involved in the overall real estate transaction and the challenged activity must be an essential, integral part of the transaction, inseparable from its interstate aspects; and that here a broker's participation in the presumably interstate aspects of securing title insurance and financing was only incidental, rather than indispensable.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, under Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, supra, Sherman Act jurisdiction did not exist, because petitioners had failed to demonstrate that real estate brokers are either necessary or integral participants in the interstate aspects of residential real estate financing and title insurance.
Held:  The complaint should not have been dismissed at this stage of the proceedings.  Pp.  444 U. S. 241-247.
(a) To establish jurisdiction under the Sherman Act, a plaintiff must allege the relationship between the activity involved and some aspect of 
Page 444 U. S. 233
 interstate commerce and, if these allegations are controverted, must submit evidence to demonstrate either that the defendants' activity is itself in interstate commerce or, if it is local in nature, that it has an effect on some other appreciable activity demonstrably in interstate commerce.  Here, petitioners may establish the jurisdictional element of a Sherman Act violation by demonstrating a substantial effect on interstate commerce generated by respondents' brokerage activity, and petitioners need not make the more particularized showing of an effect on interstate commerce caused by the alleged conspiracy to fix commission rates, or by those other aspects of respondents' activity that are alleged to be unlawful.  Pp.  444 U. S. 241-243.
(b) The courts below misinterpreted Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, supra, as requiring that petitioners demonstrate that real estate brokers are either necessary or integral participants in the interstate aspects of residential real estate financing and title insurance.  The Goldfarb holding was not addressed to the ""effect on commerce"" test of jurisdiction, and in no way restricted it to those challenged activities that have an integral relationship to an activity in interstate commerce.

Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that, when the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) considered alternative sites before redesignating a proposed site for middle-income housing as one for low-income housing it should have given determinative weight to environmental factors such as crowding low-income housing into a concentrated area and should not have considered the delay that would occur in developing an alternative site as an overriding factor.  Once an agency has made a decision subject to the procedural requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the only role for a court is to insure that the agency has considered the environmental consequences; it cannot interject itself within the area of discretion of the executive as to the choice of the action to be taken.  Here, there is no doubt that HUD considered the environmental consequences of its decision to redesignate the proposed site for low-income housing, and the Act requires no more.
Certiorari granted; 590 F.2d 39, reversed.

 Robert PEER, Director, etc., et al.v. Nanette GRIFFETH et al.No. 79-807. 
 Facts and opinion, D.C., 448 F.Supp. 1137; 603 F.2d 118. 
 Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 April 14, 1980. Denied.

 The Court of Appeals has taken a significant step in this case to expand the ruling of this Court in Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S. Ct. 1011 (1970), a step that I believe merits plenary consideration by the full Court. The question pertains to whether an applicant for state-mandated welfare benefits is entitled to a hearing under the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution before being denied welfare benefits for failure to meet the initial requirements imposed by state law. The California courts themselves, in Zobriscky v. Los Angeles County, 28 Cal.App.3d 930, 105 Cal. Rptr. 121 (1972), have concluded that an applicant is not entitled to any hearing because, in the words of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, they ""refused to find general relief to be a protected property interest."" Griffeth v. Detrich, 603 F.2d 118, 121 (1979). 
 There has been much decisional law from this and other courts, and much scholarly commentary as to what is a protected ""property"" interest under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, and what procedural guarantees are necessary under that Clause before one may be denied such a property interest. See, e. g., Goldberg v. Kelly, supra; Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (1972); Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976); Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1d 668 (1979); Van Alstyne, Cracks in ""The New Property"": Adjudicative Due Process in the Administrative State, 62 Cornell L.Rev. 445 (1977). Obviously this Court cannot parse every state-law provision to determine whether it creates a protected ""property interest"" under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But 
Page 445 U.S. 970 , 971
 here I believe the District Court put its finger on the significance of the case when it ruled against respondents, saying: 
 Particularly when the only state appellate court to consider the question has concluded that there is no protected property interest under state law, this extension of Goldberg v. Kelly, supra, should receive plenary consideration by this Court.
