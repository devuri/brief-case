v. City of Berkeley, California
No. 80-737
Argued October 14, 1981
Decided December 14, 1981
454 U.S. 290

Syllabus 
A Berkeley, Cal., ordinance places a limitation of $250 on contributions to committees formed to support or oppose ballot measures submitted to a popular vote.  When appellant association, which was formed to oppose a ballot measure imposing rent control in the city, accepted some contributions exceeding the $250 limit, appellee Berkeley Fair Campaign Practices Commission ordered the association to pay the excess into the city treasury.  The association then brought suit in California Superior Court seeking injunctive relief against enforcement of the ordinance, and that court subsequently granted summary judgment for the association, holding that the ordinance was invalid on its face as a violation of the First Amendment.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, but the California Supreme Court reversed, holding that the ordinance furthered compelling governmental interests in ensuring that special interest groups could not ""corrupt"" the initiative process by spending large amounts to support or oppose a ballot measure, which interests outweighed the First Amendment interests infringed upon.
Held:  The restraint imposed by the ordinance on the right of association, and, in turn, on individual and collective rights of expression, plainly contravenes both the right of association and the speech guarantees of the First Amendment.  Pp.  454 U. S. 294-300.
(a) To place a limit on individuals wishing to band together to advance their views on a ballot measure, while placing no limit on individuals acting alone, is clearly a restraint on the right of association.  Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, held that contributions to candidates or their committees could be restricted in order to prevent corruption or its appearance.  Here, there is no risk of corruption, because this case relates to contributions to committees favoring or opposing ballot measures.  Also, there is no risk that the voters will be in doubt as to the identity of those whose money supports or opposes a given ballot measure, since the contributors must make their identities known under the disclosure provisions of the ordinance.  Under the exacting judicial review appropriate for infringements 
Page 454 U. S. 291
 of First Amendment rights, the $250 limit is unconstitutional.  Pp.  454 U. S. 295-299.
(b) The contribution limit automatically affects expenditures, and limits on expenditures operate as a direct restraint on freedom of expression of groups and individuals wishing to express themselves through groups.  There is no significant state or public interest in curtailing debate and discussion of a ballot measure, and the integrity of the political system will be adequately protected if contributors are identified in a public filing revealing the amounts contributed.  Pp.  454 U. S. 299-300.

No. 80-824
Argued October 13, 1981
Decided December 14, 1981
454 U.S. 312

Syllabus 
Respondent brought suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioners Polk County, its Offender Advocate, its Board of Supervisors, and Martha Shepard, an attorney in the Offender Advocate's Office.  As the factual basis for his lawsuit, respondent alleged that Shepard, who had been assigned to represent him in an appeal of a criminal conviction to the Iowa Supreme Court, failed to represent him adequately, since she had moved for permission to withdraw as counsel on the ground that respondent's claims were legally frivolous.  The Iowa Supreme Court granted Shepard's motion and dismissed respondent's appeal.  In the District Court, respondent alleged that Shepard's actions violated certain of his constitutional rights.  To establish that Shepard acted ""under color of state law,"" a jurisdictional requisite for a  1983 action, respondent relied on her employment by the county.  The District Court dismissed the claims against all of the petitioners, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. A public defender does not act ""under color of state law"" when performing a lawyer's traditional functions as counsel to an indigent defendant in a state criminal proceeding.  Because it was based on such activities, the complaint against Shepard must be dismissed.  Pp.  454 U. S. 317-325.
(a) From the moment of Shepard's assignment to represent respondent, their relationship became identical to that existing between any other lawyer and client, except for the source of Shepard's payment.  The legal system posits that a defense lawyer best serves the public not by acting on the State's behalf or in concert with it, but rather by advancing the undivided interests of the client.  This is essentially a private function for which state office and authority are not needed.  Pp.  454 U. S. 317-319.
(b) Cases in which this Court assumed that state-employed doctors serving in supervisory capacities at state institutions could be held liable under  1983 are not controlling.  O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563, and Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, distinguished.  Pp.  454 U. S. 319-320.
(c) Although the employment relationship between the State and a public defender is a relevant factor, it is insufficient to establish that a 
Page 454 U. S. 313
 public defender acts under color of state law within the meaning of  1983.  A public defender is not amenable to administrative direction in the same sense as other state employees.  And equally important, it is the State's constitutional obligation to respect the professional independence of the public defenders whom it engages.  Pp.  454 U. S. 320-322.
(d) It is the ethical obligation of any lawyer -- whether privately retained or publicly appointed -- not to clog the courts with frivolous motions or appeals.  Respondent has no legitimate complaint that Shepard failed to prosecute a frivolous appeal on his behalf.  Pp.  454 U. S. 322-324.
2. Respondent has not alleged unconstitutional action by Polk County, its Offender Advocate, or its Board of Supervisors.  To the extent that his claims rest on a respondeat superior theory of liability, they fail to present a claim under 1983.  And a constitutional tort actionable under  1983 is not described by the bald allegations that Shepard had injured respondent while acting pursuant to administrative rules and procedures, and that the county ""retains and maintains, advocates out of law school"" who have on numerous occasions moved to withdraw from appeals of convictions.  Respondent failed to allege any administrative policy that arguably caused a violation of his rights under the Sixth, Eighth, or Fourteenth Amendments.  An official,policy of withdrawal from frivolous cases would not violate the Constitution.  Pp.  454 U. S. 325-327.

|454 u.s. 339|"Harris v. Rivera
No. 81-17
Decided December 14, 1981
454 U.S. 339

Syllabus 
A New York trial judge, sitting without a jury, convicted respondent and his wife but acquitted their codefendant on charges arising out of a robbery, notwithstanding if the judge had credited the testimony of the prosecution's main witness (the victim), he presumably would have convicted all three defendants or, conversely, if he had credited the testimony of the only defense witness (the codefendant), he presumably would have acquitted all three.  Respondent's conviction was affirmed on appeal.  His subsequent application in Federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus was denied.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals held that the New York trial judge had committed constitutional error because he had not explained the apparent inconsistency in his verdicts acquitting the codefendant and convicting respondent.  Accordingly, the court ordered the state trial judge either to grant respondent a new trial or to make findings demonstrating a rational basis for the facially inconsistent verdicts.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred when, without first determining whether an inconsistent verdict would be unconstitutional, it directed the state trial judge to provide an explanation of the apparent inconsistency in his verdicts.  Federal judges have no general supervisory power over state trial judges, and may not require the observance of any special procedures except when necessary to assure compliance with the dictates of the Federal Constitution.
2. An apparent inconsistency in a trial judge's verdict does not give rise to an inference of irregularity in his finding of guilt that is sufficiently strong to overcome the well established presumption that the judge adhered to basic rules of procedure.  Here, even assuming that the codefendant's acquittal was logically inconsistent with respondent's conviction, respondent, who was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt after a fair trial, has no constitutional ground to complain that his codefendant was acquitted.
Certiorari granted; 643 F.2d 86, reversed.

The Court of Appeals' mandate -- holding unconstitutional a policy of conducting routine strip-searches of all persons held at the Arlington County, Va., Detention Center, and remanding the case to the District Court for further proceedings -- is stayed temporarily, pending consideration of the reapplication for a stay by the full Court.

||"Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno
No. 8048
Argued October 14, 1981
Decided December 8, 1981*
454 U.S. 235

Syllabus 
Respondent, as representative of the estates of several citizens and residents of Scotland who were killed in an airplane crash in Scotland during a charter flight, instituted wrongful death litigation in a California state court against petitioners, which are the company that manufactured the plane in Pennsylvania and the company that manufactured the plane's propellers in Ohio.  At the time of the crash, the plane was registered in Great Britain and was owned and operated by companies organized in the United Kingdom.  The pilot and all of the decedents' heirs and next of kin were Scottish subjects and citizens, and the investigation of the accident was conducted by British authorities.  Respondent sought to recover from petitioners on the basis of negligence or strict liability (not recognized by Scottish law), and admitted that the action was filed in the United States because its laws regarding liability, capacity to sue, and damages are more favorable to respondent's position than those of Scotland.  On petitioners' motion, the action was removed to a Federal District Court in California and was then transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1404(a).  The District Court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss the action on the ground offorum non conveniens.  Relying on the test set forth in Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, and analyzing the ""private interest factors"" affecting the litigants' convenience and the ""public interest factors"" affecting the forum's convenience, as set forth in Gilbert, the District Court concluded that Scotland was the appropriate forum.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court had abused its discretion in conducting the Gilbert analysis and that, in any event, dismissal is automatically barred where 
Page 454 U. S. 236
 the law of the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiff than the law of the forum chosen by the plaintiff.
Held:
1. Plaintiffs may not defeat a motion to dismiss on the ground of forum non conveniens merely by showing that the substantive law that would be applied in the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiffs than that of the chosen forum.  The possibility of a change in substantive law should ordinarily not be given conclusive or even substantial weight in the forum non conveniens inquiry.  Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson Steamships, Ltd., 285 U. S. 413.  Pp.  454 U. S. 247-255.
(a) Under Gilbert, supra, dismissal will ordinarily be appropriate where trial in the plaintiff's chosen forum imposes a heavy burden on the defendant or the court, and where the plaintiff is unable to offer any specific reasons of convenience supporting his choice.  If substantial weight were given to the possibility of an unfavorable change in law, however, dismissal might be barred even where trial in the chosen forum was plainly inconvenient, and the forum non conveniens doctrine would become virtually useless.  Such an approach not only would be inconsistent with the purpose of the forum non conveniens doctrine, but also would pose substantial practical problems, requiring that trial courts determine complex problems in conflict of laws and comparative law, and increasing the flow into American courts of litigation by foreign plaintiffs against American manufacturers.  Pp.  454 U. S. 248-252.
(b) Nor may an analogy be drawn between forum non conveniens dismissals and transfers between federal courts pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1404(a), which was construed in Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U. S. 612, as precluding a transfer if it resulted in a change in the applicable law.  The statute was enacted to permit change of venue between federal courts, and although it was drafted in accordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens, it was intended to be a revision, rather than a codification of the common law.  District courts were given more discretion to transfer under  1404(a) than they had to dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens. Van Dusen v. Barrack, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  454 U. S. 253-254.
2. The District Court properly decided that the presumption in favor of the plaintiff's forum choice applied with less than maximum force when the plaintiff or (as here) the real parties in interest are foreign.  When the plaintiff has chosen the home forum, it is reasonable to assume that the choice is convenient; but when the plaintiff or real parties in interest are foreign, this assumption is much less reasonable, and the plaintiff's choice deserves less deference.  Pp.  454 U. S. 255-256. 
Page 454 U. S. 237

3. The forum non conveniens determination is committed to the trial court's sound discretion, and may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion.  Here, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the private and public interests under the Gilbert analysis, and thereby determining that the trial should be held in Scotland.  Pp.  454 U. S. 257-261.
(a) In analyzing the private interest factors, the District Court did not act unreasonably in concluding that fewer evidentiary problems would be posed if the trial were held in Scotland, a large proportion of the relevant evidence being located there.  The District Court also correctly concluded that the problems posed by the petitioners' inability to implead potential Scottish third-party defendants -- the pilot's estate, the plane's owners, and the charter company -- supported holding the trial in Scotland.  Pp.  454 U. S. 257-259.
(b) The District Court's review of the factors relating to the public interest was also reasonable.  Even aside from the question whether Scottish law might be applicable in part, all other public interest factors favor trial in Scotland, which has a very strong interest in this litigation.  The accident occurred there, all of the decedents were Scottish, and apart from petitioners, all potential parties are either Scottish or English.  As to respondent's argument that American citizens have an interest in ensuring that American manufacturers are deterred from producing defective products and that additional deterrence might be obtained by trial in the United States where they could be sued on the basis of both negligence and strict liability, any incremental deterrence from trial in an American court is likely to be insignificant and is not sufficient to justify the enormous commitment of judicial time and resources that would be required.  Pp.  454 U. S. 259-261.

No. 8048
Argued October 14, 1981
Decided December 8, 1981*
454 U.S. 235

Syllabus 
Respondent, as representative of the estates of several citizens and residents of Scotland who were killed in an airplane crash in Scotland during a charter flight, instituted wrongful death litigation in a California state court against petitioners, which are the company that manufactured the plane in Pennsylvania and the company that manufactured the plane's propellers in Ohio.  At the time of the crash, the plane was registered in Great Britain and was owned and operated by companies organized in the United Kingdom.  The pilot and all of the decedents' heirs and next of kin were Scottish subjects and citizens, and the investigation of the accident was conducted by British authorities.  Respondent sought to recover from petitioners on the basis of negligence or strict liability (not recognized by Scottish law), and admitted that the action was filed in the United States because its laws regarding liability, capacity to sue, and damages are more favorable to respondent's position than those of Scotland.  On petitioners' motion, the action was removed to a Federal District Court in California and was then transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1404(a).  The District Court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss the action on the ground offorum non conveniens.  Relying on the test set forth in Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, and analyzing the ""private interest factors"" affecting the litigants' convenience and the ""public interest factors"" affecting the forum's convenience, as set forth in Gilbert, the District Court concluded that Scotland was the appropriate forum.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court had abused its discretion in conducting the Gilbert analysis and that, in any event, dismissal is automatically barred where 
Page 454 U. S. 236
 the law of the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiff than the law of the forum chosen by the plaintiff.
Held:
1. Plaintiffs may not defeat a motion to dismiss on the ground of forum non conveniens merely by showing that the substantive law that would be applied in the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiffs than that of the chosen forum.  The possibility of a change in substantive law should ordinarily not be given conclusive or even substantial weight in the forum non conveniens inquiry.  Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson Steamships, Ltd., 285 U. S. 413.  Pp.  454 U. S. 247-255.
(a) Under Gilbert, supra, dismissal will ordinarily be appropriate where trial in the plaintiff's chosen forum imposes a heavy burden on the defendant or the court, and where the plaintiff is unable to offer any specific reasons of convenience supporting his choice.  If substantial weight were given to the possibility of an unfavorable change in law, however, dismissal might be barred even where trial in the chosen forum was plainly inconvenient, and the forum non conveniens doctrine would become virtually useless.  Such an approach not only would be inconsistent with the purpose of the forum non conveniens doctrine, but also would pose substantial practical problems, requiring that trial courts determine complex problems in conflict of laws and comparative law, and increasing the flow into American courts of litigation by foreign plaintiffs against American manufacturers.  Pp.  454 U. S. 248-252.
(b) Nor may an analogy be drawn between forum non conveniens dismissals and transfers between federal courts pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1404(a), which was construed in Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U. S. 612, as precluding a transfer if it resulted in a change in the applicable law.  The statute was enacted to permit change of venue between federal courts, and although it was drafted in accordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens, it was intended to be a revision, rather than a codification of the common law.  District courts were given more discretion to transfer under  1404(a) than they had to dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens. Van Dusen v. Barrack, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  454 U. S. 253-254.
2. The District Court properly decided that the presumption in favor of the plaintiff's forum choice applied with less than maximum force when the plaintiff or (as here) the real parties in interest are foreign.  When the plaintiff has chosen the home forum, it is reasonable to assume that the choice is convenient; but when the plaintiff or real parties in interest are foreign, this assumption is much less reasonable, and the plaintiff's choice deserves less deference.  Pp.  454 U. S. 255-256. 
Page 454 U. S. 237

3. The forum non conveniens determination is committed to the trial court's sound discretion, and may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion.  Here, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the private and public interests under the Gilbert analysis, and thereby determining that the trial should be held in Scotland.  Pp.  454 U. S. 257-261.
(a) In analyzing the private interest factors, the District Court did not act unreasonably in concluding that fewer evidentiary problems would be posed if the trial were held in Scotland, a large proportion of the relevant evidence being located there.  The District Court also correctly concluded that the problems posed by the petitioners' inability to implead potential Scottish third-party defendants -- the pilot's estate, the plane's owners, and the charter company -- supported holding the trial in Scotland.  Pp.  454 U. S. 257-259.
(b) The District Court's review of the factors relating to the public interest was also reasonable.  Even aside from the question whether Scottish law might be applicable in part, all other public interest factors favor trial in Scotland, which has a very strong interest in this litigation.  The accident occurred there, all of the decedents were Scottish, and apart from petitioners, all potential parties are either Scottish or English.  As to respondent's argument that American citizens have an interest in ensuring that American manufacturers are deterred from producing defective products and that additional deterrence might be obtained by trial in the United States where they could be sued on the basis of both negligence and strict liability, any incremental deterrence from trial in an American court is likely to be insignificant and is not sufficient to justify the enormous commitment of judicial time and resources that would be required.  Pp.  454 U. S. 259-261.

Syllabus 
The University of Missouri at Kansas City, a state university, makes its facilities generally available for the activities of registered student groups.  A registered student religious group that had previously received permission to conduct its meetings in University facilities was informed that it could no longer do so because of a University regulation prohibiting the use of University buildings or grounds ""for purposes of religious worship or religious teaching.""  Members of the group then brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the regulation violated, inter alia, their rights to free exercise of religion and freedom of speech under the First Amendment.  The District Court upheld the regulation as being not only justified, but required, by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, viewing the regulation as a content-based discrimination against religious speech, for which it could find no compelling justification, and holding that the Establishment Clause does not bar a policy of equal access, in which facilities are open to groups and speakers of all kinds.
Held:  The University's exclusionary policy violates the fundamental principle that a state regulation of speech should be content-neutral.  Pp.  454 U. S. 267-277.
(a) Having created a forum generally open for use by student groups, the University, in order to justify discriminatory exclusion from such forum based on the religious content of a group's intended speech, must satisfy the standard of review appropriate to content-based exclusions; i.e., it must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.  Pp.  454 U. S. 267-270.
(b) Although the University's interest in complying with its constitutional obligations under the Establishment Clause may be characterized as compelling, an ""equal access"" policy would not be incompatible with that Clause.  A policy will not offend the Establishment Clause if it can pass the following three-pronged test:  (1) It has a secular legislative purpose; (2) its principal or primary effect would be neither to advance nor to inhibit religion; and (3) it does not foster ""an excessive government entanglement with religion.""  Here, it is conceded that an ""equal access"" 
Page 454 U. S. 264
 policy would meet the first and third prongs of the test.  In the context of this case and in the absence of any evidence that religious groups will dominate the University's forum, the advancement of religion would not be the forum's ""primary effect.""  An ""equal access"" policy would therefore satisfy the test's second prong as well.  Pp.  454 U. S. 270-275.
(c) The State's interest in achieving greater separation of church and State than is already ensured under the Establishment Clause is not sufficiently ""compelling"" to justify content-based discrimination against religious speech of the student group in question.  Pp.  454 U. S. 275-276.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL and Justice BLACKMUN join, dissenting. 
 Petitioners, the Keys, brought this action in the District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi against respondents, the Wises and the United States. They sought to quiet title to 451 acres of land in Humphreys County, Miss., over which the United States had acquired two easements from the Wises. The Federal Quiet Title Act 1 vests exclusive original jurisdiction of such suits in the federal district courts and waives the sovereign immunity of the United States only in respect to such suits. The District Court first denied motions of the Wises and the United States to dismiss the suit. This was correct in light of the Act. But the court 
Page 454 U.S. 1103 , 1104
 then, sua sponte, entered an order of abstention remitting the parties to initiation of an action in the state courts of Mississippi. [Footnote 2] That order was a patent flouting of the congressional mandate pre-empting state court jurisdiction and requiring the District Court to exercise its original and exclusive jurisdiction. Nonetheless, petitioners' motion for reconsideration was denied. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, without filing an opinion, dismissed the appeal and denied petitioners' motion to stay state court proceedings pending appeal. 
 The Wises brought suit meanwhile against petitioners in Mississippi Chancery Court, which declared title in Wises. While the case was pending before the Mississippi Supreme Court, petitioners sought a writ of mandamus from the Court of Appeals to order the District Court to rescind the abstention order. The application was denied by the Court of Appeals, again without opinion. We denied certiorari sub nom. Key v. Keady, 429 U.S. 1023 (1976). Having failed on their motion to reconsider, on their appeal from the abstention order, and on an extraordinary writ of mandamus, petitioners took the only recourse open to them: They objected to the Chancery Court's exercise of jurisdiction in the Mississippi Supreme Court on the ground that under the Federal Quiet Title Act the United States District Court hadexclusive jurisdiction. The Mississippi Supreme Court rejected petitioners' preemption objection based on the Quiet Title Act on the ground that since the Wises, as plaintiffs in the suit, did not controvert any interest claimed by the United States, the Quiet Title Act was irrelevant to the state court suit.

 Rehearing Denied Jan. 25, 1982. 
 See 455 U.S. 929. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 Last Term, this Court granted petitioner's previous petition for certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court affirming the death sentence, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420 ( 1980). See 449 U.S. 988 (1980). On remand, without the benefit of full briefing and argument requested by petitioner, the State Supreme Court reaffirmed petitioner's death sentence. Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment, I would grant the petition for certiorari in this case and vacate the judgment 
Page 454 U.S. 1114 , 1115
 below insofar as it leaves undisturbed the death sentence. Moreover, even assuming, arguendo, that there are circumstances in which the death penalty may be constitutionally imposed, I believe that the State Supreme Court ignored the mandate of this Court by reaffirming the death sentence in this case. Therefore, essentially for the reasons stated in my dissent from the denial of certiorari in Davis v. Georgia, Spraggins v. Georgia, and Brooks v. Georgia, 451 U.S. 921 (1981), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the judgment below on this additional ground. 
 Petitioner in this case was sentenced to death after the jury found that the offense of murder was ""outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim"" pursuant to Ga.Code 27-2534.1 (b)(7) (1978).* In Godfrey v. Georgia, supra, this Court recognized that this statutory language is so broad that it invites the jury to impose the death sentence in every murder case. InGodfrey, both the plurality opinion and the opinion concurring in the judgment explained that a State's capital punishment scheme ""must channel thesentencer's discretion by 'clear and objective standards' that provide 'specific and detailed guidance,' and that 'make rationally reviewable the process for imposing a sentence of death.' "" 446 U.S., at 428, 100 S.Ct. at 1764 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). See id., at 437, 100 S.Ct. at 1769 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment). Under Georgia law, the jury is responsible for sentencing in death penalty cases. Because the Georgia [454 U.S. 1114 , 1116]

 Last Term, this Court granted petitioner's previous petition for certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court affirming the death sentence, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420 ( 1980). See 449 U.S. 988 (1980). On remand, without the benefit of full briefing and argument requested by petitioner, the State Supreme Court reaffirmed petitioner's death sentence. Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment, I would grant the petition for certiorari in this case and vacate the judgment 
Page 454 U.S. 1114 , 1115
 below insofar as it leaves undisturbed the death sentence. Moreover, even assuming, arguendo, that there are circumstances in which the death penalty may be constitutionally imposed, I believe that the State Supreme Court ignored the mandate of this Court by reaffirming the death sentence in this case. Therefore, essentially for the reasons stated in my dissent from the denial of certiorari in Davis v. Georgia, Spraggins v. Georgia, and Brooks v. Georgia, 451 U.S. 921 (1981), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the judgment below on this additional ground. 
 Petitioner in this case was sentenced to death after the jury found that the offense of murder was ""outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim"" pursuant to Ga.Code 27-2534.1 (b)(7) (1978).* In Godfrey v. Georgia, supra, this Court recognized that this statutory language is so broad that it invites the jury to impose the death sentence in every murder case. InGodfrey, both the plurality opinion and the opinion concurring in the judgment explained that a State's capital punishment scheme ""must channel thesentencer's discretion by 'clear and objective standards' that provide 'specific and detailed guidance,' and that 'make rationally reviewable the process for imposing a sentence of death.' "" 446 U.S., at 428, 100 S.Ct. at 1764 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). See id., at 437, 100 S.Ct. at 1769 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment). Under Georgia law, the jury is responsible for sentencing in death penalty cases. Because the Georgia [454 U.S. 1114 , 1116]

Syllabus 
Held:  There is a reasonable basis in law for the practice of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) of excluding from collective bargaining units only those confidential employees with a ""labor nexus,"" while rejecting any claim that all employees with access to confidential information are beyond the reach of the definition of ""employee"" in  2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  Pp.  454 U. S. 177-192.
(a) There is nothing in the Taft-Hartley Act's legislative history to support any inference, let alone conclusion, that Congress intended to alter, or disapproved, the NLRB's determination prior to the 1947 passage of the Act that only confidential employees with a ""labor nexus"" should be excluded from bargaining units.  Rather, the contrary appears.  Indeed, the Taft-Hartley Act's express inclusion of ""professional employees"" under the Act's coverage negates any reading of the legislative history as excluding confidential employees generally from  2(3)'s definition of ""employee.""

(b) The dictum in NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267,  416 U.

Nor is there any merit to the argument that the NLRB has applied the labor nexus test inconsistently.  A review of the NLRB's decisions indicates that it has never followed a practice of depriving all employees who have access to confidential business information from the full panoply of rights afforded by the NLRA.  Rather, for over 40 years, the NLRB, while declining to create any implied exclusion from the definition of ""employee"" for confidential employees,

Syllabus 
Respondent, when 17 years old, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment under the Federal Youth Corrections Act (YCA), 18 U.S.C.  5010(c).  Subsequently, while incarcerated, he was found guilty of assaulting a federal officer, and the District Court imposed an adult sentence to be served consecutively to the YCA sentence, finding that respondent would not benefit from any further treatment under the YCA.  Later, while still incarcerated, respondent pleaded guilty to another charge of assaulting a federal officer, and the District Court sentenced him to a further adult sentence to be served consecutively to the sentence he was then serving.  The Bureau of Prisons then classified respondent as an adult offender, and accordingly, since that time, he has not been segregated from adult prisoners and has not been offered the YCA rehabilitative treatment that the initial trial court recommended.  After exhausting his administrative remedies, respondent filed a petition for habeas corpus.  The District Court granted the writ, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the YCA forbids the reevaluation of a YCA sentence by a second judge, even if the second judge makes a finding that further YCA treatment would not benefit the offender.
Held:  The YCA does not require YCA treatment for the remainder of a youth sentence where the judge imposing the subsequent adult sentence determines, as here, that such treatment will not benefit the offender further.  Pp.  454 U. S. 206-220.
(a) The YCA strongly endorses a judge's discretionary power to choose among available sentencing options, and prescribes certain basic conditions of treatment for YCA offenders.  By determining that the youth offender should be sentenced under the YCA, the trial court, in effect, decides that the Bureau of Prisons must comply with both the segregation and treatment requirements of the statute.  Correctional authorities may not exercise any of the sentencing powers established in the YCA.  Pp.  454 U. S. 206-210.
(b) The language of  6010(c) authorizing a court to ""sentence the youth offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment and supervision"" pursuant to the YCA, and of  6011 providing that ""[c]ommitted 
Page 454 U. S. 202
 youth offenders . . . shall undergo treatment in institutions . . . that will provide the essential varieties of treatment,"" and that ""such youth offenders shall be segregated from other offenders,"" does not prohibit any modification of the basic terms of a YCA sentence before its expiration.  That is, such language does not require the judge to make an irrevocable determination of segregation or treatment needs, nor preclude a subsequent judge from redetermining those needs in light of intervening events.  Pp.  454 U. S. 210-211.
(c) On the other hand, the YCA does not give the Bureau of Prisons independent authority to deny a youth offender the treatment and segregation from adults that a sentencing court mandates.  Pp.  454 U. S. 211-213.
(d) The purposes of the YCA, as revealed in its structure and legislative history, compel the conclusion that a court faced with a choice of sentences for a youth offender still serving a YCA term is not deprived of the option of finding no further benefit in YCA treatment for the remainder of the term.  Such history and structure also demonstrate Congress' intent that a court -- but not prison officials -- may require a youth offender to serve the remainder of a YCA sentence as an adult after the offender has received a consecutive adult term.  When Congress withdrew from prison officials some of their traditional authority to adjust conditions of confinement, it could not have intended that no one exercise that authority, the only reasonable conclusion being that Congress reposed that authority in the court.  Pp.  454 U. S. 213-217.
(e) The standards that a district judge should apply in determining whether an offender will obtain any further benefit from YCA treatment are no different from the standards applied in imposing the sentence originally.  In light of all relevant factors, the judge can exercise his sound discretion in determining whether the offender should receive youth or adult treatment for the remainder of his term, and should make a judgment informed by both the YCA's rehabilitative purposes and the offender's realistic circumstances.  Here, the second sentencing judge made a sufficient finding that respondent would not benefit from YCA treatment during the remainder of his youth term.  Pp.  454 U. S. 218-219.

No. 80-427
Argued October 5, 1981

454 U.S. 100

Syllabus 
Held:  The principle of comity bars taxpayers' damages actions brought in federal courts under 42 U.S.C.  1983 to redress the allegedly unconstitutional administration of a state tax system.   Because the principle of comity bars federal courts from granting damages relief in such cases, it is not necessary to decide whether the Tax Injunction Act, standing alone, would bar such actions.  Pp.  454 U. S. 107-117.
(a) Prior to enactment in 1937 of the Tax Injunction Act -- which prohibits district courts from enjoining, suspending, or restraining the assessment, levy, or collection of any state tax where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had in state courts -- this Court's decisions in cases seeking federal court equitable relief against state taxation (handed down both before and after the enactment in 1871 of 42 U.S.C.  1983's predecessor) recognized that the doctrine of equitable restraint when remedies at law are adequate was particularly applicable in suits challenging the constitutionality of state tax laws because of the delicate balance between the federal authority and state governments, and the concomitant respect that should be accorded state tax laws in federal court.  Pp.  454 U. S. 107-109.
(b) The legislative history of the Tax Injunction Act does not suggest that Congress intended that federal court deference in state tax matters be limited to the actions enumerated in the Act.  Thus, the principle of comity which predated the Act was not restricted by its passage.  Pp.  454 U. S. 109-110.
(c) The post-Act vitality of the comity principle is demonstrated by this Court's 1943 decision in Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U. S. 293, that federal courts may not render declaratory judgments as to the constitutionality of state tax laws.  Although the Act was raised as a possible bar to the suit (as it has been raised in this case), it was found to be unnecessary to determine whether the Act could be construed to prohibit declaratory relief.  The decision was based instead on principles of federalism and the necessity of federal court respect for state taxing schemes, thus demonstrating not only the post-Act vitality of the comity principle, but also its applicability to actions seeking a remedy other than injunctive relief.  Pp.  454 U. S. 110-111. 
Page 454 U. S. 101

(d) Damages actions under  1983 would be no less disruptive of state tax systems than actions to enjoin the collection of taxes.  Recovery of damages under  1983 would first require a determination of the unconstitutionality of the state tax scheme that would be fully as intrusive as the equitable actions that are barred by comity principles.  Moreover, the intrusiveness of such  1983 actions would be exacerbated by the doctrine of Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, authorizing immediate resort to a federal court under  1983 without first exhausting state remedies -- whenever state actions allegedly infringe constitutional rights.  In addition to the intrusiveness of the judgment, the very maintenance of the suit itself would intrude on the enforcement of the state scheme.  Pp. 113-115.

Syllabus 
Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires all federal agencies, ""to the fullest extent possible,"" to include an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in proposals for major federal actions significantly affecting the environment, and also requires the EIS to be made available to the public, subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  With respect to the construction in Hawaii of new ammunition and weapons storage facilities containing magazines capable of storing nuclear weapons, the Navy prepared an Environmental Impact Assessment, which concluded that the new facilities would have no significant environmental impact, and therefore no EIS was prepared.  Because the information is classified for national security reasons, the Navy's regulations forbid it either to admit or to deny that nuclear weapons are actually stored at the now-completed facilities.  Before construction of the facilities was completed, respondents brought an action in Federal District Court seeking an injunction against the building of the facilities until an EIS had been filed.  The District Court held that, in view of, inter alia, the Navy's own regulations, the Navy had complied with NEPA ""to the fullest extent possible"" within the meaning of 102(2)(C).  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  102(2)(C) requires the Navy to prepare and release to the public a ""Hypothetical Environmental Impact Statement"" with regard to a facility capable of storing nuclear weapons.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in requiring the Navy to prepare and release to the public a ""Hypothetical Environmental Impact Statement.""  Pp.  454 U. S. 143-147.
(a) In inventing such a statement, the Court of Appeals departed from Congress' express intent manifested by the explicit language in  102(2)(C) providing that public disclosure of an EIS should be governed by the FOIA.  Here, Exemption 1 of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure classified material dealing with national security, such as information relating to the storage of nuclear weapons, is applicable.  Pp.  454 U. S. 143-145. 
Page 454 U. S. 140

(b) Moreover, by requiring such a statement, the Court of Appeals required the production of a document that would not exist save for what that court thought to be NEPA's disclosure requirements.  If the Navy would not be required by the FOIA to release an EIS were one already prepared, it is obviously not required to prepare a ""hypothetical"" EIS nowhere mentioned in NEPA.  P.  454 U. S. 145.
(c) The Navy is not required to prepare an EIS simply because the facilities in question are ""nuclear capable,"" but rather it is the proposal to store nuclear weapons at those facilities that would trigger the obligation to prepare an EIS.  Here, it has not been and cannot be established whether the Navy had made such a proposal.  P.  454 U. S. 146.

Because the information is classified for national security reasons, the Navy's regulations forbid it either to admit or to deny that nuclear weapons are actually stored at the now-completed facilities.  Before construction of the facilities was completed, respondents brought an action in Federal District Court seeking an injunction against the building of the facilities until an EIS had been filed.  The District Court held that, in view of, inter alia, the Navy's own regulations, the Navy had complied with NEPA ""to the fullest extent possible"" within the meaning of 102(2)(C).  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  102(2)(C) requires the Navy to prepare and release to the public a ""Hypothetical Environmental Impact Statement"" with regard to a facility capable of storing nuclear weapons.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in requiring the Navy to prepare and release to the public a ""Hypothetical Environmental Impact Statement.""  Pp.  454 U. S. 143-147.
(a) In inventing such a statement, the Court of Appeals departed from Congress' express intent manifested by the explicit language in  102(2)(C) providing that public disclosure of an EIS should be governed by the FOIA.  Here, Exemption 1 of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure classified material dealing with national security, such as information relating to the storage of nuclear weapons, is applicable.  Pp.  454 U. S. 143-145. 
Page 454 U. S. 140

(b) Moreover, by requiring such a statement, the Court of Appeals required the production of a document that would not exist save for what that court thought to be NEPA's disclosure requirements.  If the Navy would not be required by the FOIA to release an EIS were one already prepared, it is obviously not required to prepare a ""hypothetical"" EIS nowhere mentioned in NEPA.  P.  454 U. S. 145.
(c) The Navy is not required to prepare an EIS simply because the facilities in question are ""nuclear capable,"" but rather it is the proposal to store nuclear weapons at those facilities that would trigger the obligation to prepare an EIS.  Here, it has not been and cannot be established whether the Navy had made such a proposal.  P.  454 U. S. 146.

Syllabus 
Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (Act), the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) is authorized to lease tracts of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) for the exploration for, and development of, mineral resources, including oil and gas.  As originally passed, the Act authorized the Secretary, in his discretion, to solicit bids either by fixing a royalty rate of not less than 12 1/2%, and requiring bids on an initial ""cash bonus"" to be paid when the lease was awarded, or by fixing the amount of the cash bonus, and requiring bids on the royalty rate.  In practice, virtually all tracts were leased on the basis of a fixed royalty, with bidding on the amount of the cash bonus.  However, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 (1978 Amendments) increased the number of authorized bidding systems to 10, retaining the original system and authorizing new systems, some of which also involve cash bonus bidding, while others use a factor other than the cash bonus as the bidding variable.  The 1978 Amendments direct the Secretary to develop a 5-year plan of experimentation with the new systems, requiring him to experiment with the bidding systems other than the traditional cash bonus, fixed royalty system in not less than 20% but not more than 60% of the total area offered for leasing each year, unless he determines that those percentage requirements are inconsistent with the 1978 Amendments' purposes.  The 1978 Amendments assure ongoing congressional oversight of the Secretary's leasing activities by requiring frequent reports to Congress.  To date, the Secretary has used two of the nontraditional bidding systems in leases covering 49% of the total area offered.  However, he has not experimented with any of the systems using a factor other than the size of a cash bonus as the bidding variable.  Respondents, including the State of California, brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging, inter alia, that the Secretary has abused his discretion by failing to experiment with systems that do not use the size of a cash bonus as the bidding variable.  The District Court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment, but the Court of Appeals held, inter alia, that the 1978 Amendments require the Secretary to experiment 
Page 454 U. S. 152
 with at least some of the bidding systems that do not use the size of a cash bonus as the bidding variable.
Held:
1. California has standing to challenge the Secretary's choice of bidding systems.  Because the 1978 Amendments require the Federal Government to turn over a fair share of the revenues of an OCS lease to the neighboring coastal State whenever the Federal Government and the State own adjoining portions of an OCS oil and gas pool, California has a direct financial stake in federal OCS leasing off the California coast.  In alleging that the bidding systems currently used by the Secretary are incapable of producing a fair market return, California asserts the kind of ""distinct and palpable injury"" that is required for standing.  And California also satisfies the requirement that there be a ""fairly traceable"" causal connection between the injury it claims and the conduct it challenges, so that, if the relief sought is granted, the injury will be redressed.  Pp.  454 U. S. 160-162.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in compelling the Secretary to experiment with non-cash-bonus bidding systems.  Pp.  454 U. S. 162-169.
(a) Nothing in the 1978 Amendments suggests that Congress, in committing the Government to the goal of obtaining fair market value for OCS oil and gas resources, intended to channel the Secretary's discretion in choosing among the alternative bidding systems, and nothing in the statute singles out the non-cash-bonus systems for special consideration.  The language of the 1978 Amendments requires experimentation with at least some of the new bidding systems, but leaves the details to the Secretary's discretion.  Pp.  454 U. S. 162-165.
(b) Nor does the legislative history of the 1978 Amendments compel the conclusion that the Congress as a whole intended to limit the Secretary's discretion to choose among the various experimental bidding systems.  When viewed in context, unfavorable references to ""cash bonus"" bidding show congressional dissatisfaction with large front-end payments associated with the traditional cash bonus bid, fixed royalty system then in effect, not with all forms of cash bonus bidding.

 Supreme Court of the United States November 30, 1981 Rehearing Denied Jan. 25, 1982. 
 See 455 U.S. 929. 
 The judgment is affirmed. 

 Justice STEVENS, dissenting. 
 Appellant Forrest McCluney brought this action to recover damages under the Missouri ""service letter statute,"" Mo.Rev.Stat. 290.140 (1978). 1 McCluney entered into an employment contract with appellee Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co. in Missouri in 1956. In 1970, Schlitz offered McCluney the position of plant manager at its facility in North Carolina. Appellant accepted the position and moved to North Carolina. In 1975, Schlitz offered McCluney a position as vice president of plant operations at Schlitz' corporate headquarters in Wisconsin. McCluney again accepted. Thereafter, McCluney was fired and sought a ""service letter"" pursuant to the Missouri service letter statute. 
 In Horstman v. General Electric Co., 438 S.W.2d 18 (Mo.App.1969), a Missouri state court held, as a matter of state law, that a Missouri resident employed under a Kansas employment contract was not entitled to a service letter under the Missouri service letter statute. The court stated: 
 ""Considering the legislative intent and construction of the statute by the courts of Missouri, it is clear that appellant is not entitled to a service letter under the Missouri service letter statute because appellant was not

 hired in Missouri, did not work in Missouri, was not discharged in Missouri, did not request a service letter from an office of respondent in Missouri, received no letters from respondent's office in the State of Missouri, and because there were no contacts between appellant and the State of Missouri insofar as his employment or discharge by respondent was concerned. Appellant's employment contract was a Kansas contract, since that is where he was hired and where he worked."" Id., at 21. 
 In the instant case, the Court of Appeals expressly held that the employment contract entered by appellant in Missouri in 1956 was discharged in 1970 when appellant accepted a promotion to a position as a plant manager in North Carolina; the court unequivocally stated that ""[t] his suit is not upon a Missouri contract."" C.A. 8, 649 F.2d 578, 583. The Court of Appeals recognized that in Bliven v. Brunswick Corp., 575 S.W. 2d 788 (Mo.App.1978), the court held that a ""service letter"" was required in a case in which an employee had been hired in Missouri and then transferred to four different States over a 2-year period. The Court of Appeals specifically distinguished Bliven, however, in concluding that the instant suit was not based upon a Missouri employment contract. [Footnote 2] In [454 U.S. 1071 , 1073]

Syllabus 
Respondents, who were inmates in a South Carolina prison, contended that they were unnecessarily beaten by prison guards during a prison uprising.  One respondent sought criminal arrest warrants against four guards, and a state court Magistrate, acting on the basis of affidavits and information presented by the respondent, informed the legal adviser to the South Carolina Department of Corrections of his intent to issue the warrants.  After a meeting with correctional officials, the State Solicitor, by a letter to the Magistrate, requested that the warrants not be issued, and stated that he intended to seek an investigation of the charges against the prison guards.  The Magistrate did not issue the warrants, and no state investigation was initiated.  Respondents subsequently filed suit against petitioners (the legal adviser and the Director of the Department of Corrections) and other state officials in Federal District Court, contending that they had violated 42 U.S.C.  1983 by conspiring in bad faith to block the issuance of arrest warrants for the prosecution of the guards.  The District Court found petitioners liable for damages and attorney's fees, although the State Solicitor and the Magistrate were found to be immune from liability.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Petitioners' actions, by which they influenced the State Solicitor's decision to oppose issuance of the arrest warrants, did not violate any judicially cognizable rights of respondents.  There is a questionable nexus between respondents' injury -- the alleged beatings -- and the state officials' actions in which they gave information to a Magistrate prior to issuance of an arrest warrant.  Even if a prosecution could remedy respondents' injury, the issuance of an arrest warrant is simply a prelude to, and would not necessarily result in, actual prosecution.  The decision to prosecute is solely within the prosecutor's discretion.  Thus, a private citizen has no judicially cognizable right to prevent state officials from presenting information, through intervention of the state solicitor, that will assist a magistrate in determining whether to issue an arrest warrant.

 Constance KAMBEROSv. GTE AUTOMATIC ELECTRIC, INCNo. 81-480 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 16, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 In this Title VII case, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit substantially reduced an award of backpay because the petitioner did not seek a right-to-sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission while the Commission was attempting to resolve the grievance through conciliation. The decision conflicts directly with the position of the Fifth Circuit, indirectly with that of the Ninth Circuit, possibly misreads this Court's decisions, and definitely leaves Title VII plaintiffs confused as to their responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict and, it is hoped, to clarify the situation. 
 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 103, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. , establishes procedures by which aggrieved parties may seek relief from unlawful discrimination. The Act provides that charges first be 
Page 454 U.S. 1060 , 1061
 brought to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 180 days of the alleged violation. 2000e-5(e). If the Commission dismisses the charge or issues a right-to-sue letter, the party may bring an action in federal court within 90 days. 2000e-5(f)(1)(A). Regulations under the Act provide that after 180 days from the filing of a complaint with the Commission, a person can request a right-to-sue notice which ""the Commission shall promptly issue."" 29 CFR 1601.28(a) (1980). Nothing in the Act or its accompanying regulations requires that such a request be made within a certain time, or, for that matter, that it be made at all. 
 The petitioner, a lawyer, was refused employment by respondent because, as she was told in just so many words, the company was looking for a man. That same day petitioner filed her complaint with the Commission. Although petitioner could have requested a right-to-sue letter 180 days later, she waited for over four years while the Commission pursued the grievance through conciliation. That process apparently was unsuccessful and, on January 3, 1974, a right-to-sue letter was issued. Fifteen days later, petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court, which upheld her claim and awarded various prospective relief as well as backpay of over $100,000 dating from the filing of charges in 1969. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed that the respondent was liable for sex discrimination, but objected to the backpay award because the petitioner allowed her complaint to ""lie dormant"" with the Commission for over four years when she could have obtained a right-to-sue letter upon request. The District Court was directed, on remand, to reduce the backpay award for the time during which petitioner could have requested a right-to-sue letter from the Commission. 603 F.2d 598, 603.

 Constance KAMBEROSv. GTE AUTOMATIC ELECTRIC, INCNo. 81-480 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 16, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 In this Title VII case, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit substantially reduced an award of backpay because the petitioner did not seek a right-to-sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission while the Commission was attempting to resolve the grievance through conciliation. The decision conflicts directly with the position of the Fifth Circuit, indirectly with that of the Ninth Circuit, possibly misreads this Court's decisions, and definitely leaves Title VII plaintiffs confused as to their responsibilities under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict and, it is hoped, to clarify the situation. 
 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 103, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. , establishes procedures by which aggrieved parties may seek relief from unlawful discrimination. The Act provides that charges first be 
Page 454 U.S. 1060 , 1061
 brought to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 180 days of the alleged violation. 2000e-5(e). If the Commission dismisses the charge or issues a right-to-sue letter, the party may bring an action in federal court within 90 days. 2000e-5(f)(1)(A). Regulations under the Act provide that after 180 days from the filing of a complaint with the Commission, a person can request a right-to-sue notice which ""the Commission shall promptly issue."" 29 CFR 1601.28(a) (1980). Nothing in the Act or its accompanying regulations requires that such a request be made within a certain time, or, for that matter, that it be made at all. 
 The petitioner, a lawyer, was refused employment by respondent because, as she was told in just so many words, the company was looking for a man. That same day petitioner filed her complaint with the Commission. Although petitioner could have requested a right-to-sue letter 180 days later, she waited for over four years while the Commission pursued the grievance through conciliation. That process apparently was unsuccessful and, on January 3, 1974, a right-to-sue letter was issued. Fifteen days later, petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court, which upheld her claim and awarded various prospective relief as well as backpay of over $100,000 dating from the filing of charges in 1969. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed that the respondent was liable for sex discrimination, but objected to the backpay award because the petitioner allowed her complaint to ""lie dormant"" with the Commission for over four years when she could have obtained a right-to-sue letter upon request. The District Court was directed, on remand, to reduce the backpay award for the time during which petitioner could have requested a right-to-sue letter from the Commission. 603 F.2d 598, 603. 
 The Fifth Circuit has expressly declined to rule that Title VII plaintiffs must make a timely request for a right-to-sue letter or lose the right to substantial backpay relief. In two [454 U.S. 1060 , 1062]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 16, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Opinion of Justice STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
 In suggesting that the Court is derelict in its duty to resolve the apparent conflict between the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case and the decision of the Sixth Circuit in Moore v. Sun Oil Co. of Pennsylvania, 636 F.2d 154 (1980), the dissenting opinion fails to mention the fact that both courts held that the issue of liability should be decided by a jury.* The question whether the arithmetical calculation of backpay should be made by a judge or by a jury under instructions from the judge is not nearly as significant as the question whether the determination of liability should be made by a judge or a jury. Moreover, since the employer in this case no longer offered employment of the type sought by petitioner, the backpay issue arose in a somewhat unusual context. I do not believe the Court has abused its discretion in declining to review this case. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 It may be unfortunate in light of the expanding size of our docket, but it remains the case that this Court is the only 
Page 454 U.S. 1064 , 1065
 body capable of resolving conflicts between the various lower courts, both federal and state. Our obligation to resolve these conflicts is just as pressing as is the need for a uniform rule of law. In my view this is a very pressing need, and is particularly so when the conflict involves those elements that define the character of the judicial process itself. In this respect, the right to a jury trial is fundamental. It is not a tolerable rule of law that one's right to a jury trial depends upon the geographical location of the federal district court within which one files a complaint. This is precisely what is involved in this case. 
 Respondent unsuccessfully sought employment as a truck driver with petitioners' trucking company. Alleging that this refusal to hire was based on racial considerations, respondent brought this suit claiming a violation of 42 U.S.C. 1981.1 He filed his complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Respondent sought monetary damages for backpay, lost insurance benefits, expenses incurred in seeking alternative employment, pain and suffering, interest, attorney's fees, and costs. He moved for a jury trial. That motion was opposed by petitioners with respect to the claims for lost wages, interest, attorney's fees, and costs. The District Court, acting sua sponte, entered an order denying a jury trial on all issues, holding that a jury trial is not available in a 1981 case. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed. 638 F.2d 1137 ( 1981). Relying on Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454 (1975), in which this Court held that both legal and equitable relief is available in actions brought under 1981, and Curtis v.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 16, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Thomas Riley was arrested in connection with three homicides. At the time of his arrest, he was 16 years old. Petitioner was held for several hours in a police car and subsequently in a jail cell . In the police station, after being advised of his constitutional rights to remain silent and consult with an attorney, petitioner asked to speak to his father, who had come to the station when he learned of his son's arrest. This request was ignored by the police. Petitioner then confessed to the crimes. After a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Ill., he was convicted of two counts of murder and one count of involuntary manslaughter. Prior to trial, Riley unsuccessfully moved to suppress his confession, claiming, inter alia, that the request of a juvenile defendant to see a parent is the functional equivalent of an adult's request for an attorney and should terminate police interrogation. 
 On direct appeal, the Illinois Appellate Court rejected petitioner's challenge to the admissibility of his confession. People v. Riley, 49 Ill. App.3d 304, 7 Ill.Dec. 145, 364 N.E.2d 306 (1977). The Illinois Supreme Court denied leave to appeal. This Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari. 435 U.S. 
Page 454 U.S. 1067 , 1068
 1000 (1978). I dissented, noting that there was a conflict of authority on the question whether an accused child's request to see a parent must be honored by the police before they continue interrogation. 
 Having exhausted his available state remedies, Riley filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. That court ultimately rejected his claim that the confession should have been suppressed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. 653 F.2d 1153 (1981). The Court of Appeals relied heavily on this Court's recent decision in Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707 (1979), which held that a juvenile's request for his probation officer did not necessarily constitute an invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege. Petitioner again filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court. The petition is now denied. Because I continue to believe that the issue presented here is substantial, and because the decision of the court below further contributes to the conflict among authorities, I dissent. The Court's decision in Fare v. Michael C. does not determine the result in this case. Fare v. Michael C. emphasized that a probation officer has a statutory duty to report wrongdoing by the juvenile and serve the ends of the juvenile court system. Thus, he would be particularly hampered in his efforts to protect the juvenile's legal rights. Obviously, a parent is in a very different position.

No. 80-939
Argued October 6, 1981
Decided November 10, 1981*
454 U.S. 27

Syllabus 
One provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (Act), 2 U.S.C.  441a(d)(3), limits the amount that the national committee and state committees of a political party may spend in connection with the general election of a candidate for the United States Senate or House of Representatives.  Petitioner National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) is a political committee organized to support Republican candidates for the Senate.  Although the Act authorizes the NRSC to contribute up to a certain amount to such candidates, it is not authorized to make expenditures on their behalf.  The Federal Election Commission (FEC), however, has permitted the NRSC to act as agent of national and state party committees in making expenditures on their behalf.  When certain state Republican Party committees designated the NRSC as their agent for  441a(d)(3) expenditure purposes, the respondent Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed a complaint with the FEC, asserting that the NRSC's agreements with the state committees were contrary to  441a(d)(3).  The FEC dismissed the complaint, concluding that there was ""no reason to believe"" that the agreements violated the Act.  On review, the District Court granted the FEC's motion for summary judgment, holding that the FEC's decision was not ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.""  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the ""plain language"" of  441a(d)(3) precluded the agency agreements between state committees and the NRSC.
Held:  Section 441a(d)(3) does not expressly or by necessary implication foreclose the use of agency agreements, such as are at issue here, and the FEC thus acted within the authority vested in it by Congress when it determined to permit such agreements.  Pp.  454 U. S. 31-43.
(a) While  441a(d)(3) does not authorize the NRSC to make expenditures in its own right, it does not follow that it may not act as agent of a 
Page 454 U. S. 28
 committee that is expressly authorized to make expenditures.  Nothing in the statute suggests that a state committee may not designate another committee to be its alter ego and to act in its behalf for the purposes of  441a(d)(3).  Nor does the legislative history of the Act purport to disapprove agency arrangements.  Pp.  454 U. S. 31-36.
(b) Under the standard of whether the FEC's construction of the Act was ""sufficiently reasonable"" to be accepted by a reviewing court, the District Court was correct in accepting the FEC's judgment.  The FEC's view that the agency agreements were logically consistent with  441a(a)(4) -- which authorizes the transfer of funds among national, state, and local committees of the same party -- is acceptable.  And the FEC's interpretation of  441a(d)(3) is not inconsistent with any discernible purpose of the Act.  Pp.  454 U. S. 36-42.

Syllabus 
When Army Sergeant Ridgway and his first wife, April, were granted a divorce by a Maine court, the decree, inter alia, ordered Ridgway to keep in force the insurance policies on his life then outstanding for the benefit of the Ridgways' three children.  At the time of the divorce, the sergeant's life was insured under a $20,000 policy issued by petitioner Prudential Insurance Co. of America (Prudential) pursuant to the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Act of 1965 (SGLIA), and April was the designated beneficiary.  Subsequently, Ridgway married petitioner Donna, and changed the policy's beneficiary designation to one directing that the proceeds be paid as specified ""by law,"" which meant that, under the SGLIA, the proceeds would be paid to the insured's ""widow,"" i.e., his ""lawful spouse . . . at the time of his death.""  Thereafter, Ridgway died, survived by Donna as his lawful wife.  After April and Donna had both filed claims to the policy proceeds, April instituted suit in Maine Superior Court against Prudential, seeking to enjoin payment of the proceeds to Donna and to obtain a declaratory judgment that the proceeds were payable to the children under the divorce decree.  Donna joined the suit as a plaintiff, asserting a claim to the proceeds based on the beneficiary designation and her status as Ridgway's widow.  April filed a cross-claim, praying for the imposition of a constructive trust for the children's benefit on any proceeds paid to Donna.  The Superior Court rejected April's claims, taking the view that a constructive trust would interfere with the operation of the SGLIA, and thus would run afoul of the Supremacy Clause.  The Maine Supreme Judicial Court vacated the dismissal of April's cross-claim, and remanded with directions to enter an order naming Donna as constructive trustee of the policy proceeds.
Held:  The insured's beneficiary designation under the SGLIA policy prevails over the constructive trust imposed upon the policy proceeds by the state court.  Pp.  454 U. S. 533.

Decided November 9, 1981
454 U.S. 14

Syllabus 
Held:  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was not violated by the Ohio Adult Parole Authority's rescission, without a hearing, of its decision to grant respondent early parole.  The rescission, which occurred before respondent was released, resulted from the Authority's having learned that respondent had made false statements in an interview conducted before the decision to grant parole and in his proposed parole plan.  After conceding that Ohio law created no protected ""liberty"" interest in early parole, the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that a liberty interest arose from the ""mutually explicit understandings"" of the parties, and that the rescission without a hearing thus violated due process.  The ""mutually explicit understandings"" language of Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, relied on by the Court of Appeals, relates to the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of ""property"" interests, rather than ""liberty"" interests such as that asserted by respondent.  Cf. Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458.

			"|"Jago v. Van Curen
No. 81942
Decided November 9, 1981
454 U.S. 14

Syllabus 
Held:  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was not violated by the Ohio Adult Parole Authority's rescission, without a hearing, of its decision to grant respondent early parole.  The rescission, which occurred before respondent was released, resulted from the Authority's having learned that respondent had made false statements in an interview conducted before the decision to grant parole and in his proposed parole plan.  After conceding that Ohio law created no protected ""liberty"" interest in early parole, the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that a liberty interest arose from the ""mutually explicit understandings"" of the parties, and that the rescission without a hearing thus violated due process.  The ""mutually explicit understandings"" language of Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, relied on by the Court of Appeals, relates to the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of ""property"" interests, rather than ""liberty"" interests such as that asserted by respondent.  Cf. Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458.
Certiorari granted; 641 F.2d 411, reversed."|

 See 454 U.S. 1165. 
 The judgment is affirmed. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Justice POWELL and Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 The Court today affirms a decision of the Court of Appeals, CA9, 631 F.2d 135, holding unconstitutional a Washington statute which has yet 
Page 454 U.S. 1022 , 1023
 either to be enforced in or construed by a Washington state court. I would abstain from decision until the Washington courts are given an opportunity to interpret the law which has been thus invalidated. This Court-and all federal courts-have enough to do without ""preempting"" state courts on matters initially of state concern. 
 The Washington ""moral nuisance"" law, Wash.Rev.Code 7.48.050 et seq. ( Supp. 1977)-a comprehensive statute directed at prohibiting the public sale and exhibition of obscene materials-was adopted as an initiative by the voters in the November 8, 1977, election. Before the statute was even certified by the Secretary of State, appellees, several corporations engaged in the exhibition, distribution, and sale of movies, books, and magazines, filed this action in the Federal District Court, 449 F.Supp. 1145. On February 6, 1978, less than three months after the initiative's adoption, and apparently before it had ever been applied, the District Court declared the law unconstitutional. 449 F.Supp. 1145. 
 I have previously outlined the concerns that should lead a federal court to stay its hand in cases such as this, when litigants have deliberately avoided resort to the courts of the state whose statute is being challenged. Vance v. Universal Amusement Co., 445 U.S. 308, 317-320, 1161-1163 (1980) (BURGER, C. J., dissenting); cf. Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 521-531, 1946-1951 (1977) (BURGER, C. J., dissenting); Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 439-443, 511-513 (1971) (BURGER, C. J., dissenting). The policies of federalism and comity militate in favor of affording state judges-who are as capable as are federal judges of enforcing the Constitution of the United States, and have taken the same oath to do so-the initial opportunity to consider the scope and validity of state statutes. This is particularly so when the state law under consideration has never been applied, and when its interpretation is uncertain; in such a case the state court's construction of the statute may obviate the need for adjudication of the federal constitutional issues, or the state court may resolve those issues as we would.

 See 454 U.S. 1165. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Because I continue to believe that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by 
Page 454 U.S. 1037 , 1038
 the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. I would also grant certiorari on an additional ground. This case presents the question whether the death sentence may be imposed after conviction of a capital offense, where the jury was not instructed as to lesser-included noncapital offenses because the statute of limitations had run with respect to the lesser offenses. Petitioner argues that the failure to provide instructions on lesser- included offenses in these circumstances is inconsistent with this Court's decisions in Keeble v. United States, 412 U.S. 205d 844 (1973), and Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625d 392 (1980). In my view, there is substantial merit to this claim. 
 Petitioner was arrested by Florida police and charged with the capital felony of first-degree murder. He was tried by a jury. After the submission of the evidence, the trial judge required petitioner to choose between having the jury instructed only as to first-degree murder, or waiving the Florida statute of limitations with respect to the lesser- included noncapital offenses of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter. The statute had run on each of those offenses. Petitioner refused to waive the statute of limitations. Thus, the jury was not permitted to consider the possibility that petitioner might be guilty of some lesser offense. After several hours of deliberations, the jury found petitioner guilty of first-degree murder. It recommended that he be sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial judge rejected this recommendation and sentenced petitioner to death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed. It stated that instructions as to lesser-included offenses would have been required in ordinary circumstances. Where the statute had run on those offenses, however, instructions were not necessary. 393 So.2d 1119 (1981). 
 I am not persuaded by the Florida Supreme Court's reasoning. In Keeble and Beck, this Court emphasized the importance of instructions on lesser-included offenses. Keeble [454 U.S. 1037 , 1039]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2971, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 As I have consistently stated, I believe that a decision to impose the death penalty is always cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2971, 2973, 904, 907 (1976). Thus, I would grant certiorari in this case and vacate the judgment 
Page 454 U.S. 1041 , 1042
 insofar as it leaves undisturbed the death sentence. I would also grant certiorari on an additional ground. Petitioner argues that the death penalty has been arbitrarily and capriciously imposed in this case, because the trial judge rejected the jury's recommendation that he be sentenced to life imprisonment. According to petitioner, the jury should not have been overruled, since its recommendation was not unreasonable. In my view, there is substantial merit to this claim. 
 I  
 The Florida capital punishment statute, Fla.Stat. 921.141 (1979), which this Court approved in Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242 (1976), establishes a three-level review system. After a defendant is found guilty of a capital offense, an evidentiary hearing is held before the judge and the jury to determine the sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing, the jury considers whether ""sufficient mitigating circumstances exist which outweigh the aggravating circumstances found to exist,"" and based on these considerations, ""whether the defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment or death."" 921. 141(2)(b) and (c). 
 The jury's verdict is advisory only; the actual sentence is imposed by the trial judge after he conducts his own review of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. However, the Florida Supreme Court 395 So.2d 1145 has stated that the jury recommendation is entitled to substantial weight. ""In order to sustain a sentence of death following a jury recommendation of life, the facts suggesting a sentence of death should be so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ."" Tedder v. State, 322 So.2d 908, 910 (1975). Accord, Thompson v. State, 328 So.2d 1, 5 (Fla.1976). See also Proffitt v. Florida, supra. Judges are given the power to override jury verdicts only because of the possibility that in isolated cases juries will unreasonably reject death. See Chambers v.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 2, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Opinion of Justice STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
 Practical considerations preclude the Court from explaining its reasons for denying petitions for certiorari. See Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, Inc., 338 U.S. 912 (opinion of Frankfurter, J., respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari). Opinions dissenting from the denial of certiorari are answered so rarely that they may some- 
Page 454 U.S. 975 , 976
 times create an unwarranted impression that the Court is not administering its certiorari docket in a responsible way. [Footnote 1] Because I was concerned that Justice REHNQUIST's opinion in Davis v. Jacobs, et al., 454 U.S. 911, might create such an impression, I thought it appropriate to write in response. A similar concern prompts me to write in this case. 
 Justice BRENNAN's dissenting opinion correctly points out that there are substantial arguments favoring a grant of certiorari. There are, however, at least three countervailing considerations militating in favor of a denial of certiorari that do not clearly emerge from a reading of the dissenting opinion. 
 First, there is no allegation in the petition for certiorari that there is a conflict between the decision of the Court of Appeals, CA2, 638 F.2d 507, in this case and any other Federal Court of Appeals decision. Often the law develops in a more satisfactory fashion if this Court withholds review of novel issues until differing views have been expressed by other federal courts. [Footnote 2] 

 Second, it is not clear that petitioner has standing to object to the seizure of evidence in this case. At issue is the legal- [454 U.S. 975 , 977]

Opinions dissenting from the denial of certiorari are answered so rarely that they may some- 
Page 454 U.S. 975 , 976
 times create an unwarranted impression that the Court is not administering its certiorari docket in a responsible way. [Footnote 1] Because I was concerned that Justice REHNQUIST's opinion in Davis v. Jacobs, et al., 454 U.S. 911, might create such an impression, I thought it appropriate to write in response. A similar concern prompts me to write in this case. 
 Justice BRENNAN's dissenting opinion correctly points out that there are substantial arguments favoring a grant of certiorari. There are, however, at least three countervailing considerations militating in favor of a denial of certiorari that do not clearly emerge from a reading of the dissenting opinion. 
 First, there is no allegation in the petition for certiorari that there is a conflict between the decision of the Court of Appeals, CA2, 638 F.2d 507, in this case and any other Federal Court of Appeals decision. Often the law develops in a more satisfactory fashion if this Court withholds review of novel issues until differing views have been expressed by other federal courts. [Footnote 2] 

 Second, it is not clear that petitioner has standing to object to the seizure of evidence in this case. At issue is the legal- [454 U.S. 975 , 977]

 November 2, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice O'CONNOR join, dissenting. 
 This case offers an instructive example of a phenomenon not uncommon in constitutional law. The Constitution is a 
Page 454 U.S. 988 , 989
 written document, but cases and controversies involving its provisions necessarily result in opinions from this Court. Those opinions themselves contain aphorisms, whose resemblance to the actual text of the Constitution grows increasingly remote as they are used as substitutes for the text itself, applied to wholly different situations than that addressed in the original case, or simply used as convenient ""catchwords"" to justify a given result. In my opinion, that is what has happened here. Constitutional building blocks have been piled on top of one another so that the connection between the original provision in the Constitution and the application in a particular case is all but incomprehensible. 
 Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 206, 1203 (1964), reversed the conviction of an accused on the ground that he had been denied ""the basic protections of [the Sixth Amendment] when there was used against him at his trial evidence of his own incriminating words, which federal agents had deliberately elicited from him."" One building block was used to reach that result. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932), held that a trial court's failure to appoint counsel in a capital case until the trial began violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it deprived the defendants of an opportunity to consult with an attorney, and have him investigate their case and prepare a defense. In Massiah, the Court implicitly concluded that the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of the assistance of counsel includes a promise of the companionship of counsel, at least when an interrogation takes place following the initiation of criminal proceedings. [Footnote 1] But Massiah was further expanded in Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387 (1977), at least insofar as the latter case appeared to establish an extremely heavy burden which the prosecution must carry to demonstrate waiver [454 U.S. 988 , 990]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 2, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 In this case, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found that petitioner had committed an unfair labor practice by filing a civil action for damages in state court against a discharged employee who had filed unfair labor practices charges with the NLRB. The NLRB ordered petitioner to dismiss the state-court action and reimburse the employee for all legal expenses she had incurred in defending the lawsuit. Because I believe that principles of federalism and comity should preclude the NLRB from interpreting the Na- 
Page 454 U.S. 994 , 995
 tional Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to empower the NLRB to enjoin a state- court damages action between two private entities, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 Tonia Anderson was hired by petitioner as a probationary employee for a period of 120 days. After discussing working conditions with other employees, Anderson spoke with her supervisor, informing him of her desire for a number of benefits. After a subsequent meeting attended by Anderson and two supervisors, Anderson was informed that her employment was terminated because her attitude toward her job had changed and, therefore, she would be unable to perform her work satisfactorily. 
 Anderson then filed unfair labor practices charges with the NLRB, which issued a complaint against petitioner alleging violations of 8(a)( 1), (3) of the NLRA, 61 Stat. 140, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1), (3 ). One day prior to the NLRB hearing on these charges, petitioner filed a damages action against Anderson in state court. Petitioner's complaint alleged that Anderson had contrived a fraudulent scheme in order to obtain a paid vacation with her new husband. The complaint alleged that Anderson knew that if she could provoke petitioner into discharging her, NLRB settlement procedures, following the filing of her unfair labor practice charge, would result in her reinstatement with backpay within a relatively short period of time. The NLRB subsequently issued a second complaint, alleging that petitioner violated 8(a)(1), (4), 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1), ( 4), by initiating the damages action against Anderson. 
 Based solely on the complaint petitioner filed in the state-court action,1 the NLRB concluded that petitioner violated 8(a)(1), (4) because its damages action ""was filed purely for purposes of retaliation to punish Anderson for seeking re- [454 U.S. 994 , 996]

 Louie L. WAINWRIGHT, Secretary, Department of Corrections, FloridaNo. 80-6434 Supreme Court of the United States November 2, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I continue to believe that in all circumstances the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 2973 (1976). However, I dissent from the denial of certiorari in this case on the additional ground that the Florida Supreme Court practice challenged by petitioners is questionable under prior precedents of this Court and deserves plenary consideration. 
 Petitioner Brown and 122 other Florida inmates sentenced to death brought original petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the Florida Supreme Court, 392 So.2d 1327, alleging that since 1975, the Florida Supreme Court has ""engaged in the continuing practice of requesting and receiving information concerning capital appellants which was not presented at trial and not a part of the trial record or record on appeal. The information includes . . . pre-sentence investigation reports concerning the capital offense under review or prior convictions unrelated to the capital offense; psychiatric evaluations or contact notes [made in the correctional system after conviction]; psychological screening reports; recitations of a capital defendant's refusal to submit to a psychiatric examination from which a report could be prepared; post-sentence investigation reports; probation or parole violation reports; and state prison classification and admissions summaries."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 2c- 3c. With rare exceptions, the State Supreme Court allegedly received this information without notice to the appellant whose sentence the court was reviewing or to his attorney. To support these allegations, petitioners offered written re- 
Page 454 U.S. 1000 , 1001
 quests by the Court Clerk to correctional officials requesting such information, and letters of transmittal from these officials. Petitioners also suggest that this kind of information may have been received in some cases but not others, thus skewing the appellate process without regard to whether the information may benefit the particular appellant whose sentence is under review. The court accepted these allegations as true for the purposes of its decision but denied the petitions. 
 I believe that the Florida court's ex parte consideration of such nonrecord evaluative data relating to individual appellants during the court's review is questionable as a matter of due process and is inconsistent with this Court's past insistence on strict procedural regularity in the imposition and review of capital sentences. See Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349 (1977). Moreover, much of the information appears to be inadmissible and unreliable hearsay, which petitioners should at least have the opportunity to cross-examine. Some may be inadmissible under this Court's recent decision in Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454 (1981). Accordingly, I dissent. 
 Gardner, supra, invalidated a Florida death sentence in which the sentencing court had relied in part on a confidential portion of a presentencing report that had not been disclosed to the defendant or to his counsel. The plurality opinion emphasized the ""vital importance to the defendant and to the community that any decision to impose the death sentence be, and appear to be, based on reason rather than caprice or emotion."" 430 U.S., at 358. Contrary to the State Supreme Court's view, Gardner suggested no relevant distinction between the trial court's initial imposition of a sentence and an appellate court's discharge of its mandatory review function. Such a distinction is irreconcilable with this Court's decision in Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242 (1976), which approved the Florida appellate review procedure on [454 U.S. 1000 , 1002]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the District Court of Appeal of Florida for the Third District. The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 
 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting. In Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715 ( 1972), this Court concluded that ""on the record before us, Indiana cannot constitutionally commit the petitioner for an indefinite period simply on account of his incompetency to stand trial on the charges filed against him."" Id., at 720. It went on to state: ""Respondent argues, however, that because the record fails to establish affirmatively that Jackson will never improve, his commitment 'until sane' is not really an indeterminate one. It is only temporary, pending possible change in his condition. Thus, presumably, it cannot be judged against commitments under other state statutes that are truly indeterminate. . . . ""Were the State's factual premise that Jackson's commitment is only temporary a valid one, this might well be a different case. But the record does not support that premise."" Id., at 725. The Jackson Court went on to discuss Greenwood v. United States, 350 U.S. 366 (1956), and held that it did not support Indiana's position, since it merely ""upheld the Federal Government's constitutional authority to commit an individual found by the District Court to be 'insane,' incompetent to stand trial on outstanding criminal charges, and probably dangerous to the safety of the officers, property, or other interests of the United States."" 406 U.S., at 726. In the present case, the Florida District Court of Appeal, 390 So.2d 95 reversed respondent's murder conviction on the ground that, prior to trial, he had been committed to a state hospital longer than necessary to assess the likelihood of his eventual 
Page 454 U.S. 1004 , 1005
 recovery of competency to stand trial. In my view, the decision rests on a serious misunderstanding of this Court's opinion in Jackson, supra. In light of the risk that the error will be repeated if not corrected, I would grant the petition. 
 On July 7, 1970, respondent was indicted for the first-degree murder of a police officer. He was arraigned and entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. Following a hearing on September 14, 1970, the trial court found respondent incompetent to stand trial and committed him to a state hospital. Three psychiatrists testified that respondent was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and that episodes of the illness were likely to recur without intensive treatment. The psychiatrists also agreed that respondent posed a serious danger to himself and to others. [Footnote 1] 

 Over the next six years, the trial court ordered periodic psychiatric examinations of respondent and conducted five hearings to reevaluate his competency to stand trial. In hindsight, the hearings reveal a recurrent pattern of behavior. While institutionalized, respondent received large doses of psychotropic medication, which, in the opinion of the examining psychiatrists, were successful in restoring his competency to stand trial. The trial court, however, apparently was of the view that it could not reach a valid determination of competency as long as respondent was under the influence of medication. This view was shared by respondent's counsel and by at least one of the examining psychiatrists. As a result, the court ordered withdrawal of medication and reevaluation. Typically, respondent severely regressed without medication. On the occasion of each reevaluation, the examining psychiatrists found respon- [454 U.S. 1004 , 1006]

 Aaron L. KOLOM, et ux. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUENo. 81-99 Supreme Court of the United States November 2, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice POWELL, dissenting. 
 In the decision below, ""fair market value"" of a share of stock for minimum-tax purposes was determined solely by reference to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) price at the time of purchase even though 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 896, 15 U.S.C. 78p(b), effectively prohibited the taxpayer's sale of the security for six months thereafter. The case presents an important question of fairness to taxpayers, who, under this ruling, must recognize a ""gain"" that does not yet exist and may never materialize. Because the decision below is not supported by either the statutory language or its legislative history and because it tends to frustrate the congressional policy favoring employee stock ownership, I would grant certiorari and set the case for argument. 
 I In 1968, 1970, and 1971, petitioner Aaron L. Kolom received options to acquire stock in Tool Research and Engineering Corp. (TRE) pursuant to a plan that qualified under 421 and 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC), as amended, 26 U.S.C. 421 and 422. Kolom exercised the options in September and October 1972 when he was an officer and director of TRE. He bought a total of 12,427 shares in three blocks at an average of 131/4, 12 and 195/8, per share. On the dates of exercise, the mean prices of the stock on the NYSE were, respectively, 52, 451/4, and 451/4. Because Kolom was a TRE director, he was not free to take this ""gain ."" Under 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78p(b), Kolom would have been liable to the company for any profits realized from the sale of these shares during the 6-month period following exercise of his op- 
Page 454 U.S. 1011 , 1012
 tion. And by the time Kolom was able to sell, the situation had altered dramatically. Six months after the date of exercise of the first block, the NYSE price dropped over 50% to 235/8. Six months after the date of exercise of the other two blocks, the NYSE price also dropped over 50% to 207/8. Kolom eventually sold 5,000 of the shares for an average price of $ 9.27 per share, realizing a substantial loss on the transaction. 
 Under the IRC provisions in effect at the time, the exercise of the options did not result in any recognized compensation for purposes of calculating income because the TRE Employee Stock Option Plan (Plan) qualified under 421 and 422. Tax on stock transferred under a qualified plan is deferred until the stock is sold, and any gain is then taxed at capital-gains rates provided certain other requirements are met. 
 Stock received pursuant to a qualified plan can, however, result in tax liability under the minimum-tax provisions. Title 26 U.S.C. 56 and 57 (1976 ed. and Supp.III) impose a tax on certain ""preference"" items, including stock received under plans that qualify under 421 and 422. The Commissioner audited Kolum's 1972 return and assessed a deficiency on the ground that, for purposes of calculating his minimum tax, Kolom should have included as a ""preference"" item the difference between the option price and the NYSE price at the time each option was exercised. The Commissioner argued that Kolom should have included his ""gain"" of $424,888 as a preference item even though Kolom could not have realized the gain and even though the gain evaporated in the course of the six months following exercise of the option. This fictional gain resulted in a deficiency assessment of $43,792. The Tax Court, 71 T.C. 235 affirmed the Commissioner, as did the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 644 F.2d 1282.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 2, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of New Jersey. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 The question presented in this case is whether petitioner's confession, obtained by police after he had been arrested without probable cause, held in custody for some 18 hours, and confronted with the confessions of three other participants in the crime, should have been excluded at petitioner's trial as an inadmissible fruit of an unconstitutional arrest. 
 On J., was robbed. Investigation revealed information sufficient for the issuance of an arrest warrant for Archie Murphy. On the evening of January 15, 
Page 454 U.S. 1017 , 1018
 1976, police went to an East Orange, N.J., apartment building to execute the arrest warrant for Murphy. Upon arrival, one officer saw petitioner Edward Barry standing outside the building. Recognizing him from his investigation of another robbery one year earlier, the officer arrested petitioner and gave him Miranda warnings. Murphy was arrested inside the building. 
 Petitioner and Murphy were first taken to the East Orange police station, then to Montclair Police Headquarters. Petitioner was transferred to the Glen Ridge jail for overnight lodging. In the early morning hours of January 16, Murphy made a statement incriminating himself and identifying petitioner as the driver of the getaway car. At midday on January 16, after petitioner had been in custody for approximately 18 hours, he was taken from Glen Ridge jail to Montclair for questioning. He was again given Miranda warnings and was told that his brother, Murphy, and another suspect had all confessed to the robbery and that he had been implicated. He was also shown the weapons used in the robbery. Confronted with these matters, petitioner gave a written statement revealing his participation in the robbery. 
 Petitioner was convicted. His confession was the principal evidence against him. The Appellate Division reversed, holding that petitioner's confession should have been excluded from evidence as the product of an illegal arrest. 171 N.J.Super. 543, 547-548, 410 A.2d 259, 262 (1979). The Supreme Court of New Jersey reinstated the judgment of conviction. It agreed with the lower court that the arrest was illegal because ""the police at that time were without probable cause to arrest,"" 86 N.J. 80, 88, 429 A.2d 581, 585 (1981), but went on to determine whether the confession resulted from exploiting the illegal arrest or instead was the product of petitioner's free will, the taint of the illegal arrest having been removed.

|454 u.s. 1|"Duckworth v. Serrano
No. 82041
Decided October 19, 1981
454 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Respondent, whose Indiana state court conviction for murder was affirmed by the Indiana Supreme Court, unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus relief in a Federal District Court.  On appeal to the Court of Appeals, respondent claimed for the first time that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel, on the basis of a prosecution witness' testimony at the state trial that she had been represented on a traffic charge by the law firm of respondent's attorney and that she had asked respondent's attorney to represent her on a pending robbery charge, unrelated to the murder.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's dismissal of the habeas corpus petition, concluding that there was a per se violation of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of effective representation, and that, ""in view of the clear violation"" of respondent's rights and ""in the interest of judicial economy,"" there was no reason to await the state court's initial consideration of the issue.
Held:  The Court of Appeals was obligated to dismiss respondent's petition because obvious constitutional errors, no less than obscure transgressions, are subject to the well-settled requirement, codified in the federal habeas statute, 28 U.S.C.  2254(b) and (c), that a state prisoner must normally exhaust state remedies before a writ of habeas corpus can be granted by the federal courts.  Creating an exception to the exhaustion requirement for ""clear violations"" would not promote judicial economy, 
Page 454 U. S. 2
 but rather would invite habeas petitioners to make a practice of first seeking relief on these grounds in federal courts.
Certiorari granted; 654 F.2d 725, reversed and remanded.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 19, 1981
 Rehearing Denied Dec. 7, 1981. 
 See 454 U.S. 1117. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 The District Court in this criminal case sustained petitioner's motion to suppress on the ground that the evidence in question was obtained by Drug Enforcement Administration agents with the aid of an electronic tracking device or ""beeper"" which was installed on the exterior of petitioner's rented van and for which no warrant was obtained. 
 Without reaching the issue of whether the installation of the device was a search or seizure under the Fourth Amendment, the Court of Appeals, en banc, in a 16-to-8 decision, concluded that the installation was permissible even if it were assumed to constitute a search. 645 F.2d 252 ( 1981). It held that reasonable suspicion is adequate to support warrantless installation of a beeper because of the limited expectation of privacy in an automobile, because the intrusion occasioned by the placement of the beeper is minimal, and because the important Government interest in eliminating il- 
Page 454 U.S. 950 , 951
 legal drug manufacture outweighs the slight infringement of any expectation of privacy. 
 Courts of Appeals are divided on the legality of a warrantless installation of a beeper. The First Circuit has held that no warrant is required for the attachment and monitoring of beepers but that probable cause must exist to justify the intrusion. United States v. Moore, 562 F.2d 106 (1977). The court saw no merit in the Government counterargument that a lower standard was justified because the case involved a dangerous drug which the public would not want to go undetected. The Sixth Circuit requires a warrant and probable cause for the installation of a beeper. United States v. Bailey, 628 F.2d 938 (1980).* 
 Despite these conflicts, the Solicitor General opposes the petition, arguing that if petitioner is acquitted following a trial on the merits, his claims will be moot. But this would leave the conflicts among the Circuits unresolved, conflicts that are now ripe for our attention. Where there is an important and clear-cut issue of law which is fundamental to the further conduct of the case and which would otherwise qualify as a basis for certiorari, interlocutory status need not preclude review.

See United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 377, 359 (1945); Gillespie v. United States Steel [454 U.S. 950 , 952]

 Gary Carwell CROUCH and Mary Crouchv. UNITED STATESNo. 81-5009 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 19, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 This case raises the question of how ""plain"" objects in ""plain view"" must be in order to justify a warrantless search. 
Page 454 U.S. 952 , 953
 Specifically, it raises the question whether documents that must be read before their incriminating nature becomes evident are in plain view. 
 Petitioners are Mary Crouch and her son, Gary. On July 3, 1978, Gary Crouch was released for a 3-day furlough from Goodman Correctional Institute, where he was an inmate. Prior to his release, agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration had received information that indicated that Gary and Mary Crouch might be engaged in the manufacture of methamphetamine. [Footnote 1] On July 3, agents obtained a warrant authorizing a search of the Crouch residence for ""chemicals, laboratory equipment, and other paraphernalia, which are used in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamines in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1)."" The warrant was executed on the afternoon of July 6.2 The officers found chemicals, laboratory equipment, and empty gelatin capsules, but no methamphetamine. During the course of the search, agents discovered, in a drawer of a desk, a bundle of letters in open envelopes addressed to Gary at the state penitentiary from Mary. The agents removed the letters, examined their contents and found that they contained information concerning the manufacture of methamphetamine. Subsequently, the agents found another batch of letters, from Gary to Mary, in Mary's purse (the purse does not seem to have been in her possession). These letters contained additional incriminating evidence. Both sets of letters were seized as evidence. [454 U.S. 952 , 954]

 BOARD OF EDUCATION OF the NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS SCHOOL DISTRICT, et al.,v. Robert J. DAVIS and Lorene JoshuaNo. 80-1831 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 13, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 Both the Court of Appeals and the District Court have treated this as a school desegregation case, as indeed it is for substantive purposes. But in my view both the Court of Appeals and the District Court wholly failed to come to grips with the requirement that there be an Art. III controversy between the parties to the case before a federal court may either entertain it in the first instance or entertain additional proceedings in a case in which the requirements of Art. III at one time were met. It has always been my understanding that Art. III requirements are as important in desegregation 
Page 454 U.S. 904 , 905
 cases as they are in quiet title cases, Fair Labor Standards Act cases, and any number of other types of cases where federal-question jurisdiction may exist. I disagree with the decision of the Court to deny certiorari in this case because, whatever the merits of the dispute as to whether petitioners have or have not achieved a ""unitary"" school system, litigation to prove or disprove this fact must be conducted by parties who meet the ""case or controversy"" test. 
 In Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 32, 1284 (1971), the Court stated that ""once the affirmative duty to desegregate has been accomplished and racial discrimination through official action is eliminated,"" there is no longer a constitutional violation which would enable the district court to entertain additional litigation in that particular case. Admittedly, school desegregation cases are often long and seemingly intractable; but as the Court said in Swann, supra: 
 ""At some point, these school authorities and others like them should have achieved full compliance with this Court's decision in Brown I [Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954)]."" Id., at 31. 
 There is no doubt that a district court is at liberty to treat as a class action a suit filed for the purposes of attaining a ""unitary"" school system, but it is conceded that no class was ever certified in this case. As we said in Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 430, 2702 (1976): 
 ""Counsel for the individual named respondents, the original student plaintiffs and their parents, argued that this litigation was filed as a class action, that all the parties have until now treated it as a class action, and that the failure to obtain the class certification required under Rule 23 is merely the absence of a meaningless 'verbal recital' which counsel insists should have no effect on the facts of this case.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 This case originated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and that court issued a brief memorandum opinion and order denying relief to respondent

 Chavis. Respondent had brought an action under 42 U. S. C. 1983 claiming that he had been denied constitutional rights as a result of prison procedures set in motion by the stabbing of a correctional officer at one of the Illinois state prisons, even though he was ultimately exonerated by those procedures. The District Court divided respondent's complaint into two parts: a claim of denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by reason of the conduct of the hearing before the prison Adjustment Committee in 1976, and a claim that he was denied his ""civil rights"" when he was transferred to another prison in the system without a hearing. The District Court discussed the 1976 hearing in some detail, and found no violation of due process. In addition, the District Court found that respondent's transfer without a hearing raised no constitutional issue because of our decision in Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215 (1976). The court accordingly dismissed respondent's complaint. 
 On appeal, the Court of Appeals CA 7, 643 F.2d 1281, reversed the judgment of the District Court as to the due process claim and also sustained an Eighth Amendment claim upon which the District Court appears not to have passed. Chavis v. Rowe, 643 F.2d 1281 (CA 7 1981). The Court of Appeals stated that ""Chavis' failure to name a particular defendant in connection with his Eighth Amendment allegation is no bar to this claim."" Id., at 1290, n. 9. 
 I believe that this Court should grant petitioners' request for review of the manner in which the Court of Appeals treated the respondent's due process claim. At a hearing on October 2, 1976, the Adjustment Committee dismissed the correctional officer's ""ticket"" as "" improperly written"". Id., at 1283. The following week, another correctional officer who was also a member of the Adjustment Committee wrote a second ""Inmate Violation Report"" charging respondent with the assault and stabbing.

 Opinion of Justice STEVENS respecting the denial of the petitions for writs of certiorari. 
 The question raised by the dissenting opinion is whether the order to be entered in these 17 cases should be a dismissal or a denial. Although this question might be characterized as a procedural technicality-because its resolution is a matter of complete indifference to the litigants-the argument made in the dissent merits a response because it creates the impression that the Court's answer to this arcane inquiry demonstrates that the Court is discharging its responsibilities in a lawless manner. The impression is quite incorrect. 
 The petitioners in these cases are state prisoners. None of them has a meritorious claim. Their habeas corpus petitions were all dismissed by Federal District Judges, and they all unsuccessfully sought review in the United States Court of Appeals. Because none of the petitioners obtained a certificate of probable cause, none of these cases was properly ""in"" the Court of Appeals and therefore 28 U.S.C. 1254 does not give this Court jurisdiction over the petitions for certiorari. It is perfectly clear, however, that if there were merit to the petitions, the Court would have ample authority to review them in either of two ways. 
 First, as the Court expressly decided in 1945 in a case that is procedurally identical to these, this Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S. C. 1651. In House v. Mayo, 324 U.S. 42, the Court conceded that it lacked certiorari jurisdiction under the predecessor to 1254, but squarely held that the All Writs Act, now 28 U. S.C. 1651, authorized the Court to ""grant a writ of certiorari to review the action of the court of appeals in declining to allow an appeal to it"" and to review the ""questions on the merits sought to be raised by the appeal.""

 Major Henry JOHNSON, Jr. v. VIRGINIANo. 80-6519 Supreme Court of the United States October 13, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Virginia. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, who was convicted of murder in a Virginia trial court, argues that his confession should not have been admitted into evidence. The confession was made during a police interrogation, at the outset of which petitioner waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). Earlier that same day, however, petitioner had stated that he wished to confer with an attorney. The interrogation took place before he had an opportunity to do so. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that there had been a valid waiver, and thus that the confession was admissible. In my view, the decision to admit the confession was contrary to the spirit-if not the letter-of our recent decision in Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477 (1981), which was handed down after the State Supreme Court's ruling in this case. I would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment of the State Supreme Court, and remand the case for reconsideration in light of Edwards. 
 In Edwards v. Arizona, the petitioner was arrested on charges of robbery, burglary, and murder. After he was informed of his Miranda rights, he was questioned by police. Edwards denied involvement in the crime and presented an alibi defense. He then told police that he wanted to ""make a deal."" He stated, however, that he wanted to consult with an attorney first. Although questioning then ceased, police detectives visited Edwards the next day and told him that they wished to ask him some questions. Petitioner replied that he did not want to talk to anyone. After being told that he ""had to"" talk to the detectives, he acquiesced. The officers read Edwards his Miranda rights and began a new interrogation session. Shortly after the session began, petitioner implicated himself in the crime. 
Page 454 U.S. 920 , 921
 We reversed the Arizona Supreme Court's ruling that this confession was admissible, holding: 
 We recognized that a person in custody who had expressed a desire to have a lawyer might change his mind and even welcome an opportunity to talk. Id., at 485-486. Where the accused did not himself renew discussions with the police, however, we decided that it was unsafe to assume that he had voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to counsel. 
 The facts of this case are remarkably similar to those of Edwards v. Arizona. On December 12, 1977, petitioner was arrested by Virginia authorities and charged with robbery, premeditated murder in the commission of armed robbery, and use of a firearm in the commission of murder. At his arraignment the next day, petitioner asked the court to appoint counsel. An attorney was appointed. That afternoon, however, before petitioner had an opportunity to confer with his lawyer, a local police detective visited him in jail. This detective later testified that he neither knew nor cared whether petitioner had requested an attorney.

 Orson G. WHITE v. UNITED STATES; 
 and Lawrence ANDERSON v. UNITED STATESNo. 80-6704 No.80-6759 Supreme Court of the United States October 13, 1981
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 
 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. Two Terms previous, I dissented from a denial of certiorari that left the state and lower federal courts in conflict and confusion over whether an anonymous tip may furnish reasonable suspicion for an investigatory detention. Jernigan v. Louisiana, 446 U.S. 958d 816 (1980). Because it remains apparent that this difficult issue of everyday importance to law enforcement officials and citizens on the street alike requires resolution here, I am again moved to note my dissent. The District of Columbia Police received an anonymous telephone call informing them that a young black man known as ""Nicky"" and wearing a blue jumpsuit had parked his 1971 Ford at No. 1 15th Street, N. E., entered a 1974 Oldsmobile, and driven away. The caller, who further identified the cars by color and license number, said that ""Nicky"" and the unidentified driver of the Oldsmobile were involved in narcotics traffic and would be "" dirty"" with drugs when they returned. The caller refused to identify himself or how he obtained this information. Upon receipt of the tip, two police officers, working out of uniform, established surveillance at the address given. They observed the Oldsmobile returning with a black male passenger in a blue sweatsuit, but saw no suspicious activity. The officers pulled their unmarked cruiser alongside the Oldsmobile partially blocking its access, displayed police identification, approached the car with guns drawn, and ordered the men, the petitioners in these cases, out of their automobile. Heroin and narcotics paraphernalia were subsequently discovered, leading to the men's arrest and conviction for possession of and intent to distribute heroin. 
Page 454 U.S. 924 , 925
 A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the trial court's denial of petitioners' motion to suppress the evidence seized from the Oldsmobile as the fruit of an invalid investigatory stop. 208 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 648 F.2d 29 (1981). The majority first determined that the actions of the police should be treated as a brief investigatory detention. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), instead of an arrest. [Footnote 1] It then concluded that the stop was valid because of the specificity of the descriptions provided and the verification of that information by the police. Judge Edwards strongly dissented on both points. The majority admitted that ""[t]he question whether an anonymous tip corroborated only by observation of innocent details justified a Terry stop is a live and disputed one,"" 208 U.S.App.D.C., at 303, 648 F.2d, at 43. 
 Arguably, the decision of the Court of Appeals is inconsistent with our prior cases which require that reasonable suspicion be based on a sufficiently reliable informant's tip. In Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143 (1972), we not only recognized that ""[s]ome tips, completely lacking in indicia of reliability, would either warrant no police response or require further investigation before a forcible stop of the suspect would be authorized,"" id., at 147, but also explicitly noted thatAdams presented a stronger case ""than obtains in the case of an anonymous telephone tip,"" id., at 146, 92 S.Ct. at 1923. Informers who have provided accurate tips in the past, e. g., Terry, supra, or who offer tips that can be immediately confirmed on the scene, e. g., Adams, supra, stand on a much firmer ground of reliability than anonymous telephone callers. 
 Other Federal Courts of Appeals have taken widely divergent positions on the reliability of an unidentified tipster. Compare United States v. McLeroy, 584 F.2d 746 (CA5 1978), and United States v. Robinson, 536 F.2d 1298 (CA9 [454 U.S. 924 , 926]

 Anne NEEDHAMv. WHITE LABORATORIES, INCNo. 81-191 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 13, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 Because I believe that the Court of Appeals, CA7, 639 F.2d 394, in this case misapplied the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and this Court's decision in Thompson v. INS, 375 U.S. 384d 404 (1964), I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 In 1952, petitioner's mother took dienestrol, a synthetic estrogen, during her pregnancy with petitioner. In early 
Page 454 U.S. 927 , 928
 1974, petitioner's physician informed her that she had a vaginal cancer. Alleging that her mother's use of dienestrol was the proximate cause of her cancer, petitioner brought this diversity suit under Illinois tort law . After trial, the jury returned a verdict and awarded petitioner $800, 000 in damages. 
 Within 10 days of this judgment, respondent filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). The timely filing of this post-trial motion tolled the 30-day period in which to file a notice of appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4). The District Court denied the motion on January 14, 1980. Thus, the 30-day period began to run anew, terminating on February 14, 1980. On February 4, 1980, respondent filed a motion styled as a ""motion for reconsideration"" of the January 14 order denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. At a subsequent hearing, the District Court erroneously informed counsel that respondent's "" motion to reconsider"" tolled the time for appeal. Respondent did not move for, and the District Court did not grant, an extension of time within which to appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5). The District Court denied the ""motion to reconsider"" on March 20, 1980. Respondent filed notice of appeal on April 21, 1980, 99 days subsequent to the order of January 14 denying respondent's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. 
 A divided Court of Appeals held that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Needham v. White Laboratories, Inc., 639 F.2d 394 (CA7 1981). After conceding that respondent's ""motion to reconsider"" did not toll the 30-day period that began to run when the Rule 50(b) motion was denied, the court held that this case fell within ""the narrow exception recognized"" in Thompson v. INS, supra. The court held that Thompson applied because respondent ""should not be penalized for relying on the district court assurance that notice of appeal filed within thirty days of its [454 U.S. 927 , 929]

 Sept. 2, 1981. 
Page 453 U.S. 928 , 929
 
 Opinion of Justice POWELL. 
 This case, involving an application and ""reapplication"" for a stay, arises in a complex and unusual procedural posture. The applicant Charles Graddick is the Attorney General of Alabama. Late on the afternoon of July 23 he applied to me as Circuit Justice to stay an order of the District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. The order arose from protracted litigation, commenced in 1971, involving conditions in the Alabama prison system. It directed release of some 400 inmates at midnight on July 24. In order to consider the issues presented, I entered a temporary stay and requested responses. I subsequently denied the application on July 25. 
 In his application to me as Circuit Justice, Attorney General Graddick did not claim standing as a party to the underlying prison litigation. On the contrary, he came to this Court complaining of the District Court's refusal to grant his motion to intervene in that lawsuit. He sought a stay to permit him to appeal following resolution of his claimed right of intervention. 
 On July 25, the order of the District Court was given effect. More than 200 prisoners were released. Despite this change in the underlying circumstances-which a ""stay"" would ordinarily be entered to preserve- Graddick promptly filed a ""reapplication"" for stay with THE CHIEF JUSTICE. THE CHIEF JUSTICE referred this ""reapplication,"" on which we act today, to the full Court. 
 The ""reapplication"" was in fact a new application. In it Graddick for the first time claimed standing as the successor Attorney General to a party defendant dating back to the original action in 1971. If he is such a party, his motion to intervene was wholly unnecessary. [453 U.S. 928 , 930]

No. 80-195
Argued February 25, 1981

453 U.S. 490

Syllabus 
Appellee city of San Diego enacted an ordinance which imposes substantial prohibitions on the erection of outdoor advertising displays within the city.  The stated purpose of the ordinance is ""to eliminate hazards to pedestrians and motorists brought about by distracting sign displays"" and ""to preserve and improve the appearance of the City.""  The ordinance permits on-site commercial advertising (a sign advertising goods or services available on the property where the sign is located), but forbids other commercial advertising and noncommercial advertising using fixed-structure signs, unless permitted by 1 of the ordinance's 12 specified exceptions, such as temporary political campaign signs.  Appellants, companies that were engaged in the outdoor advertising business in the city when the ordinance was passed, brought suit in state court to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance.  The trial court held that the ordinance was an unconstitutional exercise of the city's police power and an abridgment of appellants' First Amendment rights.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed on the first ground alone, but the California Supreme Court reversed, holding, inter alia, that the ordinance was not facially invalid under the First Amendment.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  Pp.  453 U. S. 498-521;  453 U. S. 527-540.
26 Cal.3d 848, 610 P.2d 407, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by JUSTICE STEWART, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face.  Pp.  453 U. S. 498-521.
(a) As with other media of communication, the government has legitimate interests in controlling the noncommunicative aspects of billboards, but the First and Fourteenth Amendments foreclose similar interests in controlling the communicative aspects of billboards.  Because regulation of the noncommunicative aspects of a medium often impinges to some degree on the communicative aspects, the courts must reconcile the government's regulatory interests with the individual's right to expression.  Pp.  453 U. S. 500-503.
(b) Insofar as it regulates commercial speech, the ordinance meets the constitutional requirements of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. 
Page 453 U. S. 491
 Public Service Comm'n, 447 U. S. 557.  Improving traffic safety and the appearance of the city are substantial governmental goals.  The ordinance directly serves these goals, and is no broader than necessary to accomplish such ends.  Pp.  453 U. S. 503-512.
(c) However, the city's general ban on signs carrying noncommercial advertising is invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The fact that the city may value commercial messages relating to on-site goods and services more than it values commercial communications relating to off-site goods and services does not justify prohibiting an occupant from displaying his own ideas or those of others.  Furthermore, because, under the ordinance's specified exceptions, some noncommercial messages may be conveyed on billboards throughout the commercial and industrial zones, the city must allow billboards conveying other noncommercial messages throughout those zones.  The ordinance cannot be characterized as a reasonable ""time, place, and manner"" restriction.  Pp.  453 U. S. 512-517.
(d) Government restrictions on protected speech are not permissible merely because the government does not favor one side over another on a subject of public controversy.  Nor can a prohibition of all messages carried by a particular mode of communication be upheld merely because the prohibition is rationally related to a nonspeech interest.  Courts must protect First Amendment interests against legislative intrusion, rather than defer to merely rational legislative judgments in this area.  Since the city has concluded that its official interests are not as strong as private interests in on-site commercial advertising, it may not claim that those same official interests outweigh private interests in noncommercial communications.  Pp.  453 U. S. 517-521.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that, in practical effect, the city's ordinance constitutes a total ban on the use of billboards to communicate to the public messages of general applicability, whether commercial or noncommercial, and that, under the appropriate First Amendment analysis, a city may totally ban billboards only if it can show that a sufficiently substantial governmental interest is directly furthered thereby, and that any more narrowly drawn restriction would promote less well the achievement of that goal.  Under this test, San Diego's ordinance is invalid, since (1) the city failed to produce evidence demonstrating that billboards actually impair traffic safety in San Diego, (2) the ordinance is not narrowly drawn to accomplish the traffic safety goal, and (3) the city failed to show that its asserted interest in esthetics was sufficiently substantial in its commercial and industrial areas.  Nor would an ordinance totally banning commercial billboards but allowing noncommercial billboards be constitutional, since 
Page 453 U. S. 492
 it would give city officials the discretion to determine in the first instance whether a proposed message is ""commercial"" or ""noncommercial.""  Pp.  453 U. S. 527-540.

No. 78-1789
Argued April 20, 1981
Decided July 2, 1981
453 U.S. 571

Syllabus 
In 1952, respondent natural gas producers and petitioner entered into a contract under which respondents agreed to sell petitioner natural gas from a certain gas field in Louisiana. The contract contained a fixed price schedule and a ""favored nations clause,"" which provided that, if petitioner purchased gas from the gas field from another party at a higher rate than it was paying respondents, then respondents would be entitled to a higher price for their sales to petitioner.  In 1954, respondents filed the contract and their rates with the Federal Power Commission (now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) and obtained from it a certificate authorizing the sale of gas at the specified contract rates.  In 1961, petitioner purchased certain leases in the same gas field from the United States and began producing gas on its leasehold.  In 1974, respondents filed an action in a Louisiana state court, contending that petitioner's lease payments to the United States had triggered the favored nations clause.  Because petitioner had not increased its payments to respondents as required by that clause, respondents sought as damages an amount equal to the difference between the price they actually were paid in the intervening years and the price they would have been paid had that clause gone into effect.  Although finding that the clause had been triggered, the trial court held that the ""filed rate doctrine,"" which prohibits a federally regulated seller of natural gas from charging rates higher than those filed with the Commission pursuant to the Natural Gas Act, precluded an award of damages for the period prior to 1972 (the time during which respondents were subject to the Commission's jurisdiction).  The intermediate appellate court affirmed, but the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed, holding that respondents were entitled to damages for the period between 1961 and 1972 notwithstanding the filed rate doctrine.  The court reasoned that petitioner's failure to inform respondents of the lease payments to the United States had prevented respondents from filing rate increases with the Commission, and that, if they had done so, the increases would have been approved.
Held:  The filed rate doctrine prohibits the award of damages for petitioner's breach during the period that respondents were subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.  Pp.  453 U. S. 576-585. 
Page 453 U. S. 572

(a) The Natural Gas Act bars a regulated seller of natural gas from collecting a rate other than the one filed with the Commission, and prevents the Commission itself from imposing a rate increase for gas already sold.  Here, the Louisiana Supreme Court's ruling amounts to nothing less than the award of a retroactive rate increase based on speculation about what the Commission might have done had it been faced with the facts of this case.  This is precisely what the filed rate doctrine forbids.  It would undermine the congressional scheme of uniform rate regulation to allow a state court to award as damages a rate never filed with the Commission, and thus never found to be reasonable within the meaning of the Act.  Pp.  453 U. S. 576-579.
(b) Congress has granted exclusive authority over rate regulation to the Commission, and, in so doing, withheld the authority to grant retroactive rate increases or to permit collection of a rate other than the one on file.  It would be inconsistent with this purpose to permit a state court to do through a breach of contract action what the Commission may not do.  Under the filed rate doctrine, the Commission alone is empowered to approve the higher rate respondents might have filed with it, and until it has done so, no rate other than the one on file may be charged.  The court below thus has usurped a function that Congress has assigned to a federal regulatory body.  Cf. Chicago & North Western Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick & Tile Co., 450 U. S. 311.  This the Supremacy Clause will not permit.  Pp.  453 U. S. 579-582.
(c) Under the filed rate doctrine, when there is a conflict between the filed rate and the contract rate, the filed rate prevails.  P.  453 U. S. 582.
(d) Permitting the state court to award what amounts to a retroactive right to collect a rate in excess of the filed rate ""only accentuates the danger of conflict,"" and no appeal to equitable principles can justify such usurpation of federal authority.  Pp.  453 U. S. 583-584.

No. 80-581
Argued March 30, 1981
Decided July 2, 1981
453 U.S. 609

Syllabus 
Montana imposes a severance tax on each ton of coal mined in the State, including coal mined on federal land.  The tax is levied at varying rates depending on the value, energy content, and method of extraction of the coal, and may equal, at a maximum, 30% of the ""contract sales price.""  Appellants, certain Montana coal producers and 11 of their out-of-state utility company customers, sought refunds, in a Montana state court, of severance taxes paid under protest and declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the tax was invalid under the Commerce and Supremacy Clauses of the United States Constitution.  Without receiving any evidence, the trial court upheld the tax, and the Montana Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. The Montana severance tax does not violate the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  453 U. S. 614-629.
(a) A state severance tax is not immunized from Commerce Clause scrutiny by a claim that the tax is imposed on goods prior to their entry into the stream of interstate commerce.  Any contrary statements in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U. S. 245, and its progeny are disapproved.   The Montana tax must be evaluated under the test set forth in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274,  430 U. S. 279, whereby a state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it
""is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State.""
Pp.  453 U. S. 614-617.
(b) Montana's tax comports with the requirements of the Complete Auto Transit test.  The tax is not invalid under the third prong of the test on the alleged ground that it discriminates against interstate commerce because 90% of Montana coal is shipped to other States under contracts that shift the tax burden primarily to non-Montana utility companies, and thus to citizens of other States.  There is no real discrimination, since the tax is computed at the same rate regardless of the final destination of the coal and the tax burden is borne according to the amount of coal consumed, not according to any distinction between in-state and out-of-state consumers.  Nor is there any merit to 
Page 453 U. S. 610
 appellants' contention that they are entitled to an opportunity to prove that the tax is not ""fairly related to the services provided by the State"" by showing that the amount of the taxes collected exceeds the value of the services provided to the coal mining industry.  The fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test requires only that the measure of the tax be reasonably related to the extent of the taxpayer's contact with the State, since it is the activities or presence of the taxpayer in the State that may properly be made to bear a just share of the state tax burden.  Because it is measured as a percentage of the value of the coal taken, the Montana tax, a general revenue tax, is in proper proportion to appellants' activities within the State, and, therefore, to their enjoyment of the opportunities and protection which the State has afforded in connection with those activities, such as police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained workforce, and the advantages of a civilized society.  The appropriate level or rate of taxation is essentially a matter for legislative, not judicial, resolution.  Pp.  453 U. S. 617-629.
2. Nor does Montana's tax violate the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.  453 U. S. 629-636.
(a) The tax is not invalid as being inconsistent with the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, as amended.  Even assuming that the tax may reduce royalty payments to the Federal Government under leases executed in Montana, this fact alone does not demonstrate that the tax is inconsistent with the Act.  Indeed, in  32 of the Act, Congress expressly authorized the States to impose severance taxes on federal lessees without imposing any limits on the amount of such taxes.  And there is nothing in the language or legislative history of the Act or its amendments to support appellants' assertion that Congress intended to maximize and capture through royalties all ""economic rents"" (the difference between the cost of production and the market price of the coal) from the mining of federal coal, and then to divide the proceeds with the State in accordance with the statutory formula.  The history speaks in terms of securing a ""fair return to the public"" and if, as was held in Mid-Northern Oil Co. v. Walker, 268 U. S. 45, the States, under  32, may levy and collect taxes as though the Federal Government were not concerned, the manner in which the Federal Government collects receipts from its lessees and then shares them with the States has no bearing on the validity of a state tax.  Pp.  453 U. S. 629-633.
(b) The tax is not unconstitutional on the alleged ground that it frustrates national energy policies, reflected in several federal statutes, encouraging production and use of coal, and appellants are not entitled to a hearing to explore the contours of these national policies and to adduce evidence supporting their claim.  General statements in federal statutes reciting the objective of encouraging the use of coal do not 
Page 453 U. S. 611
 demonstrate a congressional intent to preempt all state legislation that may have an adverse impact on the use of coal.  Nor is Montana's tax preempted by the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978.  Section 601(a)(2) of that Act clearly contemplates the continued existence, not the preemption, of state severance taxes on coal.  Furthermore, the legislative history of that section reveals that Congress enacted the provision with Montana's tax specifically in mind.  Pp.  453 U. S. 633-636.

The tax is levied at varying rates depending on the value, energy content, and method of extraction of the coal, and may equal, at a maximum, 30% of the ""contract sales price.""  Appellants, certain Montana coal producers and 11 of their out-of-state utility company customers, sought refunds, in a Montana state court, of severance taxes paid under protest and declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the tax was invalid under the Commerce and Supremacy Clauses of the United States Constitution.  Without receiving any evidence, the trial court upheld the tax, and the Montana Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. The Montana severance tax does not violate the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  453 U. S. 614-629.
(a) A state severance tax is not immunized from Commerce Clause scrutiny by a claim that the tax is imposed on goods prior to their entry into the stream of interstate commerce.  Any contrary statements in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U. S. 245, and its progeny are disapproved.   The Montana tax must be evaluated under the test set forth in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274,  430 U. S. 279, whereby a state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it
""is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State.""
Pp.  453 U. S. 614-617.
(b) Montana's tax comports with the requirements of the Complete Auto Transit test.  The tax is not invalid under the third prong of the test on the alleged ground that it discriminates against interstate commerce because 90% of Montana coal is shipped to other States under contracts that shift the tax burden primarily to non-Montana utility companies, and thus to citizens of other States.  There is no real discrimination, since the tax is computed at the same rate regardless of the final destination of the coal and the tax burden is borne according to the amount of coal consumed, not according to any distinction between in-state and out-of-state consumers.  Nor is there any merit to 
Page 453 U. S. 610
 appellants' contention that they are entitled to an opportunity to prove that the tax is not ""fairly related to the services provided by the State"" by showing that the amount of the taxes collected exceeds the value of the services provided to the coal mining industry.  The fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test requires only that the measure of the tax be reasonably related to the extent of the taxpayer's contact with the State, since it is the activities or presence of the taxpayer in the State that may properly be made to bear a just share of the state tax burden.  Because it is measured as a percentage of the value of the coal taken, the Montana tax, a general revenue tax, is in proper proportion to appellants' activities within the State, and, therefore, to their enjoyment of the opportunities and protection which the State has afforded in connection with those activities, such as police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained workforce, and the advantages of a civilized society.  The appropriate level or rate of taxation is essentially a matter for legislative, not judicial, resolution.  Pp.  453 U. S. 617-629.
2. Nor does Montana's tax violate the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.  453 U. S. 629-636.
(a) The tax is not invalid as being inconsistent with the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, as amended.  Even assuming that the tax may reduce royalty payments to the Federal Government under leases executed in Montana, this fact alone does not demonstrate that the tax is inconsistent with the Act.  Indeed, in  32 of the Act, Congress expressly authorized the States to impose severance taxes on federal lessees without imposing any limits on the amount of such taxes.  And there is nothing in the language or legislative history of the Act or its amendments to support appellants' assertion that Congress intended to maximize and capture through royalties all ""economic rents"" (the difference between the cost of production and the market price of the coal) from the mining of federal coal, and then to divide the proceeds with the State in accordance with the statutory formula.  The history speaks in terms of securing a ""fair return to the public"" and if, as was held in Mid-Northern Oil Co. v. Walker, 268 U. S. 45, the States, under  32, may levy and collect taxes as though the Federal Government were not concerned, the manner in which the Federal Government collects receipts from its lessees and then shares them with the States has no bearing on the validity of a state tax.  Pp.  453 U. S. 629-633.
(b) The tax is not unconstitutional on the alleged ground that it frustrates national energy policies, reflected in several federal statutes, encouraging production and use of coal, and appellants are not entitled to a hearing to explore the contours of these national policies and to adduce evidence supporting their claim.  General statements in federal statutes reciting the objective of encouraging the use of coal do not 
Page 453 U. S. 611
 demonstrate a congressional intent to preempt all state legislation that may have an adverse impact on the use of coal.  Nor is Montana's tax preempted by the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978.  Section 601(a)(2) of that Act clearly contemplates the continued existence, not the preemption, of state severance taxes on coal.  Furthermore, the legislative history of that section reveals that Congress enacted the provision with Montana's tax specifically in mind.  Pp.  453 U. S. 633-636.

Syllabus 
In response to the seizure of American personnel as hostages at the American Embassy in Tehran, Iran, President Carter, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), declared a national emergency on November 14, 1979, and blocked the removal or transfer of all property and interests in property of the Government of Iran which were subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.  The Treasury Department then issued implementing regulations providing that,
""[u]nless licensed or authorized . . . , any attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is null and void with respect to any property in which, on or since [November 14, 1979,] there existed an interest of Iran,""
and that any licenses or authorizations granted could be ""amended, modified, or revoked at any time.""  The President then granted a general license that authorized certain judicial proceedings, including prejudgment attachments, against Iran, but did not allow the entry of any judgment or decree.  On December 19, 1979, petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court against the Government of Iran, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and a number of Iranian banks, alleging that it was owed a certain amount of money for services performed under a contract with the Atomic Energy Organization.  The District Court issued orders of attachment against the defendants' property, and property of certain Iranian banks was then attached to secure any judgment that might be entered against them.  Subsequently, on January 19, 1981, the Americans held hostage were released by Iran pursuant to an agreement with the United States.  Under this agreement, the United States was obligated to terminate all legal proceedings in United States courts involving claims of United States nationals against Iran, to nullify all attachments and judgments obtained therein, and to bring about the termination of such claims through binding arbitration in an Iran-United States Claims Tribunal.  The President at the same time issued implementing Executive Orders revoking all licenses that permitted the exercise of ""any right, power, or privilege"" with regard to Iranian funds, nullifying all non-Iranian interests in such assets acquired after the blocking order of November 
Page 453 U. S. 655
 14, 1979, and requiring banks holding Iranian assets to transfer them to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to be held or transferred as directed by the Secretary of the Treasury.  On February 24, 1981, President Reagan issued an Executive Order which ratified President Carter's Executive Orders and ""suspended"" all claims that may be presented to the Claims Tribunal, but which provided that the suspension of a claim terminates if the Claims Tribunal determines that it has no jurisdiction over the claim.  Meanwhile, the District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner and awarded it the amount claimed under the contract plus interest, but stayed execution of the judgment pending appeal by the defendants, and ordered that all prejudgment attachments against the defendants be vacated and that further proceedings against the bank defendants be stayed.  Petitioner then filed an action in Federal District Court against the United States and the Secretary of the Treasury, seeking to prevent enforcement of the various Executive Orders and regulations implementing the agreement with Iran.  It was alleged that the actions of the President and the Secretary of the Treasury were beyond their statutory and constitutional powers, and, in any event, were unconstitutional to the extent they adversely affect petitioner's final judgment against Iran and the Atomic Energy Organization, its execution of that judgment, its prejudgment attachments, and its ability to continue to litigate against the Iranian banks.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, but entered an injunction pending appeal to the Court of Appeals prohibiting the United States from requiring the transfer of Iranian property that is subject to any writ of attachment issued by any court in petitioner's favor.  This Court then granted certiorari before judgment.
Held:
1. The President was authorized to nullify the attachments and order the transfer of Iranian assets by the provision of the IEEPA, 50 U.S.C.  1702(a)(1)(B), which empowers the President to ""compel,"" ""nullify,"" or ""prohibit"" any ""transfer"" with respect to, or transactions involving, any property subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in which any foreign country has any interest.  Pp.  453 U. S. 669-674.
(a) Nothing in the legislative history of either  1702 or  5(b) of the Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA), from which  1702 was directly drawn, requires reading out of  1702 all meaning to the words ""transfer,"" ""compel,"" or ""nullify,"" and limiting the President's authority in this case only to continuing the freeze, as petitioner claims.  To the contrary, both the legislative history and cases interpreting the TWEA fully sustain the President's broad authority when acting under 
Page 453 U. S. 656
 such congressional grant of power.  And the changes brought about by the enactment of the IEEPA did not in any way affect the President's authority to take the specific action taken here.  By the time petitioner brought the instant action, the President had already entered the freeze order, and petitioner proceeded against the blocked assets only after the Treasury Department had issued revocable licenses authorizing such proceedings and attachments.  The attachments obtained by petitioner, being subject to revocation, were specifically made subordinate to further actions which the President might take under the IEEPA.  Pp.  453 U. S. 671-673.
(b) Blocking orders, such as the one here, permit the President to maintain foreign assets at his disposal for use in negotiating the resolution of a declared national emergency, and the frozen assets serve as a ""bargaining chip"" to be used by the President when dealing with a hostile country.  To limit the President's authority, as petitioner urges, would mean that claimants could minimize or eliminate this ""bargaining chip"" through attachments or similar encumbrances.  Pp.  453 U. S. 673-674.
(c) Petitioner's interest in its attachments was conditional and revocable, and as such, the President's action nullifying the attachments and ordering the transfer of the assets did not effect a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment absent just compensation.  P.  453 U. S. 674, n. 6.
(d) Because the President's action in nullifying the attachments and ordering the transfer of assets was taken pursuant to specific congressional authorization, it is
""supported by the strongest presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation, and the burden of persuasion would rest heavily upon any who might attack it.""
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579,  343 U. S. 637 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Under the circumstances of this case, petitioner has not sustained that burden.  P.  453 U. S. 674.
2. On the basis of the inferences to be drawn from the character of the legislation, such as the IEEPA and the Hostage Act, which Congress has enacted in the area of the President's authority to deal with international crises, and from the history of congressional acquiescence in executive claims settlement, the President was authorized to suspend claims pursuant to the Executive Order in question here.  Pp.  453 U. S. 675-688.
(a) Although neither the IEEPA nor the Hostage Act constitutes specific authorization for the President's suspension of the claims, these statutes are highly relevant as an indication of congressional acceptance of a broad scope for executive action in circumstances such as those presented in this case.  Pp.  453 U. S. 675-679.
(b) The United States has repeatedly exercised its sovereign authority to settle the claims of its nationals against foreign countries.  
Page 453 U. S. 657
 Although those settlements have sometimes been made by treaty, there has also been a longstanding practice of settling such claims by executive agreement without the advice and consent of the Senate, and this practice continues at the present time.  Pp.  453 U. S. 679-680.
(c) That Congress has implicitly approved the practice of claims settlement by executive agreement is best demonstrated by Congress' enactment of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1919, which created the International Claims Commission, now the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, and gave it jurisdiction to make final and binding decisions with respect to claims by United States nationals against settlement funds.  And the legislative history of the IEEPA further reveals that Congress has accepted the authority of the President to enter into settlement agreements.  Pp.  453 U. S. 680-682.
(d) In addition to congressional acquiescence in the President's power to settle claims, prior cases of this Court have also recognized that the President has some measure of power to enter into executive agreements without obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate.  See, e.g., United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203.  Pp.  453 U. S. 682-683.
(e) Petitioner's argument that all settlement claims prior to 1952, when the United States had adhered to the doctrine of absolute sovereign immunity should be discounted because of the evolution of sovereign immunity, is refuted by the fact that, since 1952, there have been at least 10 claim settlements by executive agreement.  Thus, even if the pre-1952 cases should be disregarded, congressional acquiescence in settlement agreements since that time supports the President's power to act here.  Pp.  453 U. S. 683-684.
(f) By enacting the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), which granted personal and subject matter jurisdiction to federal district courts over commercial suits by claimants against foreign states that waived immunity, Congress did not divest the President of the authority to settle claims.  The President, by suspending petitioner's claim, has not circumscribed the jurisdiction of the United States courts in violation of Art. III, but has simply effected a change in the substantive law governing the lawsuit.  The FSIA was designed to remove one particular barrier to suit, namely, sovereign immunity, and cannot be read as prohibiting the President from settling claims of United States nationals against foreign governments.  Pp.  453 U. S. 684-686.
(g) Long continued executive practice, known to and acquiesced in by Congress, raises a presumption that the President's action has been taken pursuant to Congress' consent.  Such practice is present here, and such a presumption is also appropriate.   P.  453 U. S. 686.
(h) The conclusion that the President's action in suspending petitioner's 
Page 453 U. S. 658
 claim did not exceed his powers is buttressed by the fact the President has provided an alternative forum, the Claims Tribunal, to settle the claims of the American nationals.  Moreover, Congress has not disapproved the action taken here.  Pp.  453 U. S. 686-688.
(i) While it is not concluded that the President has plenary power to settle claims, even against foreign governmental entities, nevertheless, where, as here, the settlement of claims has been determined to be a necessary incident to the resolution of a major foreign policy dispute between this country and another, and Congress has acquiesced in the President's action, it cannot be said that the President lacks the power to settle such claim.  P.  453 U. S. 688.
3. The possibility that the President's actions with respect to the suspension of the claims may effect a taking of petitioner's property in violation of the Fifth Amendment in the absence of just compensation makes ripe for adjudication the question whether petitioner will have a remedy at law in the Court of Claims.  And there is no jurisdictional obstacle to an appropriate action in that court under the Tucker Act.  Pp.  453 U. S. 688-690.

Section 312 (a) (7) of the Communications Act of 1934, as added by Title I of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, authorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to revoke any broadcasting station license
""for willful or repeated failure to allow reasonable access to or to permit purchase of reasonable amounts of time for the use of a broadcasting station by a legally qualified candidate for Federal elective office on behalf of his candidacy.""
On October 11, 1979, the Carter-Mondale Presidential Committee(Committee) requested each of the three major television networks (petitioners) to provide time for a 30-minute program between 8 p. m. and 10:30 p.m. on any day from the 4th through the 7th of December, 1979.  The Committee intended to present, in conjunction with President Carter's formal announcement of his candidacy, a documentary outlining the record of his administration.  The petitioners refused to make the requested time available.  CBS emphasized the large number of candidates for the Presidential nominations and the potential disruption of regular programming to accommodate requests for equal treatment, but offered to sell a 5-minute segment at 10:55 p.m. on December 8 and a 5-minute segment in the daytime; American Broadcasting Cos. replied that it had not yet decided when it would begin selling political time for the 1980 Presidential campaign, but later indicated that it would allow such sales in January, 1980; and National Broadcasting Co., noting the number of potential requests for time from Presidential candidates, stated that it was not prepared to sell time for political programs as early as December, 1979.  The Committee then filed a complaint with the FCC, charging that the networks had violated their obligation to provide ""reasonable access"" under  312(a)(7).  The FCC ruled that the networks had violated the statute, concluding that their reasons for refusing to sell the time requested were ""deficient"" under the FCC's standards 
Page 453 U. S. 368
 of reasonableness, and directing the networks to indicate by a specified date how they intended to fulfill their statutory obligations.  On the networks' petition for review, the Court of Appeals affirmed the FCC's orders, holding that the statute created a new, affirmative right of access to the broadcast media for individual candidates for federal elective office, and that the FCC has the authority to independently evaluate whether a campaign has begun for purposes of the statute.  The court approved the FCC's insistence that, in responding to a candidate's request for time, broadcasters must weigh certain factors, including the individual needs of the candidate (as expressed by the candidate); the amount of time previously provided to the candidate; potential disruption of regular programming; the number of other candidates likely to invoke equal opportunity rights if the broadcaster granted the request before it; and the timing of the request.  The court determined that the record supported the FCC's conclusion that the networks failed to apply the proper standards, and had thus violated the statute's ""reasonable access"" requirement.  The court also rejected petitioners' First Amendment challenge to  312(a)(7) as applied.
Held:
1. Section 312 (a)(7) created an affirmative, promptly enforceable right of reasonable access to the use of broadcast stations for individual candidates seeking federal elective office.  It went beyond merely codifying prior FCC policies developed under the public interest standard.  Pp.  453 U. S. 376-386.
(a) It is clear on the face of the statute that Congress did not prescribe simply a general duty to afford some measure of political programming, which the public interest obligation of broadcasters already provided for.  Rather,  312(a)(7) focuses on the individual ""legally qualified candidate"" seeking air time to advocate ""his candidacy,"" and guarantees him ""reasonable access"" enforceable by specific governmental sanction.  Further, the sanction may be imposed for either ""willful or repeated"" failure to afford reasonable access.  Pp.  453 U. S. 377-379.
(b) The legislative history confirms that  312(a)(7) created a right of access that enlarged the political broadcasting responsibilities of licensees.  Pp.  453 U. S. 379-382.
(c) Since the enactment of  312(a)(7), the FCC has consistently construed the statute as extending beyond the prior public interest policy, and as imposing the additional requirement that reasonable access and purchase of reasonable amounts of time be afforded candidates for federal office.  This repeated construction of the statute comports with its language and legislative history, and has received congressional review, so that departure from that construction is unwarranted.  Pp.  453 U. S. 382-385. 
Page 453 U. S. 369

(d) The qualified observation in Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S. 94,  412 U. S. 113-114, n. 12, relied on by petitioners, that  312(a)(7) ""essentially codified"" existing FCC practice was not a conclusion that the statute was in all respects coextensive with that practice, and imposed no additional duties on broadcasters.  That case did not purport to rule on the precise contours of the responsibilities created by  312(a)(7), since that issue was not before the Court.  Pp.  453 U. S. 385-386.
2. Contrary to petitioners' contentions, certain of the FCC's standards to effectuate the guarantees of  312(a)(7) -- which standards evolved principally on a case-by-case basis, and are not embodied in formalized rules -- do not contravene the statutory objectives or unduly intrude on petitioners' editorial discretion, and the statute was properly applied to petitioners in determining that they had failed to grant the ""reasonable access"" required by the statute.  Pp.  453 U. S. 386-394.
(a) The FCC's practice of independently determining -- by examining objective evidence and considering the position of both the candidate and the networks, as well as other factors -- whether a campaign has begun and the obligations imposed by the statute have attached does not improperly involve the FCC in the electoral process or significantly impair broadcasters' editorial discretion.  Nor is the FCC's standard requiring broadcasters to evaluate access requests on an individualized basis improper on the alleged ground that it attaches inordinate significance to candidates' needs, thereby precluding fair assessment of broadcasters' concerns.  The FCC mandates careful consideration of, not blind assent to, candidates' desires for air time.  Although the standard does proscribe blanket rules concerning access, such as a broadcaster's rule of granting only time spots of a fixed duration to all candidates, the standard is consistent with  312(a)(7)'s guarantee of reasonable access for individual candidates for federal elective office.  The FCC's standards are not arbitrary and capricious, but represent a reasoned attempt to effectuate the statute's access requirement, giving broadcasters room to exercise their discretion, but demanding that they act in good faith.  Pp.  453 U. S. 388-390.
(b) On the basis of prior FCC decisions and interpretations, petitioners had adequate notice that their conduct in responding to the Committee's request for access would contravene the statute.  The FCC's conclusion about the status of the campaign accorded with its announced position on the vesting of  312(a)(7) rights, and was adequately supported by the objective factors on which it relied.  And under the circumstances here, it cannot be concluded that the FCC abused its discretion in finding that petitioners failed to grant the ""reasonable access"" required by  312(a)(7).  Pp.  453 U. S. 390-394. 
Page 453 U. S. 370

3. The right of access to the media under  312(a)(7), as defined by the FCC and applied here, does not violate the First Amendment rights of broadcasters by unduly circumscribing their editorial discretion, but instead properly balances the First Amendment rights of federal candidates, the public, and broadcasters.  Although the broadcasting industry is entitled under the First Amendment to exercise ""the widest journalistic freedom consistent with its public [duties] ,"" Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, supra, at  412 U. S. 110, ""[i]t is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.""  Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367,  395 U. S. 390.  Section 312(a)(7), which creates only a limited right of access to the media, makes a significant contribution to freedom of expression by enhancing the ability of candidates to present, and the public to receive, information necessary for the effective operation of the democratic process.  Pp.  453 U. S. 394-397.
202 U.S.App.D.C. 369, 629 F.2d 1, affirmed.

Syllabus 
When California Highway Patrol officers stopped petitioner's station wagon for proceeding erratically, they smelled marihuana smoke as he opened the car door.  In the ensuing search of the car, the officers found in the luggage compartment two packages wrapped in green opaque plastic.  They then unwrapped the packages, both of which contained bricks of marihuana.  Petitioner was charged with various drug offenses, and, after his pretrial motion to suppress the evidence found when the packages were unwrapped was denied, he was convicted.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that the warrantless opening of the packages was constitutionally permissible, since any experienced observer could reasonably have inferred from the appearance of the packages that they contained bricks of marihuana.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.  Pp.  453 U. S. 423-29;  453 U. S. 429-436.
103 Cal.App.3d 34, 162 Cal.Rptr. 780, reversed.
JUSTICE STEWART, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded that the opening of the packages without a search warrant violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  453 U. S. 423-429.
(a) A closed piece of luggage found in a lawfully searched car is constitutionally protected to the same extent as are closed pieces of luggage found anywhere else.  United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1; Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753.  Pp.  453 U. S. 423-425.
(b) With respect to the constitutional protection to which a closed container found in the lawful search of an automobile is entitled, there is no distinction between containers, such as suitcases, commonly used to transport ""personal effects,"" i.e., property worn on or carried about the person or having some intimate relation to the person, and flimsier containers, such as cardboard boxes and plastic bags.  Such a distinction has no basis in the language or meaning of the Fourth Amendment, which protects people and their effects, and protects those effects whether they are ""personal"" or ""impersonal.""  And there are no objective criteria by which such a distinction could be made.  Pp.  453 U. S. 425-427.
(c) Unless a closed container found in an automobile is such that 
Page 453 U. S. 421
 its contents may be said to be in plain view, those contents are fully protected by the Fourth Amendment.  Here, the evidence was insufficient to justify an exception to the rule on the ground that the contents of the packages in question could be inferred from their outward appearance.  To fall within such exception, a container must so clearly announce its contents, whether by its distinctive configuration, transparency, or otherwise, that its contents are obvious to the observer.  Pp.  453 U. S. 427-428.
JUSTICE POWELL concluded that petitioner had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the opaquely wrapped and sealed package in question.  The Fourth Amendment requires a police officer to obtain a warrant before searching a container that customarily serves as a repository for personal effects or when, as here, the circumstances indicate that the defendant has a reasonable expectation that the contents will not be open to public scrutiny.  Pp.  453 U. S. 429-436.

453 U.S. 454

Syllabus 
An automobile in which respondent was one of the occupants was stopped by a New York State policeman for traveling at an excessive rate of speed.  In the process of discovering that none of the occupants owned the car or was related to the owner, the policeman smelled burnt marihuana and saw on the floor of the car an envelope suspected of containing marihuana.  He then directed the occupants to get out of the car and arrested them for unlawful possession of marihuana.  After searching each of the occupants, he searched the passenger compartment of the car, found a jacket belonging to respondent, unzipped one of the pockets, and discovered cocaine.  Subsequently, respondent was indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance.  After the trial court had denied his motion to suppress the cocaine seized from his jacket pocket, respondent pleaded guilty to a lesser included offense, while preserving his claim that the cocaine had been seized in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the search and seizure, but the New York Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The search of respondent's jacket was a search incident to a lawful custodial arrest, and hence did not violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The jacket, being located inside the passenger compartment of the car, was ""within the arrestee's immediate control"" within the meaning of Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752, wherein it was held that a lawful custodial arrest creates a situation justifying the contemporaneous warrantless search of the arrestee and of the immediately surrounding area.  Not only may the police search the passenger compartment of the car in such circumstances, they may also examine the contents of any containers found in the passenger compartment.  And such a container may be searched whether it is open or closed, since the justification for the search is not that the arrestee has no privacy interest in the container, but that the lawful custodial arrest justifies the infringement of any privacy interest the arrestee may have.

And such a container may be searched whether it is open or closed, since the justification for the search is not that the arrestee has no privacy interest in the container, but that the lawful custodial arrest justifies the infringement of any privacy interest the arrestee may have.

No. 80-590
Argued March 31, 1981
Decided July 1, 1981
453 U.S. 473

Syllabus 
Respondent Mobil Oil Corp. contracted with petitioner for the latter's performance of certain operations on offshore oil drilling platforms.  Under the agreement, petitioner promised to indemnify Mobil for all claims resulting directly or indirectly from the work.  One of petitioner's employees (also a respondent), working on an oil drilling platform above the seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf, was injured while, because of a storm, he was being evacuated from the platform aboard a boat chartered by Mobil.  The employee brought suit for damages in a Texas state court, alleging negligence by Mobil and the boat owner.  Mobil filed a third-party complaint for indemnification against petitioner.  The trial court rejected petitioner's contention that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the third-party complaint because Mobil's cause of action arose under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), which vested exclusive subject matter jurisdiction in a federal district court.  During the trial, the court denied petitioner's request to instruct the jury that personal injury damages awards are not subject to federal income taxation and that they should not increase or decrease an award in contemplation of tax consequences.  The jury found Mobil negligent and awarded the employee $900,000 for his injuries.  It also found that the employee sustained his injuries while performing work subject to the contract of indemnification.  The court then entered judgment against petitioner in the amount of $900,000.  The Texas Court of Civil Appeals affirmed, and the Texas Supreme Court denied review.
Held:
1. Federal courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction over personal injury and indemnity cases arising under OCSLA.  Nothing in the language, structure, legislative history, or underlying policies of OCSLA suggests that Congress intended federal courts to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over such actions.  Pp.  453 U. S. 477-484.
(a) As a general principle, state courts may assume subject matter jurisdiction over a federal cause of action absent provision by Congress to the contrary or disabling incompatibility between the federal claim and state court adjudication.  Pp.  453 U. S. 477-478. 
Page 453 U. S. 474

(b) Congress did not explicitly grant federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over cases arising under OCSLA.  And the OCSLA plan -- declaring the Outer Continental Shelf to be an area of ""exclusive federal jurisdiction"" and adopting ""applicable and not inconsistent"" law of the adjacent States to fill the substantial ""gaps"" in the coverage of federal law -- is not inimical to state court jurisdiction over personal injury actions.  Nothing inherent in exclusive federal sovereignty or political jurisdiction over a territory precludes a state court from entertaining a suit concerning events occurring in the territory and governed by federal law.  Nor can OCSLA's legislative history be read to rebut the presumption of concurrent state court jurisdiction, given Congress' silence on the subject in the statute itself.  Pp.  453 U. S. 478-483.
(c) The operation of OCSLA, which borrows state law to govern claims arising under it, will not be frustrated by state court jurisdiction over personal injury actions.  And allowing personal injury and contract actions in state courts will advance interests identified by Congress in enacting OCSLA concerning the special relationship between the men working on offshore platforms and the adjacent shore to which they commute to visit their families.  Pp.  453 U. S. 483-484.
2. Whether petitioner was entitled to an instruction cautioning the jury that personal injury damages awards are not subject to federal income taxation depends on matters that were not addressed by the court below, and that should be initially considered by it on remand of the case.  Subsequent to the Texas Court of Civil Appeals' determination that petitioner was not entitled to such an instruction under then-current federal case law, this Court decided Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Liepelt, 444 U. S. 490.  In that case, an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, this Court, in the absence of any guidance in the statute, articulated a federal common law rule that a defendant in a federal personal injury action is entitled to an instruction that damages awards are not subject to federal income taxation.  However, OCSLA mandates that the law of the adjacent State (Louisiana here) applies as federal law ""[t]o the extent [it is] not inconsistent"" with federal law.  The question whether this incorporation of state law precludes a court from finding that state law is ""inconsistent"" with the federal common law rule announced in Liepelt need be answered here only if Louisiana law would not require that the damages instruction be given upon timely request.  Thus, the case is remanded to the Court of Civil Appeals to determine whether Louisiana law requires the instruction, and, if it does not, whether Liepelt displaces the state rule in an OCSLA case.

No. 883
Argued January 14, 1981

453 U.S. 280

Syllabus 
Respondent, an American citizen and a former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, announced a campaign ""to expose CIA officers and agents and to take the measures necessary to drive them out of the countries where they are operating.""  He then engaged in activities abroad that have resulted in identifications of alleged undercover CIA agents and intelligence sources in foreign countries.  Because of these activities the Secretary of State revoked respondent's passport, explaining that the revocation was based on a regulation authorizing revocation of a passport where the Secretary determines that an American citizen's activities abroad ""are causing or are likely to cause serious damage to the national security or the foreign policy of the United States.""  The notice also advised respondent of his right to an administrative hearing.  Respondent filed suit against the Secretary in Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that the regulation invoked by the Secretary has not been authorized by Congress and is impermissibly overbroad; that the passport revocation violated respondent's freedom to travel and his First Amendment right to criticize Government policies; and that the failure to accord him a pre-revocation hearing violated his Fifth Amendment right to procedural due process.  Granting summary judgment for respondent and ordering the Secretary to restore respondent's passport, the District Court held that the regulation exceeded the Secretary's power under the Passport Act of 1926, which authorizes the Secretary to
""grant and issue passports, and cause passports to be granted, issued, and verified in foreign countries by diplomatic representatives of the United States . . . under such rules as the President shall designate and prescribe. . . .""
The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the Secretary was required to show that Congress had authorized the regulation either by an express delegation or by implied approval of a ""substantial and consistent"" administrative practice, and that no such authority had been shown.
Held:  The 1926 Act authorizes the revocation of respondent's passport pursuant to the policy announced by the challenged regulation, such 
Page 453 U. S. 281
 policy being ""sufficiently substantial and consistent"" to compel the conclusion that Congress has approved it; and the regulation is constitutional as applied.  Pp.  453 U. S. 289-310.
(a) Although the Act does not, in express terms, authorize the Secretary to revoke a passport or deny a passport application, neither does it expressly limit those powers.  It is beyond dispute that he has the power to deny a passport for reasons not specified in the statutes, and, as respondent concedes, if the Secretary may deny a passport application for a certain reason, he may revoke a passport on the same ground.  Pp.  453 U. S. 289-291.
(b) In light of the broad rulemaking authority granted in the Act, the consistent administrative construction of it must be followed by the courts, absent compelling indications that such construction is wrong.  This is especially so in light of the fact that the statute deals with foreign policy and national security, where congressional silence is not to be equated with disapproval.  Pp.  453 U. S. 291-292.
(c) Absent evidence of any legislative intent to repudiate the consistent administrative construction of the prior and similar 1856 Passport Act as preserving the nonstatutory authority of the President and Secretary to withhold passports on national security and foreign policy grounds, it must be concluded that Congress, in enacting the 1926 Act, adopted such construction.  Moreover, the Executive has consistently construed the 1926 Act to work no change in prior practice.  Pp.  453 U. S. 292-300.
(d) A 1978 statute making it unlawful to travel abroad without a passport even in peacetime and a 1978 amendment to the 1926 Act providing that ""[u]nless authorized by law,"" in the absence of war, armed hostilities, or imminent danger to travelers, a passport may not be geographically restricted, are weighty evidence of congressional approval of the Secretary's interpretation of his authority to revoke passports, particularly as set forth in the challenged regulation.  Pp.  453 U. S. 300-301.
(e) An administrative policy or practice may be consistent even though the occasions for invoking it are limited.  Although a pattern of actual enforcement is one indicator of Executive policy, it suffices that the Executive has openly asserted the power at issue.  Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S. 116, distinguished.  Pp.  453 U. S. 301-303.
(f) The protection accorded beliefs, standing alone, is very different from the protection accorded conduct.  Here, beliefs and speech are only part of respondent's campaign, which presents a serious danger to American officials abroad and to the national security.  Pp.  453 U. S. 304-306.
(g) In light of the express language in the challenged regulation, 
Page 453 U. S. 282
 which permits revocation of a passport only in cases involving likelihood of ""serious damage"" to national security or foreign policy, respondent's constitutional claims are without merit.  The right to hold a passport is subordinate to national security and foreign policy considerations, and is subject to reasonable governmental regulation.  Assuming, arguendo, that First Amendment protections reach beyond our national boundaries, respondent's First Amendment claim is without foundation. See Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697,  283 U. S. 716. To the extent the revocation of respondent's passport operates to inhibit him, it is an inhibition of action, rather than of speech.  And, on the record of this case, the Government is not required to hold a pre-revocation hearing, since where there is a substantial likelihood of ""serious damage"" to national security or foreign policy as the result of a passport holder's activities abroad, the Government may take action to ensure that the holder may not exploit the United States' sponsorship of his travels.  The Constitution's due process guarantees call for no more than what was accorded here:  a statement of reasons and an opportunity for a prompt post-revocation hearing.  Pp.  453 U. S. 306-310.

|453 u.s. 322|"National Labor Relations Board v. Amax Coal Co.
No. 8092
Argued April 28, 1981
Decided June 29, 1981*
453 U.S. 322

Syllabus 
Amax Coal Co. owns several deep-shaft coal mines in the Midwest, with respect to which it is a member of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association (BCOA), a national multiemployer group that bargains with the union representing Amax's employees.  Under a collective bargaining contract with the union, Amax, along with other members of the BCOA, agreed to contribute to the union's national pension and welfare trust funds, which were established under  302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA).  In accord with  302(c)(5)(B), the trust funds are administered by three trustees, one selected by the union, one by members of the BCOA, and one by the other two.  When Amax opened a surface mine in Wyoming, with respect to which it did not join the BCOA, Amax and the union negotiated a separate collective bargaining contract under which Amax contributed specified amounts of money to the national trust funds to benefit the employees at the surface mine.  When this contract ended, the union struck the surface mine and others in an attempt to compel the mine owners to establish a multiemployer bargaining unit and to agree to a new contract under which the members of the new employer unit would contribute to the national trust funds.  When subsequent separate negotiations between the union and Amax came to an impasse and the strike continued at the surface mine, Amax filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) unfair labor practice charges against the union.  Amax claimed that any management-appointed trustee of the  302(c)(5) trust fund was a collective bargaining ""representative"" of the employer within the meaning of  8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act -- which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union ""to restrain or coerce . . . an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances"" -- and that, therefore, since the management trustee of the national trust funds had 
Page 453 U. S. 323
 already been selected by the BCOA, the union's insistence that it participate in the national trust fund with regard to the surface mine employees constituted illegal coercion under  8(b)(1)(B).  The NLRB held that the union had not violated  8(b)(1)(B).  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that management-appointed trustees of a  302(c)(5) trust fund act as both fiduciaries of the employee beneficiaries and as agents of the appointing employers, and, insofar as is consistent with their fiduciary obligations, are expected to administer the trusts in such a way as to advance the employer's interests.  The court accordingly concluded that the union had violated  8(b)(1)(B) in exerting its economic power to induce Amax to participate in the national trust funds with respect to the surface mine employees.
Held:  Employer-selected trustees of a  302(c)(5) trust fund are not ""representatives"" of the employer ""for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances"" within the meaning of  8(b)(1)(B).  Pp.  453 U. S. 328-338.
(a) The duty of the management-appointed trustee of a  302(c)(5) fund is inconsistent with that of an agent of the appointing party.  Given the established rule of the law of trusts that a trustee has an unwavering duty of complete loyalty to the beneficiary of a trust, to the exclusion of the interests of all other parties, and the use in  302(c)(5) of such terms as ""held in trust"" and ""for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees . . . and their families and dependents,"" it must be inferred that Congress intended to incorporate the law of trusts, unless it has unequivocally expressed a contrary intent.  Nothing in  302(c)(5)'s language reveals any intent that a trustee should or may administer a trust fund in the interest of the party that appointed him, or that an employer may direct or supervise the decisions of the trustee he has appointed.  And the LMRA's legislative history confirms that  302(c)(5) was designed to reinforce, not to alter, a trustee's established duty.  Pp.  453 U. S. 328-332.
(b) Whatever may have been implicit in Congress' view of a trustee of a  302(c)(5) fund became explicit when Congress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which essentially codified the strict fiduciary standards that a  302(c)(5) trustee must meet.  And the ERISA's legislative history confirms that Congress intended to prevent such a trustee from being put in a position where he has dual loyalty.  Pp.  453 U. S. 332-334.
(c) Section 8(b)(1)(B) was primarily enacted to prevent unions from forcing employers to join multiemployer bargaining units, or to dictate the identity of those who would represent employers in collective bargaining negotiations or settlement of employee grievances.  A union's 
Page 453 U. S. 324
 power to strike or bargain to impasse to induce an employer to contribute to a multiemployer trust fund does not pose the danger Congress thereby sought to prevent.  Moreover, union pressure to force an employer to contribute to an established trust fund does not amount to dictating to an employer who shall represent him in collective bargaining and the adjustment of grievances, because the trustees of a  302(c)(5) trust fund simply do not, as such, engage in these activities.  Pp.  453 U. S. 334-338.

Under a collective bargaining contract with the union, Amax, along with other members of the BCOA, agreed to contribute to the union's national pension and welfare trust funds, which were established under  302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA).  In accord with  302(c)(5)(B), the trust funds are administered by three trustees, one selected by the union, one by members of the BCOA, and one by the other two.  When Amax opened a surface mine in Wyoming, with respect to which it did not join the BCOA, Amax and the union negotiated a separate collective bargaining contract under which Amax contributed specified amounts of money to the national trust funds to benefit the employees at the surface mine.  When this contract ended, the union struck the surface mine and others in an attempt to compel the mine owners to establish a multiemployer bargaining unit and to agree to a new contract under which the members of the new employer unit would contribute to the national trust funds.  When subsequent separate negotiations between the union and Amax came to an impasse and the strike continued at the surface mine, Amax filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) unfair labor practice charges against the union.  Amax claimed that any management-appointed trustee of the  302(c)(5) trust fund was a collective bargaining ""representative"" of the employer within the meaning of  8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act -- which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union ""to restrain or coerce . . . an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances"" -- and that, therefore, since the management trustee of the national trust funds had 
Page 453 U. S. 323
 already been selected by the BCOA, the union's insistence that it participate in the national trust fund with regard to the surface mine employees constituted illegal coercion under  8(b)(1)(B).  The NLRB held that the union had not violated  8(b)(1)(B).  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that management-appointed trustees of a  302(c)(5) trust fund act as both fiduciaries of the employee beneficiaries and as agents of the appointing employers, and, insofar as is consistent with their fiduciary obligations, are expected to administer the trusts in such a way as to advance the employer's interests.  The court accordingly concluded that the union had violated  8(b)(1)(B) in exerting its economic power to induce Amax to participate in the national trust funds with respect to the surface mine employees.
Held:  Employer-selected trustees of a  302(c)(5) trust fund are not ""representatives"" of the employer ""for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances"" within the meaning of  8(b)(1)(B).  Pp.  453 U. S. 328-338.
(a) The duty of the management-appointed trustee of a  302(c)(5) fund is inconsistent with that of an agent of the appointing party.  Given the established rule of the law of trusts that a trustee has an unwavering duty of complete loyalty to the beneficiary of a trust, to the exclusion of the interests of all other parties, and the use in  302(c)(5) of such terms as ""held in trust"" and ""for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees . . . and their families and dependents,"" it must be inferred that Congress intended to incorporate the law of trusts, unless it has unequivocally expressed a contrary intent.  Nothing in  302(c)(5)'s language reveals any intent that a trustee should or may administer a trust fund in the interest of the party that appointed him, or that an employer may direct or supervise the decisions of the trustee he has appointed.  And the LMRA's legislative history confirms that  302(c)(5) was designed to reinforce, not to alter, a trustee's established duty.  Pp.  453 U. S. 328-332.
(b) Whatever may have been implicit in Congress' view of a trustee of a  302(c)(5) fund became explicit when Congress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which essentially codified the strict fiduciary standards that a  302(c)(5) trustee must meet.  And the ERISA's legislative history confirms that Congress intended to prevent such a trustee from being put in a position where he has dual loyalty.  Pp.  453 U. S. 332-334.
(c) Section 8(b)(1)(B) was primarily enacted to prevent unions from forcing employers to join multiemployer bargaining units, or to dictate the identity of those who would represent employers in collective bargaining negotiations or settlement of employee grievances.  A union's 
Page 453 U. S. 324
 power to strike or bargain to impasse to induce an employer to contribute to a multiemployer trust fund does not pose the danger Congress thereby sought to prevent.  Moreover, union pressure to force an employer to contribute to an established trust fund does not amount to dictating to an employer who shall represent him in collective bargaining and the adjustment of grievances, because the trustees of a  302(c)(5) trust fund simply do not, as such, engage in these activities.  Pp.  453 U. S. 334-338.

Held:  There is no rigid rule requiring that the content of the warnings to an accused prior to police interrogation required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.

Thus, the California Court of Appeal erred in holding that Miranda warnings were inadequate simply because of the order in which they were given to respondent (a minor), where, after he was told that he had ""the right to talk to a lawyer before you are questioned, have him present with you while you are being questioned, and all during the questioning,"" he was informed that he had the right to have his parents present, and then was informed that he had ""the right to have a lawyer appointed to represent you at no cost to yourself.""  These warnings adequately conveyed to respondent his right to have a lawyer appointed if he could not afford one prior to and during interrogation, and the Court of Appeal erred in concluding otherwise.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment, 642 F.2d 514, is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for further consideration in light of Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981). 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting.

Syllabus 
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA or Act) was amended in 1974 to extend to federal employees the Act's protection of older workers against discrimination in the workplace based on age.  Section 15(c) of the Act provides that any aggrieved federal employee ""may bring a civil action in any Federal district court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes"" of the Act.  Respondent federal employee brought suit in Federal District Court against the Secretary of the Navy under  15(c), alleging violations of the Act and demanding a jury trial.  The District Court ruled, over the Secretary's objection, that respondent was entitled to a jury trial.  On an interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Respondent was not entitled to a jury trial.  Pp.  453 U. S. 160-169.
(a) Where Congress waives the Government's immunity from suit, as it has in the ADEA, the plaintiff has a right to a trial by jury only where Congress has affirmatively and unambiguously granted that right by statute.  Pp.  453 U. S. 160-161.
(b) Congress has not done so here.  Neither the provision in  15(c) for federal employer cases to be brought in federal district courts, rather than the Court of Claims, nor the use of the word ""legal"" in that section, evinces a congressional intent that ADEA plaintiffs who proceed to trial against the Federal Government may do so before a jury.

Section 15(c) contrasts with  7(c) of the Act, which expressly provides for jury trials in actions against private employers and state and local governments.  Moreover, in extending the Act to cover federal employees, Congress based the provision not on the Fair Labor Standards Act, as was  7, but on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, where, unlike the FLSA, there was no right to trial by jury.

No. 79-1952
Argued January 19, 1981
Decided June 26, 1981
453 U.S. 182

Syllabus 
One provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (Act), 2 U.S.C.  441a(a)(1)(C), prohibits individuals and unincorporated associations from contributing more than $5,000 per calendar year to any multicandidate political committee.  A related provision,  441a(f), makes it unlawful for political committees knowingly to accept contributions exceeding the $5,000 limit.  Appellant California Medical Association (CMA) is a not-for-profit unincorporated association of doctors, and appellant California Medical Political Action Committee (CALPAC) is a political committee formed by CMA and registered with appellee Federal Election Commission (FEC).  When CMA and CALPAC were notified of an impending enforcement proceeding by the FEC for alleged violations of  441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(f), they, together with individual members, filed a declaratory judgment action in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of these provisions.  Subsequently, the FEC filed its enforcement proceeding in the same District Court, and CMA and CALPAC pleaded as affirmative defenses the same constitutional claims raised in their declaratory judgment action.  Pursuant to the special expedited review provisions of the Act,  437h(a), the District Court, while the enforcement proceeding was still pending, certified the constitutional questions raised in the declaratory judgment action to the Court of Appeals, which rejected the constitutional claims and upheld the challenged $5,000 limit on annual contributions.  Appellants sought review on direct appeal in this Court pursuant to  437h(b).
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  453 U. S. 187-201;  453 U. S. 201-204.
641 F.2d 619, affirmed.
JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and IV, concluding that:
1. This Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.  There is no merit to the FEC's contention that, in view of the overlapping provisions of the Act for judicial review of declaratory judgment actions,  437h(a), and enforcement proceedings,  437g(a)(10), and because Congress

 failed to provide any mechanism for coordinating cases in which the same constitutional issues are raised by the same parties in both a declaratory judgment action and an enforcement proceeding, as here, a direct appeal to this Court under  437h(b) should be limited to situations in which no enforcement proceedings are pending, since otherwise litigants, like appellants here, could disrupt and delay enforcement proceedings and undermine the functioning of the federal courts.  Neither the statutory language nor legislative history of  437g and 437h indicates that Congress intended such a limitation.  Pp.  453 U. S. 187-192.
2. Section 441a(a)(1)(C) does not violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment on the ground, alleged by appellants, that, because a corporation's or labor union's contributions to a segregated political fund are unlimited under the Act, an unincorporated association's contribution to a multicandidate political committee cannot be limited without violating equal protection.  Appellants' contention ignores the fact that the Act as a whole imposes far fewer restrictions on individuals and unincorporated associations than it does on corporations and unions.  The differing restrictions placed on individuals and unincorporated associations, on the one hand, and on corporations and unions, on the other, reflect a congressional judgment that these entities have differing structures and purposes and that they therefore may require different forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the political process.  Pp.  453 U. S. 200-201.
JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Part III that  441a(a)(1)(C) does not violate the First Amendment.  Nothing in  441a(a)(1)(C) limits the amount CMA or any of its members may independently expend in order to advocate political views; rather, the provision restrains only the amount CMA may contribute to CALPAC.  The ""speech by proxy"" that CMA seeks to achieve through its contributions to CALPAC is not the sort of political advocacy that this Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, found entitled to full First Amendment protection.  Since CALPAC receives contributions from more than 50 persons a year, appellants' claim that CALPAC is merely the mouthpiece of CMA is untenable.  CALPAC instead is a separate legal entity that receives funds from multiple sources and engages in independent political advocacy.  If the First Amendment rights of a contributor are not infringed by limitations on the amount he may contribute to a campaign organization which advocates the views and candidacy of a particular candidate, Buckley v. Valeo, supra, the rights of a contributor are similarly not impaired by limits on the amount he may give to a multicandidate political committee, such as CALPAC, which advocates the 
Page 453 U. S. 184
 views and candidacies of a number of candidates.  Moreover, the challenged contribution restriction, contrary to appellants' claim, is an appropriate means by which Congress could seek to protect the integrity of the contribution restrictions upheld in Buckley v. Valeo.  Pp.  453 U. S. 193-199.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded that the challenged contribution limitation does not violate the First Amendment because it is no broader than necessary to achieve the governmental interest in preventing actual or potential corruption.  Pp.  453 U. S. 201-204.
MARSHALL, J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and IV, in which BRENNAN, WHITE, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part III, in which BRENNAN, WHITE, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.

			"|"California Medical Association v. Federal Elections Commission
No. 79-1952
Argued January 19, 1981
Decided June 26, 1981
453 U.S. 182

Syllabus 
One provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (Act), 2 U.S.C.  441a(a)(1)(C), prohibits individuals and unincorporated associations from contributing more than $5,000 per calendar year to any multicandidate political committee.  A related provision,  441a(f), makes it unlawful for political committees knowingly to accept contributions exceeding the $5,000 limit.  Appellant California Medical Association (CMA) is a not-for-profit unincorporated association of doctors, and appellant California Medical Political Action Committee (CALPAC) is a political committee formed by CMA and registered with appellee Federal Election Commission (FEC).  When CMA and CALPAC were notified of an impending enforcement proceeding by the FEC for alleged violations of  441a(a)(1)(C) and 441a(f), they, together with individual members, filed a declaratory judgment action in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of these provisions.  Subsequently, the FEC filed its enforcement proceeding in the same District Court, and CMA and CALPAC pleaded as affirmative defenses the same constitutional claims raised in their declaratory judgment action.  Pursuant to the special expedited review provisions of the Act,  437h(a), the District Court, while the enforcement proceeding was still pending, certified the constitutional questions raised in the declaratory judgment action to the Court of Appeals, which rejected the constitutional claims and upheld the challenged $5,000 limit on annual contributions.  Appellants sought review on direct appeal in this Court pursuant to  437h(b).
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  453 U. S. 187-201;  453 U. S. 201-204.
641 F.2d 619, affirmed.
JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and IV, concluding that:
1. This Court has jurisdiction over the appeal.  There is no merit to the FEC's contention that, in view of the overlapping provisions of the Act for judicial review of declaratory judgment actions,  437h(a), and enforcement proceedings,  437g(a)(10), and because Congress 
Page 453 U. S. 183
 failed to provide any mechanism for coordinating cases in which the same constitutional issues are raised by the same parties in both a declaratory judgment action and an enforcement proceeding, as here, a direct appeal to this Court under  437h(b) should be limited to situations in which no enforcement proceedings are pending, since otherwise litigants, like appellants here, could disrupt and delay enforcement proceedings and undermine the functioning of the federal courts.  Neither the statutory language nor legislative history of  437g and 437h indicates that Congress intended such a limitation.  Pp.  453 U. S. 187-192.
2. Section 441a(a)(1)(C) does not violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment on the ground, alleged by appellants, that, because a corporation's or labor union's contributions to a segregated political fund are unlimited under the Act, an unincorporated association's contribution to a multicandidate political committee cannot be limited without violating equal protection.  Appellants' contention ignores the fact that the Act as a whole imposes far fewer restrictions on individuals and unincorporated associations than it does on corporations and unions.  The differing restrictions placed on individuals and unincorporated associations, on the one hand, and on corporations and unions, on the other, reflect a congressional judgment that these entities have differing structures and purposes and that they therefore may require different forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the political process.  Pp.  453 U. S. 200-201.
JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Part III that  441a(a)(1)(C) does not violate the First Amendment.  Nothing in  441a(a)(1)(C) limits the amount CMA or any of its members may independently expend in order to advocate political views; rather, the provision restrains only the amount CMA may contribute to CALPAC.  The ""speech by proxy"" that CMA seeks to achieve through its contributions to CALPAC is not the sort of political advocacy that this Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, found entitled to full First Amendment protection.  Since CALPAC receives contributions from more than 50 persons a year, appellants' claim that CALPAC is merely the mouthpiece of CMA is untenable.  CALPAC instead is a separate legal entity that receives funds from multiple sources and engages in independent political advocacy.  If the First Amendment rights of a contributor are not infringed by limitations on the amount he may contribute to a campaign organization which advocates the views and candidacy of a particular candidate, Buckley v. Valeo, supra, the rights of a contributor are similarly not impaired by limits on the amount he may give to a multicandidate political committee, such as CALPAC, which advocates the

JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded that the challenged contribution limitation does not violate the First Amendment because it is no broader than necessary to achieve the governmental interest in preventing actual or potential corruption.  Pp.  453 U. S. 201-204.

Syllabus 
A regular commissioned officer of the United States Army who retires after 20 years of service is entitled to retired pay.  Retired pay terminates with the officer's death, although he may designate a beneficiary to receive any arrearages that remain unpaid at death.  In addition, there are statutory plans that allow the officer to set aside a portion of his retired pay for his survivors.  Appellant, a Regular Army Colonel, filed a petition in California Superior Court for dissolution of his marriage to appellee.  At the time, he had served approximately 18 of the 20 years required for retirement with pay.  Under California law, each spouse, upon dissolution of a marriage, has an equal and absolute right to a half interest in all community and quasi-community property, but retains his or her separate property.  In his petition, appellant requested, inter alia, that his military retirement benefits be confirmed to him as his separate property.  The Superior Court held, however, that such benefits were subject to division as quasi-community property, and accordingly ordered appellant to pay to appellee a specified portion of the benefits upon retirement.  Subsequently, appellant retired and began receiving retired pay; under the dissolution decree, appellee was entitled to approximately 45% of the retired pay.  On review of this award, the California Court of Appeal affirmed, rejecting appellant's contention that, because the federal scheme of military retirement benefits preempts state community property law, the Supremacy Clause precluded the trial court from awarding appellee a portion of his retired pay.
Held:  Federal law precludes a state court from dividing military retired pay pursuant to state community property laws.  Pp.  453 U. S. 220-236.
(a) There is a conflict between the terms of the federal military retirement statutes and the community property right asserted by appellee.  The military retirement system confers no entitlement to retired pay upon the retired member's spouse, and does not embody even a limited ""community property concept.""  Rather, the language, structure, and history of the statutes make it clear that retired pay continues to be the personal entitlement of the retiree.  Pp.  453 U. S. 221-232.
(b) Moreover, the application of community property principles to military retired pay threatens grave harm to ""clear and substantial"" 
Page 453 U. S. 211
 federal interests.  Thus, the community property division of retired pay, by reducing the amounts that Congress has determined are necessary for the retired member, has the potential to frustrate the congressional objective of providing for the retired service member.  In addition, such a division has the potential to interfere with the congressional goals of having the military retirement system serve as an inducement for enlistment and reenlistment and as an encouragement to orderly promotion and a youthful military.  Pp.  453 U. S. 232-235.

Syllabus 
Respondents (an organization licensed by petitioner city to present certain musical concerts, and a promoter of the concerts) brought suit in Federal District Court against the city and city officials.  Alleging, inter alia, that the city's cancellation of the license amounted to a violation of their constitutional rights under color of.state law, respondents sought compensatory and punitive damages under 42 U.S.C.  183.  Without objection, the court gave an instruction authorizing the jury to award punitive damages against each defendant, including the city.  Verdicts were returned for respondents, which in addition to awarding compensatory damages, also awarded punitive damages against both the individual officials and the city.  The city moved for a new trial, arguing for the first time that punitive damages could not be awarded against a municipality under  1983.  Although noting that the challenge to the instruction was untimely under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51, the District Court considered and rejected the city's substantive legal arguments on their merits.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the city's failure to object to the charge at trial, as required by Rule 51, could not be overlooked on the theory that the charge itself was plain error.  The court also expressed a belief that the challenged instruction might not have been error at all, and identified the ""distinct possibility"" that municipalities could be liable for punitive damages under  1983 in the proper circumstances.
Held:
1. The city's failure to object to the charge at trial does not foreclose this Court from reviewing the punitive damages issue.  Because the District Court adjudicated the merits, and the Court of Appeals did not disagree with that adjudication, no interests in fair and effective trial administration advanced by Rule 51 would be served if this Court refused to reach the merits.  Nor should review here be limited to the restrictive ""plain error"" standard.  The contours of municipal liability under  1983 are currently in a state of evolving definition and uncertainty, and the very novelty of the legal issue at stake counsels unconstricted review.  In addition to being novel, the punitive damages question 
Page 453 U. S. 248
 is also important, and appears likely to recur in  1983 litigation against municipalities.  Pp.  453 U. S. 255-257.
2. A municipality is immune from punitive damages under  1983.  Pp.  453 U. S. 258-271.
(a) In order to conclude that Congress meant to incorporate a particular immunity as an affirmative defense in  1983 litigation, a court must undertake careful inquiry into considerations of both history and public policy.  Pp.  453 U. S. 258-259.
(b) In 1871, when Congress enacted what is now  1983, it was generally understood that a municipality was to be treated as a natural person subject to suit for a wide range of tortious activity, but this understanding did not extend to the award of punitive damages at common law.  Indeed, common law courts consistently and expressly declined to award punitive damages against municipalities.  Nothing in the legislative history suggests that, in enacting  1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress intended to abolish the doctrine of municipal immunity from punitive damages.  If anything, the relevant history suggests the opposite.  Pp.  453 U. S. 259-266.
(c) Considerations of public policy do not support exposing a municipality to punitive damages for the malicious or reckless conduct of its officials.  Neither the retributive nor the deterrence objectives of punitive damages and of  1983 would be significantly advanced by holding municipalities liable for such damages.  Pp.  453 U. S. 266-271.

Syllabus 
Respondents (an organization whose members harvest fish and shellfish off the coast of New York and New Jersey and one individual member) brought suit in Federal District Court against petitioners (various governmental entities and officials from New York, New Jersey, and the Federal Government), alleging damage to fishing grounds caused by discharges and ocean dumping of sewage and other waste.  Invoking a number of legal theories, respondents sought injunctive and declaratory relief and compensatory and punitive damages.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners.  It rejected respondents' federal common law nuisance claims on the ground that such a cause of action is not available to private parties.  And as to claims based on alleged violations of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) and the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 
Page 453 U. S. 2
 (MPRSA), the court refused to allow respondents to proceed with such claims independently of the provisions of the Act, which authorize private citizens (defined as ""persons having an interest which is or may be adversely affected"") to sue for injunctions to enforce the Acts, because respondents had failed to give the notice to the Environmental Protection Agency, the States, and any alleged violators required for such citizen suits.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  With respect to the FWPCA and MPRSA, the court held that failure to comply with the notice provisions did not preclude suits under the Acts in addition to the authorized citizen suits.  The court construed the citizen suit provisions as intended to create a limited cause of action for ""private attorneys general"" (""non-injured"" plaintiffs), as opposed to ""injured"" plaintiffs such as respondents, who have an alternative basis for suit under the saving clauses in the Acts preserving any right which any person may have under ""any statute or common law"" to enforce any standard or limitation or to seek any other relief.  The court then concluded that respondents had an implied statutory right of action.  With respect to the federal common law nuisance claims, the court rejected the District Court's conclusion that private parties may not bring such claims.
Held:
1. There is no implied right of action under the FWPCA and MPRSA.  Pp.  453 U. S. 11-21.
(a) In view of the elaborate provisions in both Acts authorizing enforcement suits by government officials and private citizens, it cannot be assumed that Congress intended to authorize by implication additional judicial remedies for private citizens suing under the Acts.  In the absence of strong indicia of a contrary congressional intent, it must be concluded that Congress provided precisely the remedies it considered appropriate.  Pp.  453 U. S. 13-15.
(b) The saving clauses are ambiguous as to Congress' intent to ""preserve"" remedies under the Acts.  It is doubtful that the phrase ""any statute"" in those clauses includes the very statute in which the phrase is contained.  Since it is clear that the citizen suit provisions apply only to persons who can claim some sort of injury, there is no reason to infer the existence of a separate cause of action for ""injured,"" as opposed to ""non-injured"" plaintiffs, as the Court of Appeals did.  Pp.  453 U. S. 15-17.
(c) The legislative history of the Acts does not lead to contrary conclusions with respect to implied remedies under either Act.  Rather, such history provides affirmative support for the view that Congress 
Page 453 U. S. 3
 intended the limitations imposed on citizen suits to apply to all private suits under the Acts.  P.  453 U. S. 17.
(d) The existence of the express remedies in both Acts demonstrates that Congress intended to supplant any remedy that otherwise might be available to respondents under 42 U.S.C.  1983 (1976 ed., Supp. III) for violation of the Acts by any municipalities and sewerage boards among petitioners.  Pp.  453 U. S. 19-21.
2. The Federal common law of nuisance has been fully preempted in the area of water pollution by the FWPCA, Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, and, to the extent ocean waters not covered by the FWPCA are involved, by the MPRSA. Pp.  453 U. S. 21-22.

With respect to the FWPCA and MPRSA, the court held that failure to comply with the notice provisions did not preclude suits under the Acts in addition to the authorized citizen suits.  The court construed the citizen suit provisions as intended to create a limited cause of action for ""private attorneys general"" (""non-injured"" plaintiffs), as opposed to ""injured"" plaintiffs such as respondents, who have an alternative basis for suit under the saving clauses in the Acts preserving any right which any person may have under ""any statute or common law"" to enforce any standard or limitation or to seek any other relief.  The court then concluded that respondents had an implied statutory right of action.  With respect to the federal common law nuisance claims, the court rejected the District Court's conclusion that private parties may not bring such claims.
Held:
1. There is no implied right of action under the FWPCA and MPRSA.  Pp.  453 U. S. 11-21.
(a) In view of the elaborate provisions in both Acts authorizing enforcement suits by government officials and private citizens, it cannot be assumed that Congress intended to authorize by implication additional judicial remedies for private citizens suing under the Acts.  In the absence of strong indicia of a contrary congressional intent, it must be concluded that Congress provided precisely the remedies it considered appropriate.  Pp.  453 U. S. 13-15.
(b) The saving clauses are ambiguous as to Congress' intent to ""preserve"" remedies under the Acts.  It is doubtful that the phrase ""any statute"" in those clauses includes the very statute in which the phrase is contained.  Since it is clear that the citizen suit provisions apply only to persons who can claim some sort of injury, there is no reason to infer the existence of a separate cause of action for ""injured,"" as opposed to ""non-injured"" plaintiffs, as the Court of Appeals did.  Pp.  453 U. S. 15-17.
(c) The legislative history of the Acts does not lead to contrary conclusions with respect to implied remedies under either Act.  Rather, such history provides affirmative support for the view that Congress 
Page 453 U. S. 3
 intended the limitations imposed on citizen suits to apply to all private suits under the Acts.  P.  453 U. S. 17.
(d) The existence of the express remedies in both Acts demonstrates that Congress intended to supplant any remedy that otherwise might be available to respondents under 42 U.S.C.  1983 (1976 ed., Supp. III) for violation of the Acts by any municipalities and sewerage boards among petitioners.  Pp.  453 U. S. 19-21.
2. The Federal common law of nuisance has been fully preempted in the area of water pollution by the FWPCA, Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, and, to the extent ocean waters not covered by the FWPCA are involved, by the MPRSA. Pp.  453 U. S. 21-22.

Syllabus 
The Medicaid program provides federal funds to States that pay for medical treatment for needy persons.  Section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Social Security Act provides that, in calculating benefits, state Medicaid plans must not
""take into account the financial responsibility of any individual for any applicant or recipient of assistance under the plan unless such applicant or recipient is such individual's spouse""
or minor, blind, or disabled child. Section 1902(a)(17)(B) requires participating States to grant benefits to eligible persons taking into account only such income and resources that are, ""as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary [of Health and Human Services], available to the applicant.""  The Secretary promulgated regulations describing the circumstances in which the income of one spouse may be ""deemed"" available to the other for purposes of determining eligibility for Medicaid benefits.  In States participating in the program called Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (SSI), which substantially replaced the former state-run categorical need plans and enlarged eligibility for Medicaid benefits, the regulations provide that, when the applicant and his spouse live in the same household, the spouse's income and resources always must be considered in determining eligibility whether or not they are actually contributed, and that, when the applicant and spouse cease to share the same household, the spouse's income will be disregarded the next month unless both are eligible for assistance, in which case the income of both is considered for six months.  Greater ""deeming"" is authorized in States which have exercised the option under  209(b) of the 1972 amendments to the Social Security Act of electing not to enlarge Medicaid eligibility to SSI levels.  Respondent, an organization dedicated to helping the elderly, filed suit in Federal District Court attacking the regulations applicable in the  209(b) States on the ground that ""deeming"" impermissibly employs an ""arbitrary formula"" to impute a spouse's income to an institutionalized applicant, and thus is inconsistent with  1902(a)(17)(B).  Respondent claimed that, before a State may take into account the spouse's income in calculating an institutionalized applicant's benefits, it must 
Page 453 U. S. 35
 make a factual determination that the spouse's income actually is contributed to that applicant.  The District Court agreed, and declared the regulations invalid.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but on the ground that the regulations were invalid because the Secretary, in promulgating them, had failed to consider the unfairness of treating separated spouses as a ""single economic unit"" and the disruption caused by the requirement of support from the applicant's spouse.
Held:  The regulations at issue are consistent with the statutory scheme, and are reasonable exercises of the authority delegated to the Secretary.  Pp.  453 U. S. 43-50.
(a) In view of the explicit delegation of substantive authority to the Secretary in  1902(a)(17)(B), his definition of the term ""available"" is entitled to ""legislative effect,"" rather than mere deference or weight.  Pp.  453 U. S. 43-44.
(b) The language of  1902(a)(17)(D), which was enacted as part of the original Medicaid program, makes it clear that, from the beginning of the program, Congress authorized States to presume spousal support.  And this provision's legislative history is fully consistent with its language.  By enacting  209(b), Congress in effect told States that wished to use the  209(b) option that they could retain virtually all of the Medicaid eligibility limitations, including ""deeming,"" that were allowed under the original Act.  Pp.  453 U. S. 44-47.
(c) In treating spouses differently from most other relatives by explicitly authorizing state plans ""to take into account the financial responsibility"" of the spouse, Congress demonstrated that ""deeming"" is not antithetical to the general statutory requirement that Medicaid eligibility be based solely on resources ""available"" to the applicant.  ""Available"" resources are different from those in hand.  The requirement of availability refers to resources left to a couple after the spouse has deducted a sum on which to live, and does not require a State to consider only the resources actually paid by the spouse to the applicant.  The administration of public assistance based on the use of a formula is not inherently arbitrary.  To require individual factual determinations of need would dissipate, in  factfinding, resources that could have been spent on the needy.  Pp.  453 U. S. 47-48.

Syllabus 
The Military Selective Service Act (Act) authorizes the President to require the registration for possible military service of males, but not females, the purpose of registration being to facilitate any eventual conscription under the Act.  Registration for the draft was discontinued by Presidential Proclamation in 1975 (the Act was amended in 1973 to preclude conscription), but as the result of a crisis in Southwestern Asia, President Carter decided in 1980 that it was necessary to reactivate the registration process, and sought Congress' allocation of funds for that purpose.  He also recommended that Congress amend the Act to permit the registration and conscription of women as well as men.  Although agreeing that it was necessary to reactivate the registration process, Congress allocated only those funds necessary to register males, and declined to amend the Act to permit the registration of women.  Thereafter, the President ordered the registration of specified groups of young men.  In a lawsuit brought by several men challenging the Act's constitutionality, a three-judge District Court ultimately held that the Act's gender-based discrimination violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and enjoined registration under the Act.
Held:  The Act's registration provisions do not violate the Fifth Amendment.  Congress acted well within its constitutional authority to raise and regulate armies and navies when it authorized the registration of men and not women.  Pp.  453 U. S. 64-83.
(a) The customary deference accorded Congress' judgments is particularly appropriate when, as here, Congress specifically considered the question of the Act's constitutionality, and perhaps in no area has the Court accorded Congress greater deference than in the area of national defense and military affairs.  While Congress is not free to disregard the Constitution when it acts in the area of military affairs, this Court must be particularly careful not to substitute its judgment of what is desirable for that of Congress, or its own evaluation of evidence for a reasonable evaluation by the Legislative Branch.  Congress carefully considered whether to register only males for potential conscription or whether to register both sexes, and its broad constitutional authority 
Page 453 U. S. 58
 cannot be ignored in considering the constitutionality of its studied choice of one alternative in preference to the other.  Pp.  453 U. S. 64-72.
(b) The question of registering women was extensively considered by Congress in hearings held in response to the President's request for authorization to register women, and its decision to exempt women was not the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about women.  Since Congress thoroughly reconsidered the question of exempting women from the Act in 1980, the Act's constitutionality need not be considered solely on the basis of the views expressed by Congress in 1948, when the Act was first enacted in its modern form.  Congress' determination that any future draft would be characterized by a need for combat troops was sufficiently supported by testimony adduced at the hearings so that the courts are not free to make their own judgment on the question.   And since women are excluded from combat service by statute or military policy, men and women are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft, and Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause.  The testimony of executive and military officials before Congress showed that the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than ""equity.""  The District Court, undertaking an independent evaluation of the evidence, exceeded its authority in ignoring Congress' conclusions that whatever the need for women for noncombat roles during mobilization, it could be met by volunteers, and that staffing noncombat positions with women during a mobilization would be positively detrimental to the important goal of military flexibility.

Syllabus 
Title 18 U.S.C.  1725 prohibits the deposit of unstamped ""mailable matter"" in a letterbox approved by the United States Postal Service, and violations are subject to a fine.  The local Postmaster notified appellee civic association that its practice of delivering messages to residents by placing unstamped notices in the letterboxes of private homes violated  1725, and advised it that, if it and other members of appellee council of civic associations continued such practice, it could result in a fine.  Appellees then brought suit in Federal District Court against the Postal Service for declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the enforcement of  1725 would inhibit their communications with local residents and would thereby deny them the freedom of speech and press secured by the First Amendment.  The District Court ultimately declared  1725 unconstitutional as applied to appellees and the council's member associations and enjoined the Postal Service from enforcing it as to them.
Held:  Section 1725 does not unconstitutionally abridge appellees' First Amendment rights, inasmuch as neither the enactment nor the enforcement of  1725 is geared in any way to the content of the message sought to be placed in the letterbox.  Pp.  453 U. S. 120-134.
(a) When a letterbox is designated an ""authorized depository"" of the mail by the Postal Service, it becomes an essential part of the nationwide system for the delivery and receipt of mail.  In effect, the postal customer, although he pays for the physical components of the ""authorized depository,"" agrees to abide by the Postal Service's regulations in exchange for the Postal Service agreeing to deliver and pick up his mail.  A letterbox, once designated an ""authorized depository,"" does not at the same time transform itself into a ""public forum"" of some limited nature to which the First Amendment guarantees access to all comers.  Just because it may be somewhat more efficient for appellees to place their messages in letterboxes does not mean that there is a First Amendment right to do so.  The First Amendment does not guarantee access to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the Government.  Pp.  453 U. S. 126-131. 
Page 453 U. S. 115

(b) Congress, in exercising its constitutional authority to develop and operate a national postal system, may properly legislate with the generality of cases in mind, and should not be put to the test of defending in one township after another the constitutionality of a statute under the traditional ""time, place, and manner"" analysis.  If Congress and the Postal Service are to operate as efficiently as possible an extensive system for the delivery of mail, they must adopt regulations of a general character having uniform applicability throughout the Nation.  In this case, Congress was legislating to promote what it considered to be the efficiency of the Postal Service, and was not laying down a generalized prohibition against the distribution of leaflets or the discussion of issues in traditional public forums.

Held:  A suit brought by respondent local union against petitioner parent international union alleging a violation of the international union's constitution arising from the international union's issuance of an order requiring consolidation of certain local unions, including respondent -- which suit was instituted in state court but removed to federal court by the international union -- falls within the jurisdiction of the federal district courts under  301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.

Held:  A suit brought by respondent local union against petitioner parent international union alleging a violation of the international union's constitution arising from the international union's issuance of an order requiring consolidation of certain local unions, including respondent -- which suit was instituted in state court but removed to federal court by the international union -- falls within the jurisdiction of the federal district courts under  301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.

No. 80-795
Argued April 20, 1981
Decided June 22, 1981
452 U.S. 640

Syllabus 
A rule (Rule 6.05) of the Minnesota Agricultural Society (Society), a Minnesota public corporation that operates the annual state fair, provides that sale or distribution of any merchandise, including printed or written material, except from a duly licensed location on the fairgrounds shall be a misdemeanor.  As Rule 6.05 is construed and applied by the Society, all persons, groups, or firms desiring to sell, exhibit, or distribute materials during the fair must do so only from fixed locations.  However, the Rule does not prevent organizational representatives from walking about the fairgrounds and communicating the organization's views to fair patrons in face-to-face discussions.  Space in the fairgrounds is rented in a nondiscriminatory fashion on a first-come, first-served basis, and Rule 6.05 applies alike to nonprofit, charitable, and commercial enterprises.  Respondents, International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. (ISKCON), an organization espousing the views of the Krishna religion, and the head of one of its temples filed suit in a Minnesota state court against state officials, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that Rule 6.05, on its face and as applied, violated their First Amendment rights.  ISKCON asserted that the Rule suppressed the practice of Sankirtan, a religious ritual that enjoins its members to go into public places to distribute or sell religious literature and to solicit donations for the support of the Krishna religion.  The trial court upheld the constitutionality of Rule 6.05, but the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed.
Held:  Rule 6.05, requiring members of ISKCON who desire to practice Sankirtan at the state fair to confine their distribution, sales, and solicitation activities to a fixed location, is a permissible restriction on the place and manner of communicating the views of the Krishna religion.  Pp.  452 U. S. 647-655.
(a) Rule 6.05 is not based upon the content or subject matter of speech, since it applies evenhandedly to all persons or organizations, 
Page 452 U. S. 641
 whether commercial or charitable, who wish to distribute and sell written materials or to solicit funds.  Nor is the Rule which involves a method of allocating space on a first-come, first-served basis -- open to the kind of arbitrary application that is inherently inconsistent with a valid time, place, and manner regulation as having the potential for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point of view.  Pp.  452 U. S. 648-649.
(b) The State's interest in maintaining the orderly movement of the crowd at the fair is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that a time, place, or manner restriction must serve a significant governmental interest.  The significance of that interest must be assessed in light of the characteristic nature and function of the particular forum involved.  Because the fairgrounds comprise a relatively small area where an enormous variety of goods, services, entertainment, and other matters of interest are exhibited to large crowds on a temporary basis, the State's interest in the orderly movement and control of such an assembly is a substantial consideration.  Pp.  452 U. S. 649-651.
(c) The justification for Rule 6.05 cannot be measured solely on the basis of the disorder that would result from granting members of ISKCON an exemption from the Rule.  Inclusion of peripatetic solicitation as part of a church ritual does not entitle church members to solicitation rights in a public forum superior to those of members of other religious groups that raise money but do not purport to ritualize the process.  And if Rule 6.05 is an invalid restriction on ISKCON's activities, it is no more valid with respect to other social, political, or charitable organizations seeking to distribute information, sell wares, or solicit funds at the fair.  Pp.  452 U. S. 651-654.
(d) Similarly, Rule 6.05 cannot be viewed as an unnecessary regulation on the ground that the State could avoid the threat to its interest posed by ISKCON by less restrictive means, such as penalizing disorder, limiting the number of solicitors, or imposing more narrowly drawn restrictions on the location and movement of ISKCON's representatives.  Since the inquiry must involve all other organizations that would be entitled to distribute, sell, or solicit if the booth rule may not be enforced with respect to ISKCON, it is improbable that such alternative means would deal adequately with the problems posed by the large number of distributors and solicitors that would be present on the fairgrounds.  P.  452 U. S. 654.
(e) Alternative forums for the expression of respondents' protected speech exist despite the effects of Rule 6.05.  The Rule does not prevent ISKCON from practicing Sankirtan anywhere outside the fairgrounds, nor does it exclude ISKCON from the fairgrounds.  Its members may mingle with the crowd and orally propagate their views, and ISKCON 
Page 452 U. S. 642
 may also arrange for a booth and distribute and sell literature and solicit funds from that location on the fairgrounds.  Pp.  452 U. S. 654-655.

No. 80-544
Argued April 21, 1981
Decided June 22, 1981
452 U.S. 666

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a company engaged in the business of providing housekeeping, cleaning, maintenance, and related services for commercial customers, had a contract to do maintenance work for a nursing home.  As a result of a dispute with the home over the size of the management fee, petitioner terminated the contract, and petitioner's employees who worked at the nursing home were discharged.  While the contract was still in effect, a labor union was certified as the bargaining representative for petitioner's employees at the nursing home.  The union, upon learning of petitioner's intention to discharge these employees, requested a delay from petitioner for the purpose of bargaining, but petitioner refused to bargain.  The union then filed an unfair labor practice charge against petitioner, alleging violation of its duty to bargain in good faith ""with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment"" under  8(d) and 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act.  The National Labor Relations Board upheld the charge and ordered petitioner, if it agreed to resume the nursing home operations, to reinstate the discharged employees or, if agreement was not reached, to offer the employees equivalent jobs at its other operations.  The Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order, holding that, while no per se rule could be formulated to govern an employer's decision to close part of its business,  8(d) creates a presumption in favor of mandatory bargaining over such a decision, which presumption is rebuttable by showing that the purposes of the NLRA would not be furthered by imposing a duty to bargain.
Held:  Although required to bargain about the effects of such a decision, petitioner had no duty to bargain over its decision to terminate the nursing home contract.  The facts of Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, 379 U. S. 203, distinguished.  Pp.  452 U. S. 674-688.
(a) In view of an employer's need for unencumbered decisionmaking in the conduct of its business, bargaining over management decisions that have a substantial impact on the continued availability of employment should be required only if the benefit, for labor-management relations 
Page 452 U. S. 667
 and the collective bargaining process, outweighs the burden placed on the conduct of the business.  Pp.  452 U. S. 674-680.
(b) The harm likely to be done to an employer's need to operate freely in deciding whether to shut down part of its business purely for economic reasons outweighs the incremental benefit that might be gained through the union's participation in making that decision.  The decision itself is not part of  8(d)'s ""terms and conditions of employment"" over which Congress has mandated bargaining.  Pp.  452 U. S. 680-686.

Syllabus 
When police officers executing a warrant to search a house for narcotics encountered respondent descending the front steps, they requested his assistance in gaining entry and detained him while they searched the premises.  After finding narcotics and ascertaining that respondent owned the house, the police arrested him, searched his person, and found heroin in his coat pocket.  Respondent, who was charged with possession of the heroin found on his person, moved to suppress the heroin as the product of an illegal search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The trial judge granted the motion and quashed the information, and both the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The initial detention of respondent, which constituted a ""seizure"" and was assumed to be unsupported by probable cause, did not violate his constitutional right to be secure against an unreasonable seizure of his person.  For Fourth Amendment purposes, a warrant to search for contraband founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.  Because it was lawful to require respondent to reenter and to remain in the house until evidence establishing probable cause to arrest him was found, his arrest and the search incident thereto were constitutionally permissible.

Held.  A provision of New York's Alcoholic Beverage Control Law prohibiting nude dancing in establishments licensed by the State to sell liquor for on-premises consumption is not unconstitutional as violating the First Amendment on the alleged ground that it prohibits nonobscene topless dancing, but instead is valid as being within the State's broad power under the Twenty-first Amendment to regulate the sale of liquor within its boundaries.  Cf. California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109.  The State's power to ban the sale of alcoholic beverages entirely includes the lesser power to ban the sale of liquor on premises where topless dancing occurs.  Whatever artistic or communicative value may attach to topless dancing is overcome by the State's exercise of its broad power under the Twenty-first Amendment.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 This case involves the scope and applicability of the Nonintercourse statute, first enacted in 1790 and now codified in 25 U.S.C. 177, which prohibits the sale of Indian land unless conveyed by a treaty approved by the Federal Government. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the terms of the Nonintercourse statute apply to all land throughout the United States. Because the decision below casts doubt on the title to land in millions of acres in the eastern part of the United States, I would grant the petition for certiorari. 
 In 1977, respondent brought suit to obtain possession of approximately 600 acres of land currently in the possession of the State of Connecticut. Respondent claimed that it owned this land from ""time immemorial"" and that the land was subsequently acquired from respondent without the approval of the United States, in violation of the Nonintercourse statute of 1790 and its successor statutes. The District Court denied petitioner's motion to dismiss, but certified the question for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1292(b). 
 The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 638 F.2d 612 ( 1980). Petitioner argued that the Nonintercourse 
Page 452 U.S. 968 , 969
 statute applies only to Indian land in ""Indian country,"" which would be primarily western lands as defined in the various Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts, and not to all Indian land. Petitioner also pointed to a provision in several of the Nonintercourse statutes which stated that nothing in the statute prohibited trade or intercourse with Indians living on land ""surrounded by settlements."" See id., at 618. It was petitioner's view that Indian land in Connecticut was exempt from the provisions of the Nonintercourse statute, since it was clearly ""surrounded by settlements."" The court observed: 
 ""In these suits, [petitioner] states have marshalled historical evidence which suggests that the eastern Indian tribes and their lands were always understood to be under the jurisdiction of the states. While these arguments have been held to be unavailing in a number of other contexts, such as whether the eastern tribes were properly considered 'tribes' under the protection of the federal government, and whether they were considered 'tribes' for purposes of sovereign immunity to suit, until this action, no court has had to address directly the issue of whether the Nonintercourse statute was intended to apply to land held by the eastern tribes. The State's argument is admittedly appealing in that it would explain why both the states and the federal government have ignored so completely what the Indians assert to be the dictates of the Nonintercourse statute."" Id., at 615 (footnotes and emphasis added). 
 Notwithstanding this concession, the Court of Appeals, after canvassing the history of the Indian statutes and relevant aspects of Indian land tenure, ultimately concluded that the Nonintercourse statute applied to all Indian land, whether or not it was in Indian country, and thus included the land claimed by respondents.

452 U.S. 458

Syllabus 
After several applications by respondent Dumschat, a life inmate in a Connecticut state prison, for commutation of his life sentence had been rejected by the Connecticut Board of Pardons without explanation, he sued the Board in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Board's failure to provide him with a written statement of reasons for denying commutation violated his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Relying chiefly on the fact that the Board had granted approximately three-fourths of all applications for commutation of life sentences, the District Court, after allowing other inmates (also respondents) to intervene and certifying the suit as a class action, held that all prisoners serving life sentences in Connecticut state prisons have a constitutionally protected ""entitlement"" to a statement of reasons why commutation is not granted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, and then, after its judgment had been vacated by this Court and the case had been remanded for reconsideration in light of Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U. S. 1, held that the overwhelming likelihood that Connecticut life inmates will be pardoned and released before they complete their minimum terms gave them a constitutionally protected liberty interest in pardon proceedings, and that, under Greenholtz, a statement of reasons for denying commutation was constitutionally necessary under the Due Process Clause.
Held:  The power vested in the Connecticut Board of Pardons to commute sentences conferred no rights on respondents beyond the right to seek commutation.  Pp.  452 U. S. 463-467.
(a) Far from supporting an ""entitlement,"" Greenholtz, which rejected the claim that a constitutional entitlement to release from a valid prison sentence exists independently of a right explicitly conferred by the State, compels the conclusion that an inmate has ""no constitutional or inherent right"" to commutation of his life sentence.  In terms of the Due Process Clause, a Connecticut felon's expectation that a lawfully imposed sentence will be commuted or that he will be pardoned is no 
Page 452 U. S. 459
 more substantial than an inmate's expectation, for example, that he will not be transferred to another prison; it is simply a unilateral hope.

(b) In contrast to the unique Nebraska parole statute which was applied in Greenholtz and which created a right to parole unless certain findings were made, the mere existence of a power to commute under the Connecticut commutation statute -- which imposes no limit on what procedure is to be followed, what evidence may be considered, or what criteria are to be applied by the Board of Pardons -- and the granting of commutation to many inmates, create no right or ""entitlement.""

Title 18 U.S.C.  5003(a) authorizes the Attorney General to contract with a state ""for the custody, care, subsistence, education, treatment, and training of persons convicted of criminal offenses in the courts of such State,"" when the Director of the United States Bureau of Prisons certifies that proper and adequate federal ""treatment facilities and personnel are available.""  Petitioner was convicted in a Vermont state court of first-degree murder arising out of the rape and strangulation of an elderly woman.  Since Vermont had previously closed its only maximum security prison, petitioner was assigned to a state prison having the capacity for short-term, but not long-term, incarceration of inmates with high security needs, and it was recommended, because of the nature of his offense ,that he be transferred to a federal prison.  A hearing was held before the Vermont Department of Corrections at which it was determined that petitioner was a high security risk, and, ultimately, under a contract between Vermont and the United States, petitioner was transferred to the federal prison system pursuant to  5003(a).  Subsequently, petitioner filed an action in Federal District Court, challenging his transfer on the ground that the federal officials lacked statutory authority to accept custody.  He claimed that  5003(a) requires federal authorities to make an individual determination that each state prisoner transferred to the federal system needs a particular specialized treatment program available in that system, and that no such determination had been made in his case.  The District Court denied petitioner's request for relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 5003(a) authorizes a transfer of a state prisoner to the federal system such as occurred in this case.  Pp.  452 U. S. 479-487.
(a) Section 5003(a)'s plain language authorizes contracts not simply for treatment, but also for custody, care, subsistence, education, and training of state prisoners in federal facilities.  The requirement for certification by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons is simply a housekeeping measure designed to ensure that the federal system has the capacity to absorb the state prisoners.  Nothing in  5003(a)'s language restricts or limits the use of federal prison facilities to those 
Page 452 U. S. 474
 state prisoners who are in need of some particular treatment.  Pp.  452 U. S. 480-482.
(b) Section 5003's legislative history reveals that it was enacted to deal with the simple and practical problem of permitting states to transfer their prisoners to federal custody in the same way that the Federal Government had, for some time, been placing prisoners in state custody pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  4002.  And nothing in the legislative history makes this case one of the ""rare and exceptional cases"" requiring a departure from the statute's plain language.  Pp.  452 U. S. 483-485.
(c) The contemporaneous and uniform construction of  5003(a) by the Bureau of Prisons, the agency that proposed its enactment and is charged with its administration, has been that the statute authorizes contracts based on a broad range of purposes, including such a transfer as is shown by the record in this case.  In the absence of any evidence of congressional objection, the agency's interpretation must be given great weight.  Pp.  452 U. S. 485-487.

Syllabus 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Act) requires the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), in promulgating occupational safety and health standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents, to set the standard ""which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence"" that no employee will suffer material impairment of health.  Section 3(8) of the Act defines the term ""occupational safety and health standard"" as meaning a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, ""reasonably necessary or appropriate"" to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.  Section 6(f) of the Act provides that the Secretary's determinations ""shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.""  The Secretary, acting through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), promulgated the so-called Cotton Dust Standard limiting occupational exposure to cotton dust (an airborne particle byproduct of the preparation and manufacture of cotton products), exposure to which induces byssinosis, a serious and potentially disabling respiratory disease known in its more severe manifestations as ""brown lung"" disease.  Estimates indicate that at least 35,000 employed and retired cotton mill workers, or 1 in 12, suffer from the most disabling form of byssinosis, and 100,000 employed and retired workers suffer from some form of the disease.  The Standard sets permissible exposure levels to cotton dust for the different operations in the cotton industry.  Implementation of the Standard depends primarily on a mix of engineering controls, such as installation of ventilation systems, and work practice controls, such as special floor-sweeping procedures.  During the 4-year interim period permitted for full compliance with the Standard, employers are required to provide respirators to employees and to transfer employees 
Page 452 U. S. 491
 unable to wear respirators to another position, if available, having a dust level that meets the Standard's permissible exposure limit, with no loss of earnings or other employment rights or benefits.  OSHA estimated the total industrywide cost of compliance as $656.5 million.  Petitioners, representing the cotton industry, challenged the validity of the Standard in the Court of Appeals, contending, inter alia, that the Act requires OSHA to demonstrate that the Standard reflects a reasonable relationship between the costs and benefits associated with the Standard, that OSHA's determination of the Standard's ""economic feasibility"" was not supported by substantial evidence, and that the wage guarantee requirement was beyond OSHA's authority.  The Court of Appeals upheld the Standard in all major respects.  It held that the Act did not require OSHA to compare costs and benefits; that Congress itself balanced the costs and benefits in its mandate to OSHA under  6(b)(5) to adopt the most protective feasible standard; and that OSHA's determination of economic feasibility was supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.  The court also held that OSHA had authority to require employers to guarantee employees' wage and employment benefits following transfer because of inability to wear a respirator.
Held:
1. Cost-benefit analysis by OSHA in promulgating a standard under 6(b)(5) is not required by the Act because feasibility analysis is.  Pp.  452 U. S. 506-522.
(a) The plain meaning of the word ""feasible"" is ""capable of being done,"" and, thus,  6(b)(5) directs the Secretary to issue the standard that most adequately assures that no employee will suffer material impairment of health, limited only by the extent to which this is ""capable of being done.""  In effect then, as the Court of Appeals held, Congress itself defined the basic relationship between costs and benefits by placing the ""benefit"" of the worker's health above all other considerations save those making attainment of this ""benefit"" unachievable.  Any standard based on a balancing of costs and benefits by the Secretary that strikes a different balance than that struck by Congress would be inconsistent with the command set forth in  6(b)(5).  Pp.  452 U. S. 508-512.
(b) Section 3(8), either alone or in tandem with  6(b)(5), does not incorporate a cost-benefit requirement for standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents.  Even if the phrase ""reasonably necessary or appropriate"" in  3(8) might be construed to contemplate some balancing of costs and benefits, Congress specifically chose in  6(b)(5) to impose separate and additional requirements for issuance of standards dealing with such materials and agents:  it required that those standards be issued to prevent material health impairment 
Page 452 U. S. 492
 to the extent feasible.  To interpret  3(8) as imposing an additional and overriding cost-benefit analysis requirement on the issuance of  6(b)(5) standards would eviscerate  6(b)(5)'s ""to the extent feasible"" requirement.  Pp.  452 U. S. 512-513.
(c) The Act's legislative history supports the conclusion that Congress itself, in  6(b)(5), balanced the costs and benefits.  There is no indication whatsoever that Congress intended OSHA to conduct its own cost-benefit analysis before promulgating a ""toxic material"" or ""harmful physical agent"" standard.  Rather, not only does the history confirm that Congress meant ""feasible,"" rather than ""cost-benefit,"" when it used the former term, but it also shows that Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment.  Pp.  452 U. S. 514-522.
2. Whether or not, in the first instance, this Court would find OSHA's findings supported by substantial evidence, it cannot be said that the Court of Appeals, on the basis of the whole record, ""misapprehended or grossly misapplied"" the substantial evidence test when it upheld such findings.  Pp.  452 U. S. 522-536.
3. Whether or not OSHA has the underlying authority to promulgate a wage guarantee requirement with respect to employees who are transferred to another position when they are unable to wear a respirator, OSHA failed to make the necessary determination or statement of reasons that this requirement was related to achievement of health and safety goals.  Pp.  452 U. S. 536-540.

Section 6(b)(5) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Act) requires the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), in promulgating occupational safety and health standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents, to set the standard ""which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence"" that no employee will suffer material impairment of health.  Section 3(8) of the Act defines the term ""occupational safety and health standard"" as meaning a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, ""reasonably necessary or appropriate"" to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.  Section 6(f) of the Act provides that the Secretary's determinations ""shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.""  The Secretary, acting through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), promulgated the so-called Cotton Dust Standard limiting occupational exposure to cotton dust (an airborne particle byproduct of the preparation and manufacture of cotton products), exposure to which induces byssinosis, a serious and potentially disabling respiratory disease known in its more severe manifestations as ""brown lung"" disease.  Estimates indicate that at least 35,000 employed and retired cotton mill workers, or 1 in 12, suffer from the most disabling form of byssinosis, and 100,000 employed and retired workers suffer from some form of the disease.  The Standard sets permissible exposure levels to cotton dust for the different operations in the cotton industry.  Implementation of the Standard depends primarily on a mix of engineering controls, such as installation of ventilation systems, and work practice controls, such as special floor-sweeping procedures.  During the 4-year interim period permitted for full compliance with the Standard, employers are required to provide respirators to employees and to transfer employees 
Page 452 U. S. 491
 unable to wear respirators to another position, if available, having a dust level that meets the Standard's permissible exposure limit, with no loss of earnings or other employment rights or benefits.  OSHA estimated the total industrywide cost of compliance as $656.5 million.  Petitioners, representing the cotton industry, challenged the validity of the Standard in the Court of Appeals, contending, inter alia, that the Act requires OSHA to demonstrate that the Standard reflects a reasonable relationship between the costs and benefits associated with the Standard, that OSHA's determination of the Standard's ""economic feasibility"" was not supported by substantial evidence, and that the wage guarantee requirement was beyond OSHA's authority.  The Court of Appeals upheld the Standard in all major respects.  It held that the Act did not require OSHA to compare costs and benefits; that Congress itself balanced the costs and benefits in its mandate to OSHA under  6(b)(5) to adopt the most protective feasible standard; and that OSHA's determination of economic feasibility was supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.  The court also held that OSHA had authority to require employers to guarantee employees' wage and employment benefits following transfer because of inability to wear a respirator.
Held:
1. Cost-benefit analysis by OSHA in promulgating a standard under 6(b)(5) is not required by the Act because feasibility analysis is.  Pp.  452 U. S. 506-522.
(a) The plain meaning of the word ""feasible"" is ""capable of being done,"" and, thus,  6(b)(5) directs the Secretary to issue the standard that most adequately assures that no employee will suffer material impairment of health, limited only by the extent to which this is ""capable of being done.""  In effect then, as the Court of Appeals held, Congress itself defined the basic relationship between costs and benefits by placing the ""benefit"" of the worker's health above all other considerations save those making attainment of this ""benefit"" unachievable.  Any standard based on a balancing of costs and benefits by the Secretary that strikes a different balance than that struck by Congress would be inconsistent with the command set forth in  6(b)(5).  Pp.  452 U. S. 508-512.
(b) Section 3(8), either alone or in tandem with  6(b)(5), does not incorporate a cost-benefit requirement for standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents.  Even if the phrase ""reasonably necessary or appropriate"" in  3(8) might be construed to contemplate some balancing of costs and benefits, Congress specifically chose in  6(b)(5) to impose separate and additional requirements for issuance of standards dealing with such materials and agents:  it required that those standards be issued to prevent material health impairment 
Page 452 U. S. 492
 to the extent feasible.  To interpret  3(8) as imposing an additional and overriding cost-benefit analysis requirement on the issuance of  6(b)(5) standards would eviscerate  6(b)(5)'s ""to the extent feasible"" requirement.  Pp.  452 U. S. 512-513.
(c) The Act's legislative history supports the conclusion that Congress itself, in  6(b)(5), balanced the costs and benefits.  There is no indication whatsoever that Congress intended OSHA to conduct its own cost-benefit analysis before promulgating a ""toxic material"" or ""harmful physical agent"" standard.  Rather, not only does the history confirm that Congress meant ""feasible,"" rather than ""cost-benefit,"" when it used the former term, but it also shows that Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment.  Pp.  452 U. S. 514-522.
2. Whether or not, in the first instance, this Court would find OSHA's findings supported by substantial evidence, it cannot be said that the Court of Appeals, on the basis of the whole record, ""misapprehended or grossly misapplied"" the substantial evidence test when it upheld such findings.  Pp.  452 U. S. 522-536.
3. Whether or not OSHA has the underlying authority to promulgate a wage guarantee requirement with respect to employees who are transferred to another position when they are unable to wear a respirator, OSHA failed to make the necessary determination or statement of reasons that this requirement was related to achievement of health and safety goals.  Pp.  452 U. S. 536-540.

Syllabus 
The Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 provides in 38 U.S.C.  2021(b)(3) that any employee of a private employer
""shall not be denied retention in employment or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces.""
Petitioner was an employee in respondent's refinery, which operated 24 hours a day, every day of the year, and whose employees worked five 8-hour days weekly but in a different 5-day sequence each week.  As a military reservist, petitioner had to attend training with his unit one weekend a month and for two weeks each summer.  On a number of weekends, petitioner was required to attend training on days when he was scheduled to work at the refinery, and, in most instances, he was unable to exchange shifts with other employees, as he was permitted to do.  Respondent provided him with leaves of absence to attend training, as required by 38 U.S.C.  2024(d), but it did not pay him for the hours he did not work, nor did it take steps to permit him to make up those hours by working outside the normal schedule.  Petitioner brought an action against respondent in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that respondent had violated  2021(b)(3).  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner on the ground that respondent, by not scheduling petitioner for a full 40-hour week on those occasions when he was unable to exchange shifts, had denied him ""an incident or advantage of employment"" within the meaning of  2021(b)(3), and awarded him an amount for wages lost on those ""work dates when an accommodation should have been made.""  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent had taken no discriminatory action proscribed by  2021(b)(3).
Held:  Section 2021(b)(3) does not require an employer to make work scheduling accommodations for employee reservists not made for other employees.  Pp.  452 U. S. 554-566.
(a) The legislative history indicates that  2021(b)(3) was enacted for the significant but limited purpose of protecting the employee reservist from discrimination like discharge and demotion motivated 
Page 452 U. S. 550
 solely by reserve status.  There is nothing in  2021(b)(3) or its legislative history to indicate that Congress even considered imposing an obligation on employers to provide a special work scheduling preference, but rather the history suggests that Congress did not intend employers to provide special benefits to employee reservists not generally made available to other employees.  Pp.  452 U. S. 554-562.
(b) While this case involves absences for weekend duty,  2021(b)(3) refers to ""any obligation as a member of a Reserve component.""  Accordingly, there is no principled way of distinguishing between an employer's obligation to make scheduling accommodations for weekends, as opposed to, for example, annual 2-week training periods, or even longer periods of training or duty.  There is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that Congress intended reservists to be entitled to all ""incidents and advantages of employment"" accorded during their absence to working employees, including regular time and overtime pay.  Pp.  452 U. S. 562-563.
(c) There is nothing in the statute or its history to support petitioner's contention that  2021(b)(3) only requires an employer under the circumstances of this case to make a ""reasonable accommodation"" to employee reservists.  Such a ""reasonable accommodation"" has already been made in  204(d) by requiring employers to grant a leave of absence to reservists whose duties force them to miss time at work.  To say that  2021(b)(3) would be of little significance unless a ""reasonable accommodation"" requirement is imposed ignores the fact that the nondiscrimination requirements of the section already impose substantial obligations on employers by precluding them from ridding themselves of the inconveniences and productivity losses resulting from employee reservists' absence by discharging or otherwise disadvantaging such employees solely because of their military obligations.  Pp.  452 U. S. 563-565.

Syllabus 
Chapter 96 of Title 18 of the United States Code, entitled Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), was added to Title 18 by the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970.  Title 18 U.S.C.  1962(c), which is part of RICO, makes it unlawful
""for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.""
The term ""enterprise"" is defined in 18 U.S.C.  1961(4) as including
""any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.""
An indictment charged respondent and others with, inter alia, a conspiracy to violate  1962(c).  The indictment described the enterprise in question as a group of individuals associated in fact for the purpose of engaging in certain specified criminal activities.  Respondent was convicted in Federal District Court, but the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that RICO was intended solely to protect legitimate business enterprises from infiltration by racketeers, and does not make it criminal to participate in an association which performs only illegal acts and has not infiltrated or attempted to infiltrate a legitimate enterprise.
Held:  The term ""enterprise,"" as used in RICO, encompasses both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises.  Pp.  452 U. S. 580-593.
(a) Neither the language nor structure of RICO limits its application to legitimate enterprises.  On its face, the definition of ""enterprise"" in  1961(4) appears to include both legitimate and illegitimate enterprises within its scope.  The section describes two separate categories of associations that come within the purview of an ""enterprise"" -- the first encompassing organizations such as corporations, partnerships, and other ""legal entities,"" and the second covering ""any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.""  The second category is not a more generalized description of the first, and hence the rule of ejusdem generis cannot be properly applied to hold 
Page 452 U. S. 577
 that the second category should be limited by the specific examples enumerated in the first.  Pp.  452 U. S. 580-582.
(b) With respect to  1962(c), an ""enterprise"" is not a ""pattern of racketeering activity,"" but is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.  In order to secure a conviction, the Government must prove both the existence of an ""enterprise"" and the connected ""pattern of racketeering activity.""  Pp.  452 U. S. 582-583.
(c) Applying RICO to illegitimate as well as legitimate enterprises does not render any portion of the statute superfluous, nor does it create any structural incongruities within the statute's framework.  On the contrary, insulating the wholly criminal enterprise from prosecution under RICO is the more incongruous position.  Pp.  452 U. S. 583-587.
(d) Nothing in RICO's legislative history requires a conclusion that the statute is limited in its application to legitimate enterprises.  In view of the purposes of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 to eradicate organized crime in the United States, it cannot be said that Congress nevertheless confined the reach of the law to only narrow aspects of organized crime, and, in particular, under RICO, to only the infiltration of legitimate business.

Syllabus 
Section 103(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 requires federal mine inspectors to inspect underground mines at least four times a year and surface mines at least twice a year to ensure compliance with health and safety standards, and to make followup inspections to determine whether previously discovered violations have been corrected.  The section also grants inspectors the right of entry to any coal or other mine and provides that no advance notice of an inspection need be given.  If a mine operator refuses to allow a warrantless inspection under  103(a), the Secretary of Labor is authorized to bring a civil action for injunctive or other relief.  When a federal inspector attempted a followup inspection of appellee company's stone quarries, appellee officer of the company refused to allow the inspection to continue.  Subsequently, the Secretary of Labor filed suit in Federal District Court seeking to enjoin the company from refusing to permit warrantless searches of its facility.  The District Court granted summary judgment for appellees on the ground that the Fourth Amendment prohibited the warrantless searches authorized by  103(a).
Held:  The warrantless inspections required by  103(a) do not violate the Fourth Amendment, but instead are reasonable within the meaning of that Amendment.  Pp.  452 U. S. 598-606.
(a) Unlike searches of private homes, which generally must be conducted pursuant to a warrant in order to be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, legislative schemes authorizing warrantless administrative searches of commercial property do not necessarily violate that Amendment.  A warrant may not be constitutionally required when Congress has reasonably determined that warrantless searches are necessary to further a regulatory scheme, and the federal regulatory presence is sufficiently comprehensive and defined that the owner of commercial property cannot help but be aware that his property will be subject to periodic inspections undertaken for specific purposes.  Pp.  452 U. S. 598-602.
(b) Here, in view of the substantial federal interest in improving the health and safety conditions in mines, and of Congress' awareness that the mining industry is among the most hazardous and that this industry's poor health and safety record has significant deleterious effects on 
Page 452 U. S. 595
 interstate commerce, Congress could reasonably determine that a system of warrantless inspections was necessary ""if the law is to be properly enforced and inspection made effective.""  United States v. Biswell, 406 U. S. 311,  406 U. S. 316.  Pp.  452 U. S. 602-603.
(c) Moreover, the statute's inspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application, provides a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.  Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., 436 U. S. 307, distinguished.  Pp.  452 U. S. 603-604.
(d) The fact that stone quarries, as opposed to underground mines, do not have a long tradition of Government regulation does not, in itself, mean that the warrantless inspection in question violated the Fourth Amendment.  It is the pervasiveness and regularity of federal regulation that ultimately determines whether a warrant is necessary to render an inspection program reasonable under that Amendment.  If the length of regulation were the only criterion, absurd results would occur which the Fourth Amendment's concept of reasonableness would not tolerate.  Pp.  452 U. S. 604-606.

(c) Moreover, the statute's inspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application, provides a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.  Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., 436 U. S. 307, distinguished.  Pp.  452 U. S. 603-604.
(d) The fact that stone quarries, as opposed to underground mines, do not have a long tradition of Government regulation does not, in itself, mean that the warrantless inspection in question violated the Fourth Amendment.  It is the pervasiveness and regularity of federal regulation that ultimately determines whether a warrant is necessary to render an inspection program reasonable under that Amendment.  If the length of regulation were the only criterion, absurd results would occur which the Fourth Amendment's concept of reasonableness would not tolerate.  Pp.  452 U. S. 604-606.

Syllabus 
A preenforcement challenge to the constitutionality of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (Act) was presented in a Federal District Court action wherein the plaintiffs were an association of coal producers engaged in surface coal mining operations in Virginia, some of its member coal companies, individual landowners, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and a town (hereinafter appellees).  The Act is designed to establish a nationwide program to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations.  The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) has primary responsibility for administering the Act by promulgating regulations and enforcing its provisions.  A two-stage program for the regulation of surface mining -- an interim phase and a permanent phase -- is established; and environmental protection performance standards are prescribed.  Ultimately, a regulatory program is to be adopted for each State, either by approval of a State's proposed permanent program that meets federal minimum standards or by adoption of a federal program for any State that chooses not to submit a program.  Enforcement of the permanent programs rests either with the participating State or with the Secretary as to nonparticipating States.  The District Court, although rejecting appellees' Commerce Clause, equal protection, and substantive due process challenges to the Act, held that the Act violates the Tenth Amendment, that various provisions of the Act effect an uncompensated taking of private property in violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and that some of the Act's enforcement provisions violate procedural due process requirements.
Held:  In the context of a facial challenge, the Act is constitutional.  Pp.  452 U. S. 275-305. 
Page 452 U. S. 265

(a) The Act does not violate the Commerce Clause as regulating the use of private lands, rather than the interstate commerce effects of surface coal mining.  In view of the legislative record, which includes extended hearings concerning the effects of surface mining on the Nation's environment and economy and the need for uniform minimum nationwide standards, it cannot be said that Congress did not have a rational basis for its findings, set out in the Act itself, that surface coal mining has substantial effects on interstate commerce.  And the Act's regulatory scheme is reasonably related to the goals Congress sought to accomplish -- the Act's restrictions on the practices of mine operators all serving to control the environmental and other adverse effects of surface coal mining.  Pp.  452 U. S. 275-283.
(b) Sections 515(d) and (e) of the Act, which prescribe performance standards on ""steep slopes,"" including a requirement that an operator return the site to its ""approximate original contour,"" and which authorize variances from the contour requirement, do not violate any Tenth Amendment limitation on congressional exercise of the commerce power as interfering with the States' ""traditional governmental function"" of regulating land use.  The steep-slope provisions govern only the activities of coal mine operators who are private individuals and businesses, and do not regulate the ""States as States.""  Cf. National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833.  Appellees' contentions that the threat of federal usurpation of their regulatory roles coerces the States into enforcing the Act, and that the Act regulates the States as States because it establishes mandatory minimum federal standards, are without merit, since the Tenth Amendment does not limit congressional power to preempt or displace state regulation of private activities affecting interstate commerce.  Moreover, Congress does not invade areas reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment simply because it exercises its authority under the Commerce Clause in a manner that displaces the States' exercise of their police powers.  Pp.  452 U. S. 283-293.
(c) The issue whether the Act's steep-slope provisions and  522(e), which prohibits mining in certain locations, violate the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not ripe for judicial resolution.  Because appellees' taking claim arose in the context of a facial challenge, it presented no concrete controversy concerning either application of the Act to particular surface mining operations or its effect on specific parcels of land.  And the ""mere enactment"" of the Act does not constitute a taking, since it does not deny an owner economically viable use of his land, the Act, except for  522(e), neither categorically prohibiting surface coal mining nor purporting to regulate alternative uses to which coal-bearing lands may be put.  Pp.  452 U. S. 293-297. 
Page 452 U. S. 266

(d) The provisions of  521, 525, and 526 of the Act pertaining to the Secretary's issuance of orders for immediate cessation of a surface mining operation determined to be in violation of the Act do not violate the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.  Summary administrative action resulting in deprivation of a significant property interest without a prior hearing is justified when, as here, it responds to situations in which swift action is necessary to protect the public health and safety.  The objective criteria for the issuance of immediate cessation orders, established by the Act, and the Secretary's implementing regulations, are specific enough to control governmental action and reduce the risk of erroneous deprivation, and mine operators are afforded a prompt and adequate postdeprivation administrative hearing and an opportunity for judicial review.  And the District Court erred in reducing to 24 hours the statutorily prescribed 5-day period for the Secretary's response to mine operators' requests for temporary relief from an immediate cessation order.  The record does not show that the Secretary has not responded or will not respond in less than five days, which is the statutory maximum, and appellees have not demonstrated that they have been adversely affected by the 5-day period in a particular case or that it is generally unreasonable.  In addition, no evidence was introduced to show that a shorter reply period is administratively feasible.  Pp.  452 U. S. 298-303.
(e) Appellees' due process challenge to the Act's provisions for the imposition of civil penalties for violations of cessation orders is premature.  Appellees did not allege that they, or any one of them, have had civil penalties assessed against them, and there was no finding that any of appellee coal mine operators have been affected or harmed by any of the statutory procedures for the assessment and collection of fines.  Pp.  452 U. S. 303-304.
483 F.Supp. 425, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

Syllabus 
This appeal involves a constitutional challenge to the so-called ""prime farmland"" provisions and certain general provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (Act).  The prime farmland provisions establish special requirements for surface coal mining operations conducted on land that both qualifies as prime farmland and has historically been used as cropland.  These provisions include  510(d)(1), which requires an applicant for a permit for mining on prime farmland to show that he has the capacity to restore the land, within a reasonable time after the completion of mining, to the productivity level of prime farmland in the surrounding area;  519(c)(2), which conditions release of a mine operator's bond on the completion of such restoration; and  508(a)(2), which directs mine operators to include information about the premining productivity of the land in the reclamation plans filed as part of permit applications.  The general provisions in question include  515(b)(3), which requires restoration of mined land to its approximate original contour;  515(b)(5), which requires surface mine operators to remove topsoil separately and preserve it for use during reclamation;  508, which requires applicants for surface mining permits to submit reclamation plans;  522(a), (c), and (d), which require States wishing to regulate surface mining to establish an administrative procedure for determining whether particular lands are unsuitable for surface mining;  522(e), which proscribes mining within a specified distance of roads, cemeteries, public buildings, schools, churches, public parks, or dwellings; and the Act's procedures for collecting civil penalties from violators of the Act, including a requirement that a contested penalty be paid into an escrow account pending review.  Appellees (the State of Indiana and several of its officials, the Indiana Coal Association, several coal mine operators, and others) filed suits in Federal District Court, alleging that the provisions in question contravene the Commerce Clause, the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, and the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The District Court sustained each of the constitutional 
Page 452 U. S. 315
 challenges and permanently enjoined enforcement of the challenged provisions.
Held:  The Act is not vulnerable to appellees' preenforcement constitutional challenge.  Pp.  452 U. S. 321-336.
(a) The provisions in question do not violate the Commerce Clause.  The Act was adopted to ensure that production of coal for interstate commerce would not be at the expense of agriculture, the environment, or public health and safety, and to protect mine operators in States adhering to high performance and reclamation standards from disadvantageous competition with operators in States with less rigorous regulatory programs.  The challenged provisions advance these legitimate goals, and Congress acted reasonably in adopting the regulatory scheme contained in the Act.  Pp.  452 U. S. 321-329.
(b) Nor do the challenged provisions contravene the Tenth Amendment.  Such provisions regulate only the activities of surface mine operators who are private individuals and businesses, and do not directly regulate the States as States.  P.  452 U. S. 330.
(c) The prime farmland and ""approximate original contour"" provisions do not violate the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.  Congress acted rationally in making no allowances for variances from the prime farmland requirements and in allowing variances from the approximate original contour only for steep slope and mountaintop operations.  The fact that a particular State has more mining operations under prime farmland and fewer steep slope or mountaintop operations than another State does not establish impermissible discrimination Under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. And, by invalidating the prime farmland and ""approximate original contour"" provisions under the rubric of ""substantive due process,"" the District Court essentially acted as a superlegislature, and accordingly exceeded its proper role.  Pp.  452 U. S. 331-333.
(d) Sections 510(d)(1), 519(c)(2), 508(a)(2), and 522(a), (c),( d), and (e) do not take private property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Appellees' taking claims do not focus on any particular properties to which the challenged provisions have been applied.  Similarly, the District Court's ruling did not pertain to the taking of a particular piece of property or the denial of a mining permit for specific farmland operations proposed by appellees.  The ""mere enactment"" of the Act did not effect an unconstitutional taking of private property.  The prime farmland provisions do not prohibit surface mining but merely regulate the conditions under which such mining may be conducted.  Pp.  452 U. S. 333-335.
(e) Appellees' challenge to the civil penalty provisions of the Act as 
Page 452 U. S. 316
 depriving mine operators of their right to due process is premature, where appellees have not shown that they were ever assessed civil penalties, much less that the statutory prepayment requirement was ever applied to them or caused them any injury.  Pp.  452 U. S. 335-336.

Syllabus 
Respondents, who were housed in the same cell in an Ohio maximum security prison, brought a class action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioner state officials, alleging that ""double celling"" violated the Constitution and seeking injunctive relief.  Despite its generally favorable findings of fact, the District Court concluded that the double celling was cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, as made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  This conclusion was based on five considerations:  (1) inmates at the prison were serving long-terms of imprisonment; (2) the prison housed 38% more inmates than its ""design capacity""; (3) the recommendation of several studies that each inmate have at least 555 square feet of living quarters, as opposed to the 63 square feet shared by the double celled inmates; (4) the suggestion that double celled inmates spend most of their time in their cells with their cellmates; and (5) the fact that double celling at the prison was not a temporary condition.  The Court of Appeals affirmed .
Held:  The double celling in question is not cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  452 U. S. 344-352.
(a) Conditions of confinement, as constituting the punishment at issue, must not involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain, nor may they be grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting imprisonment.  But conditions that cannot be said to be cruel and unusual under contemporary standards are not unconstitutional.  To the extent such conditions are restrictive and even harsh, they are part of the penalty that criminals pay for their offenses against society.  Pp.  452 U. S. 345-347.
(b) In view of the District Court's findings of fact, virtually every one of which tends to refute respondents' claim, its conclusion that double celling at the prison constituted cruel and unusual punishment is insupportable.  Pp.  452 U. S. 347-348.
(c) The five considerations on which the District Court relied are 
Page 452 U. S. 338
 insufficient to support its constitutional conclusion.  Such considerations properly are weighed by the legislature and prison administration, rather than by a court.  They fall far short, in themselves, of proving cruel and unusual punishment, absent evidence that double celling under the circumstances either inflicts unnecessary or wanton pain or is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting imprisonment.  Pp.  452 U. S. 348-350.
(d) In discharging their oversight responsibility to determine whether prison conditions amount to cruel and unusual punishment, courts cannot assume that state legislatures and prison officials are insensitive to the requirements of the Constitution or to the sociological problems of how best to achieve the goals of the penal function in the criminal justice system.  Pp.  452 U. S. 351-352.

This conclusion was based on five considerations:  (1) inmates at the prison were serving long-terms of imprisonment; (2) the prison housed 38% more inmates than its ""design capacity""; (3) the recommendation of several studies that each inmate have at least 555 square feet of living quarters, as opposed to the 63 square feet shared by the double celled inmates; (4) the suggestion that double celled inmates spend most of their time in their cells with their cellmates; and (5) the fact that double celling at the prison was not a temporary condition.  The Court of Appeals affirmed .
Held:  The double celling in question is not cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  452 U. S. 344-352.
(a) Conditions of confinement, as constituting the punishment at issue, must not involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain, nor may they be grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting imprisonment.  But conditions that cannot be said to be cruel and unusual under contemporary standards are not unconstitutional.  To the extent such conditions are restrictive and even harsh, they are part of the penalty that criminals pay for their offenses against society.  Pp.  452 U. S. 345-347.
(b) In view of the District Court's findings of fact, virtually every one of which tends to refute respondents' claim, its conclusion that double celling at the prison constituted cruel and unusual punishment is insupportable.  Pp.  452 U. S. 347-348.
(c) The five considerations on which the District Court relied are 
Page 452 U. S. 338
 insufficient to support its constitutional conclusion.  Such considerations properly are weighed by the legislature and prison administration, rather than by a court.  They fall far short, in themselves, of proving cruel and unusual punishment, absent evidence that double celling under the circumstances either inflicts unnecessary or wanton pain or is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime warranting imprisonment.  Pp.  452 U. S. 348-350.
(d) In discharging their oversight responsibility to determine whether prison conditions amount to cruel and unusual punishment, courts cannot assume that state legislatures and prison officials are insensitive to the requirements of the Constitution or to the sociological problems of how best to achieve the goals of the penal function in the criminal justice system.  Pp.  452 U. S. 351-352.

Blue Cross of Kansas City
No. 80-802
Argued April 29, 1981
Decided June 15, 1981
452 U.S. 378

Syllabus 
Prior to the completion of its construction, petitioner, a private, acute care community hospital in the Kansas City, Mo., metropolitan area, sought to enter into a participating hospital agreement with respondent Blue Cross of Kansas City (Blue Cross), a nonprofit provider of individual and group health care reimbursement plans in the area.  Blue Cross refused on the basis of its policy barring participation by any new hospital that could not show that it was meeting a clearly evident need for health care services in its service area.  Blue Cross relied on petitioner's failure to obtain approval for construction from the Mid-America Health Systems Agency (MAHSA), a private, nonprofit, federally funded corporation which was the local ""health system agency"" (HSA) designated for the area under the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974 (NHPRDA).  MAHSA's major function is health planning for the Kansas City metropolitan area.  Petitioner had not sought approval of its construction from MAHSA because of the latter's announced policy that it would not approve any addition of acute care beds in view of its determination that there was a surplus of hospital beds in the area.  Alleging a wrongful refusal to deal and a conspiracy between Blue Cross and MAHSA, which resulted in a competitive disadvantage to it, petitioner filed suit against respondents Blue Cross and the National Blue Cross Association for violation of the Sherman Act.  Respondents contended that the NHPRDA had impliedly repealed the antitrust laws as applied to the conduct in question.  The District Court granted judgment for respondents, finding a clear repugnancy between the NHPRDA and the antitrust laws, and congressional intent to repeal the antitrust laws in this context.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Although respondents may have acted with only the highest motives in seeking to implement the plans of the local HSA, they cannot defeat petitioner's antitrust claim by the assertion of immunity from the requirements of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  452 U. S. 388-393. 
Page 452 U. S. 379

(a) Implied antitrust immunity can be justified only by a convincing showing of clear repugnancy between the antitrust laws and the regulatory system.  Even when an industry is regulated substantially, this does not necessarily evidence an intent to repeal the antitrust laws with respect to every action taken within the industry.  And intent to repeal the antitrust laws is much clearer when a regulatory agency has been empowered to regulate the type of conduct under antitrust challenge.  Pp.  452 U. S. 388-389.
(b) The action challenged here was neither compelled nor approved by any governmental regulatory body.  Instead, it was a spontaneous response to the finding of only an advisory planning body, the local HSA which, under the NHPRDA, has no regulatory authority over health care providers.  And the application of the antitrust laws to the Blue Cross' conduct would not frustrate a particular provision of the NHPRDA or create a conflict with the orders of any regulatory body.  Nor does the NHPRDA require Blue Cross to take an action that, in essence, sought to enforce the advisory decision of MAHSA.  There Is no reason to believe that Congress specifically contemplated ""enforcement"" of advisory decisions of an HSA by private insurance providers, let alone relied on such actions to put ""teeth"" into the noncompulsory local planning process.  Pp.  452 U. S. 389-391.
(c) And NHPRDA is not so incompatible with antitrust concerns as to create a ""pervasive"" repeal of the antitrust laws as applied to every action taken in response to the health care planning process.  Respondents have failed to make the showing necessary for an exemption of all such actions.  Pp.  452 U. S. 391-393.

Syllabus 
Seven private antitrust actions (including separate actions by each of the respondents) were brought by plaintiffs seeking to represent classes of retail purchasers against petitioners, owners of various department stores, for alleged price fixing.  The actions were consolidated in Federal District Court, which dismissed them for failure to allege an ""injury"" to the plaintiffs' ""business or property"" within the meaning of the Clayton Act.

452 U.S. 412

Syllabus 
Under a Georgia statute, a parent who willfully and voluntarily abandons his or her dependent child is guilty of a misdemeanor, and those parents who commit that offense within Georgia and thereafter leave the State are guilty of a felony.  Appellee pleaded guilty in a Georgia state court to the felony of abandoning his child and leaving the State, thereby formally admitting that he had willfully and voluntarily abandoned his child, leaving her in a dependent condition, before he left the State.  Appellee received a prison sentence and, after exhausting state remedies, filed a petition for habeas corpus in Federal District Court.  He claimed that the Georgia statute, by providing for enhanced punishment for parents who left Georgia after abandoning their children, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV,  2, of the Constitution.   The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. The Georgia statute does not impermissibly infringe upon the constitutionally protected right to travel.  Appellee's guilty plea was an acknowledgment that he had committed a misdemeanor before he initially left Georgia, and his criminal conduct within Georgia necessarily qualified his right thereafter freely to travel interstate.  Although a simple penalty for leaving a State is impermissible, if departure aggravates the consequences of conduct that is otherwise punishable, the State may treat the entire sequence of events, from the initial offense to departure from the State, as more serious than its separate components.  Appellee has provided no basis for questioning the validity of the legislative judgment that the legitimate purpose of causing parents to support their children is served by making abandonment within the State followed by departure a more serious offense than mere abandonment within the State.  Pp.  452 U. S. 417-423.
2. Nor does the Georgia statute violate the Equal Protection Clause.  The portion of the statute at issue applies equally to all parents residing in Georgia, and appellee has not shown that it has been arbitrarily or discriminatorily applied.  It is not necessary to consider whether the State has available less restrictive means to serve the legitimate purposes 
Page 452 U. S. 413
 furthered by the felony provision of the statute.  The statute does not infringe upon appellee's fundamental rights, and, in this context, the State need not employ the least restrictive, or even the most effective or wisest, means to achieve its legitimate ends.  Similarly, it need not be determined whether the statute is unnecessarily broad on the ground that it does not require that the act of leaving the State -- as well as the act of abandonment -- be motivated by a wrongful intent.   This is a matter relating to the wisdom of the legislation, and it raises no question with respect to the uniform and impartial character of the State's law.  Pp.  452 U. S. 423-426.

 Andrew J. WINSTON, etc., et al. v. Joseph G. MOORE, JrNo. 80-1474 Supreme Court of the United States June 15, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice STEWART join, dissenting. 
 The respondent was charged with feloniously breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny, and was tried by the Circuit Court of the city of Richmond, Va., on March 10, 1980. At approximately 4:30 p.m., the presentation of evidence and arguments of counsel having been completed, the jury retired to deliberate. At approximately 6 p.m., the jury recessed for the evening. The next morning the trial court gave the jury its version of an ""Allen"" charge because it sensed that the jury was having difficulty reaching a verdict. The jury again began deliberating, but after a little less than an hour the foreman notified the trial court that the jury had not been able to reach a verdict. The court then excused the jury and declared a mistrial, all without objection from the respondent. At the same time, the court set the case down for retrial the following month, on April 16, 1980. 
 On April 15, 1980, the trial court denied respondent's motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that a retrial would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Respondent sought the same relief from the Supreme Court of Virginia, which was summarily denied on April 16, 1980. App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a. Respondent then filed a federal habeas petition in the Eastern District of Virginia, likewise seeking to enjoin a retrial. Respondent contended that the trial court erred when it declared a mistrial at the March 10, 1980, trial because there was an insufficient showing of ""manifest necessity,"" as required by this Court's ruling in United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579 ( 1824). On April 17, 1980, the District Court held a hearing, apparently on the basis of sworn allegations and responses, see App. to 
Page 452 U.S. 944 , 945
 Pet. for Cert. 6a, and issued a writ of habeas corpus directing that respondent ""shall be free from any further jeopardy on the charges set forth in the indictment against him set forth in the record in this case."" Id., at 8a. This determination was in turn affirmed on the basis of the "" reasons adequately stated by the district court"" by a divided Court of Appeals on December 18, 1980. 639 F.2d 781 (CA 4). 
 The reasoning of the District Court seems to have been that the jury had deliberated for a relatively short period of time: approximately 11/2 hours on March 10th, and approximately an hour the following day. The state judge, however, had given the jury his version of an ""Allen"" charge before they commenced deliberations on the second day, and the District Court in its findings of fact and conclusions of law stated that ""[t]here is, of course, no magic number of hours."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a. The second critical flaw which the federal habeas court found in the state- court proceedings was that the foreman of the jury had not specifically informed the judge that the jury was deadlocked, but instead simply stated "" the jurors have not been able to reach a verdict."" Thereafter, the trial judge failed to inquire of the jury as a whole. Ibid. The federal habeas judge explained: ""I think that such an inquiry by the court is required by the law, and in the absence of such an inquiry there is no record which would support a finding that a mistrial was manifestly necessary."" Id., at 8a. 
 Certainly the ""law"" upon which the federal habeas judge relied is not law which has emanated from this Court. We have recognized that the determination of ""manifest necessity"" is one which a trial court is uniquely capable of making, and said as much in United States v. Perez, supra :

Respondent sought the same relief from the Supreme Court of Virginia, which was summarily denied on April 16, 1980. App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a. Respondent then filed a federal habeas petition in the Eastern District of Virginia, likewise seeking to enjoin a retrial. Respondent contended that the trial court erred when it declared a mistrial at the March 10, 1980, trial because there was an insufficient showing of ""manifest necessity,"" as required by this Court's ruling in United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579 ( 1824). On April 17, 1980, the District Court held a hearing, apparently on the basis of sworn allegations and responses, see App. to 
Page 452 U.S. 944 , 945
 Pet. for Cert. 6a, and issued a writ of habeas corpus directing that respondent ""shall be free from any further jeopardy on the charges set forth in the indictment against him set forth in the record in this case."" Id., at 8a. This determination was in turn affirmed on the basis of the "" reasons adequately stated by the district court"" by a divided Court of Appeals on December 18, 1980. 639 F.2d 781 (CA 4). 
 The reasoning of the District Court seems to have been that the jury had deliberated for a relatively short period of time: approximately 11/2 hours on March 10th, and approximately an hour the following day. The state judge, however, had given the jury his version of an ""Allen"" charge before they commenced deliberations on the second day, and the District Court in its findings of fact and conclusions of law stated that ""[t]here is, of course, no magic number of hours."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a. The second critical flaw which the federal habeas court found in the state- court proceedings was that the foreman of the jury had not specifically informed the judge that the jury was deadlocked, but instead simply stated "" the jurors have not been able to reach a verdict."" Thereafter, the trial judge failed to inquire of the jury as a whole. Ibid. The federal habeas judge explained: ""I think that such an inquiry by the court is required by the law, and in the absence of such an inquiry there is no record which would support a finding that a mistrial was manifestly necessary."" Id., at 8a. 
 Certainly the ""law"" upon which the federal habeas judge relied is not law which has emanated from this Court. We have recognized that the determination of ""manifest necessity"" is one which a trial court is uniquely capable of making, and said as much in United States v. Perez, supra : "|

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Justice BLACKMUN and Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 I dissent from the denial of certiorari because the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois is directly contrary to Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U.S. 410 (1980), and other decisions of this Court. 
 Respondent drove her eastbound automobile over a highway dividing median, striking a westbound car head-on and killing two 13-year-old girls who were passengers in the westbound car. An Illinois State Police officer at the scene cited respondent for the traffic offense of crossing the median. [Footnote 1] In January 1976, she pleaded guilty to that offense and she was convicted and fined. 
 In May 1976, following an investigation of the collision, a state grand jury indicted respondent on two counts of reckless homicide. [Footnote 2] The State subsequently filed a bill of particulars indicating that in order to show that respondent's conduct leading up to the collision was reckless, it would

 prove that she drove too fast for conditions; failed to reduce speed to avoid an accident; failed to drive her vehicle in the proper lane of the roadway; failed to exercise due care for the safety of persons rightfully on the highway; improperly passed on the right; improperly passed on the left; and failed to wear corrective lenses as required by her driver's license. The State explained that it would use the fact that respondent had driven across the center line of the highway only ""in order to show the causal nexus between [respondent's] conduct prior to actually crossing the median strip and the death of the two victims."" 3 
 The trial court granted respondent's motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds, and the Appellate Court affirmed. The divided Supreme Court of Illinois also affirmed, reasoning that ""the State intends to use the factual basis which led to the first conviction as the basis for the second conviction."" 83 Ill.2d 440, 445, 47 Ill.Dec. 336, 338, 415 N.E.2d 341, 343 (1980). 
 Illinois v. Vitale, supra, involved strikingly similar facts. The respondent's automobile struck and killed two children; a police officer at the scene issued a traffic citation charging the respondent with failing to reduce speed to avoid an accident; the respondent was convicted and fined; the State then charged him with involuntary manslaughter under the statute involved in the present case.

 Supreme Court of the United States

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The motion of the respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting. 
 The question presented in this habeas corpus case is whether the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit correctly held that respondent's challenges to his conviction should be governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence rather than state criminal law. Because I believe that the Court of Appeals has confused the applicability of the Federal Rules of Evi- 
Page 452 U.S. 951 , 952
 dence with the permissible limits of its inquiry in a federal habeas proceeding, I dissent from the denial of the petition for certiorari. 
 During the course of respondent's criminal trial, one of the jurors received an anonymous telephone call that she considered threatening. She reported this call to the trial judge who conducted an in camera hearing and determined that she was capable of rendering an impartial verdict. In a post-conviction proceeding, respondent asserted that the juror subsequently told other jurors about this call, which constituted juror misconduct and introduced a prejudicial influence into the deliberations. The Public Defender, who had contacted 10 of the 12 jurors, testified that 8 jurors responded to questions regarding their knowledge of a telephone threat during the trial. The trial court refused to grant a mistrial based on these allegations. The Supreme Court of Indiana affirmed. Owen v. State, 269 Ind. 513, 381 N.E.2d 1235 (1978). It relied on Indiana state law which prohibits the interrogation of jurors for the purpose of impeaching a jury verdict. 
 Respondent then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. The District Court denied the writ, finding no constitutional error in the state-court ruling or procedure. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. 645 F.2d 74 (1980). It concluded that the Federal Rules of Evidence govern federal habeas proceedings, not Indiana law. Fed.Rule Evid. 1101(c). The evidentiary question is thus governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b), which permits a juror to testify as to whether prejudicial information was brought to bear on any juror, not the contrary Indiana law.* [452 U.S. 951 , 953]

 June 12, 1981. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, Circuit Justice. 
 Applicants request that I stay a judgment of the District Court for the Northern District of California pending a direct appeal of that judgment 503 F.Supp. 409, to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1252. On May 5, 1981, applicants filed a notice of appeal. 
 This case involves the constitutionality of the hearing procedures available under Part B of the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395j-1395w, 1395ff (1976 ed. and Supp.III). The Medicare Act is divided into two parts. Part A provides insurance for hospital and related post-hospital services. 42 U.S.C. (& Supp. III) 1395c; 1395d (1976 ed. and Supp. III). Part B provides a voluntary program of supplementary medical insurance covering, in general, 80% of the reasonable costs of 
Page 452 U.S. 1301 , 1302
 certain other services, primarily physicians services and medical supplies . 42 U.S.C. 1395k, 1395l (1976 ed. and Supp.III). The Secretary determines whether an individual is eligible to enroll in the Part B program, and the individual is entitled to an administrative hearing and judicial review of that eligibility determination. 42 U.S.C. 1395ff(a) and (b)(1)(B). As to the implementation of Part B, Congress authorized the Secretary to enter into contracts with private insurance carriers under which the carriers would determine and pay Part B benefits on a reimbursable basis. 42 U.S.C. 1395u. Under these contracts, the carriers receive advances of funds, which they then disburse to claimants in reimbursement for medical services found by the carriers to be covered by Part B. 1395u(c). If a claimant is dissatisfied with the reimbursement allowed by the private carrier, the claimant is entitled to a ""fair HEARING"" CONDUCTED BY THE PRIVATE CARRIER IF the amount of the claim is $100 or more. 1395u(b)(3)(C). The Act does not provide for an appeal to the Secretary of an adverse judgment by the carrier after a hearing. 
 Respondents, a class of Part B beneficiaries, brought suit challenging the constitutionality of that hearing procedure. In a decision rendered May 19, 1980, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California concluded that Congress' vesting of final decisionmaking authority in the carrier violates the claimant's due process rights because, in the court's view, hearing officers selected by the carrier may be biased and because hearings conducted by Administrative Law Judges employed by the Government may be more reliable. In relief, the District Court ordered that any Part B claimant whose claim was finally rejected after a full evidentiary hearing by the carrier's hearing officer on or after May 1, 1980, be given the opportunity for a de novo evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the Secretary. On May 1, 1981, the District Court denied the applicants' application for a stay of its order pending appeal. [452 U.S. 1301 , 1303]

No. 80-429
Argued March 23, 1981
Decided June 8, 1981
452 U.S. 161

Syllabus 
While Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate in his employment practices on the basis of sex, the last sentence of  703(h) of Title VII (Bennett Amendment) provides that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for any employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex in determining the amount of its employees' wages if such differentiation is ""authorized"" by the Equal Pay Act of 1963.  The latter Act, 29 U.S.C.  206(d), prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of sex by paying lower wages to employees of one sex than to employees of the other for performing equal work,
""except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex.""
Respondents, women who were employed as guards in the female section of petitioner county's jail until this section was closed, filed suit under Title VII for backpay and other relief, alleging, inter alia, that they had been paid lower wages than male guards in the male section of the jail and that part of this differential was attributable to intentional sex discrimination, since the county set the pay scale for female guards, but not for male guards, at a level lower than that warranted by its own survey of outside markets and the worth of the jobs.  The District Court rejected this claim, ruling as a matter of law that a sex-based wage discrimination claim cannot be brought under Title VII unless it would satisfy the equal work standard of the Equal Pay Act.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The Bennett Amendment does not restrict Title VII's prohibition of sex-based wage discrimination to claims for equal pay for ""equal work.""  Rather, claims for sex-based wage discrimination can also be brought under Title VII even though no member of the opposite sex holds an equal but higher paying job, provided that the challenged wage rate is not exempted under the Equal Pay Act's affirmative defenses as to wage differentials attributable to seniority, merit, quantity or quality of production, or any other factor other than sex.  Pp.  452 U. S. 167-181. 
Page 452 U. S. 162

(a) The language of the Bennett Amendment -- barring sex-based wage discrimination claims under Title VII where the pay differential is ""authorized"" by the Equal Pay Act -- suggests an intention to incorporate into Title VII only the affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act, not its prohibitory language requiring equal pay for equal work, which language does not ""authorize"" anything at all.  Nor does this construction of the Amendment render it superfluous.  Although the first three affirmative defenses are redundant of provisions elsewhere in  703(h) of Title VII, the Bennett Amendment guarantees a consistent interpretation of like provisions in both statutes.  More importantly, incorporation of the fourth affirmative defense could have significant consequences for Title VII litigation.  Pp.  452 U. S. 168-171.
(b) The Bennett Amendment's legislative background is fully consistent with this interpretation, and does not support an alternative ruling.  Pp.  452 U. S. 171-176.
(c) Although some of the earlier interpretations of the Bennett Amendment by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may have supported the view that no claim of sex discrimination in compensation may be brought under Title VII except where the Equal Pay Act's ""equal work"" standard is met, other Commission interpretations frequently adopted the opposite position.  And the Commission, in its capacity as amicus curiae, now supports respondents' position.  Pp.  452 U. S. 177-178.
(d) Interpretation of the Bennett Amendment as incorporating only the affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act draws additional support from the remedial purposes of the statutes, and interpretations of Title VII that deprive victims of discrimination of a remedy, without clear congressional mandate, must be avoided.  Pp.  452 U. S. 178-180.
(e) The contention that respondents' interpretation of the Bennett Amendment places the pay structure of virtually every employer and the entire economy at risk and subject to scrutiny by the federal courts is inapplicable here.  Respondents contend that the county evaluated the worth of their jobs and determined that they should be paid approximately 95% as much as the male officers; that it paid them only about 70% as much, while paying the male officers the full evaluated worth of their jobs; and that the failure of the county to pay respondents the full evaluated worth of their jobs can be proved to be attributable to intentional sex discrimination.  Thus, the suit does not require a court to make its own subjective assessment of the value of the jobs, or to attempt by statistical technique or other method to quantify the effect of sex discrimination on the wage rates.  Pp.  452 U. S. 180-181.

(b) The Bennett Amendment's legislative background is fully consistent with this interpretation, and does not support an alternative ruling.  Pp.  452 U. S. 171-176.
(c) Although some of the earlier interpretations of the Bennett Amendment by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may have supported the view that no claim of sex discrimination in compensation may be brought under Title VII except where the Equal Pay Act's ""equal work"" standard is met, other Commission interpretations frequently adopted the opposite position.  And the Commission, in its capacity as amicus curiae, now supports respondents' position.  Pp.  452 U. S. 177-178.
(d) Interpretation of the Bennett Amendment as incorporating only the affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act draws additional support from the remedial purposes of the statutes, and interpretations of Title VII that deprive victims of discrimination of a remedy, without clear congressional mandate, must be avoided.  Pp.  452 U. S. 178-180.
(e) The contention that respondents' interpretation of the Bennett Amendment places the pay structure of virtually every employer and the entire economy at risk and subject to scrutiny by the federal courts is inapplicable here.  Respondents contend that the county evaluated the worth of their jobs and determined that they should be paid approximately 95% as much as the male officers; that it paid them only about 70% as much, while paying the male officers the full evaluated worth of their jobs; and that the failure of the county to pay respondents the full evaluated worth of their jobs can be proved to be attributable to intentional sex discrimination.  Thus, the suit does not require a court to make its own subjective assessment of the value of the jobs, or to attempt by statistical technique or other method to quantify the effect of sex discrimination on the wage rates.  Pp.  452 U. S. 180-181.

Syllabus 
Section 128(a)(10) of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) provides that in connection with closed-end consumer credit transactions, the creditor must disclose
""any security interest held or to be retained or acquired by the creditor in connection with the extension of credit, and a clear identification of the property to which the security interest relates.""
Regulation Z of the Federal Reserve Board (Board), promulgated pursuant to the Board's authority under the TILA, essentially repeats the statute's disclosure requirement, defines ""security interest"" and ""security"" as ""any interest in property which secures payment or performance of an obligation,"" and sets forth a nonexhaustive list of interests included in the terms.  In 1977, respondents purchased an automobile from petitioner dealer under a retail installment contract that was assigned to petitioner Ford Motor Credit Co.  A provision on the face of the contract disclosed that the seller retained a security interest in the automobile, but did not refer to a provision on the back of the contract whereby the buyers, who were required to purchase physical damage insurance on the automobile protecting the interests of both the buyers and the seller, assigned to the seller any unearned insurance premiums that might be returned if the policy were canceled.  Before making any payments on the contract or the insurance policy, respondents returned the automobile to the dealer and filed suit in federal court, alleging that the contract violated the TILA for failure to disclose on its face that the seller had acquired a ""security interest"" in unearned insurance premiums, and seeking statutory damages, attorney's fees, and costs.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, holding that the assignment of unearned insurance premiums created a ""security interest"" within the meaning of  128(a)(10), and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Such an assignment of unearned insurance premiums does not create a ""security interest"" that must be disclosed pursuant to the TILA.  Pp.  452 U. S. 211-223.
(a) In a proposed official staff interpretation, the Board has expressly stated that Regulation Z does not require a creditor to disclose as a security interest its right to receive insurance proceeds or unearned premiums 
Page 452 U. S. 206
 from a property insurance policy.  Also the Board's revised Regulation Z, which was issued pursuant to the Truth in Lending Simplification and Reform Act of 1980, defines ""security interest"" as not including ""incidental interests"" such as interests in insurance proceeds or premium rebates.  This definition does not purport to change the original Regulation Z with respect to whether an incidental interest in unearned insurance premiums must be disclosed, and thus is persuasive authority as to whether such an interest should be disclosed as a ""security interest"" under the unrevised regulation.  Neither the original TILA nor the 1980 Act defines the term ""security interest,"" and the legislative history of the 1980 Act fully supports the Board's revised regulation and its proposed interpretation of the unrevised regulation.  Pp.  452 U. S. 211-219.
(b) Although neither the 1980 Act's legislative history nor the Board's construction of the term ""security interest"" conclusively establishes the meaning of these words in the TILA, the Board's regulation implementing this legislation, as well as its interpretation of its own regulation, should be accepted by the courts, since they are not repugnant to any provision in the TILA.  Cf. Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555.  The Board's position is supported by the legislative history of both the TILA and the 1980 Act, and is a permissible interpretation of the term ""security interest"" as used in the TILA.  Pp.  452 U.

Syllabus 
Section 161(a) of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), as added by the Fair Credit Billing Act, provides that, whenever a creditor sends an obligor a statement of the obligor's account ""in connection with an extension of consumer credit"" and the obligor believes that the statement contains a billing error, the obligor may send the creditor a written notice.  If such a notice is sent, the creditor then must acknowledge receipt of it, investigate the matter, and either correct the account or send a written explanation of its belief that the original statement was correct.  Section 103(h) of the TILA provides that the adjective ""consumer,"" used with reference to a credit transaction, characterizes the transaction as one in which the party to whom credit is offered or extended ""is a natural person"" and the money, property, or services which are the subject of the transaction are ""primarily for personal, family, household, or agricultural purposes.""  A corporation of which respondent is an officer applied to petitioner for a ""company account"" designed for business customers and asked petitioner to issue credit cards to respondent and other officers.  Respondent was required to sign a ""company account"" form, agreeing to be jointly and severally liable with the company for all charges incurred through use of the card issued to him.  Cards were issued on the company's credit rating.  A dispute arose between the company and petitioner with respect to charges for flight insurance for certain business trips made by company employees and for renewal of cards that the company claimed were no longer desired, and the company refused to pay the amount in dispute.  Company officers wrote to petitioner several times about this, but it does not appear that petitioner ever responded.  Subsequently, when respondent attempted to use his company card, he was informed that the account had been canceled because of delinquency in payment.  Respondent then filed an action in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that petitioner had canceled the account because of respondent's company's refusal to pay the disputed charges, and seeking damages for petitioner's failure to comply with  161(a).  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner, holding that  161(a) did

 not apply to an account opened in the name of a corporation in reliance on the corporation's credit.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Section 161(a) is not applicable to the dispute between these parties, and hence petitioner was not required to follow the procedures mandated by  161(a).  The threshold requirement of  161(a) -- an ""extension of consumer credit"" -- was not satisfied.  The company account was not covered by  103(h)'s definition of ""consumer,"" because it was opened primarily for business purposes, and not ""primarily for personal, family, household, or agricultural purposes.""  Similarly, the transactions giving rise to the billing dispute cannot be characterized as extensions of consumer credit, since they were business transactions.  Pp.  452 U. S. 240-246.

Petitioner, for its own convenience, provided meals and lodging to its employees working on offshore oil rigs.  Petitioner did not include the value of the meals and lodging in computing the employees' ""wages"" for the purpose of paying taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) or withholding the employees' federal income taxes.  Upon audit, the Internal Revenue Service included the value of the meals and lodging in the employees' ""wages"" for FICA and FUTA, but not for income tax withholding.  In doing so, the IRS acted consistently with Treasury Regulations that interpret the definition of ""wages"" in FICA and FUTA to include the value of such meals and lodging, whereas the substantially identical definition of ""wages"" in the income tax withholding provisions is interpreted by Treasury Regulations to exclude this value.  Petitioner paid the additional assessment for FICA and FUTA taxes and brought suit in Federal District Court for a refund.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the Government, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the different interpretations of the definition of ""wages"" was justified by the different purposes of FICA and FUTA, on the one hand, and income tax withholding, on the other.
Held:  The Treasury Regulations interpreting the definition of ""wages"" in FICA and FUTA to include the value of the meals and lodging are invalid, for they fail to implement the statutory definition in a consistent or reasonable manner.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 8, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 Respondent was an officer in a university police department. Over the objections of petitioners, his superiors, respondent desired to run for the office of County Sheriff. The chief of the local police force, Chief Brown, also desired to run for that office. Chief Brown was involved in an accident, and respondent approved an accident report which stated among other things that Brown had been drinking. The next morning petitioners, at the request of Chief Brown, had the accident report changed so as to read ""Not known if drinking."" Respondent objected to the modified accident report, and disclosed these events to his father, who in turn leaked the original and altered accident reports to the press. When petitioners learned of the leak, they fired respondent. Respondent subsequently filed suit alleging that he had been fired for engaging in protected First Amendment activity. 
 After a jury trial, respondent was awarded compensatory and punitive damages against both petitioners. Relying on the so-called Pickering defenses, see Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563 (1968), petitioners had sought to defend the discharge on the grounds that respondent by leaking confidential police material for his own political ends, had destroyed a harmonious working relationship with his superiors. Petitioners also contended that they were entitled to "" official immunity"" from damages, in that they had in good faith discharged respondent for violating the department's policy against disclosing confidential police investigative reports. See Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308 (1975); 
Page 452 U.S. 926 , 927
 Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232 (1974). The District Court, however, held that evidence of these defenses was inadmissible into evidence, and it declined to instruct the jury as to "" qualified or good-faith"" immunity. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. Williams v. Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, 629 F.2d 993. It first held that evidence of the confidentiality policy, which went directly to the issue of official immunity, could only be admitted if the policy 
 Although the court conceded that petitioners had shown enough evidence of the existence of a confidentiality policy to establish a jury question, the court held that the other factors were not present, namely, that the confidentiality policy conflicted with state regulations.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 8, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 Respondent was an officer in a university police department. Over the objections of petitioners, his superiors, respondent desired to run for the office of County Sheriff. The chief of the local police force, Chief Brown, also desired to run for that office. Chief Brown was involved in an accident, and respondent approved an accident report which stated among other things that Brown had been drinking. The next morning petitioners, at the request of Chief Brown, had the accident report changed so as to read ""Not known if drinking."" Respondent objected to the modified accident report, and disclosed these events to his father, who in turn leaked the original and altered accident reports to the press. When petitioners learned of the leak, they fired respondent. Respondent subsequently filed suit alleging that he had been fired for engaging in protected First Amendment activity. 
 After a jury trial, respondent was awarded compensatory and punitive damages against both petitioners. Relying on the so-called Pickering defenses, see Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563 (1968), petitioners had sought to defend the discharge on the grounds that respondent by leaking confidential police material for his own political ends, had destroyed a harmonious working relationship with his superiors. Petitioners also contended that they were entitled to "" official immunity"" from damages, in that they had in good faith discharged respondent for violating the department's policy against disclosing confidential police investigative reports. See Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308 (1975); 
Page 452 U.S. 926 , 927
 Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232 (1974). The District Court, however, held that evidence of these defenses was inadmissible into evidence, and it declined to instruct the jury as to "" qualified or good-faith"" immunity. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. Williams v. Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, 629 F.2d 993. It first held that evidence of the confidentiality policy, which went directly to the issue of official immunity, could only be admitted if the policy 
 Although the court conceded that petitioners had shown enough evidence of the existence of a confidentiality policy to establish a jury question, the court held that the other factors were not present, namely, that the confidentiality policy conflicted with state regulations. Because the evidence of the confidentiality policy was inadmissible, the court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a jury instruction as to the existence of ""good-faith"" immunity. 
 It seems to me that the Court of Appeals' six-prong ""test"" unjustifiably expands the principles announced in such cases as Wood and Scheuer. In those cases, we held that official immunity is available where there is evidence that the official has a subjective good-faith belief in the lawfulness of his action and where the action is not inconsistent with undisputed and settled law. Accordingly, I believe that the novel test announced by the Court of Appeals warrants review.

452 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
After appellee, while unmarried, gave birth to a female child, she identified appellant as the father to the Connecticut Department of Social Services, a requirement stemming from the child's receipt of public assistance.  The Department then provided an attorney for appellee to bring a paternity suit against appellant in a Connecticut state court.  Appellant moved the trial court to order blood grouping tests on appellee and her child pursuant to a Connecticut statute ( 46b-168), which includes the provision that the cost of such tests shall be chargeable against the party requesting them.  Asserting that he was indigent, appellant asked that the State be ordered to pay for the tests.  The trial court granted the motion insofar as it sought the tests, but denied the request that they be furnished at the State's expense, with the result that no tests were performed.  After a trial, the court found that appellant was the child's father, entered a damages judgment against him, and ordered him to pay child support directly to the State.  The Appellate Session of the Connecticut Superior Court affirmed, holding, inter alia, that  46b-168 does not violate the due process rights of an indigent defendant in  paternity proceeding.
Held:  In the circumstances of this case, application of  46b-168 to deny appellant blood grouping tests because of his lack of financial resources violated the due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  452 U. S. 5-17.
(a) Appellant's due process claim is premised on the unique quality 
Page 452 U. S. 2
 of blood grouping tests as a source of exculpatory evidence, the State's prominent role in the litigation, and the character of paternity suits under Connecticut law.  In evaluating that claim, the following factors must be considered:  the private interests at stake; the risk that the procedures used will lead to erroneous results, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and the governmental interests affected.  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319,  424 U. S. 335.  Pp.  452 U. S. 5-12.
(b) Assessment of these factors indicates that appellant did not receive the process he was constitutionally due.  The private interests implicated are substantial.  Given the usual absence of witnesses in a paternity suit, the self-interest coloring the litigants' testimony, Connecticut's onerous evidentiary rule that the reputed father's testimony alone is insufficient to overcome the mother's prima facie case, and the State's refusal to pay for blood grouping tests, the risk is not inconsiderable that an indigent defendant will be erroneously adjudged the father.  Furthermore, because of its recognized capacity to definitively exclude a high percentage of falsely accused putative fathers, the availability of scientific blood test evidence clearly would be a valuable procedural safeguard in such cases.  And the State's financial interest in avoiding the expenses of blood grouping tests is not significant enough to overcome the substantial private interests involved, particularly where federal funds are available to help defray such expenses and the State could advance such expenses and then tax them as costs to the parties.  Thus, without aid in obtaining blood test evidence in a paternity case, an indigent defendant, who faces the State as an adversary when the child is a recipient of public assistance and who must overcome the evidentiary burden Connecticut imposes, lacks ""a meaningful opportunity to be heard.""

No. 79-6423
Argued February 23, 1981
Decided June 1, 1981
452 U.S. 18

Syllabus 
In 1975, a North Carolina state court adjudicated petitioner's infant son to be a neglected child and transferred him to the custody of respondent Durham County Department of Social Services.  A year later, petitioner was convicted of second-degree murder, and she began a sentence of 25 to 40 years of imprisonment.  In 1978, respondent petitioned the court to terminate petitioner's parental rights.  Petitioner was brought from prison to the hearing on the petition, and the court, after determining, sua sponte, that she had been given ample opportunity to obtain counsel and that her failure to do so was without just cause, did not postpone the proceedings.  Petitioner did not aver that she was indigent, and the court did not appoint counsel for her.  At the hearing, petitioner cross-examined a social worker from respondent, and both petitioner and her mother testified under the court's questioning.  The court thereafter terminated petitioner's parental status, finding that she had not contacted respondent about her child since December, 1975, and that she had ""wilfully failed to maintain concern or responsibility for the welfare of the minor.""  The North Carolina Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's sole contention on appeal that, because she was indigent, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required the State to provide counsel for her.  The North Carolina Supreme Court summarily denied discretionary review.
Held:
1. The Constitution does not require the appointment of counsel for indigent parents in every parental status termination proceeding.  The decision whether due process calls for the appointment of counsel is to be answered in the first instance by the trial court, subject to appellate review.  Pp.  452 U. S. 232.
(a) With regard to what the ""fundamental fairness"" requirement of the Due Process Clause means concerning the right to appointed counsel, there is a presumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed counsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his physical liberty.  The other elements of the due process decision -- the private interest at stake, the government's interest, and the risk that the procedures used will lead to erroneous decisions, Mathews v. 
Page 452 U. S. 19
 Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319,  424 U. S. 335 -- must be balanced against each other and then weighed against the presumption.  Pp.  452 U. S. 25-27.
(b) The parent's interest in the accuracy and justice of the decision to terminate parental status is an extremely important one (and may be supplemented by the dangers of criminal liability inherent in some termination proceedings); the State shares with the parent an interest in a correct decision, has a relatively weak pecuniary interest in avoiding the expense of appointed counsel and the cost of the lengthened proceedings his presence may cause, and, in some but not all cases, has a possibly stronger interest in informal procedures; and the complexity of the proceeding and the incapacity of the uncounseled parent could be, but would not always be, great enough to make the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the parent's rights insupportably high.  Thus if, in a given case, the parent's interests were at their strongest, the State's interests were at their weakest, and the risks of error were at their peak, the Eldridge factors would overcome the presumption against the right to appointed counsel, and due process would require appointment of counsel.  Pp.  452 U. S. 27-32.
2. In the circumstances of this case, the trial judge did not deny petitioner due process of law when he did not appoint counsel for her.  The record shows, inter alia, that the petition to terminate petitioner's parental rights contained no allegations of neglect or abuse upon which criminal charges could be based; no expert witnesses testified; the case presented no specially troublesome points of law; the presence of counsel could not have made a determinative difference for petitioner; she had expressly declined to appear at the 1975 child custody hearing; and the trial court found that her failure to make an effort to contest the termination proceeding was without cause.

Syllabus 
Appellants operate an adult bookstore in the commercial zone of appellee borough, and the store contains licensed coin-operated devices that display adult films.  When appellants added a coin-operated mechanism permitting a customer to watch a usually nude live dancer, complaints were filed against them charging that the exhibition of live dancing violated an ordinance that restricted uses permitted in a commercial zone, and they were convicted.  Rejecting appellants' defense based on the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the trial court, while recognizing that live nude dancing is protected by the First Amendment, held that First Amendment guarantees were not involved, since the case involved solely a zoning ordinance under which live entertainment, whether a nude dance or some other form of live presentation, was not a permitted use in any establishment in the borough.  The Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court affirmed, and the New Jersey Supreme Court denied further review.
Held:  Appellants' convictions are invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, for appellee failed to justify the exclusion of live entertainment from the broad range of commercial uses permitted in the borough.  Pp.  452 U. S. 65-77.
(a) The ordinance in question, as construed by the New Jersey courts to exclude live entertainment, including nude dancing, throughout the borough, prohibits a wide range of expression that has long been held to be within the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  An entertainment program may not be prohibited solely because it displays a nude human figure, and nude dancing is not without its First Amendment protection from official regulation.  Pp.  452 U. S. 65-66.
(b) The First Amendment requires sufficient justification for the exclusion of a broad category of protected expression from the permitted commercial uses, and none of appellee's asserted justifications withstands scrutiny.  Its asserted justification that permitting live entertainment would conflict with its plan to create a commercial area catering only to the residents' ""immediate needs"" is patently insufficient.  As to its asserted justification that live entertainment may be selectively excluded from the permitted commercial uses to avoid problems associated with live entertainment, such as parking, trash, police protection, 
Page 452 U. S. 62
 and medical facilities, appellee has presented no evidence that live entertainment poses problems of this nature more significant than those associated with various permitted uses, or that its interests could not be met by restrictions that are less intrusive on protected forms of expression.  And as to the claimed justification that the ordinance in question is a reasonable ""time, place, and manner"" restriction, appellee does not identify its interests making it reasonable to exclude all live entertainment but to allow a variety of other commercial uses, and has presented no evidence that live entertainment is incompatible with the permitted uses.

|452 u.s. 89|"Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard
No. 80-441
Argued March 30, 1981
Decided June 1, 1981
452 U.S. 89

Syllabus 
Petitioner Gulf Oil Co. and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission entered into a conciliation agreement involving alleged discrimination against black and female employees at one of Gulf's refineries.  Under this agreement, Gulf undertook to offer backpay to alleged victims of discrimination and began to send notices to employees eligible for backpay, stating the amount available in return for execution of a full release of all discrimination claims.  Respondents then filed a class action in Federal District Court against Gulf and petitioner labor union, on behalf of all black present and former employees and rejected applicants for employment, alleging racial discrimination in employment and seeking injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief.  Gulf then filed a motion seeking an order limiting communications from the named plaintiffs (respondents) and their counsel to class members.  Ultimately, over respondents' objections, the District Court issued an order, based on the form of order in the Manual for Complex Litigation, imposing a complete ban on all communications concerning the class action between parties or their counsel and any actual or potential class member who was not a formal party, without the court's prior approval.  The order stated that, if any party or counsel asserted a constitutional right to communicate without prior restraint and did so communicate, he must file a copy of the communication with the court.  The court made no findings of fact, and did not write an explanatory opinion.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the order limiting communications was an unconstitutional prior restraint on expression accorded First Amendment protection.
Held:  The District Court in imposing the order in question abused its discretion under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Pp.  452 U. S. 99-104.
(a) The order is inconsistent with the general policies embodied in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which governs class actions in federal district courts.  It interfered with respondents' efforts to inform potential class members of the existence of the lawsuit, and may have been particularly injurious -- not only to respondents but to the class as a whole -- because employees at that time were being pressed to decide whether to accept Gulf's backpay offers.  In addition, the order made 
Page 452 U. S. 90
 it more difficult for respondents to obtain information about the merits of the case from the persons they sought to represent.  Pp.  452 U. S. 99-101.

			"|"Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard
No. 80-441
Argued March 30, 1981
Decided June 1, 1981
452 U.S. 89

Syllabus 
Petitioner Gulf Oil Co. and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission entered into a conciliation agreement involving alleged discrimination against black and female employees at one of Gulf's refineries.  Under this agreement, Gulf undertook to offer backpay to alleged victims of discrimination and began to send notices to employees eligible for backpay, stating the amount available in return for execution of a full release of all discrimination claims.  Respondents then filed a class action in Federal District Court against Gulf and petitioner labor union, on behalf of all black present and former employees and rejected applicants for employment, alleging racial discrimination in employment and seeking injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief.  Gulf then filed a motion seeking an order limiting communications from the named plaintiffs (respondents) and their counsel to class members.  Ultimately, over respondents' objections, the District Court issued an order, based on the form of order in the Manual for Complex Litigation, imposing a complete ban on all communications concerning the class action between parties or their counsel and any actual or potential class member who was not a formal party, without the court's prior approval.  The order stated that, if any party or counsel asserted a constitutional right to communicate without prior restraint and did so communicate, he must file a copy of the communication with the court.  The court made no findings of fact, and did not write an explanatory opinion.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the order limiting communications was an unconstitutional prior restraint on expression accorded First Amendment protection.
Held:  The District Court in imposing the order in question abused its discretion under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Pp.  452 U. S. 99-104.
(a) The order is inconsistent with the general policies embodied in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which governs class actions in federal district courts.  It interfered with respondents' efforts to inform potential class members of the existence of the lawsuit, and may have been particularly injurious -- not only to respondents but to the class as a whole -- because employees at that time were being pressed to decide whether to accept Gulf's backpay offers.  In addition, the order made 
Page 452 U. S. 90
 it more difficult for respondents to obtain information about the merits of the case from the persons they sought to represent.  Pp.  452 U. S. 99-101.
(b) Because of these potential problems, such an order should be based on a clear record and specific findings reflecting a weighing of the need for a limitation and the potential interference with the parties' rights.  Only such a determination can ensure that the court is furthering, rather than hindering, the policies embodied in the Federal Rules, especially Rule 23.  Moreover, such a weighing should result in a carefully drawn order that limits speech as little as possible, consistent with the parties' rights.  Pp.  452 U. S. 101-102.

No. 79-1213
Argued December 2, 1980
Decided June 1, 1981
452 U.S. 105

Syllabus 
Petitioners, two white male correctional officers employed by the California Department of Corrections and an organization representing correctional officers and some other Department employees, filed suit in California state court against respondents, the Department and various state officers, alleging that the Department's affirmative action plan unlawfully discriminated against white males and that the individual petitioners had been denied promotions because of race.  On the basis of the California Supreme Court's decision in Bakke v. University of California Regents, 18 Cal.3d 34, 553 P.2d 1152, the trial court enjoined respondents from giving any preference on the basis of race or sex in hiring or promoting any employee, but allowed the use of race or sex as a factor in making job assignments.  On respondents' appeal, the California Court of Appeal reversed, holding that the trial court's rationale was no longer tenable in view of this Court's intervening decision in University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265.  However, the Court of Appeal did not unequivocally direct that judgment be entered for respondents, but left certain questions open for ""examination if the case is to be retried.""
Held:  This Court's writ of certiorari, granted to review the merits of the Court of Appeal's decision, is dismissed.  Because of significant developments in the law and because of significant ambiguities in the record concerning both the extent to which race or sex has been used as a factor in making promotions and the justification for such use, the constitutional issues should not be addressed until the trial court's proceedings are finally concluded and the state appellate courts have completed their review of the trial court record.

No. 80-180
Argued March 2, 1981
Decided June 1, 1981
452 U.S. 130

Syllabus 
After holding that the apportionment plan for precincts from which county commissioners were elected to serve on the Commissioners Court for Kleberg County, Tex., was unconstitutional because of substantial population variances in the precincts, the District Court directed county officials to submit a proposed reapportionment plan to the court.  The Commissioners Court then employed an expert to prepare a new plan and subsequently adopted his plan and submitted it to the District Court.  The court approved the plan and authorized the Commissioners Court to conduct 1980 primary and general elections under it, rejecting respondents' contention that  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Act) required the county, a jurisdiction covered by the Act, to obtain preclearance from either the Attorney General of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia before the plan could become effective.  The Court of Appeals vacated the District Court's order, holding that
""[a] proposed reapportionment plan submitted by a local legislative body does not lose its status as a legislative, rather than court-ordered, plan merely because it is the product of litigation conducted in a federal forum,""
and that the Act required preclearance.
Held:  Congress intended to require compliance with the statutory preclearance procedures under the circumstances of this case.  Whenever a covered jurisdiction submits a proposal reflecting the policy choices of the elected representatives of the people -- no matter what constraints have limited the choices available to them -- the preclearance requirement of the Act is applicable.  Pp.  452 U. S. 137-153.
(a) The statement in East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall, 424 U. S. 636 -- which held that a court-adopted reapportionment plan suggested by the local legislative body there involved was a judicial plan for purposes of substantive review -- that the plan was also a judicial plan for purposes of  5 preclearance was dictum, and does not control this case.  Pp.  452 U. S. 139-146.
(b) The language of  5 does not unambiguously answer the question, but the legislative history of the 1975 amendments of the Act shows that it was intended that the statutory protections are to be available even

Petitioner and respondents manufacture and sell ready-mix concrete.  A purchaser of concrete from petitioner filed a civil action against petitioner in Federal District Court, alleging that petitioner and certain unnamed firms had conspired to raise concrete prices in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act, and seeking treble damages under  4 of the Clayton Act.  After learning through discovery that respondents were the alleged coconspirators, petitioner filed a third-party complaint against them, seeking contribution should it be held liable in the original action.  The District Court dismissed the third-party complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, holding that federal law does not allow an antitrust defendant to recover in contribution from alleged coconspirators.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  There is no basis in federal statutory or common law for allowing federal courts to fashion the right to contribution urged by petitioner.  Pp.  451 U. S. 634-647.
(a) Congress neither expressly nor implicitly intended to create such a right to contribution.  Nothing in the Sherman and Clayton Acts or in their legislative history refers to contribution, and there is nothing to indicate any congressional concern with softening the blow on joint wrongdoers.  Rather, the very idea of treble damages reveals an intent to punish past, and deter future, unlawful conduct, not to ameliorate the liability of joint wrongdoers.  Pp.  451 U. S. 639-640.
(b) The federal courts are not empowered to fashion a federal common law rule of contribution among antitrust wrongdoers.  Contribution does not implicate ""uniquely federal interests"" of the kind that oblige courts to formulate federal common law.  Moreover, even though Congress may have intended to allow federal courts to develop governing principles of law in the common law tradition with regard to substantive violations of the Sherman Act, it does not follow that Congress intended to give courts as wide discretion in formulating remedies to enforce the Act or the kind of relief sought through contribution.

Syllabus 
California, in addition to imposing a premiums tax on both foreign and domestic insurance companies doing business in the State, imposes a ""retaliatory"" tax on such a foreign insurer when the insurer's State of incorporation imposes higher taxes on California insurers doing business in that State than California would otherwise impose on that State's insurers doing business in California.  Appellant, an Ohio insurer doing business in California, after unsuccessfully filing administrative refund claims for California retaliatory taxes paid, brought a refund suit in California Superior Court, alleging that the retaliatory tax violates the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Superior Court ruled the tax unconstitutional, but the California Court of Appeal reversed.
Held:
1. The retaliatory tax does not violate the Commerce Clause.  The McCarran-Ferguson Act, which leaves the regulation and taxation of insurance companies to the States, removes entirely any Commerce Clause restriction upon California's power to tax the insurance business.  Neither the language nor the history of that Act suggests that it does not permit, as appellant argues, ""anticompetitive state taxation that discriminates against out-of-state insurers.""  Pp.  451 U. S. 652-655.
2. Nor does the retaliatory tax violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  451 U. S. 655-674.
(a) Whatever the extent of a State's authority to exclude foreign corporations from doing business within the State, that authority does not justify imposition of more onerous taxes or other burdens on foreign corporations than those imposed on domestic corporations, unless the discrimination between foreign and domestic corporations bears a rational relation to a legitimate state purpose.  Pp.  451 U. S. 655-668.
(b) The purpose of the retaliatory tax, to promote the interstate business of California insurers by deterring other States from imposing discriminatory or excessive taxes on California insurers, is a legitimate state purpose.  And the California Legislature rationally could have 
Page 451 U. S. 649
 believed that the retaliatory tax would promote that purpose, it being immaterial whether, in fact, the tax will accomplish its objectives.  Assuming that the lawmakers of each State are motivated in part by a desire to promote the interests of their domestic insurance industry, it is reasonable to suppose that California's retaliatory tax will induce other States to lower the burdens on California insurers in order to spare their domestic insurers the cost of the retaliatory tax in California.

Syllabus 
After being discharged for violation of his employer's plant rule prohibiting defined misbehavior, an employee, pursuant to the grievance and arbitration procedure mandated by the collective bargaining agreement between the employer and respondent union, asked his union representative to file a grievance on his behalf on the ground that his dismissal was not for just cause.  The union pursued the grievance through the third step of the grievance procedure and requested arbitration, but it then withdrew the request.  The union constitution required union members aggrieved by any action of the union to exhaust the internal union appeals procedures before seeking redress from a court.  The employee, however, instead of filing an appeal from the union's decision not to seek arbitration of his grievance, filed an action in Federal District Court under  301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, alleging that the union had breached its duty of fair representation, and that the employer had breached the collective bargaining agreement by discharging him without just cause.  He sought reinstatement from the employer and monetary relief from both the employer and the union.  The District Court sustained the union and the employer's affirmative defense that the employee had failed to exhaust the internal union appeals procedures, and accordingly dismissed the suit against both the union and the employer.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the suit against the union, but reversed the dismissal against the employer.  The court held that the employee's failure to exhaust was fatal to his claim against the union because, by filing an internal appeal, he might have received money damages, the relief he sought in his  301 suit against the union.  But the court held that the employee's failure to exhaust did not bar his suit against the employer, because the internal appeals procedures 
Page 451 U. S. 680
 could not result in either reinstatement of his job, the relief sought from the employer under  301(a), or reactivation of his grievance.
Held:  Where the internal union appeals procedures could not reactivate the employee's grievance or grant him the complete relief he sought under  301(a), he should not have been required to exhaust such procedures prior to bringing suit against the union and the employer under  301(a).  Pp.  451 U. S. 685-696.
(a) Because internal union appeals procedures, in contrast to contractual grievance and arbitration procedures negotiated by the parties to a collective bargaining agreement, are created by the union constitution and are designed to settle disputes between an employee and his union arising under the constitution, the policies encouraging private resolution of grievances arising out of the collective bargaining process are not directly applicable to the issue whether to require exhaustion of internal union procedures.  Republic Steel Corp. v. Maddox, 379 U. S. 650, distinguished.  Such policies are furthered by an exhaustion requirement only where the internal procedures can either grant the aggrieved employee full relief or reactivate his grievance.  Pp.  451 U. S. 685-689.
(b) If the internal procedures are inadequate to effect the relief sought by the employee, his failure to exhaust should be excused, and he should be permitted to pursue his claim for breach of the duty of fair representation and breach of the collective bargaining agreement in court under  301.  Here, although it appears that some monetary relief could be obtained through the internal procedures, it also appears that the union could neither reinstate the employee in his job nor reactivate his grievance because of certain time restrictions in the collective bargaining agreement for obtaining arbitration of a grievance.  These restrictions on the relief available through the internal procedures rendered such procedures inadequate.  The policy underlying  301 to effect a relatively rapid disposition of labor disputes would be undermined by an exhaustion requirement unless the internal procedures are capable of either reactivating the employee's grievance or of redressing it.  Pp.  451 U. S. 689-693.
(c) Although the argument that exhaustion of internal procedures should be required might have force if the employee's  301 suit is only against the union and the internal procedures are adequate to grant the relief sought against the union, the defense should not be available where, as here, the employee sued both the union and the employer.  If a trial court required exhaustion of the internal procedures with respect to the suit against the union but not against the employer, it would be faced with the undesirable alternatives of either staying the suit against the employer pending such exhaustion, thus 
Page 451 U. S. 681
 violating national labor policy, or of permitting the suit against the employer to proceed and tolling the statute of limitations against the union pending exhaustion, with the possible result that the court would find itself with two separate  301 suits based on the same facts proceeding at different paces in its courtroom.

Syllabus 
Respondent union, which represents most of the stage actors and actresses in the United States, has entered into collective bargaining agreements with virtually all major theatrical producers throughout the country, fixing minimum (scale) wages and other conditions of employment for those represented by the union.  Because of abuses by theatrical agents who, as independent contractors, negotiated employment contracts for actors and actresses with producers, particularly abuses as to the extraction of high commissions tending to undermine collectively bargained rates of compensation, the union, in 1928, unilaterally established a licensing system for the regulation of agents, prohibiting union members from using an agent who has not obtained a license from the union.  The essential elements of the licensing system have remained unchanged.  To obtain a license, an agent must agree to comply with union regulations which, inter alia, prohibit agent commissions on scale portions of wages received by an actor or an actress from a producer, limit commissions on wages in excess of scale pay, and require payment to the union of franchise fees.  Petitioners, agents who refused to obtain union licenses, instituted this action, contending that the union's regulations violated  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  After trial, the District Court dismissed the complaint, finding that the union's agency franchise system was protected from liability by the antitrust exemptions of unions and their members arising under the Clayton Act and the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, determining that the central feature of the union's franchising system -- the exaction of an agreement by agents as to their commissions -- was immune from antitrust challenge.  The court suggested that, if the exactions of franchise fees exceeded the union's costs in administering its license system, they could not legally be collected; but despite the lack of any cost evidence at trial, the court concluded that the fees were sufficiently low that a remand on the point would not serve any useful purpose.
Held:
1. Labor unions, acting in their self-interest and not in combination with nonlabor groups, enjoy statutory exemption from Sherman Act 
Page 451 U. S. 705
 liability, but the exemption does not apply when a union combines with a ""nonlabor group,"" or persons who are not ""parties to a labor dispute"" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219.  Here, the union's franchising of agents did not involve any combination between the union and any ""nonlabor groups.""  The record amply supports the conclusion that there was no combination between the union and the theatrical producers, and the determination of whether the combination between the union and those agents who agreed to become franchised was a combination with a ""nonlabor group"" depends on whether there was
""job or wage competition or some other economic interrelationship affecting legitimate union interests between the union members and the independent contractors.""
Musicians v. Carroll, 391 U. S. 99,  391 U. S. 106.  Because of the peculiar structure of the legitimate theater industry, where it is customary, if not essential, for union members to secure employment through agents whose fees are calculated as a percentage of the member's wage -- thus making it impossible for the union to defend even the integrity of the minimum wages it has negotiated with producers without regulation of agency fees -- the union's regulations are within the labor exemption.  Agents must, therefore, be considered a ""labor group,"" and their controversy with the union is plainly a ""labor dispute"" as defined in the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  The union's regulations are also clearly designed to promote its legitimate self-interest.  Pp.  451 U. S. 713-722.
2. However, the union's justification for the franchise fees -- based only on the suggestion in the most general terms that they are related to the basic purposes of its regulations -- is inadequate to warrant the conclusion that the fees are a permissible component of the exempt regulatory system.

|451 u.s. 725|"Maryland v. Louisiana
No. 83, Orig.
Argued January 19, 1981
Decided May 26, 1981
451 U.S. 725

Syllabus 
In this original action, several States, joined by the United States, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and a number of pipeline companies, challenge the constitutionality of Louisiana's tax on the ""first use"" of any natural gas brought into Louisiana which was not previously subjected to taxation by another State or the United States.  The primary effect of the tax, which is imposed on pipeline companies, is on gas produced in the federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and then piped to processing plants in Louisiana and, for the most part, eventually sold to out-of-state consumers.  The first-use tax statute (Act), as well as provisions of other Louisiana statutes, provides a number of exemptions from and credits for the tax whereby Louisiana consumers of OCS gas for the most part are not burdened by the tax, but it uniformly applies to gas moving out of the State.  Section 47:1303C of the Act declares that ""the tax shall be deemed a cost associated with uses made by the owner in preparation of marketing of the natural gas,"" and prohibits any attempt to allocate the cost of the tax to any party except the ultimate consumer.  A Special Master filed reports, including one recommending that Louisiana's motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds be denied, and that the plaintiff States' motion for judgment on the pleadings be denied and further evidentiary hearings be conducted.  Exceptions were filed to the reports.
Held:
1. Louisiana's exceptions to the Special Master's recommendation that the motion to dismiss be denied are rejected.  Pp.  451 U. S. 735-745.
(a) Louisiana's First-Use Tax, while imposed on the pipelines, is passed on to the ultimate consumer.  Thus, the plaintiff States, as major purchasers of natural gas whose cost has increased as a direct result of imposition of the tax, are directly affected in a ""substantial and real"" way, so as to justify the exercise of this Court's original jurisdiction under Art. III,  2, cl. 2, of the Constitution, which provides for such jurisdiction over cases in which a ""State shall be a Party,"" and 28 U.S.C.  1251(a) (1976 ed., Supp. III), which provides that this Court shall have ""original and exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States.""  Jurisdiction is also supported by the plaintiff States' interests as parens patriae, acting to protect their citizens from substantial economic injury presented by imposition of 
Page 451 U. S. 726
 the First-Use Tax.  Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553.  Pp.  451 U. S. 735-739.
(b) This case is an appropriate one for the exercise of this Court's exclusive jurisdiction under  1251(a), even though state court actions are pending in Louisiana in which the constitutional issues raised here are presented.  Neither the plaintiff States, the United States, nor the FERC is a named party in any of the state actions, and they have not sought to intervene therein.  Louisiana's tax, affecting millions of consumers in over 30 States, implicates serious and important concerns of federalism fully in accord with the purposes and reach of this Court's original jurisdiction.  The exercise of original jurisdiction is also justified because the tax affects the United States' interests in the administration of the OCS area, and the case is therefore an appropriate one for the exercise of this Court's nonexclusive original jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1251(b)(2) (1976 ed., Supp. III), of suits brought by the United States against a State.  Arizona v. New Mexico, 425 U. S. 794, distinguished.  Pp.  451 U. S. 739-745.
2. Plaintiffs' exceptions to the Special Master's recommendation that judgment on the pleadings be denied pending further evidentiary hearings are sustained.  Pp.  451 U. S. 746-760.
(a) Section 47:1303C of the Louisiana Act violates the Supremacy Clause.  Under the Natural Gas Act, determining pipeline and producer costs is the task of the FERC in the first instance, subject to judicial review.  In exercising its authority to regulate the determination of the proper allocation of costs associated with the interstate sale of natural gas to consumers, the FERC normally allocates part of the processing costs between marketable hydrocarbons extracted in the course of processing and the ""dried"" gas, insisting that the owners of the hydrocarbons bear a fair share of the expense associated with processing, rather than passing all of the costs on to the gas consumers.  However,  47:1303C provides that the amount of the Louisiana tax is a cost associated with uses made by the owner in preparation of marketing the natural gas and forecloses the owner from seeking reimbursement for payment of the tax from any third party other than a purchaser of the gas, even though the third party may be the owner of marketable hydrocarbons extracted from processing.

The tax impermissibly discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of local interests as the necessary result of various tax credits and exclusions provided in the Act and other Louisiana statutes whereby Louisiana consumers of OCS gas are substantially protected against the impact of the tax, whereas OCS gas moving out of the State is burdened with the tax.

			"|"Maryland v. Louisiana
No. 83, Orig.
Argued January 19, 1981
Decided May 26, 1981
451 U.S. 725

Syllabus 
In this original action, several States, joined by the United States, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and a number of pipeline companies, challenge the constitutionality of Louisiana's tax on the ""first use"" of any natural gas brought into Louisiana which was not previously subjected to taxation by another State or the United States.  The primary effect of the tax, which is imposed on pipeline companies, is on gas produced in the federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and then piped to processing plants in Louisiana and, for the most part, eventually sold to out-of-state consumers.  The first-use tax statute (Act), as well as provisions of other Louisiana statutes, provides a number of exemptions from and credits for the tax whereby Louisiana consumers of OCS gas for the most part are not burdened by the tax, but it uniformly applies to gas moving out of the State.  Section 47:1303C of the Act declares that ""the tax shall be deemed a cost associated with uses made by the owner in preparation of marketing of the natural gas,"" and prohibits any attempt to allocate the cost of the tax to any party except the ultimate consumer.  A Special Master filed reports, including one recommending that Louisiana's motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds be denied, and that the plaintiff States' motion for judgment on the pleadings be denied and further evidentiary hearings be conducted.  Exceptions were filed to the reports.
Held:
1. Louisiana's exceptions to the Special Master's recommendation that the motion to dismiss be denied are rejected.  Pp.  451 U. S. 735-745.
(a) Louisiana's First-Use Tax, while imposed on the pipelines, is passed on to the ultimate consumer.  Thus, the plaintiff States, as major purchasers of natural gas whose cost has increased as a direct result of imposition of the tax, are directly affected in a ""substantial and real"" way, so as to justify the exercise of this Court's original jurisdiction under Art. III,  2, cl. 2, of the Constitution, which provides for such jurisdiction over cases in which a ""State shall be a Party,"" and 28 U.S.C.  1251(a) (1976 ed., Supp. III), which provides that this Court shall have ""original and exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States.""  Jurisdiction is also supported by the plaintiff States' interests as parens patriae, acting to protect their citizens from substantial economic injury presented by imposition of 
Page 451 U. S. 726
 the First-Use Tax.  Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553.  Pp.  451 U. S. 735-739.
(b) This case is an appropriate one for the exercise of this Court's exclusive jurisdiction under  1251(a), even though state court actions are pending in Louisiana in which the constitutional issues raised here are presented.  Neither the plaintiff States, the United States, nor the FERC is a named party in any of the state actions, and they have not sought to intervene therein.  Louisiana's tax, affecting millions of consumers in over 30 States, implicates serious and important concerns of federalism fully in accord with the purposes and reach of this Court's original jurisdiction.  The exercise of original jurisdiction is also justified because the tax affects the United States' interests in the administration of the OCS area, and the case is therefore an appropriate one for the exercise of this Court's nonexclusive original jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1251(b)(2) (1976 ed., Supp. III), of suits brought by the United States against a State.  Arizona v. New Mexico, 425 U. S. 794, distinguished.  Pp.  451 U. S. 739-745.
2. Plaintiffs' exceptions to the Special Master's recommendation that judgment on the pleadings be denied pending further evidentiary hearings are sustained.  Pp.  451 U. S. 746-760.
(a) Section 47:1303C of the Louisiana Act violates the Supremacy Clause.  Under the Natural Gas Act, determining pipeline and producer costs is the task of the FERC in the first instance, subject to judicial review.  In exercising its authority to regulate the determination of the proper allocation of costs associated with the interstate sale of natural gas to consumers, the FERC normally allocates part of the processing costs between marketable hydrocarbons extracted in the course of processing and the ""dried"" gas, insisting that the owners of the hydrocarbons bear a fair share of the expense associated with processing, rather than passing all of the costs on to the gas consumers.  However,  47:1303C provides that the amount of the Louisiana tax is a cost associated with uses made by the owner in preparation of marketing the natural gas and forecloses the owner from seeking reimbursement for payment of the tax from any third party other than a purchaser of the gas, even though the third party may be the owner of marketable hydrocarbons extracted from processing.  Thus, the Louisiana statute is inconsistent with the federal scheme, and must give way.  Cf. Northern Natural Gas Co. v. State Corporation Comm'n of Kansas, 372 U. S. 84.  Pp.  451 U. S. 746-752.
(b) The First-Use Tax is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.  The flow of gas from OCS wells, through processing plants in Louisiana, and through interstate pipelines to the ultimate consumers in 
Page 451 U. S. 727
 over 30 States, constitutes interstate commerce and, even though ""interrupted"" by certain events in Louisiana, is a continual flow of gas in interstate commerce.

Nor can the tax be justified as a ""compensatory"" tax, compensating for the effect of the State's severance tax on local production of natural gas, since Louisiana has no sovereign interest in being compensated for the severance of resources from the federally owned OCS land.

Syllabus 
Petitioner Church, located in South Dakota, is a member of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod.  It operates an elementary Christian day school that is not a separate legal entity from the Church, but is financed by the Church's congregation and controlled by a Board elected from the congregation.  Petitioner Academy is a secondary school in South Dakota owned, supported, and controlled by the Synod, and it also is not separately incorporated.  Petitioners claim exemption with respect to their school employees from unemployment compensation taxes imposed by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and South Dakota's complementary statutes.  Title 26 U.S.C.  3309(b) provides an exemption with respect to, inter alia,
""service performed -- (1) in the employ of (A) a church or convention or association of churches, or (B) an organization . . . which is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or a convention or association of churches.""
A previous exemption under  3309(b)(3) for service performed in the employ of a school that is not an institution of higher education was repealed in 1976 when FUTA was amended.  After petitioners' unsuccessful administrative appeal from South Dakota's imposition of the taxes upon them and a successful appeal to a state court, the South Dakota Supreme Court held petitioners subject to the taxes.
Held:  Petitioners are exempt from unemployment compensation taxes under  3309(b)(1)(A).  Pp.  451 U. S. 780-788.
(a) Section 3309(b)(1)(A), as enacted in 1970, applies to schools, like petitioners', that have no separate legal existence from a church, or, as in the Academy's case, from a ""convention or association of churches.""  The employees working within these schools plainly are ""in the employ of . . . a church or convention or association of churches"" within the meaning of  3309(b)(1)(A).  And instead of construing the term ""church"" in  3309(b) as being limited to the actual house of worship, a construction that would contradict the phrasing of FUTA, such term must be construed as referring to the congregation or the hierarchy itself, that is, the church authorities who conduct the business of hiring, discharging, and directing church employees.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 26, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 I dissent from the denial of the petition for certiorari. I would grant the petition and summarily reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals insofar as it affirmed the judgment of the District Court. I cannot agree that the Fourth Amendment authorizes local school and police officials to detain every junior and senior high school student present in a town's public schools and then, using drug-detecting, police-trained German shepherds, to conduct a warrantless, student-by-student dragnet inspection ""to see if there were any drugs present."" While school officials acting in loco parentis may take reasonable steps to maintain a safe and healthful educational environment, their actions must nonetheless be consistent with the Fourth Amendment. The problem of drug abuse in the schools is not to be solved by conducting schoolhouse raids on unsuspecting students absent particularized information regarding drug users or suppliers. 
 I  
 Petitioner Diane Doe is a 13-year-old student at Highland Junior High School in Highland, Ind., a community of approximately 30,000 residents. Highland has one junior high school and one senior high school, located in adjacent buildings. There are 2,780 students enrolled in those schools. 
 On the morning of March 23, 1979, petitioner went to her first-period class as usual. Shortly before 9:15, when the class was scheduled to adjourn, petitioner's teacher ordered 
Page 451 U.S. 1022 , 1023
 everyone to remain seated until further notice. An assistant principal, accompanied by a police-trained German shepherd, a dog handler, and a uniformed police officer, then entered the classroom as one of six teams conducting simultaneous raids at the Highland schools. For the next 21/2 hours, petitioner and her classmates were required to sit quietly in their seats with their belongings in view and their hands upon their desks. They were forbidden to use the washroom unless accompanied by an escort. Uniformed police officers and school administrators were stationed in the halls. Guards were posted at the schoolhouse doors. While no student was allowed to leave the schoolhouse, representatives of the press and other news media, on invitation of the school authorities, were permitted to enter the classrooms to observe the proceedings. 
 The dogs were led up and down each aisle of the classroom, from desk to desk, and from student to student. Each student was probed, sniffed, and inspected by at least 1 of the 14 German shepherds detailed to the school. When the search team assigned to petitioner's classroom reached petitioner, the police dog pressed forward, sniffed at her body, and repeatedly pushed its nose and muzzle into her legs. The uniformed officer then ordered petitioner to stand and empty her pockets, apparently because the dog ""alerted"" to the presence of drugs. However, no drugs were found. After petitioner emptied her pockets, the dog again sniffed her body and again it apparently ""alerted."" Petitioner was then escorted to the nurse's office for a more thorough physical inspection. 
 Petitioner was met at the nurse's office by two adult women, one a uniformed police officer. After denying that she had ever used marihuana, petitioner was ordered to strip. She did so, removing her clothing in the presence of the two women. The women then looked over petitioner's body, inspected her clothing, and touched and examined the hair on [451 U.S. 1022 , 1024]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 26, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting. 
 Perhaps the tersest summary of the reasons I would grant certiorari in this case is contained in the ""black letter"" heading of Part II, section B, subsection 4 of the opinion of the Court of Appeals: ""Where the states are left after Winship, Mullaney, and Patterson."" 5 Cir., 632 F.2d 605, 624. The opinion of that court, which comprises 79 printed pages of the appendix to the petition for certiorari here, suggests that the answer is not crystal clear, even to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit whose judgment we are asked to review. 
 Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684 (1975 ), established that a State must prove every element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt. It is equally well established, however, that state legislatures and state courts, not federal judges, define the elements of a state criminal offense. Id., at 691. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in this case followed the former rule but not the latter and, on the strength of this possible error, ordered released from prison a person convicted of voluntary manslaughter whose conviction had been affirmed on direct appeal and state habeas corpus. Because I believe that it is for Georgia, and not the Court of 
Page 451 U.S. 1028 , 1029
 Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to define the elements of the crime of voluntary manslaughter, under Georgia law, I would grant plenary consideration. 
 Respondent Holloway was tried before a Georgia jury for murder and convicted of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter. Under Georgia law, ""[a] person commits murder when he unlawfully and with malice aforethought, either express or implied, causes the death of another human being."" Ga.Code 26-1101(a) (1978). Voluntary manslaughter is defined as causing the death of another human being under circumstances which would otherwise be murder if the killer ""acts solely as the result of a sudden, violent, and irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation sufficient to excite such passion in a reasonable person."" 26-1102. Respondent admitted that he intentionally killed the victim but claimed that he acted in self-defense. Georgia law recognizes the defense of self-defense, 26-902, and explicitly provides that a claim of self- defense ""is an affirmative defense."" 26-907. The trial judge accordingly instructed the jury, without objection from respondent's counsel, that after the State had proved an intentional homicide ""the burden is on the slayer"" to show that the killing was justified, in this case, by self-defense. 632 F.2d, at 619 (emphasis in original). 
 Respondent appealed his conviction, but did not raise any Mullaney issue. The Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed, 137 Ga.App. 124, 222 S.E.2d 898 (1975), and the Georgia Supreme Court denied certiorari. Respondent then sought federal habeas relief, but the District Court dismissed his application without prejudice for failure to exhaust, suggesting sua sponte that the trial court's instruction was "" 'notably suspect under the principles of Mullaney v. Wilbur.' "" 632 F.2d, at 614. The state trial court denied state habeas relief, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed. Rejecting respondent's Mullaney claim, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that: ""The burden placed on the defendant to excuse the homicide [451 U.S. 1028 , 1030]

No. 79-1127
Argued October 8, 1980
Decided May 18, 1981
451 U.S. 454

Syllabus 
After respondent was indicted in Texas for murder, the State announced its intention to seek the death penalty.  At an ensuing psychiatric examination, ordered by the trial court to determine respondent's competency to stand trial and conducted in the jail where he was being held, the examining doctor determined that respondent was competent.  Thereafter, respondent was tried by a jury and convicted.  A separate sentencing proceeding was then held before the same jury, as required by Texas law.  At such a proceeding, the jury must resolve three critical issues to determine whether or not the death sentence will be imposed.  One of these issues involves the future dangerousness of the defendant, i.e., whether there is a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.  At the sentencing hearing, the doctor who had conducted the pretrial psychiatric examination was allowed to testify for the State over defense counsels' objection that his name did not appear on the list of witnesses the State planned to use at either the guilt or penalty stages of the proceedings.  His testimony was based on the pretrial examination, and stated in substance that respondent would be a danger to society.  The jury then resolved the issue of future dangerousness, as well as the other two issues, against respondent, and thus, under Texas law, the death penalty was mandatory.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and death sentence.  After unsuccessfully seeking a writ of habeas corpus in the state courts, respondent petitioned for such relief in Federal District Court.  That court vacated the death sentence because it found constitutional error in admitting the doctor's testimony at the penalty phase.  The United States Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The admission of the doctor's testimony at the penalty phase violated respondent's Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination, because he was not advised before the pretrial psychiatric examination that he had a right to remain silent and that any statement he made could be used against him at a capital sentencing proceeding.  Pp.  451 U. S. 461-469.
(a) There is no basis for distinguishing between the guilt and penalty 
Page 451 U. S. 455
 phases of respondent's trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is concerned.  The State's attempt to establish respondent's future dangerousness by relying on the unwarned statements he made to the examining doctor infringed the Fifth Amendment just as much as would have any effort to compel respondent to testify against his will at the sentencing hearing.  Pp.  451 U. S. 462-463.
(b) The Fifth Amendment privilege is directly involved here because the State used as evidence against respondent the substance of his disclosures during the pretrial psychiatric examination.  The fact that respondent's statements were made in the context of such an examination does not automatically remove them from the reach of that Amendment.  Pp.  451 U. S. 463-466.
(c) The considerations calling for the accused to be warned prior to custodial interrogation apply with no less force to the pretrial psychiatric examination at issue here.  An accused who neither initiates a psychiatric evaluation nor attempts to introduce any psychiatric evidence may not be compelled to respond to a psychiatrist if his statements can be used against him at a capital sentencing proceeding.  When faced while in custody with a court-ordered psychiatric inquiry, respondent's statements to the doctor were not ""given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences"" and, as such, could be used as the State did at the penalty phase only if respondent had been apprised of his rights and had knowingly decided to waive them.  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436,  384 U. S. 478.  Since these safeguards of the Fifth Amendment privilege were not afforded respondent, his death sentence cannot stand.  Pp.  451 U. S. 466-469.
2. Respondent's Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel also was violated by the State's introduction of the doctor's testimony at the penalty phase.  Such right already had attached when the doctor examined respondent in jail, and that interview proved to be a ""critical stage"" of the aggregate proceedings against respondent.  Defense counsel were not notified in advance that the psychiatric examination would encompass the issue of their client's future dangerousness, and respondent was denied the assistance of his counsel in making the significant decision of whether to submit to the examination and to what end the psychiatrist's findings could be employed.  Pp.  451 U. S. 469-471.
602 F.2d 694, affirmed.

Syllabus 
After being arrested on a state criminal charge, and after being informed of his rights as required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, petitioner was questioned by the police on January 19, 1976, until he said that he wanted an attorney.  Questioning then ceased, but on January 20, police officers came to the jail and, after stating that they wanted to talk to him and again informing petitioner of his Miranda rights, obtained his confession when he said that he was willing to talk.  The trial court ultimately denied petitioner's motion to suppress his confession, finding the statement to be voluntary, and he was thereafter convicted.  The Arizona Supreme Court held that, during the January 20 meeting, he waived his right to remain silent and his right to counsel when he voluntarily gave his statement after again being informed of his rights.
Held:  The use of petitioner's confession against him at his trial violated his right under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, as declared in Miranda, supra.  Having exercised his right on January 19 to have counsel present during interrogation, petitioner did not validly waive that right on the 20th.  Pp.  451 U. S. 481-487.
(a) A waiver of the right to counsel, once invoked, not only must be voluntary, but also must constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a known right or privilege.  Here, however, the state courts applied an erroneous standard for determining waiver by focusing on the voluntariness of petitioner's confession, rather than on whether he understood his right to counsel and intelligently and knowingly relinquished it.  Pp.  451 U. S. 482-84.
(b) When an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to police-initiated interrogation after being again advised of his rights.  An accused, such as petitioner, having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused has himself initiated further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.  Here, the interrogation of petitioner on January 20 was at the instance 
Page 451 U. S. 478
 of the authorities, and his confession, made without having had access to counsel, did not amount to a valid waiver, and hence was inadmissible.  Pp.  451 U. S. 484-487.

Syllabus 
In two suits initiated in New Jersey state court, retired employees who had received workers' compensation awards subsequent to retirement challenged the validity of provisions in their employers' pension plans reducing a retiree's pension benefits by an amount equal to a workers' compensation award for which the retiree is eligible.  These private pension plans are subject to federal regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The employers independently removed the suits to Federal District Court, where the judges in each suit held that the pension offset provisions were invalid under a provision of the New Jersey Workers' Compensation Act prohibiting such offsets; that Congress had not intended ERISA to preempt such state laws; that the offsets were prohibited by ERISA's provision, 29 U.S.C.  1053(a), prohibiting forfeitures of pension rights except under specified conditions inapplicable to these cases; and that a Treasury Regulation authorizing offsets based on workers' compensation awards was invalid.  The Court of Appeals consolidated appeals from the two decisions, and reversed.
Held:
1. Congress contemplated and approved the kind of pension provisions challenged here.  Pp.  451 U. S. 509-521.
(a) Pension plan provisions for offsets based on workers' compensation awards do not contravene ERISA's nonforfeiture provisions.  While  1053(a) prohibits forfeitures of vested rights, with specified exceptions that do not include workers' compensation offsets, nevertheless other provisions make it clear that ERISA leaves to the private parties creating the pension plan the determination of the content or amount of benefits that, once vested, cannot be forfeited.  The statutory definition of ""nonforfeitable"" pension benefits, 29 U.S.C.  1002(19), assures that an employee's claim to the protected benefit is legally enforceable, but it does not guarantee a particular amount or a method for calculating the benefit.  Cf. Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 446 U. S. 359.  
Page 451 U. S. 505
 It is particularly pertinent that Congress did not prohibit ""integration,"" a calculation practice under which benefit levels are determined by combining pension funds with other public income streams available to the retired employee.  Rather, Congress accepted the practice by expressly preserving the option of pension fund integration with benefits available under both the Social Security Act and the Railroad Retirement Act.  Offsets against pension benefits for workers' compensation awards work much like the integration of pension benefits with Social Security or Railroad Retirement payments, and thus the nonforfeiture provision of  1053(a) has no more applicability to the former kind of integration than it does to the latter.  Pp.  451 U. S. 510-517.
(b) Although neither ERISA nor its legislative history mentions integration with workers' compensation, ERISA does not forbid the Treasury Regulation permitting reductions of pension benefits based on awards under state workers' compensation laws, or Internal Revenue Service rulings to the same effect.  There is no merit in the argument that integration of pension funds with workers' compensation awards, which are based on work-related injuries, lacks the rationale behind ERISA's permission of integration of pension funds with Social Security and Railroad Retirement payments, which supply payments for wages lost due to retirement.  Both the Social Security and Railroad Retirement Acts also provide payments for disability, and ERISA permits pension integration with such benefits, as well as with benefits for wages lost due to retirement.  Moreover, when it enacted ERISA, Congress knew of the IRS rulings permitting integration with workers' compensation benefits and left them in effect.  Pp.  451 U. S. 517-521.
2. The New Jersey statute in question is preempted by federal law insofar as it eliminates a method for calculating pension benefits under plans governed by ERISA.  The provision of ERISA, 29 U.S.C.  1144(a), stating that the Act's provisions shall supersede any state laws that ""relate to any [covered] employee benefit plan,"" demonstrates that Congress meant to establish pension plan regulation as exclusively a federal concern.  Regardless of whether the purpose of the New Jersey statute might have been to protect the employee's right to workers' compensation disability benefits, rather than to regulate pension plans, the statute ""relate[s] to pension plans"" governed by ERISA because it eliminates one method for calculating pension benefits -- integration -- that is permitted by federal law, and the state provision thus is an impermissible intrusion on the federal regulatory scheme.  It is of no moment that New Jersey intrudes indirectly, through a workers' compensation law, rather than directly, through a statute called ""pension 
Page 451 U. S. 506
 regulation,"" since ERISA makes clear that even indirect state action bearing on private pensions may encroach upon the area of exclusive federal concern.  Moreover, where, as here, pension plans emerge from collective bargaining, the additional federal interest in precluding state interference in labor-management negotiations calls for preemption of state efforts to regulate pension term.  Pp.  451 U. S. 521-526.
616 F.2d 1238, affirmed.
MARSHALL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except BRENNAN, J., who took no part in the decision of the case.

 regulation,"" since ERISA makes clear that even indirect state action bearing on private pensions may encroach upon the area of exclusive federal concern.  Moreover, where, as here, pension plans emerge from collective bargaining, the additional federal interest in precluding state interference in labor-management negotiations calls for preemption of state efforts to regulate pension term.  Pp.  451 U. S. 521-526.

Syllabus 
Respondent, an inmate of a Nebraska prison, ordered by mail certain hobby materials.  After being delivered to the prison, the packages containing the materials were lost when the normal procedure for receipt of mail packages was not followed.  Respondent brought an action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioner prison officials to recover the value of the hobby materials, claiming that petitioners had negligently lost the materials, and thereby deprived respondent of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court entered summary judgment for respondent, holding that negligent actions by state officials can be a basis for an action under  1983, that petitioners were not immune from liability, and that the deprivation of the hobby materials implicated due process rights.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Respondent has not stated a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Pp.  451 U. S. 531-544.
(a) In any  1983 action, the initial inquiry must focus on whether the two essential elements to a  1983 action are present:  (1) whether the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) whether this conduct deprived a person of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.  Pp.  451 U. S. 531-535.
(b) Although respondent has been deprived of property under color of state law, he has not sufficiently alleged a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The deprivation did not occur as the result of some established state procedure, but as the result of the unauthorized failure of state agents to follow established state procedure.  Moreover, Nebraska has a tort claims procedure which provides a remedy to persons who have suffered a tortious loss at the hands of the State, but which respondent did not use.  Such procedure could have fully compensated respondent for his property loss, and was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process.  Pp.  451 U. S. 535-544.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a former automobile dealer, brought suit against respondent automobile manufacturer in Federal District Court, alleging that respondent's ""sales incentive"" programs over a certain period violated the price discrimination prohibition of  2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act.  Under its programs, respondent paid a bonus to its dealers if they exceeded their quotas -- set by respondent for each dealer -- of cars to be sold at retail or purchased from respondent.  Petitioner alleged that respondent set petitioner's quotas higher than those of its competitors; that to the extent it failed to meet its quotas, and to the extent its competitors met their lower quotas, petitioner received fewer bonuses; and that the net effect was that it paid more for its automobiles than did its competitors.  Petitioner contended that the amount of the price discrimination -- the amount of the price difference multiplied by the number of petitioner's purchases -- was $81,248, and that, when petitioner went out of business, the going concern value of the business ranged between $50,000 and $170,000.  Respondent maintained that the sales incentive programs were nondiscriminatory, and that they did not injure petitioner or adversely affect competition.  The jury returned a verdict awarding petitioner $111,247.48 in damages, which the District Court trebled.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that it was unnecessary to consider whether a violation of  2(a) had been proved, since petitioner had failed to introduce substantial evidence of injury attributable to the programs, much less substantial evidence of the amount of such injury, as was required in order to recover treble damages under  4 of the Clayton Act.
Held:
1. Petitioner's contention that, once it has proved a price discrimination in violation of  2(a), it is entitled at a minimum to so-called ""automatic damages"" in the amount of the price discrimination is without merit.  Section 2(a), a prophylactic statute which is violated merely upon a showing that ""the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition,"" does not require, for purposes of 
Page 451 U. S. 558
 injunctive actions, that the discrimination must in fact have harmed competition.  Corn Products Co. v. FTC, 324 U. S. 726; FTC v. Morton Salt Co.. 334 U. S. 37.  However under  4 of the Clayton Act, which is essentially a remedial statute providing treble damages to any person ""who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws,"" a plaintiff must make some showing of actual injury attributable to something the antitrust laws were designed to prevent.  Thus, it must prove more than a violation of  2(a), since such proof establishes only that injury may result.  Cf. Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-0-Mat, Inc., 429 U. S. 477.  Pp.  451 U. S. 561-563.
2. The rule excusing antitrust plaintiffs from an unduly rigorous standard of proving antitrust injury, see, e.g., Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U. S. 100, will not be applied here to determine whether petitioner, though not entitled to ""automatic damages,"" has produced enough evidence of actual injury to sustain recovery.  While it is a close question whether petitioner's evidence would be sufficient to support a jury award even under such rule, a more fundamental difficulty is that the cases relied upon by petitioner all depend, in greater or lesser part, on the inequity of a wrongdoer's defeating the recovery of damages against him by insisting upon a rigorous standard of proof.  In this case, it cannot be said with assurance that respondent is a ""wrongdoer,"" since the Court of Appeals went directly to the issue of damages after bypassing the question whether respondent, in fact, violated  2(a).  The proper course is to remand the case so that the Court of Appeals may pass upon respondent's contention that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of such violation.  If the court determines that respondent did violate the Act, it should then consider the sufficiency of petitioner's evidence of injury.  Pp.  451 U. S. 563-568.

Syllabus 
Held:  The ""percentage depletion"" allowance under  611 and 613 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 -- whereby the owner of an economic interest in a mineral deposit is allowed a special deduction from taxable income measured by a percentage of his gross income derived from exhaustion of the mineral -- may not be denied to respondent lessees of underground coal who had the right to extract and sell the coal at prices fixed by them, paying a fixed royalty per ton to their lessors, merely because their leases were subject to termination by the lessor on 30 days' notice.  Pp.  451 U. S. 576-585.
(a) The deduction provides a special incentive for engaging in the mining business that goes well beyond a purpose of merely allowing the owner of a wasting asset to recoup the capital invested in that asset, and hence eligibility for the deduction is determined not by the amount of the capital investment, but by the mine operator's ""economic interest"" in the coal.  The question here is whether the deduction for the asset depleted by respondents will be received by anyone, since the tax consequences of the lessors' receipt of royalties will not be affected, either favorably or unfavorably, by the decision.  Pp.  451 U. S. 576-579.
(b) Under their leases, respondents had a legal interest in the coal both before and after it was mined, and were free to sell the coal at whatever price the market could bear.  Thus, they had a depletable ""economic interest"" in the coal deposits, not merely an ""economic advantage.""  Parsons v. Smith, 359 U. S. 215, and Paragon Jewel Coal Co. v. Commissioner, 380 U. S. 624, distinguished.  Nor does the right to terminate give the lessor the only significant economic interest in the coal as a matter of ""practical economics.""  It is by no means certain that an increase in the price of coal will induce a lessor to terminate a satisfactory business relationship, and it would be unfair to deny a lessee a tax benefit that is available to competitors simply because he accepted the business risk of termination that his competitors were able to avoid when they negotiated their mining leases.  Moreover, the Government has not suggested any rational basis for linking the right to a depletion deduction to the period of time that the taxpayer operates a mine.  Thus, the mere existence of the lessors' unexercised

 right to terminate respondents' leases did not destroy their economic interest in the leased mineral deposits.  Pp.  451 U. S. 579-585.

Section 33(b) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act provides that a longshoreman's acceptance, pursuant to an award in a compensation order, of compensation from his employer for injuries incurred in the course of employment
""shall operate as an assignment to the employer of all right of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages against [a person other than the employer] unless [the longshoreman] shall commence an action against such third person within six months after such award.""
Petitioner longshoremen, who had been injured aboard ship in the course of their employment, accepted compensation under such an award from their respective stevedore employers.  More than six months after the awards, each petitioner commenced an action in Federal District Court against the shipowner involved, alleging that the shipowner had negligently caused his injury.  The District Courts granted summary judgments for the shipowners (respondents) on the ground that, because petitioners failed to bring suit within six months of the compensation awards, their causes of action had been assigned to their employers, who thereafter had the exclusive right to pursue the third-party claims.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 33(b) precludes petitioners from pursuing their third-party claims against respondent shipowners.  Pp.  451 U. S. 602-618.
(a) The language of  33(b) is both mandatory and unequivocal.  The only conditions precedent to the statutory assignment are the acceptance of compensation pursuant to an award in a compensation order and the passage of the required 6-month period, both of which conditions were satisfied in these eases.  When such assignment occurs, it transfers to the employer the employee's entire right to commence a third-party action, the words ""all right"" in  33(b) precluding the possibility of only a partial assignment or concurrent rights in the employee and employer to sue in the postassignment period.  Although 
Page 451 U. S. 597
 petitioners' employers failed to pursue the assigned claims, the statute does not expressly require that they do so, nor does it provide for relief to employees should the assigned claims lie dormant.  Pp.  451 U. S. 602-604.
(b) Nothing in the legislative history shows any intent by Congress to preserve the employee's right to commence a third-party suit after the 6-month period expires.  To the contrary, the history indicates that once that period expires, the employer possesses complete control of third-party claims.  Moreover, the history forecloses the argument that Congress did not intend an assignment of a third-party claim to be effective unless there was an absence of any potential conflict of interest between the assignee and the longshoreman.  The simple standard set forth in  33(b) -- exclusive control of the cause of action in the employee for six months and in the employer thereafter -- protects the interests of both employees and employers, and is consistent with the Act's general policy of encouraging the prompt and efficient administration of compensation claims.  Pp.  451 U. S. 604-612.
(c) There is no evidence that Congress gave the employee the right or procedural mechanism, after assignment, to compel the assignee either to bring a third-party suit or to reassign the cause of action to the employee in response to a formal request to do so.  And Congress' failure to amend  33(b) in 1972, when the Act was thoroughly reexamined, does not evidence congressional approval of a Court of Appeals' decision holding that, notwithstanding  33(b), a longshoreman who has accepted compensation under an award may maintain a third-party action whenever it becomes evident that his employer has no intention to file suit on the assigned claim.  Such legislative inaction does not modify the plain terms of  33(b).  Pp.  451 U. S. 612-617.

617 F.2d 955 and 622 F.2d 572 and 575, affirmed.  STEVENS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

No. 80-420
Argued March 24, 1981
Decided May 18, 1981
451 U.S. 619

Syllabus 
In a prosecution charging petitioners with disseminating obscenity in violation of Ohio law, the trial court granted their motions to dismiss the complaints on the ground that they had been subjected to selective and discriminatory prosecution in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Ohio Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for trial, finding the evidence insufficient to support the allegations of discriminatory prosecution.  The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  Because the Ohio Supreme Court's decision was not a final judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1257, the writ of certiorari previously granted by this Court is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  In the context of a criminal prosecution, finality of judgment is normally defined by the imposition of a sentence.  Here there has been no finding of guilt and no sentence imposed.  Nor is the Ohio Supreme Court's decision a final judgment within any of the four exceptions to the general rule identified in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469.  Resolution of the question whether the obscenity prosecution of petitioners was selective or discriminatory in violation of the Equal Protection Clause can await final judgment in the state criminal proceeding without any adverse effect upon important federal interests.

 HOLLYWOOD MARINE, INC. and Water Quality Insurance Syndicate v. UNITED STATESNo. 80-1160 Supreme Court of the United States May 18, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The motion of the petitioner for leave to submit the Rule 28.1 listing under seal is denied. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Hollywood Marine is engaged in the business of transporting petroleum cargo by barge. Its barges are towed by tugboat operators who are in no way associated with petitioner except by reason of the contract between the two for services to be performed by the tugboat operator. Under such contract, the tugboat operator exercises complete control over the method and manner of performing the towing operations, including all decisions to be made as to questions of navigation. 
 On August 5, 1976, a barge owned by petitioner discharged over 2,000 gallons of oil into the Intracoastal Waterway in Texas. The spill occurred as a result of damage sustained by the barge while it was under the control of a tugboat operator. The spill was cleaned up by the Coast Guard at a total cost to the United States of $61,816.85. Pursuant to 311(f)(1), (n), of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as added, 86 Stat. 866 and 869, 33 U.S.C. 1321(f)(1), (n), the United States brought this suit to recover from petitioner the costs incurred during the cleanup . Under 1321(f)(1), the owner or operator of a discharging vessel is liable for the costs of cleaning up an oil spill except 
Petitioner's defense to the Government's action was that 
Page 451 U.S. 994 , 995
 the oil spill was caused by an act or omission of its independent contractor, the tugboat operator, and that the tugboat operator was a "" third party"" under 1321(f)(1). The District Court sustained the defense, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. 625 F.2d 524 (1980). The Court of Appeals relied on its earlier decision in United States v. LeBeouf Brothers Towing Co., 621 F.2d 787, rehearing denied, 629 F.2d 1350 (1980). In LeBeouf, the Court of Appeals concluded that the third-party defense contained in 1321(f)(1) must be narrowly interpreted. The statute's scheme for preventing and cleaning up oil spills would be undermined if barge owners could escape liability merely by hiring out their operations to tugs and independent contractors. The term ""third party"" was intended to refer to a complete outsider (e. g., a colliding vessel or a vandal), not an independent contractor whom the vessel owner was responsible for hiring in the first place. 
 While no one can say that the decision of the Court of Appeals places a wholly unreasonable interpretation on the language contained in 1321(f)( 1), that court itself stated that the term ""third party"" must be narrowly interpreted. The court's interpretation, however, is not supported by the plain language of the statute, which in its express terms provides a defense whenever the discharge is the result of an act of a ""third party."" The statute is entirely silent as to what judicial refinements, if any, were intended to be placed on the term ""third party."" 
 Because the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is legislation of vital importance, and the furnishing of oil for the country's economy is likewise of vital importance, the question presented will continue to arise. The Court of Appeals' interpretation is at odds with the decision reached by the District Court in Tug Ocean Prince, Inc. v. United States, 436 F.Supp. 907 (SDNY 1977), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 584 F.2d 1151 (CA2 1978), cert. denied, [451 U.S. 994 , 996]

 Patrick M. TRAPPER et al. v. State of NORTH CAROLINANo. 80-1163 Supreme Court of the United States May 18, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of North Carolina. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465 (1976), held that ""where the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim, a state prisoner may not be granted federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search or seizure was introduced at his trial."" Id. , at 494 (footnote omitted). The effect of this holding was to make this Court, on direct review, the only federal forum available to the accused to monitor state-court compliance with the Fourth Amendment. I dissented in that case and reminded by Brethren that "" institutional constraints totally preclude any possibility that this Court can adequately oversee whether state courts have properly applied federal law."" Id., at 526. ""[O]ur certiorari jurisdiction is inadequate for containing state criminal proceedings within constitutional bounds,"" because ""federal review by certiorari in this Court is a matter of grace, and it is grace now seldom bestowed at the behest of a criminal defendant."" Id., at 534. While the lower federal courts by way of habeas corpus are better suited than are we on direct review to assure state-court compliance with Fourth Amendment requirements, we are now duty bound by Stone v. Powell to fulfill this monitoring function. The denial of certiorari in this case demonstrates, however, that the Court will not discharge that duty, because the petition presents a substantial issue whether the North Carolina courts properly applied the Fourth Amendment. I, therefore, dissent from the denial of certiorari and would set this case for argument.

 Several events caused Carawan to become suspicious of activities on the Lombardo property.

Id., at 14. In addition, on December 21, 1978, Carawan assisted a boat which was stuck in the mud bottom of Fortescue Creek about one mile from the Lombardo property.

While doing so he heard two rifle shots which he believed came from the Lombardo property, one of which apparently passed near him. Id., at 16. 
 These events led Carawan to suspect that the Lombardo property was being used for marihuana smuggling. Id., at 16-17.

 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 In this case, the Attorney General has filed a complaint under 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, as amended in 1975, 42 U.S.C . 1973,1 alleging that petitioner School District's at-large system of electing members "" 'has been implemented with the intent and purpose of causing . . . irreparable injury to Mexican-American voters . . . by effectively and purposefully precluding them from meaningful access to the political process. . . .' "" 625 F.2d 547, 548-549 (CA5 1980). The complaint further alleges: 
 ""[T]he seven member Board of Trustees of the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District is elected at-large; 
 ""approximately fifty percent of the population of the school district is Mexican-American, but Mexican-American voters' residences are concentrated in one part of the City of Uvalde;

 ""voting is normally along racial lines; 
 ""the Board has discriminated against Mexican-Americans in the past by operating intentionally segregated elementary schools and is unresponsive to the needs of the Mexican-American community; 
 ""as a result of the school district's election system, Mexican- Americans have less opportunity than 'whites' to participate in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice to the Board."" Id., at 549 (footnote omitted). 
 The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. 461 F.Supp. 117 (1978). It concluded that the Fifteenth Amendment, upon which 2 of the Act rests,3 applies only to practices which directly affect access to the ballot and is thus not available to challenge at-large election districts on the basis of so-called ""vote dilution."" 
 The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that respondent had stated a cause of action under the Fifteenth Amendment. It canvassed the various opinions in Mobile v. City of Bolden, 446 U.S. 55d 47 (1980), and concluded that a majority of this Court had held that the Fifteenth Amendment prohibits not just the actual prevention or hindrance of people from voting, but also purposeful vote dilution.

Syllabus 
Petitioner trucking companies are parties to a collective bargaining agreement with the Teamsters Union that contains a no-strike clause.  Respondent employees of petitioners commenced a wildcat strike because they believed the union was not properly representing them in negotiations to amend the collective bargaining agreement.  Thereafter, petitioners brought an action against respondents in Federal District Court under  301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, which confers jurisdiction on federal district courts to decide suits alleging violations of collective bargaining agreements.  Petitioners sought, inter alia, damages against respondents in their individual capacities for all losses arising out of the wildcat strike.  The District Court dismissed the damages claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that Congress had not intended through  301 to create a cause of action for damages against individual union members for breach of a no-strike agreement.
Held:  Section 301 (a) does not sanction damages actions by employers against individual employees for violating the no-strike provision of a collective bargaining agreement, whether or not the union participated in or authorized the strike.  The legislative history of  301 clearly reveals Congress' intent to shield individual employees from liability for such damages, even though this results in leaving the employer unable to recover for his losses.  While  301 (b), which provides that any money judgment against a union for violation of a collective bargaining agreement shall be enforceable only against the union, and not against any individual member, explicitly addresses only union-authorized violations, the ""penumbra"" of  301 (b), as informed by its legislative history, establishes that Congress meant to exclude individual strikers from damages liability, whether or not they were authorized by their union to strike.  The history demonstrates that Congress deliberately chose to allow a damages remedy for breach of a no-strike provision only against unions, not individuals, and, as to unions, only when they participated in or authorized the illegal strike.

Syllabus 
Missouri law provides only two possible sentences for a defendant convicted of capital murder:  (a) death, or (b) life imprisonment without eligibility for probation or parole for 50 years.  Under state statutes, a separate presentence hearing, at which additional evidence in mitigation and aggravation of punishment is heard, must be held before the same jury that found the defendant guilty; the prosecution must prove the existence of aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt before the death penalty may be imposed; and a jury that imposes the death penalty must designate in writing the aggravating circumstance or circumstances that it finds beyond a reasonable doubt.  The guilt or innocence phase of petitioner's state court trial resulted in a verdict of guilty of capital murder, and his presentence hearing resulted in the jury's additional verdict fixing petitioner's punishment at life imprisonment without eligibility for probation or parole for 50 years.  After granting petitioner's post-trial motion for a new trial because of the intervening decision in Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357, which held that Missouri's allowing automatic exemption of women from jury service was unconstitutional, the trial court announced that it would grant petitioner's motion, based on double jeopardy grounds, to strike the prosecution's notice that it intended again to seek the death penalty on the basis of the same aggravating circumstances it had sought to prove at the first trial.  The Missouri Court of Appeals denied the State's request for a writ of prohibition or mandamus, but the Missouri Supreme Court ultimately granted a writ of prohibition.
Held:  Because, under Missouri law, the sentencing proceeding at petitioner's first trial was like the trial on the question of guilt or innocence, the protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause to one acquitted by a jury is available to him, with respect to the death penalty, at his retrial.  The reasoning of Stroud v. United States, 251 U. S. 15, is not controlling.  Pp.  451 U. S. 437-446.
(a) This Court generally has concluded that, because the imposition of a particular sentence usually is not regarded as an ""acquittal"" of any more severe sentence that could have been imposed, the Double Jeopardy Clause imposes no absolute prohibition against the imposition of a harsher sentence at retrial after a defendant has succeeded in having his original conviction set aside.  See North Carolina v. Pearce,

 395 U. S. 711; Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U. S. 17; Stroud v. United States, supra; United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117.  However, in those cases, unlike the present case, the sentencing procedures did not have the hallmarks of a trial on guilt or innocence.  In the first three cases, there was no separate sentencing proceeding at which the prosecution was required to prove additional facts in order to justify the particular sentence, and the sentencer's discretion in determining punishment was essentially unfettered.  Although United States v. DiFrancesco, supra,. involved a separate sentencing procedure, the prosecution was required to prove an additional fact warranting a harsher penalty only by a preponderance of the evidence, and the sentencer's choice of punishment was far broader than the two choices available to petitioner's jury under Missouri law.  Pp.  451 U. S. 437-441.
(b) The rationale of Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, which held that a defendant may not be retried if he obtains a reversal of his conviction on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to convict, is relevant here.  In the usual sentencing proceeding, it is impossible, because of the absence of sentencing standards, to conclude that a sentence less than the statutory maximum constitutes a decision to the effect that the prosecution has failed to prove its case.  But by enacting a capital sentencing procedure that resembles a trial on the issue of guilt or innocence, Missouri explicitly requires the jury to determine whether the prosecution has ""proved its case.""  Petitioner's sentence of life imprisonment at his first trial meant that the jury has already acquitted him of whatever was necessary to impose the death sentence.  Pp.  451 U. S. 441-446.

Syllabus 
The Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District (District), a governmental entity, stores and delivers untreated water to the owners of 236,000 acres of land in central Arizona, and, to subsidize its water operations, sells electricity to hundreds of thousands of people in an area including a large part of metropolitan Phoenix.  Under state law, the system for electing the District's directors limits voting eligibility to landowners and apportions voting power according to the number of acres owned.  A class of registered voters living within the District but owning either no land or less than an acre of land there filed suit, claiming that the election scheme violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  They alleged that, because the District has such governmental powers as the authority to condemn land and sell tax-exempt bonds, and because it sells electricity to virtually half the State's population and exercises significant influence on flood control and environmental management, its policies and actions substantially affect all District residents, regardless of property ownership.  The District Court upheld the constitutionality of the voting scheme, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  It held that the case was governed by the one-person, one-vote principle established in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, rather than by the exception to that principle established in Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage Dist., 410 U. S. 719, which upheld a state law permitting only landowners to vote for directors of a water district because of its special limited purpose and the disproportionate effect of its activities on landowners as a group.
Held:  The District's purpose is sufficiently specialized and narrow and its activities bear on landowners so disproportionately as to release it from the strict demands of the Reynolds principle.  As in Salyer, supra, the voting scheme for the District is constitutional because it bears a reasonable relationship to its statutory objectives.  Pp.  451 U. S. 362-371.
(a) The distinctions between the more diverse and extensive services furnished by the District here and those furnished by the water district involved in Salyer, supra, do not amount to a constitutional difference.  The District does not exercise the sort of governmental 
Page 451 U. S. 356
 powers that invoke the strict demands of Reynolds. It cannot impose ad valorem property taxes or sales taxes or enact laws governing citizens' conduct. Nor does it administer normal government functions such as the maintenance of streets, the operation of schools, or sanitation, health, or welfare services.  Pp.  451 U. S. 365-336.
(b) The District's water functions, which constitute its primary and originating purpose, are relatively narrow.  Although, unlike in Salyer, as much as 40% of the water delivered by the District goes for nonagricultural, urban purposes, the constitutionally relevant fact is that all water is distributed according to land ownership, and the District cannot control the use to which the water is put by the landowners.  Pp.  451 U. S. 367-368.
(c) Nor is the legality of the District's property-based voting scheme affected by the fact that, as one of the largest suppliers of electric power in the State, it meets most of its capital and operating costs by the selling of such power.  The provision of electricity is not, in itself, the sort of general or important governmental function that would make the government provider subject to the Reynolds doctrine.  And, in any event, the District's electric power functions are only incidental to, and thus cannot change the character of, its water functions.  Pp.  451 U. S. 368-370.
(d) And the District's functions bear a disproportionate relationship to the specific class of people whom the system makes eligible to vote.  Voting landowners are the only residents of the District whose lands are subject to liens to secure District bonds, who are subject to the District's acreage-based taxing power, and who committed capital to the District.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
Respondent, a deaf graduate student at petitioner University, filed a complaint in Federal District Court, alleging that the University had violated  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by discriminatorily refusing to pay for a sign language interpreter for respondent, and declaratory and injunctive relief was sought.  Finding a possibility that respondent would be irreparably harmed in the absence of an injunction, and that he was likely to prevail on the merits, the District Court, inter alia, granted a preliminary injunction on the condition that respondent post a security bond pending the outcome of the litigation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of the injunction.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
Respondent, a deaf graduate student at petitioner University, filed a complaint in Federal District Court, alleging that the University had violated  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by discriminatorily refusing to pay for a sign language interpreter for respondent, and declaratory and injunctive relief was sought.  Finding a possibility that respondent would be irreparably harmed in the absence of an injunction, and that he was likely to prevail on the merits, the District Court, inter alia, granted a preliminary injunction on the condition that respondent post a security bond pending the outcome of the litigation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of the injunction.  In the meantime, the University had obeyed the injunction by paying for respondent's interpreter and respondent had been graduated, but the Court of Appeals rejected a suggestion that the case was moot, noting that the issue of who should bear the cost of the interpreter remained to be decided.
Held:  The question whether a preliminary injunction should have been issued is moot, because the terms of the injunction have been fully and irrevocably carried out, but, as the Court of Appeals correctly noted, the question whether the University must pay for the interpreter remains for trial on the merits.

Syllabus 
Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 (Act) prohibits
""[t]he creation of any obstruction not affirmatively authorized by Congress, to the navigable capacity of any of the waters of the Unit.ed States.""
An environmental organization and two private citizens (hereafter respondents) brought an action in Federal District Court seeking to enjoin, as a violation of  10, the construction and operation of water diversion facilities which are part of the California Water Project, a series of water storage and transportation facilities designed to transport water from northern to central and southern California.  The District Court held, inter alia, that respondents could avail themselves of a ""private cause of action"" to enforce  10, and the Court of Appeals agreed, concluding that the Act was designed for the especial benefit of private parties who may suffer ""special injury"" caused by unauthorized obstruction to a navigable waterway.
Held:
1. No private action can be implied on behalf of those allegedly injured by a claimed violation of  10.  Pp.  451 U. S. 292-298.
(a) Section 10's language, which states no more than a general proscription of certain activities, does not indicate any intent by Congress to provide for private rights of action.  Section 10 is the kind of general ban which carries with it no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.  P.  451 U. S. 294.
(b) Nor is there anything in the legislative history suggesting that  10 was created for the especial benefit of a particular class.  On the contrary, the history suggests the view that the Act was designed to benefit the public at large by empowering the Federal Government to exercise its authority over interstate commerce with respect to obstructions on navigable rivers caused by bridges and similar structures.  Pp.  451 U. S. 294-296.
2. The question on the merits, raised by petitioner State of California, as to whether the Act requires permits for the state water allocation projects involved in these cases, will not be reached, as the above ruling

|451 u.s. 304|"City of Milwaukee v. Illinois
No. 7908
Argued December 2, 1980
Decided April 28, 1981
451 U.S. 304

Syllabus 
In original proceedings brought by respondent State of Illinois, alleging that petitioners -- the city of Milwaukee, its Sewerage Commission, and Milwaukee County's Metropolitan Sewerage Commission -- and other Wisconsin cities were polluting Lake Michigan because of overflows of untreated sewage from their sewer systems and discharges of inadequately treated sewage from their treatment plants, this Court recognized the existence of a federal ""common law"" which could give rise to a claim for abatement of a nuisance caused by interstate water pollution, but declined to exercise original jurisdiction because of the availability of a lower court action.  Illinois v. Milwaukee, 406 U. S. 91.  Accordingly, Illinois filed suit (and respondent State of Michigan intervened) in Federal District Court seeking abatement, under federal common law, of the public nuisance petitioners were allegedly creating by their discharges.  Five months later, Congress passed the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Act) Amendments of 1972, which established a new system of regulation making it illegal to discharge pollutants into the Nation's waters except pursuant to a permit that incorporated as conditions regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishing specific effluent limitations.  Permits are issued either by the EPA or a qualifying state agency, and petitioners operated their sewer systems under permits issued by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR).  While the federal court action was pending, DNR brought an action in a Wisconsin state court to compel compliance with the permits' requirements, and the state court entered a judgment requiring discharges from the treatment plants to meet effluent limitations in the permits and establishing a timetable for additional construction to control sewage overflows.  Thereafter, the District Court found that the existence of a federal common law nuisance had been proved, and entered a judgment specifying effluent limitations for treated sewage and a construction timetable to eliminate overflows that went considerably beyond the terms of petitioners' permits and the state court's enforcement order.  The Court of Appeals, ruling that the 1972 Amendments of the Act had not preempted the federal common law of nuisance, upheld the District Court's order as to elimination of overflows, but reversed insofar as the District 
Page 451 U. S. 305
 Court's effluent limitations on treated sewage were more stringent than those in the petitioners' permits and applicable EPA regulations.
Held:
1. Federal common law in an area of national concern is resorted to in the absence of an applicable Act of Congress, and because the Court is compelled to consider federal questions which cannot be answered from federal statutes alone.  As recognized in Illinois v. Milwaukee, supra, at  451 U. S. 107, when Congress addresses a question previously governed by a decision rested on federal common law, the need for such an unusual exercise of lawmaking by federal courts disappears.  Unlike the determination of whether federal law preempts state law, which requires evidence of a clear and manifest congressional purpose to preempt state law, the determination of whether federal statutory or federal common law governs starts with the assumption that it is for Congress, not federal courts, to articulate appropriate standards to be applied as a matter of federal law.  Pp.  451 U. S. 312-317.
2. No federal common law remedy was available to respondents in this case.  Pp.  451 U. S. 317-332.
(a) At least so far as concerns respondents' claims, Congress, which viewed the 1972 Amendments of the Act as a ""total restructuring"" and ""complete rewriting"" of the existing water pollution legislation considered in Illinois v. Milwaukee, has not left the formulation of appropriate federal standards to the courts through application of often vague and indeterminate nuisance concepts and maxims of equity jurisprudence, but rather has occupied the field through the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory program supervised by an expert administrative agency.  Pp.  451 U. S. 317-319.
(b) As contemplated by Congress, the problem of effluent limitations for discharges from petitioners' treatment plants has been thoroughly addressed through the administrative scheme established by Congress, and thus there is no basis for a federal court, by reference to federal common law, to impose more stringent limitations.  Similarly, the overflows of untreated sewage from petitioners' sewer system have been addressed by the regulatory regime established by the Act, through DNR's imposing conditions suited to further the Act's goals and bringing an enforcement action specifically addressed to the overflow problem.  Nor does the absence of overflow effluent limitations in the permits and the state court enforcement order render federal common law available, since the relevant question is not what concentration of various pollutants will be permitted, but what degree of control will be required in preventing overflows and ensuring that the sewage undergoes treatment.  Decision is to be made by the appropriate 
Page 451 U. S. 306
 agency on a case-by-case basis, through the permit procedure, as was done here.  Pp.  451 U. S. 319-324.
(c) When Illinois v. Milwaukee was decided, Illinois did not have any forum in which to protect its interests unless federal common law were created.  However, in the 1972 Amendments, Congress provided ample opportunity for a State affected by decisions of a neighboring State's permit-granting agency to seek redress.  Respondents did not avail themselves of the statutory procedures.  Pp.  451 U. S. 325-326.
(d) Section 510 of the Act, which provides that nothing in the Act shall preclude States from adopting and enforcing limitations on the discharge of pollutants more stringent than those adopted under the Act, does not indicate congressional intent to preserve the federal common law remedy recognized in Illinois v. Milwaukee.  Nothing in  510 suggests that the States may call upon federal courts to employ federal common law to establish more stringent standards applicable to out-of-state discharges.  Nor does a subdivision in the citizen suit provision of the Act --  505(e), which provides that nothing ""in this section"" shall limit any other remedies which might exist -- indicate congressional intent to preserve the federal common law remedy.  It does not mean that the Act, as a whole, does not supplant formerly available federal common law actions, but means only that the particular section authorizing citizen suits does not do so.  Pp.  451 U. S. 327-329.
(e) The legislative history of the 1972 Amendments with regard to certain discussions as to provisions relating to the effect of the amendments on pending lawsuits is not relevant.  The discussions focused on suits brought under federal statutes, not federal common law, related to suits brought by or against the Federal Government, and did not suggest any intent concerning the continued validity of federal common law.  Pp.  451 U. S. 329-332.
599 F.2d 151, vacated and remanded.

 NEWELL BRIDGE & RAILWAY COMPANYv. Richard J. DAILEY, State Tax Commissioner of West VirginiaNo. 80-500 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 27, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner is a West Virginia corporation. It pays West Virginia property, capital stock, and income taxes. Petitioner's sole business is the operation and maintenance of a toll bridge across the Ohio River. The bridge spans the river between Newell, W. Va., and East Liverpool, Ohio. Two-thirds of the bridge is within West Virginia and one-third is within Ohio. The bridge has only one entrance and exit in each State and carries an equal volume of traffic in both directions. There is a single tollbooth, located on the Ohio side. 
 The West Virginia Business and Occupation Tax, W.Va.Code 11-13-2 ( 1974), imposes an annual privilege tax on persons, including corporations, measured by gross receipts. The statute, however, specifically exempts "" gross income derived from commerce between this State and other states of the United States. . . ."" 11-13-2d. Since 1933, petitioner has regularly reported all tolls collected in its operation of the bridge, but has claimed that this income falls within the exemption for income received from interstate commerce. 
 In January 1974, respondent assessed the corporation $83,000 in unpaid taxes, representing the tax due on the tolls received between 1968 and 1972. Petitioner appealed 
Page 451 U.S. 942 , 943
 this assessment and won a reversal. That decision, however, was subsequently reversed, and the tax reinstated, by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. 
 That court held that the exemption for gross income derived from commerce between West Virginia and other States is identical in scope to the federal Interstate Commerce Clause: ""If revenues from bridges are not covered by the federal constitution's commerce clause, they are not excepted from the statute."" 266 S.E.2d 453, 454 (1980). To determine the scope of the federal Commerce Clause, the court relied on two prior decisions of this Court: Henderson Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, 166 U.S. 150 (1897), and Detroit International Bridge Co. v. Corporation Tax Appeal Board, 294 U.S. 83 ( 1935). In Henderson Bridge, the Court upheld a Kentucky tax on the intangible property of a Kentucky corporation, the business of which was the operation of a railroad bridge over the Ohio River between the Kentucky and Indiana shores. The West Virginia court relied on the following language from that opinion: 
 ""Clearly the tax was not a tax on the interstate business carried on over or by means of the bridge, because the bridge company did not transact such business. That business was carried on by the persons and corporations which paid the bridge company tolls for the privilege of using the bridge."" 166 U.S., at 153-154. 
 In Detroit International Bridge Co., the Court specifically relied on the above language to reach a similar conclusion. 294 U.S., at 86, 55 S. Ct., at 333. It upheld a state tax on a state corporation, the sole business of which was to operate and maintain a toll bridge across the Detroit River, from Detroit, Mich., to Ontario, Canada. In both cases, the Court held that the bridge itself was an ""instrumentality which others may use in conducting foreign commerce,"" id., at 85, but that operation of the bridge was not itself interstate commerce. 
 The West Virginia court correctly noted that ""Henderson [451 U.S. 942 , 944]

 this assessment and won a reversal. That decision, however, was subsequently reversed, and the tax reinstated, by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. 
 That court held that the exemption for gross income derived from commerce between West Virginia and other States is identical in scope to the federal Interstate Commerce Clause: ""If revenues from bridges are not covered by the federal constitution's commerce clause, they are not excepted from the statute."" 266 S.E.2d 453, 454 (1980). To determine the scope of the federal Commerce Clause, the court relied on two prior decisions of this Court: Henderson Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, 166 U.S. 150 (1897), and Detroit International Bridge Co. v. Corporation Tax Appeal Board, 294 U.S. 83 ( 1935). In Henderson Bridge, the Court upheld a Kentucky tax on the intangible property of a Kentucky corporation, the business of which was the operation of a railroad bridge over the Ohio River between the Kentucky and Indiana shores. The West Virginia court relied on the following language from that opinion: 
 ""Clearly the tax was not a tax on the interstate business carried on over or by means of the bridge, because the bridge company did not transact such business. That business was carried on by the persons and corporations which paid the bridge company tolls for the privilege of using the bridge."" 166 U.S., at 153-154. 
 In Detroit International Bridge Co., the Court specifically relied on the above language to reach a similar conclusion. 294 U.S., at 86, 55 S. Ct., at 333. It upheld a state tax on a state corporation, the sole business of which was to operate and maintain a toll bridge across the Detroit River, from Detroit, Mich., to Ontario, Canada. In both cases, the Court held that the bridge itself was an ""instrumentality which others may use in conducting foreign commerce,"" id., at 85, but that operation of the bridge was not itself interstate commerce. 
 The West Virginia court correctly noted that ""Henderson [451 U.S. 942 , 944]

This case presents the question whether a school board may enact a policy which, for budgetary reasons, favors the hiring of less experienced teachers.

 Applicant, the State of California (hereafter State), seeks a stay of the judgment of the California Court of Appeal (Fifth Appellate District) in this case after the Supreme Court of California denied the State's petition for hearing on March 17, 1981, with Justices Mosk and Richardson expressing the view that the petition should be granted.

She was struck with a wooden dowel, bludgeoned with a fireplace poker, stabbed with an ice pick, and finally strangled with a telephone cord. On the evening of the murder respondent, a minor, was arrested along with a codefendant. He was brought to a substation of the Tulare County Sheriff's Department and advised of his Miranda rights.

No. 79-512
Argued December 1, 1980
Decided April 21, 1981
451 U.S. 156

Syllabus 
Respondent longshoreman, an employee of respondent stevedore who was engaged by petitioner shipowner to load its vessel, was injured while working in the ship's hold when he was struck by cargo that fell from a pallet being held in suspension by a winch that was part of the ship's gear and was being operated by another longshoreman.  The winch's braking mechanism allegedly had been malfunctioning for two days preceding the day of the accident, but there was a dispute as to whether the cargo fell because the suspended pallet was swinging back and forth or because the braking mechanism slipped while the pallet was suspended, and as to whether the shipowner knew or should have known of the alleged condition of the winch.  Respondent longshoreman brought suit against petitioner under the provision of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act as amended in 1972, 33 U.S.C.  905(b), which states that a longshoreman injured ""by the negligence of a vessel . . . may bring an action against such vessel as a third party,"" and that the vessel's liability ""shall not be based upon the warranty of seaworthiness.""  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner, holding that, under the negligence standards governing liability under  905(b), a shipowner is not liable for dangerous conditions created by the stevedore's negligence while the stevedore is in exclusive control of the work, and that, even if petitioner knew or should have known of the defective winch, a shipowner has no duty to warn the stevedore or his employees of open and obvious defects.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, under the proper standard, petitioner had a duty to continue to inspect conditions of the vessel even if it had been turned over to the stevedore in safe condition, and that, if dangerous conditions subsequently developed, in light of the vessel's practical opportunities to discover and remedy the dangers, failure to do so could be negligence.  Concluding that there were several material facts in dispute that were for a jury to resolve, the court remanded the case for further proceedings.
Held:
1. A shipowner has a duty to have the ship and its equipment in such 
Page 451 U. S. 157
 condition that the stevedore may carry on its cargo operations with reasonable safety; and if the shipowner fails at least to warn the stevedore of hidden danger which was known to the shipowner, or should have been known to him in the exercise of reasonable care, he is liable if his negligence causes injury to a longshoreman.  But once the stevedore's cargo operations have begun, absent contract provision, positive law, or custom to the contrary, the shipowner has no general duty under  905(b) by way of supervision or inspection to exercise reasonable care to discover dangerous conditions that develop within the confines of the cargo operations that are assigned to the stevedore.  Thus, the shipowner is not liable to the longshoremen for injuries caused by dangers unknown to the owner and about which he had no duty to inform himself.  This conclusion is consistent with Congress' intent under the 1972 Amendments of the Act to foreclose the shipowner's previous faultless liability based on a theory of unseaworthiness or nondelegable duty.  The shipowner, within limits, is entitled to rely on the stevedore, and owes no duty to the longshoreman to inspect or supervise cargo operations.  Pp.  451 U. S. 166-172.
2. However, there are circumstances in which the shipowner has a duty to act where a danger to longshoremen arises from the malfunctioning of the ship's gear being used in cargo operations.  In this case, it is possible that the stevedore's judgment in continuing to use the winch despite its malfunctioning was so obviously improvident that petitioner, if it knew of the defect and that the stevedore was continuing to use it, should have realized the winch presented an unreasonable risk of harm to the longshoremen, and that, in such circumstances, it had a duty to intervene and repair the winch.  The same would be true if the defect existed from the outset and petitioner must be deemed to have been aware of its condition.  The stevedore's duties under positive law to provide a safe workplace and to use safeguards with respect to the ship's gear, as well as the vessel's justifiable expectations that those duties will be performed, are relevant in determining whether the shipowner has breached its duty.  But an equally necessary inquiry is whether the pertinent statutes, regulations, or custom place or assume a continuing duty on the vessel to repair defective ship's gear being used by the stevedore in the cargo operation.  Here, the record supports the Court of Appeals' holding that there was a triable issue as to whether the shipowner had actual knowledge of the alleged failure in the winch's braking mechanism or was chargeable with knowledge because the winch was defective from the outset.  Thus, the District Court erred in granting summary judgment, and the case should be

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who is of Mexican descent, was tried in Federal District Court for his participation in a plan by which Mexican aliens were smuggled into the country.  Another participant in the plan, one Bowling, was apparently a Caucasian with whose daughter petitioner had been living.  Prior to his trial, petitioner requested that the judge, in his voir dire examination of prospective jurors, ask a question as to possible prejudice toward Mexicans.  The judge refused to ask such question, but did ask questions concerning possible prejudice against aliens.  Petitioner was subsequently convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's challenge of the trial judge's refusal to question the jurors about possible racial or ethnic bias.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  451 U. S. 188-194;  451 U. S. 194-195.
617 F.2d 1349, affirmed.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by JUSTICE STEWART, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that there was no reversible error in the voir dire afforded petitioner.  Pp.  451 U. S. 188-194.
(a) Because the obligation to impanel an impartial jury lies in the first instance with the trial judge, and because he must rely largely on his immediate perceptions, federal judges have been accorded ample discretion in determining how best to conduct the voir dire.  ""Special circumstances"" under which the Constitution requires questioning prospective jurors about racial or ethnic bias exist only when racial issues are inextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial and there are substantial indications of the likelihood of racial or ethnic prejudice affecting the jurors in the particular case.  See Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U. S. 589; Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U. S. 524.  Under this Court's supervisory power over the federal courts, failure to honor a defendant's request to inquire into racial or ethnic prejudice, where such an inquiry is not constitutionally mandated, is reversible error only where the circumstances of the case indicate a ""reasonable possibility"" that such prejudice might influence the jury.  Federal trial courts must make such an inquiry when requested by a defendant accused of a violent crime and where the defendant and the victim are members of different 
Page 451 U. S. 183
 racial or ethnic groups.  See Ristaino, supra; Aldridge v. United States, 283 U. S. 308.  Pp.  451 U. S. 188-192.
(b) In this case, there were no ""special circumstances"" of constitutional dimension requiring an inquiry as to racial or ethnic bias, since the issues in the trial did not involve allegations of racial or ethnic prejudice.  And the circumstances of the case did not reveal a violent criminal act with a victim of a different racial or ethnic group from that of the defendant.  Nor did the external circumstances of the case indicate a ""reasonable possibility"" that racial or ethnic prejudice would influence the jury's evaluation of the evidence.  Pp.  451 U. S. 192-194.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring in the result, concluded that the decision as to inquiry on voir dire as to racial or ethnic prejudice rested primarily with the trial court, subject to case-by-case review by the appellate courts, even in the case of ""violent crimes"" where the defendant and victim were members of different racial or ethnic groups.

Federal trial courts must make such an inquiry when requested by a defendant accused of a violent crime and where the defendant and the victim are members of different 
Page 451 U. S. 183
 racial or ethnic groups.  See Ristaino, supra; Aldridge v. United States, 283 U. S. 308.  Pp.  451 U. S. 188-192.
(b) In this case, there were no ""special circumstances"" of constitutional dimension requiring an inquiry as to racial or ethnic bias, since the issues in the trial did not involve allegations of racial or ethnic prejudice.  And the circumstances of the case did not reveal a violent criminal act with a victim of a different racial or ethnic group from that of the defendant.  Nor did the external circumstances of the case indicate a ""reasonable possibility"" that racial or ethnic prejudice would influence the jury's evaluation of the evidence.  Pp.  451 U. S. 192-194.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring in the result, concluded that the decision as to inquiry on voir dire as to racial or ethnic prejudice rested primarily with the trial court, subject to case-by-case review by the appellate courts, even in the case of ""violent crimes"" where the defendant and victim were members of different racial or ethnic groups.

Syllabus 
Pursuant to an arrest warrant for one Lyons, Drug Enforcement Administration agents entered petitioner's home to search for Lyons without first obtaining a search warrant.  In the course of searching the home, the agents found cocaine and other incriminating evidence, but did not find Lyons.  Petitioner was then arrested and indicted on federal drug charges.  His pretrial motion to suppress all evidence uncovered during the search of his home on the ground that it was illegally obtained because the agents had failed to obtain a search warrant was denied by the District Court, and petitioner was convicted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The Government is precluded from contending in this Court that petitioner lacked an expectation of privacy in his searched home sufficient to prevail on his Fourth Amendment claim where this argument was never raised in the courts below, but, rather, the Government had made contrary assertions in those courts, and acquiesced in their contrary findings.  Pp.  451 U. S. 208-211.
2. The search in question violated the Fourth Amendment where it took place in the absence of consent or exigent circumstances.  Pp.  451 U. S. 211-222.
(a) Absent exigent circumstances or consent, a home may not be searched without a warrant.  Two distinct interests were implicated by the search in this case -- Lyons' interest in being free from an unreasonable seizure and petitioner's interest in being free from an unreasonable search of his home.  Because the arrest warrant for Lyons addressed only the former interest, the search of petitioner's home was no more reasonable from petitioner's perspective than it would have been if conducted in the absence of any warrant.  The search therefore violated the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  451 U. S. 211-216.
(b) Common law, contrary to the Government's assertion, does not furnish precedent for upholding the search in question, but rather sheds little light on the narrow issue presented of whether an arrest warrant, as opposed to a search warrant, is adequate to protect the Fourth Amendment interests of persons not named in the warrant when their home is searched without their consent and in the absence of exigent 
Page 451 U. S. 205
 circumstances.  Moreover, the history of the Fourth Amendment strongly suggests that its Framers would not have sanctioned the search in question.  Pp.  451 U. S. 217-220.
(e) A search warrant requirement, under the circumstances of this case, will not significantly impede effective law enforcement efforts.  An arrest warrant alone suffices to enter a suspect's own residence, and, if probable cause exists, no warrant is required to apprehend a suspected felon in a public place.  Moreover, the exigent circumstances doctrine significantly limits the situations in which a search warrant is needed.  And in those situations in which a search warrant is necessary, the inconvenience incurred by the police is generally insignificant.  In any event, whatever practical problems there are in requiring a search warrant in cases such as this, they cannot outweigh the constitutional interest at stake in protecting the right of presumptively innocent people to be secure in their homes from unjustified forcible intrusions by the government.

Syllabus 
Respondent was indicted in an Arizona state court for the commission of a state crime.  Because the charge arose from an act committed while he was on duty as a federal Border Patrol Agent, respondent, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1442(a)(1), removed the case to Federal District Court.  After a jury trial, a guilty verdict was returned, but ultimately the District Court sua sponte concluded that respondent had a valid immunity defense, and entered a judgment of acquittal.  The State appealed, but the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, holding, inter alia, that a criminal proceeding removed to federal court under  1442(a)(1) arises under federal law, and accordingly is controlled by that law.  The court concluded that only Congress can authorize an appeal by a State in a  1442(a)(1) criminal prosecution, and that it had not done so.  The court rejected the suggestion that Arizona's appeal was authorized by 28 U.S.C.  1291, which confers jurisdiction on United States courts of appeals over appeals from all final decisions of federal district courts, except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.
Held :  In a criminal proceeding removed to federal court under  1442(a)(1), a State may appeal under  1291 from an adverse judgment if statutory authority to seek such review is conferred by state law.  Thus, because Arizona law conferred such authority here, and because removal does not alter the nature of the authority conferred, the State must be allowed to appeal from the post-guilty-verdict judgment of acquittal.  Pp.  451 U. S. 239-250.
(a) Arizona statutes, as construed by Arizona courts, authorize the prosecution to seek review when it claims that the trial court has exceeded its jurisdiction or abused its discretion, as is the claim in this case.  Pp.  451 U. S. 239-240.
(b) Respondent, by obtaining a federal forum, fully vindicated the federal policies supporting removal -- permitting a trial on the merits of the state law question free from local interests or prejudice and enabling the defendant to have the validity of his immunity defense adjudicated in a federal forum.  No further purpose of the removal statute would be served by denying the State a right to seek review when that very 
Page 451 U. S. 233
 right is available under state law.  On the contrary, it would be anomalous to conclude that the State's appellate rights were diminished solely because of the removal.  Pp.  451 U. S. 241-243.
(c) This Court's prior decisions restricting the availability of  1291 and its predecessors when the Government seeks to appeal in a criminal case flow from a tradition of requiring that a prosecutorial appeal be affirmatively sanctioned by the same sovereign that sponsors the prosecution.  The intention to restrict sovereign power in this area is adequately addressed when the legislature responsible for that power has spoken in express terms, or when a legislative enactment has been authoritatively construed by the sovereign's highest court.  Section 1291 neither compels nor forecloses appellate jurisdiction in an appeal taken by a State as prosecutor.  Instead, the provision permits a State to appeal if it is authorized to do so by state law.  Arizona can rely on  1291 combined with appellate authorization from the Arizona Legislature.  In the circumstances of this case, no more is required.  Pp.  451 U. S. 244-249.

Syllabus 
The Kenai National Moose Range was created in 1941 as a national wildlife refuge by withdrawing acreage from public lands in Alaska.  Commercially significant quantities of oil underlie the Range, and the Secretary of the Interior issued oil and gas leases for the Range, beginning in the 1950's.  The Secretary has distributed revenues from these leases according to the formula provided in  35 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, whereby 90% of the revenues are paid to Alaska and 10 to the United States Treasury.  In 1964,  401(a) of the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act was amended so as to add the word ""minerals"" to the list of refuge resources, the revenues from which were to be distributed according to the formula provided in  401(c) of that Act, whereby 25% of the revenues are paid to counties in which the wildlife refuge lies, and the remaining funds are used by the Department of the Interior for public purposes.  The Department's Solicitor then made a determination, in which the Comptroller General concurred, that the amended  401(a) superseded  35 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, with the result that the formula under  401(c) was to be applied to oil and gas lease revenues from wildlife refuges.  Petitioner Kenai Peninsula Borough, the ""county"" within which Moose Range lies, thereafter brought suit in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that the amended  401(a) governed the distribution of oil and gas revenues from the Range.  Alaska also filed suit in the same court, seeking a declaration that  35 still governed such distribution, and the suits were consolidated.  The District Court granted summary judgment for Alaska, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Revenues generated by oil and gas leases on federal wildlife refuges consisting of reserved public lands, as here, must be distributed according to the formula provided in  35 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920.  Absent any expression of congressional intention to repeal

No. 79-1404
Argued December 8, 1980
Decided April 20, 1981*
451 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
The Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (Act) established a federal-state grant program whereby the Federal Government provides financial assistance to participating States to aid them in creating programs to care for and treat the developmentally disabled.  The Act is voluntary, and the States are given the choice of complying with the conditions set forth in the Act or forgoing the benefits of federal funding.  The ""bill of rights"" provision of the Act, 42 U.S.C.  6010(1) and(2), states that mentally retarded persons ""have a right to appropriate treatment, services, and habilitation"" in ""the setting that is least restrictive of . . . personal liberty.""  Pennsylvania, a participating State, owns and operates Pennhurst State School and Hospital, a facility for the care and treatment of the mentally retarded.  Respondent 
Page 451 U. S. 2
 Halderman, a retarded resident of Pennhurst, brought a class action in Federal District Court on behalf of herself and all other Pennhurst residents against Pennhurst and various officials responsible for its operation.  It was alleged, inter alia, that conditions at Pennhurst were unsanitary, inhumane, and dangerous, and that such conditions denied the class members various specified constitutional and statutory rights, including rights under the Act, and, in addition to seeking injunctive and monetary relief, it was urged that Pennhurst be closed and that ""community living arrangements"" be established for its residents.  The District Court found that certain of the claimed rights were violated, and granted the relief sought.  The Court of Appeals substantially affirmed, but avoided the constitutional claims and instead held that  6010 created substantive rights in favor of the mentally retarded, that mentally retarded persons have an implied cause of action to enforce those rights, and that the conditions at Pennhurst violated those rights.  The court further found that Congress enacted the Act pursuant to both  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and the spending power.
Held:  Section 6010 does not create in favor of the mentally retarded any substantive rights to ""appropriate treatment"" in the ""least restrictive"" environment.  Pp.  451 U. S. 11-32.
(a) The case for inferring congressional intent to create, pursuant to Congress' enacting power under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable rights and obligations is at its weakest where, as here, the rights asserted imposed affirmative obligations on the States to fund certain services, since it may be assumed that Congress will not implicitly attempt to impose massive financial obligations on the States.  Unlike legislation enacted under  5, however, legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a contract; in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.  The legitimacy of Congress' power to legislate under the spending power thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the ""contract,"" but if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.  Pp.  451 U. S. 15-18.
(b) Applying the above principles to these cases, this Court finds nothing in the Act or its legislative history to suggest that Congress intended to require the States to assume the high cost of providing ""appropriate treatment"" in the ""least restrictive"" environment to their mentally retarded citizens.  There is virtually no support for the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Congress created rights and obligations pursuant to its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Act nowhere states that that is its purpose, but, to the contrary, the 
Page 451 U. S. 3
 Act's language and structure demonstrate that it is a mere federal-state funding statute.  Section 6010, when read in the context of other more specific provisions of the Act, does no more than express a congressional preference for certain kinds of treatment.  Far from requiring the States to fund newly declared individual rights, the Act has a systematic focus, seeking to improve care to individuals by encouraging better state planning, coordination, and demonstration projects.  Pp.  451 U. S. 18-22.
(c) There is no merit to the contention that Congress, acting pursuant to its spending power, conditioned the grant of federal funds on the State's agreeing to underwrite the obligations the Court of Appeals read into  6010.  As noted, the ""findings"" of  6010, when viewed in the context of the more specific provisions of the Act, represent general statements of federal policy, not newly created legal duties.  Moreover, the ""plain language"" of  6010, as well as the administrative interpretation of the provision, also refutes such contention.  Section 6010, in contrast to other provisions of the Act that clearly impose conditions, in no way suggests that the grant of federal funds is ""conditioned"" on a State's funding the rights described therein.  Pp.  451 U. S. 22-24.
(d) The rule of statutory construction that Congress must express clearly its intent to impose conditions on the grant of federal funds, so that the States can knowingly decide whether or not to accept those funds, applies with greatest force where, as here, a State's potential obligations under the Act are largely indeterminate.  The crucial inquiry here is not whether a State would knowingly undertake the obligation to provide ""appropriate treatment"" in the ""least restrictive"" setting, but whether Congress spoke so clearly that it can fairly be said that the State could make an informed choice.  In this case, Congress fell well short of providing clear notice to the States that, by accepting funds under the Act, they would be obligated to comply with  6010.  Pp.  451 U. S. 24-25.
(e) A comparison of the general language of  6010 with the conditions Congress explicitly imposed on the States under the Act demonstrates that Congress did not intend to place either absolute or conditional obligations on the States under  6010.  Pp.  451 U. S. 25-27.
(f) Questions not addressed by the Court of Appeals -- as to whether individual mentally retarded persons may bring suit to compel compliance with those conditions that are contained in the Act, the federal constitutional claims, and claims under another federal statute -- and issues as to whether state law imposed an obligation on Pennsylvania to provide treatment, are remanded for consideration or reconsideration, respectively, in light of the instant decision.

The Act is voluntary, and the States are given the choice of complying with the conditions set forth in the Act or forgoing the benefits of federal funding.  The ""bill of rights"" provision of the Act, 42 U.S.C.  6010(1) and(2), states that mentally retarded persons ""have a right to appropriate treatment, services, and habilitation"" in ""the setting that is least restrictive of . . . personal liberty.""  Pennsylvania, a participating State, owns and operates Pennhurst State School and Hospital, a facility for the care and treatment of the mentally retarded.  Respondent 
Page 451 U. S. 2
 Halderman, a retarded resident of Pennhurst, brought a class action in Federal District Court on behalf of herself and all other Pennhurst residents against Pennhurst and various officials responsible for its operation.  It was alleged, inter alia, that conditions at Pennhurst were unsanitary, inhumane, and dangerous, and that such conditions denied the class members various specified constitutional and statutory rights, including rights under the Act, and, in addition to seeking injunctive and monetary relief, it was urged that Pennhurst be closed and that ""community living arrangements"" be established for its residents.  The District Court found that certain of the claimed rights were violated, and granted the relief sought.  The Court of Appeals substantially affirmed, but avoided the constitutional claims and instead held that  6010 created substantive rights in favor of the mentally retarded, that mentally retarded persons have an implied cause of action to enforce those rights, and that the conditions at Pennhurst violated those rights.  The court further found that Congress enacted the Act pursuant to both  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and the spending power.
Held:  Section 6010 does not create in favor of the mentally retarded any substantive rights to ""appropriate treatment"" in the ""least restrictive"" environment.  Pp.  451 U. S. 11-32.
(a) The case for inferring congressional intent to create, pursuant to Congress' enacting power under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, enforceable rights and obligations is at its weakest where, as here, the rights asserted imposed affirmative obligations on the States to fund certain services, since it may be assumed that Congress will not implicitly attempt to impose massive financial obligations on the States.  Unlike legislation enacted under  5, however, legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a contract; in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.  The legitimacy of Congress' power to legislate under the spending power thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the ""contract,"" but if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.  Pp.  451 U. S. 15-18.
(b) Applying the above principles to these cases, this Court finds nothing in the Act or its legislative history to suggest that Congress intended to require the States to assume the high cost of providing ""appropriate treatment"" in the ""least restrictive"" environment to their mentally retarded citizens.  There is virtually no support for the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Congress created rights and obligations pursuant to its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Act nowhere states that that is its purpose, but, to the contrary, the 
Page 451 U. S. 3
 Act's language and structure demonstrate that it is a mere federal-state funding statute.  Section 6010, when read in the context of other more specific provisions of the Act, does no more than express a congressional preference for certain kinds of treatment.  Far from requiring the States to fund newly declared individual rights, the Act has a systematic focus, seeking to improve care to individuals by encouraging better state planning, coordination, and demonstration projects.  Pp.  451 U. S. 18-22.
(c) There is no merit to the contention that Congress, acting pursuant to its spending power, conditioned the grant of federal funds on the State's agreeing to underwrite the obligations the Court of Appeals read into  6010.  As noted, the ""findings"" of  6010, when viewed in the context of the more specific provisions of the Act, represent general statements of federal policy, not newly created legal duties.  Moreover, the ""plain language"" of  6010, as well as the administrative interpretation of the provision, also refutes such contention.  Section 6010, in contrast to other provisions of the Act that clearly impose conditions, in no way suggests that the grant of federal funds is ""conditioned"" on a State's funding the rights described therein.  Pp.  451 U. S. 22-24.
(d) The rule of statutory construction that Congress must express clearly its intent to impose conditions on the grant of federal funds, so that the States can knowingly decide whether or not to accept those funds, applies with greatest force where, as here, a State's potential obligations under the Act are largely indeterminate.  The crucial inquiry here is not whether a State would knowingly undertake the obligation to provide ""appropriate treatment"" in the ""least restrictive"" setting, but whether Congress spoke so clearly that it can fairly be said that the State could make an informed choice.  In this case, Congress fell well short of providing clear notice to the States that, by accepting funds under the Act, they would be obligated to comply with  6010.  Pp.  451 U. S. 24-25.
(e) A comparison of the general language of  6010 with the conditions Congress explicitly imposed on the States under the Act demonstrates that Congress did not intend to place either absolute or conditional obligations on the States under  6010.  Pp.  451 U. S. 25-27.
(f) Questions not addressed by the Court of Appeals -- as to whether individual mentally retarded persons may bring suit to compel compliance with those conditions that are contained in the Act, the federal constitutional claims, and claims under another federal statute -- and issues as to whether state law imposed an obligation on Pennsylvania to provide treatment, are remanded for consideration or reconsideration, respectively, in light of the instant decision.  Pp.  451 U. S. 27-31.

Syllabus 
After respondent employee had been discharged by petitioner employer for alleged dishonest acts, respondent requested his union to file a grievance contesting the discharge.  The collective bargaining agreement provided a grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of covered disputes.  Respondent was represented by the union at an arbitration hearing which resulted in a decision upholding the discharge.  Seventeen months later, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court against the union and petitioner under  301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, alleging that the union had breached its duty of fair representation and that petitioner discharged him not for the stated reasons, which it knew to be false, but to replace full-time employees with part-time employees.  The court. granted summary judgment for the defendants on the ground that the action was barred by New York's 90-day statute of limitations for actions to vacate arbitration awards.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court should have applied New York's 6-year limitations period for breach of contract actions.
Held:  Given the choices present here, and the undesirability of the results of the grievance and arbitral process being suspended in limbo for long periods, the District Court properly chose the 90-day period for the bringing of an action to vacate an arbitration award.  Cf. Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., 424 U. S. 554.  Pp.  451 U. S. 60-64.
(a) The timeliness of a  301 suit is to be determined, as a matter of federal law, by reference to the appropriate state statute of limitations, and the determination of which limitations period is the most appropriate depends upon the nature of the federal claim and the federal policies involved.  Auto Workers v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp., 383 U. S. 696.  Pp.  451 U. S. 60-61.
(b) Although not styled as one to vacate the arbitration award, respondent's suit, if successful, would have that direct effect.  He raised the same claim that was raised before the arbitrators -- that he was discharged in violation of the collective bargaining agreement.  He sought the same relief -- reinstatement with full backpay.  While his underlying claim against his employer was based on the collective 
Page 451 U. S. 57
 bargaining agreement, the indispensable predicate for the  301(a) action was not a showing under traditional contract law that the discharge was a breach of the agreement, but instead that the union breached its duty of fair representation.  Since the arbitrators' conclusion was, under the collective bargaining agreement, ""binding on all parties,"" respondent was required to show that the union's duty to represent him fairly at the arbitration had been breached before he was entitled to reach the merits of his contract claim.  Thus, the suit is more analogous to an action to vacate an arbitration award than to a straight contract action.  Pp.  451 U. S. 61-62.
(c) An employee's unfair representation claim against his union, even though his employer may ultimately be called upon to respond in damages if he is successful, is more a creature of ""labor law"" as it has developed since the enactment of  301 than it is of general contract law.  And one of the leading federal policies in this area is the relatively rapid disposition of labor disputes.  The system of industrial self-government, with its heavy emphasis on grievance, arbitration, and the ""law of the shop,"" could easily become unworkable if a decision which has given ""meaning and content"" to the terms of an agreement, and even affected subsequent modifications of the agreement, could suddenly be called into question as much as six years later.

Syllabus 
In a class action brought against petitioner airline by a female cabin attendant employee, petitioner was held liable to the class of such female employees for backpay because wage differentials between male and female cabin attendants collectively bargained with respondent unions were found to violate the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  After its postjudgment motions claiming contribution from the unions for a proportionate part of the liability were denied as untimely, petitioner brought a separate action in Federal District Court seeking such contribution.  The District Court interpreted the pleadings as contending that petitioner had either an implied cause of action for contribution against the unions under the Equal Pay Act for discriminating against the class of employees in question or a federal common law right to contribution from the unions for a share of its Equal Pay Act liability, and that the petitioner's claim for reimbursement for its Title VII liability was based solely on a federal common law right to contribution.  The court dismissed the claim for contribution based on petitioner's liability under the Equal Pay Act, but, denying the unions' motions to dismiss, held that there was a federal common law right to contribution for liability imposed under Title VII, at least under some circumstances, and that it would reach the issues as to this right when the facts were properly developed.  Both the unions and petitioner appealed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal for contribution based on petitioner's liability under the Equal Pay Act, but declined to reach the Title VII issue, remanding to the District Court for determination of the unions' assertion that the Title VII contribution claim was barred by laches.
Held:  Petitioner has neither a federal statutory nor a federal common law right to contribution from respondent unions.  Pp.  451 U. S. 86-99.
(a) Even if it is assumed that all of the elements of a typical contribution claim are established in this case, that the policy considerations under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII favor the recognition of a right to contribution, that the unions bear significant responsibility for discriminatory practices that these statutes were designed to prohibit, and that 
Page 451 U. S. 78
 there are circumstances in which an employer may be a ""person aggrieved"" by union conduct that would be remediable under Title VII, none of these assumptions provides a sufficient basis for recognizing the right to contribution asserted by petitioner.  Pp.  451 U. S. 86-91.
(b) The language of neither the Equal Pay Act nor Title VII, both of which statutes are expressly directed against employers, supports implication of a right to contribution in favor of employers against unions.  The structure and legislative histories of both statutes similarly do not support such an implied right.  Pp.  451 U. S. 91-95.
(c) Whatever may be a federal court's power to fashion remedies in other areas of the law, it would be improper to add a federal common law right to contribution to the statutory rights that Congress created in the Equal Pay Act and Title VII.

Argued December 3, 1980

451 U.S. 100

Syllabus 
The city of Memphis decided to close the north end of a street (West Drive) that traverses a white residential community (Hein Park), the area to the north of which is predominantly black.  West Drive is one of three streets that enter Hein Park from the north.  The stated reasons for the closing were to reduce the flow of traffic using Hein Park streets, to increase safety to children who live in Hein Park or use it to walk to school, and to reduce ""traffic pollution"" in the residential area.  Respondents, residents of the predominantly black area, and two civic associations brought a class action in Federal District Court against the city and various officials, alleging that the street closing violated 42 U.S.C.  1982 -- which entitles all citizens to ""have the same right . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property"" -- and also violated the Thirteenth Amendment, as constituting ""a badge of slavery.""  Ultimately, the District Court entered judgment for the defendants, holding that the street closing did not create a benefit for white citizens which was denied black citizens, that racially discriminatory intent or purpose had not been proved, and that the city had not departed significantly from normal procedures in authorizing the closing.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that the street closing was invalid because it adversely affected respondents' ability to hold and enjoy their property.  The court concluded that relief under  1982 was required by the facts (1) that the closing would benefit a white neighborhood and adversely affect blacks; (2) that a barrier was to be erected at the point of separation of the white and black neighborhoods and would have the effect of limiting contact between them; (3) that the closing was not part of a city-wide plan, but rather was a ""unique step to protect one neighborhood from outside influences which the residents considered to be undesirable""'; and (4) that there was evidence of economic depreciation in the property values in the predominantly black area.
Held:
1. The record and the District Court's findings do not support the Court of Appeals' conclusions.  Pp.  451 U. S. 110-119. 
Page 451 U. S. 101

2. The street closing did not violate  1982.  The evidence failed to show that the street closing would prevent blacks from exercising the same property rights as whites, that it depreciated the value of blacks' property, or that it severely restricted access to black homes.  Rather, the record discloses that respondents' only injury is the requirement that one street rather than another must be used for certain trips within the city.  Such an injury does not involve any impairment to the kind of property interests identified as being within the reach of  1982.  Pp.  451 U. S. 120-124.
3. Nor did the street closing violate the Thirteenth Amendment.  A review of the justification for the closing demonstrates that its disparate impact on black citizens could not be fairly characterized as a badge or incident of slavery.  The record discloses no discriminatory motive on the city's part, but rather that the interests of safety and tranquility that motivated the closing are legitimate.  Such interests are sufficient to justify an adverse impact on motorists who are somewhat inconvenienced by the street closing.  That inconvenience cannot be equated to an actual restraint on liberty of black citizens that is in any sense comparable to the odious practice the Thirteenth Amendment was designed to eradicate.

 See 452 U.S. 932. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that capital punishment is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment, I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia, insofar as it left undisturbed the death penalty in this case. Moreover, even assuming, arguendo, the death penalty may under certain conditions be imposed constitutionally, those conditions are absent here. 
 Petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder and forcible rape. The jury imposed the death sentence on the basis of two statutory aggravating circumstances. The first aggravating circumstance was that the murder was ""outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim."" Ga.Code 27-2534.1(b)(7) (1978). We considered this provision of Georgia law in Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420, 64 L. Ed.2d 398 (1980). There, a plurality of this Court held that the discretion of the trier of fact must be narrowed when it considers the possibility of aggravation under 27-2534.1(b)(7). Our decision in Godfrey which was decided after the trial in this case, was available to the Georgia Supreme Court when it reviewed petitioner's appeal. That reviewing court 
Page 451 U.S. 923 , 924
 assumed it could determine for itself the presence of the aggravating circumstance in light of Godfrey. The proper course instead would have been to remand for reconsideration by the State's sole sentencing authority, the trial court. See Westbrook v. Balkcom, 449 U.S. 999, 1001, 541-542 (1980) (STEWART, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (citing Ga.Code 27-2503(b), 27-2534.1(b) ( 1978)). 
 The error of the State Supreme Court in this regard is not remedied by the jury's assessment of another statutory aggravating circumstance in this case. Neither this Court nor the State Supreme Court has the ability to forecast the decision of the properly instructed sentencing authority. Davis v. Georgia, 451 U.S. 921 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). The State Supreme Court's failure to follow the proper course is particularly troubling in cases, such as this, where the remaining ground for imposing the death sentence is itself vulnerable to constitutional attack. The second aggravating circumstance here involved is that the offense of murder was committed while the offender was engaged in the commission of another capital felony, Ga.Code 27-2534.1(b)(2) (1978). The aggravating felony found here was forcible rape. Yet the jury may well have declined to find this aggravating circumstance had the trial judge granted petitioner's request for an instruction on statutory rape. It is uncontested that the victim here was 12 years old, and that Georgia defines statutory rape as sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 14. Ga.Code 26-2018 (1978). It is also undisputed that statutory rape would not constitute an aggravating circumstance permitting imposition of the death sentence. 
 The Georgia Supreme Court reasoned that no instruction on this offense was necessary because statutory rape is not a lesser included offense of forcible rape. This conclusion accurately reflects the legislature's assignment of different elements to each of the two offenses . For statutory rape, the fact of sexual intercourse must be supplemented by proof of [451 U.S. 923 , 925]

 Henry WILLIS, III v. Charles R. BALKCOM, Warden No. 80-6030 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 20, 1981
 Rehearing Denied June 8, 1981. See 452 U.S. 932. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of Tattnall County, Georgia. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted of murder and the jury returned a sentence of death. On direct appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and death sentence. Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and vacate the judgment below insofar as it left the death sentence undisturbed. But even assuming, arguendo, that there are circumstances in which the death penalty may constitutionally be imposed, I believe those circumstances are not present in this case. 
 Under Georgia law, the jury is responsible for sentencing in death penalty cases. In imposing the death sentence in this case, the jury found three statutory aggravating circumstances: (1) the offense of murder was ""outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim""; 1 (2) the ""offense of murder was committed against any peace officer . . . while engaged in the performance of his official duties"";2 and (3) the ""murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding, interfering with, or preventing a lawful arrest or custody in a place of lawful confinement, of himself 
Page 451 U.S. 926 , 927
 or another."" 3 In seeking review of the death sentence imposed in this case, petitioner does not challenge the validity of the findings concerning the latter two aggravating circumstances. He does argue, however, that the trial court's charge to the jury on the first aggravating circumstance was constitutionally defective. 
 This provision, Ga.Code 27-2534.1(b)(7) (1978) (hereafter (b)(7)), was the same one involved in this Court's decision last Term in Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420 (1980). In that case, the trial judge instructed the jury about this aggravating circumstance simply by reading the text of the statute. A plurality of this Court found that practice unconstitutional. It reasoned that the language of (b)(7) does not impose ""any inherent restraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death sentence"" since ""[a] person of ordinary sensibility could fairly characterize almost every murder"" as falling within the language of (b)(7). Id., at 428-429. The plurality explained that to be constitutionally valid, a State's capital punishment scheme ""must channel the sentencer's discretion by 'clear and objective standards' that provide 'specific and detailed guidance,' and that 'make rationally reviewable the process for imposing a sentence of death.' "" Id., at 428 ( footnotes omitted) (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 198, 2937 (1976) (opinion of STEWART, POWELL and STEVENS, JJ.); Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242, 253, 2967, 49 L.

Because the trial court had failed to provide adequate guidance to the jury, the death sentence imposed in that case was vacated. 
 In the instant case, as in Godfrey, the trial court's instruction to the jury on (b)(7) consisted of simply reciting the statutory language. Although both the trial and direct appeal in this case predated Godfrey, petitioner challenged the [451 U.S. 926 , 928]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 20, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 In United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600 (1976), this Court held that when a criminal defendant's successful request for a mistrial is precipitated by "" 'prosecutorial or judicial overreaching,' "" a subsequent trial on the same charges is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Id., at 607 (quoting United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470, 485, 557 (1971)). Because the decision of the Court of Appeals in the present case raises substantial questions concerning the scope of the Dinitz rule, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 Petitioner was tried for conspiracy to distribute heroin. 
Page 451 U.S. 929 , 930
 The prosecution's chief witness was Special Agent Robert Dixon of the Drug Enforcement Administration. During cross-examination, defense counsel succeeded in eliciting several statements that substantially damaged Dixon's credibility. [Footnote 1] Annoyed at this turn of events, Dixon made a deliberate, impermissible, reference to petitioner's prior conviction for armed robbery. Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial, which was granted. Petitioner was subsequently reindicted on the same drug charge. He moved to dismiss this second indictment on the ground that the Double Jeopardy Clause, as interpreted in Dinitz, barred his retrial. The District Judge denied the motion, and a divided Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. 636 F.2d 925 (1980). The majority reasoned that Dinitz was inapplicable because the improper statement was made with the general purpose of prejudicing petitioner rather than the specific purpose of provoking a mistrial and because the misconduct was by a Government witness rather than the prosecutor. 
 The court's reasoning is questionable on both grounds. The central issue presented by this case-whether prosecutorial misconduct must have the specific purpose of provoking a defendant's request for a mistrial in order to raise double jeopardy concerns-has divided the Courts of Appeals.

|450 u.s. 707|"Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana
Employment Security Division
No. 79-952
Argued October 7, 1980
Decided April 6, 1981
450 U.S. 707

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a Jehovah's Witness, was initially hired to work in his employer's roll foundry, which fabricated sheet steel for a variety of industrial uses, but when the foundry was closed, he was transferred to a department that fabricated turrets for military tanks.  Since all of the employer's remaining departments to which transfer might have been sought were engaged directly in the production of weapons, petitioner asked to be laid off.  When that request was denied, he quit, asserting that his religious beliefs prevented him from participating in the production of weapons.  He applied for unemployment compensation benefits under the Indiana Employment Security Act, and testified at an administrntive hearing that he believed that contributing to the production of arms violated his religion, although he could, in good conscience, engage indirectly in the production of materials that might be used ultimately to fabricate arms.  The hearing referee found that petitioner had terminated his employment because of his religious convictions, but held that petitioner was not entitled to benefits because his voluntary termination was not based upon a ""good cause [arising] in connection with [his] work,"" as required by the Indiana statute.  Respondent Review Board affirmed, but the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Indiana statute, as applied, improperly burdened petitioner's right to the free exercise of his religion.  The Indiana Supreme Court vacated the Court of Appeals' decision and denied petitioner benefits, holding that he had quit voluntarily for personal reasons, his belief being more ""personal philosophical choice"" than religious belief.  The court also concluded that, in any event, a termination motivated by religion is not for ""good cause"" objectively related to the work, as required by the Indiana statute, and that denying benefits created only an indirect burden on petitioner's free exercise right, which burden was justified by legitimate state interests.
Held:  The State's denial of unemployment compensation benefits to petitioner violated his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion under Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398.  Pp.  450 U. S. 713-720.
(a) The Indiana Supreme Court improperly relied on the facts that petitioner was ""struggling"" with his beliefs and that he was not able 
Page 450 U. S. 708
 to ""articulate"" his belief precisely.  Courts should not undertake to dissect religious beliefs on such grounds.  The Indiana court also erred in apparently giving significant weight to the fact that another Jehovah's Witness with whom petitioner consulted had no scruples about working on tank turrets.  The guarantee of free exercise is not limited to beliefs which are shared by all of the members of a religious sect.  The narrow function of a reviewing court in this context is to determine whether there was an appropriate finding that petitioner terminated his work because such work was forbidden by his religion.  The record shows that petitioner terminated his employment for religious reasons.  Pp.  450 U. S. 713-716.
(b) A person may not be compelled to choose between the exercise of a First Amendment right and participation in an otherwise available public program.  It is true that the Indiana law does not compel a violation of conscience, but where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists.  While the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise is nonetheless substnntial.  Pp.  450 U. S. 716-718.
(c) The state may justify an inroad on religious liberty by showing that it is the least restrictive means of achieving some compelling state interest.  However, when the inquiry is properly narrowed to focus only on the threat to state interests, neither of the purposes urged to sustain the disqualifying provision of the Indiana statute -- to avoid the widespread unemployment and consequent burden on the fund resulting if people were permitted to leave jobs for ""personal"" reasons and to avoid a detailed probing by employers into job applicants' religious beliefs -- is sufficiently compelling to justify the burden upon petitioner's religious liberty.  Pp.  450 U. S. 718-719.
(d) Payment of benefits to petitioner would not involve the State in fostering a religious faith in violation of the Establishment Clause.  The extension of benefits reflects no more than the governmental obligation of neutrality, and does not represent that involvement of religious with secular institutions which it is the object of the Establishment Clause to forestall.  Pp.  450 U. S. 719-720.

The record shows that petitioner terminated his employment for religious reasons.  Pp.  450 U. S. 713-716.
(b) A person may not be compelled to choose between the exercise of a First Amendment right and participation in an otherwise available public program.  It is true that the Indiana law does not compel a violation of conscience, but where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists.  While the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise is nonetheless substnntial.  Pp.  450 U. S. 716-718.
(c) The state may justify an inroad on religious liberty by showing that it is the least restrictive means of achieving some compelling state interest.  However, when the inquiry is properly narrowed to focus only on the threat to state interests, neither of the purposes urged to sustain the disqualifying provision of the Indiana statute -- to avoid the widespread unemployment and consequent burden on the fund resulting if people were permitted to leave jobs for ""personal"" reasons and to avoid a detailed probing by employers into job applicants' religious beliefs -- is sufficiently compelling to justify the burden upon petitioner's religious liberty.  Pp.  450 U. S. 718-719.
(d) Payment of benefits to petitioner would not involve the State in fostering a religious faith in violation of the Establishment Clause.  The extension of benefits reflects no more than the governmental obligation of neutrality, and does not represent that involvement of religious with secular institutions which it is the object of the Establishment Clause to forestall.

Syllabus 
Petitioner truckdrivers are not paid for the time spent conducting a required pre-trip safety inspection of respondent employer motor carrier's trucks and transporting trucks that fail such inspection to the employer's on-premises repair facility.  Petitioners' union submitted a wage claim for petitioners' pre-trip inspection and transportation time to a joint grievance committee pursuant to its collective bargaining agreement with petitioners' employer.  The joint committee rejected the claim without explanation.  Petitioners then filed an action in Federal District Court, alleging that the pre-trip safety inspection and transportation time was compensable under  6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and that they were therefore entitled to the statutory remedy of actual and liquidated damages, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees.  They also alleged that respondent union had breached its duty of fair representation, and sought to have the joint grievance committee's decision set aside and to have proper compensation awarded under the collective bargaining agreement.  The District Court addressed only the fair representation claim, and rejected it.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, and also held that the District Court was correct in not addressing the FLSA claim, concluding that petitioners' voluntary submission of their grievances to arbitration barred them from asserting their statutory wage claims in the subsequent court action.
Held:  Petitioners' wage claims under the FLSA are not barred by the prior submission of their grievances to the contractual dispute resolution procedures.  Pp.  450 U. S. 734-746.
(a) The FLSA rights petitioners seek to assert are independent of the collective bargaining process.  Such rights devolve on petitioners as individual workers, not as members of the union, and are not waivable.  While courts should defer to an arbitral decision where the employee's claim is based on rights arising out of a collective bargaining agreement, different considerations apply where the employee's claim is based on rights arising out of a statute, such as the FLSA, designed to provide minimum substantive guarantees to individual workers.  Cf. Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36.  Pp.  450 U. S. 734-741. 
Page 450 U. S. 729

(b) There are two reasons why an employee's right to a minimum wage and overtime pay under the FLSA might be lost if submission of his wage claim to arbitration precluded him from later bringing an FLSA suit in federal court.  First, even if the employee's claim were meritorious, his union might, without breaching its duty of fair representation, reasonably and in good faith decide not to support the claim vigorously in arbitration.  Second, even when the union has fairly and fully presented the employee's wage claim, the employee's statutory rights might still not be adequately protected.  Because the arbitrator is required to effectuate the intent of the parties, rather than to enforce the statute, he may issue a ruling that is inimical to the public policies underlying the FLSA, thus depriving an employee of protected statutory rights.  Furthermore, not only are arbitral procedures less protective of individual statutory rights than are judicial procedures, but also arbitrators very often are powerless to grant the aggrieved employees as broad a range of relief.  Under the FLSA, courts can award actual and liquidated damages, reasonable attorney's fees, and costs, whereas an arbitrator can award only that compensation authorized by the wage provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.

Syllabus 
Section 1(a) of the Davis-Bacon Act provides that advertised specifications for federal construction contracts in excess of $2,000 ""shall contain"" a provision stating the minimum wages to be paid laborers and mechanics, which wages must be based on those the Secretary of Labor determines to be prevailing in the locality, and further provides that every contract based on such specifications ""shall contain"" a stipulation that the contractor will pay wages not less than those stated in the specifications.  Petitioner made a contract with the Atomic Energy Commission to provide scientific and management services to the United States in connection with the construction, alteration, and repair of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, a high-energy physics research facility.  The contract was administratively determined not to call for work subject to the Act, and therefore did not contain a prevailing wage stipulation.  Respondent, a former employee of petitioner, brought suit against petitioner on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, seeking damages on the theory that petitioner had violated the Davis-Bacon Act by failing to pay prevailing wages for the construction work.  The District Court entered summary judgment for petitioner on the ground that, since it appeared from the record that there were no express Davis-Bacon Act stipulations in the contract, it would be improper for the court to declare in the first instance that the contract was subject to the Act and to make appropriate wage determinations for the parties.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, if petitioner actually performed Davis-Bacon Act work with its own employees, respondent and his class became entitled to the prevailing wages, and the court remanded the case to allow respondent the opportunity to demonstrate, if he could, that petitioner had used him and his class to perform Davis-Bacon Act work.
Held:  The Davis-Bacon Act does not confer upon an employee a private right of action for back wages under a contract that has been administratively determined not to call for work subject to the Act, and thus does not contain prevailing wage stipulations.  Pp.  450 U. S. 767-784. 
Page 450 U. S. 755

(a) While requiring that certain stipulations be placed in federal construction contracts for the benefit of mechanics and laborers,  1 of the Act does not confer rights directly on these individuals, but is simply ""phrased as a directive to federal agencies engaged in the disbursement of public funds,"" Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677,  441 U. S. 693, n. 14.  That Congress did not intend to authorize a suit for back wages where there are no prevailing wage stipulations in the contract is also indicated by the absence of a provision comparable to  3 of the Davis-Bacon Act, which confers on laborers and mechanics working under a contract containing such stipulations a conditional right of action against the contractor on the payment bond required by the Miller Act.

Under  6202(g)(1)(D) of the Social Security Act, ""mother's insurance benefits"" are available only to one who, among other qualifications, ""has filed application.""  An implementing regulation provides that only written applications satisfy this requirement.  A Social Security Administration (SSA) field representative erroneously told respondent that she was not entitled to such benefits.  And contrary to instructions in SSA's Claims Manual, an internal handbook, he failed to recommend to respondent that she file a written application; nor did he advise her of the advantages of doing so.  After subsequently learning that she was eligible for benefits, respondent filed a written application and sought retroactive benefits that she would have received if she had been properly advised by the field representative.  Her claim for such retroactive benefits was denied in administrative proceedings, but the District Court found for her in her subsequent lawsuit.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The SSA field representative's erroneous statement and neglect of the Claims Manual did not estop the Secretary of Health and Human Services from denying retroactive benefits to respondent for the period in which she was eligible for benefits but had not filed a written application.  The field representative's conduct was less than ""affirmative misconduct,"" and does not justify abnegation of ""the duty of all courts to observe the conditions defined by Congress for charging the public treasury.""  Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U. S. 380,  380 U. S. 385.

Nor is estoppel justified on the basis of any distinction between respondent's ""substantive eligibility"" and her failure to satisfy a ""procedural requirement.""  A court is no more authorized to overlook the valid regulation requiring that applications be in writing than it is to overlook any other valid requirement for the receipt of benefits.

 Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 In 1974, the Memphis Police Department began an investigation of petitioner and his business activities. To further this inquiry, an undercover police officer sought a position as petitioner's handyman and chauffeur. The agent was hired, and from July 1975 to December 1975 lived in petitioner's home. On several occasions during this 6-month period the agent found in the home what he believed to be cocaine. The agent took samples of these substances and gave them to his superior officers. On the basis of this evidence, petitioner was indicted for possession of cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. 
 Justice BRENNAN would grant certiorari. 
 Prior to trial, petitioner moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that it was illegally obtained through a warrantless search of his home. The District Court denied the suppression motion and petitioner was convicted. The Court of Appeals also rejected petitioner's Fourth Amendment claim, concluding that there was no ""precedent to support the suggestion that the Fourth Amendment requires law enforcement agencies to seek prior judicial approval in the form 
Page 450 U.S. 1045 , 1046
 of a warrant before utilizing an undercover agent."" 621 F.2d 251, 252 ( 6th Cir.). Two judges dissented from the subsequent denial of petitioner's request for rehearing en banc. 632 F.2d 1 (6th Cir.). Because the panel opinion resolves an issue of substantial importance in a manner not supported by our prior decisions, I would grant the petition for certiorari. 
 The Fourth Amendment accords special protection to a person's expectation of privacy in his own home. Payton v. New York 445 U.S. 573, 585, 589-590, 1379, 1381-82 (1980); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 561, 565, 3084, 3086 (1976); Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 511, 682 (1961).

New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443 (1971); Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10 (1948). We have consistently held that these restrictions do not vanish simply because the government seeks to obtain incriminating evidence through deception rather than through a routine search. In Gouled v. United States, 255 U.S. 298, 306, 264 (1921), a Government agent gained admission into the office of a criminal suspect on the pretext of paying a social visit. During the visit, the agent surreptitiously seized incriminating evidence that was later used in a criminal prosecution against the suspect. This Court, in unanimously concluding that the warrantless search and seizure violated the Fourth Amendment, reasoned: 
 ""The prohibition of the Fourth Amendment is against all unreasonable searches and seizures and if for a Government officer to obtain entrance to a man's house or office by force or by an illegal threat or show of force, amounting to coercion, and then to search for and seize his private papers would be an unreasonable and there- [450 U.S. 1045 , 1047]

Under an Illinois statute, real property owners who contest their property taxes are required first to exhaust their available administrative remedy and, if unsuccessful, are then afforded a legal remedy requiring the payment of the taxes under protest and a subsequent state court challenge.  The customary delay from the time of payment until the receipt of refund upon successful protest is two years, and the refund is not accompanied by a payment of interest.  The beneficial owner of an apartment building in Cook County, Ill., challenged the tax assessment of her property for a certain tax year, but, after an unsuccessful administrative appeal, refused to pay the taxes and instead brought an action in Federal District Court for injunctive relief against petitioners (the Treasurer and Assessor of Cook County), alleging, inter alia, that, by requiring her to pay taxes in excess of the lawful amount, they deprived her of equal protection and due process secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction pursuant to the Tax Injunction Act, which prohibits federal district courts from enjoining the assessment, levy, or collection of state taxes where ""a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.""  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Tax Injunction Act did not bar federal district court jurisdiction because Illinois' procedure of no-interest refunds after two years was not ""a plain, speedy and efficient remedy.""
Held:  The Illinois refund procedure is ""a plain, speedy and efficient remedy"" within the meaning of the Tax Injunction Act, thereby barring federal jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief.  Pp.  450 U. S. 512-528.
(a) The language of the ""plain, speedy and efficient remedy"" exception appears to require a state court remedy that meets certain minimal procedural criteria, and the Tax Injunction Act's legislative history supports this procedural interpretation.  Here, the Illinois state court refund procedure provided the taxpayer with a ""full hearing and judicial determination"" at which she might raise any and all constitutional objections to the taxes, and review was authorized in the higher Illinois 
Page 450 U. S. 504
 courts and ultimately could be obtained in this Court.  She did not allege any procedural defect in the Illinois remedy, other than delay, that would preclude preservation and consideration of her federal rights, but rather alleged that Illinois' failure to pay interest on the tax refund made the remedy not ""plain, speedy and efficient.""  Any ""federal right"" she might have to receive interest could be assert.ed in the state court legal proceeding.  Pp.  450 U. S. 512-515.
(b) With respect to whether the Illinois remedy was ""plain,"" respondent has not alleged that the remedy is uncertain or otherwise unclear.  There is no question that, under the Illinois procedure, the court will hear and decide any federal claim; paying interest or eliminating delay would not make the remedy any more ""plain.""  Pp.  450 U. S. 516-517.
(c) Because the Illinois remedy imposes no unusual hardship on the taxpayer requiring ineffectual activity or an unnecessary expenditure of time or energy, it cannot be said that it is not ""efficient.""  Pp.  450 U. S. 517-518.
(d) Assessing the 2-year delay in receiving a refund against the usual time for similar litigation, such delay is not unusual and, under the circumstances of this case, did not fall outside the boundary of a ""speedy"" remedy.  Pp.  450 U. S. 518-521.
(e) The Tax Injunction Act's overall purpose to limit drastically federal district court jurisdiction to interfere with so important a local concern as the collection of taxes is consistent with the view that the ""plain, speedy and efficient remedy"" exception to the Act's prohibition was only designed to require that the state remedy satisfy certain procedural criteria, and that Illinois' refund procedure meets such criteria.  It would be unreasonable to construe a statute passed with such a purpose to mean that Congress nevertheless wanted taxpayers from States not paying interest on refunds to have unimpaired access to the federal courts.  If Congress had meant to carve out such an expansive exception, some mention of it would be expected, and there is none.  Pp.  450 U. S. 522-524.
(f) Although the Tax Injunction Act had its roots in federal equity practice, nevertheless, where it appears that not every wrinkle of such practice was codified intact, but rather that Congress, among other things, legislated to solve an existing problem by cutting back federal equity jurisdiction, the Act will not be interpreted to incorporate that portion of federal equity practice arguably viewing a no-interest refund remedy as inadequate.  Pp.  450 U. S. 524-526.
(g) The reasons supporting federal noninterference with state tax administration -- such as the dependency of st.ate budgets on the receipt of local tax revenues and the havoc that would be caused if federal injunctive relief against collection of state or local taxes were widely

Syllabus 
By a tribal regulation, the Crow Tribe of Montana sought to prohibit hunting and fishing within its reservation by anyone who is not a member of the Tribe.  Relying on its purported ownership of the bed of the Big Horn River, on treaties which created its reservation, and on its inherent power as a sovereign, the Tribe claimed authority to prohibit hunting and fishing by nonmembers of the Tribe even on lands within the reservation owned in fee simple by non-Indians.  Montana, however, continued to assert its authority to regulate hunting and fishing by non-Indians within the reservation.  The First Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1851, in which the signatory tribes acknowledged various designated lands as their respective territories, specified that, by making the treaty, the tribes did not ""surrender the privilege of hunting, fishing, or passing over"" any of the lands in dispute.  In 1868, the Second Treaty of Fort Laramie established the Crow Reservation, including land through which the Big Horn River flows, and provided that the reservation ""shall be . . . set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation"" of the Tribe, and that no non-Indians except Government agents ""shall ever be permitted to pass over, settle upon, or reside in"" the reservation.  To resolve the conflict between the Tribe and the State, the United States, proceeding in its own right and as fiduciary for the Tribe, filed the present action, seeking a declaratory judgment quieting title to the riverbed in the United States as trustee for the Tribe and establishing that the Tribe and the United States have sole authority to regulate hunting and fishing within the reservation, and an injunction requiring Montana to secure the Tribe's permission before issuing hunting or fishing licenses for use within the reservation.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  It held that the bed and banks of the river were held by the United States in trust for the Tribe; that the Tribe could regulate hunting and fishing within the reservation by nonmembers, except for hunting and fishing on fee lands by resident nonmember owners of those lands; and that nonmembers permitted by the Tribe to hunt or fish within the reservation remained subject to Montana's fish and game laws.
Held:
1. Title to the bed of the Big Horn River passed to Montana upon 
Page 450 U. S. 545
 its admission into the Union, the United States not having conveyed beneficial ownership of the riverbed to the Crow Tribe by the treaties of 1851 or 1868.  As a general principle, the Federal Government holds lands under navigable waters in trust for future States, to be granted to such States when they enter the Union, and there is a strong presumption against conveyance of such lands by the United States.  The 1851 treaty failed to overcome t.his presumption, since it did not, by its terms, formally convey any land to the Indians at all.  And whatever property rights the 1868 treaty created, its language is not strong enough to overcome the presumption against the sovereign's conveyance of the riverbed.  Cf. United States v. Holt State Bank, 270 U. S. 49.  Moreover, the situation of the Crow Indians at the time of the treaties presented no ""public exigency"" which would have required Congress to depart from its policy of reserving ownership of beds under navigable waters for the future States.  Pp.  450 U. S. 550-557.
2. Although the Tribe may prohibit or regulate hunting or fishing by nonmembers on land belonging to the Tribe or held by the United States in trust for the Tribe, it has no power to regulate non-Indian fishing and hunting on reservation land owned in fee by nonmembers of the Tribe.  Pp.  450 U. S. 557-567.
(a) The 1851 treaty nowhere suggested that Congress intended to grant such power to the Tribe.  And while the 1868 treaty obligated the United States to prohibit most non-Indians from residing on or passing through reservation lands used and occupied by the Tribe, thereby arguably conferring upon the Tribe authority to control fishing and hunting on those lands, that authority can only extend to land on which the Tribe exercises ""absolute and undisturbed use and occupation,"" and cannot apply to subsequently alienated lands held in fee by non-Indians.  Cf. Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 433 U. S. 165.  Nor does the federal trespass statute, 18 U.S.C.  1165, which prohibits trespassing to hunt or fish, ""augment"" the Tribe's regulatory powers over non-Indian lands.  That statute is limited to lands owned by Indians, held in trust by the United States for Indians, or reserved for use by Indians, and Congress deliberately excluded fee-patented lands from its scope.  Pp.  450 U. S. 557-563.
(b) The Tribe's ""inherent sovereignty"" does not support its regulation of non-Indian hunting and fishing on non-Indian lands within the reservation.  Through their original incorporation into the United States, as well as through specific treaties and statutes, the Indian tribes have lost many of the attributes of sovereignty, particularly as to the relations between a tribe and nonmembers of the tribe.  United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313.  Exercise of tribal power beyond what 
Page 450 U. S. 546
 is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes, and so cannot survive without express congressional delegation.  Here, regulation of hunting and fishing by nonmembers of the Tribe on lands no longer owned by the Tribe bears no clear relationship to tribal self-government or internal relations.  Non-Indian hunters and fishermen on non-Indian fee land do not enter any agreements or dealings with the Tribe so as to subject themselves to tribal civil jurisdiction.  And nothing suggests that such non-Indian hunting and fishing so threaten the Tribe's political or economic security as to justify tribal regulation.  Pp.  450 U. S. 563-567.

Sections 309(a) and 310(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 (Act) empower the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to grant an application for renewal or transfer of a radio broadcast license only if it determines that ""the public interest, convenience, and necessity"" will be served thereby.  In implementation of these provisions, the FCC, pursuant to its rulemaking authority, issued a Policy Statement concluding, with respect to ruling on applications for license renewal or transfer, that the public interest is best served by promoting diversity in a radio station's entertainment formats through market forces and competition among broadcasters, and that review of an applicant station's format changes was not compelled by the Act's language or history, would not advance the radio-listening public's welfare, and would deter innovation in radio programming.  On respondent citizen groups' petition for review of the Policy Statement, the Court of Appeals held that it violated the Act, concluding that the FCC's reliance on market forces to develop diversity in programming was an unreasonable interpretation of the Act's public interest standard, and that, in certain circumstances, the FCC is required to regard a change in entertainment format as a substantial and material fact requiring a hearing to determine whether a license renewal or transfer is in the public interest.
Held:  The FCC's Policy Statement is not inconsistent with the Act, and is a constitutionally permissible means of implementing the Act's public interest standard.  Pp.  450 U. S. 593-604.
(a) The FCC has provided a rational explanation for its conclusion that reliance on the market is the best method of promoting diversity in entertainment formats.  It has assessed the benefits and the harm likely to flow from Government review of entertainment programming,

Appellant owns land in appellee city that, when purchased as a possible site for a nuclear power plant, was mostly zoned for industrial or agricultural use. The city rezoned parts of the property, reducing the acreage for industrial use, and also established an open-space plan that included appellant's property and proposed that the city acquire the property to preserve it as a parkland.  A bond issue to provide funds for this acquisition was not approved by the voters, and the property remained in appellant's hands, subject to the new zoning ordinance and the open-space plan.  Thereafter, appellant brought an action in California Superior Court, alleging that the city had taken its property without just compensation in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions on the theory that the city had deprived it of the beneficial use of the property through the rezoning and adoption of the open-space plan.  Appellant sought damages for inverse condemnation, as well as mandamus and declaratory relief.  The Superior Court awarded damages but dismissed the mandamus claim, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed.  The California Supreme Court vacated the Court of Appeal's judgment and retransferred the case to that court for reconsideration in light of the intervening holding in Agins v. City of Tiburon, 24 Cal.3d 266, 598 P.2d 25, aff'd on other grounds, 447 U. S. 447 U.S. 255, that an owner deprived of the beneficial use of his land by a zoning regulation is not entitled to damages for inverse condemnation, but that his exclusive remedy is invalidation of the regulation in an action for mandamus or declaratory relief.  On reconsideration, the Court of Appeal then reversed the Superior Court's judgment, holding that appellant could not recover compensation through inverse condemnation and that, because the record presented factual disputes not covered by the trial court, mandamus and declaratory relief would be available if appellant desired to retry the case.  The California Supreme Court denied further review.  Appellant appealed to this Court, claiming that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments required that compensation be paid whenever private property is taken for public use.

Syllabus 
Unlike all other States in the West and Midwest, Iowa, by statute, generally prohibits the use of 65-foot double-trailer trucks within its borders, allowing the use of 55-foot single-trailer trucks and 60-foot double-trailer trucks.  Appellee, a trucking company which carries commodities through Iowa on interstate highways, filed suit alleging that Iowa's statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce.  Because appellee cannot use its 65-foot doubles to move goods through Iowa, it must either use shorter truck units, detach the trailers of a 65-foot double and shuttle each through Iowa separately, or divert 65-foot doubles around Iowa.  Iowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure, asserting that 65-foot doubles are more dangerous than 55-foot singles and that, in any event, the law promotes safety and reduces road wear within the State by diverting much truck traffic to other States.  The District Court found that the evidence established that 65-foot doubles were as safe as the shorter truck units, and held that the state law impermissibly burdened interstate commerce.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  450 U. S. 669-679;  450 U. S. 679-687.
612 F.2d 1064, affirmed.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by JUSTICE WHITE, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that the Iowa truck length limitations unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce.  See Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U. S. 429.  Pp.  450 U. S. 669-679.
(a) The Commerce Clause itself, even without congressional implementation, is a limitation upon state power to regulate commerce.  While ""the Court has been most reluctant to invalidate"" state regulations that touch upon safety -- especially highway safety -- the constitutionality of such regulations nevertheless depends on
""a sensitive consideration of the weight and nature of the state regulatory concern in light of the extent of the burden imposed on the course of interstate commerce.""
Raymond, supra at  434 U. S. 443, 441.  Pp.  450 U. S. 669-671.
(b) Since Iowa's safety interest has not been demonstrated, and since its regulations impair significantly the federal interest in efficient and 
Page 450 U. S. 663
 safe interstate transportation, the Iowa law cannot be harmonized with the Commerce Clause.  The record, including statistical studies, supports the District Court's finding that 65-foot doubles are as safe as 55-foot singles.  And appellee demonstrated that Iowa's law substantially burdens interstate commerce.  In addition to the increased costs of trucking companies in routing 65-foot doubles around Iowa or using smaller truck units through the State, Iowa's law may aggravate, rather than ameliorate, the problem of highway accidents.  Iowa's restriction -- resulting in either more smaller trucks being driven through Iowa or the same number of larger trucks being driven longer distances to bypass Iowa -- requires more highway miles to be driven to transport the same quantity of goods.  Other things being equal, accidents are proportional to distance traveled.  Thus, if 65-foot doubles are as safe as 55-foot singles, Iowa's law tends to increase the number of accidents, and to shift their incidence from Iowa to other States.  Pp.  450 U. S. 671-675.
(c) While the Court normally accords ""special deference"" to a state legislature's judgment in enacting highway regulations, Raymond, supra, at  434 U. S. 444, n. 18, less deference is due where, as here, the local regulation bears disproportionately on out-of-state residents and businesses.  Exemptions in Iowa's statutory scheme -- particularly those permitting single-trailer trucks hauling livestock or farm vehicles to be as long as 60 feet, and permitting cities abutting other States to enact local ordinances to adopt the larger length limitation of the neighboring State, and thus allow otherwise oversized trucks within the city limits and in nearby commercial zones -- secure to Iowans many of the benefits of large trucks while shunting to neighboring States many of the costs associated with their use.  Moreover, the history of the ""border cities exemption"" suggests that Iowa's statute may not have been designed to ban dangerous trucks, but rather to discourage interstate truck traffic.  A State cannot constitutionally promote its own parochial interests by requiring safe vehicles to detour around it.  Pp.  450 U. S. 675-678.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded that, in considering a Commerce Clause challenge to a state regulation, the judicial task is to balance the burden imposed on commerce against the local benefits sought to be achieved by the State's lawmakers.  It is not the function of the court to decide whether, in fact, the regulation promotes its intended purpose, so long as an examination of the evidence before or available to the lawmaker indicates that the regulation is not wholly irrational in light of its purposes.  Here, the safety advantages and disadvantages of the different types and lengths of trucks involved need not be analyzed, since the record and the legislative history of the Iowa regulation establish that those differences were irrelevant to Iowa's decision to maintain its regulation.  Rather, Iowa 
Page 450 U. S. 664
 sought to discourage interstate truck traffic on its highways.  This purpose, being protectionist in nature, is impermissible under the Commerce Clause.  Iowa may not shunt off its fair share of the burden of maintaining interstate truck routes, nor may it create increased hazards on the highways of neighboring States in order to decrease the hazards on Iowa highways.  Pp.  450 U. S. 679-687.
POWELL, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which WHITE, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.  BRENNAN, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which MARSHALL, J., joined, post, p.  450 U. S. 679.

A Utah statute requires a physician to ""[n]otify, if possible,"" the parents or guardian of a minor upon whom an abortion is to be performed.  Appellant, while an unmarried minor living with and dependent on her parents, became pregnant.  A physician advised her that an abortion would be in her best medical interest but, because of the statute, refused to perform the abortion without first notifying her parents.  Believing that she should proceed with the abortion without notifying her parents, appellant instituted a suit in state court seeking a declaration that the statute is unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement.  She sought to represent a class consisting of unmarried minors ""who are suffering unwanted pregnancies and desire to terminate the pregnancies but may not do so"" because of their physicians' insistence on complying with the statute.  The trial court upheld the statute as not unconstitutionally restricting a minor's right of privacy to obtain an abortion or to enter into a doctor-patient relationship.  The Utah Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. Since appellant did not allege or offer evidence that either she or any member of her class is mature or emancipated, she lacks standing to challenge the Utah statute as being unconstitutional on its face on the ground of overbreadth in that it could be construed to apply to all unmarried minor girls, including those who are mature and emancipated.  Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297.  Moreover, the State is bound by a ruling in another case that the statute does not apply to emancipated minors, and the Utah Supreme Court has had no occasion to consider the statute's application to mature minors.  Pp.  450 U. S. 405-407.
2. As applied to an unemancipated minor girl living with and dependent upon her parents, and making no claim or showing as to maturity or as to her relations with her parents, the Utah statute serves important state interests, is narrowly drawn to protect only those interests, and does not violate any guarantees of the Constitution.  Pp.  450 U. S. 407-413.
(a) Although a state may not constitutionally legislate a blanket, unreviewable power of parents to veto their daughter's abortion, Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622; Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, a statute getting out a mere requirement of parental notice when possible does not violate the constitutional rights of an immature, dependent minor.  Pp.  450 U. S. 407-410. 
Page 450 U. S. 399

(b) The Utah statute does not give parents a veto power over the minor's abortion decision.  As applied to immature and dependent minors, the statute serves important considerations of family integrity and protecting adolescents, as well as providing an opportunity for parents to supply essential medical and other information to the physician.  The statute is not unconstitutional for failing to specify what information parents may furnish to physicians, or to provide for a mandatory period of delay after the physician notifies the parents; or because the State allows a pregnant minor to consent to other medical procedures without formal notice to her parents if she carries the child to term; or because the notice requirement may inhibit some minors from seeking abortions.

450 U.S. 455

Syllabus 
In 1974, the husband of appellee Feenstra (hereafter appellee), without her knowledge, executed a mortgage on their jointly owned home as security on the husband's promissory note to appellant.  The husband executed the mortgage pursuant to a now superseded Louisiana statute (Art. 2404) that gave a husband the unilateral right to dispose of jointly owned community property without his spouse's consent.  In 1976, after appellee refused to pay her husband's note, appellant commenced foreclosure proceedings and instituted the instant action in Federal District Court for declaratory relief.  Appellee asserted a counterclaim challenging the constitutionality of Art. 2404, and Louisiana and its Governor were joined as third-party defendants on the counterclaim.  The District Court granted the State's motion for summary judgment.  While appellee's appeal to the Court of Appeals was pending, Louisiana completely revised its community property code provisions so as to grant spouses equal control over the disposition of such property.  Because the new code did not take effect until January 1, 1980, it did not control the mortgage executed by appellee's husband.  The Court of Appeals held that Art. 2404 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but limited its decision to prospective application because the ruling ""would create a substantial hardship with respect to property rights and obligations within the State of Louisiana.""
Held:
1. Article 2404 violated the Equal Protection Clause.  Gender-based discrimination is unconstitutional absent a showing that the classification substantially furthers an important governmental interest, and it is immaterial that, under the earlier statutory provisions, appellee could have made a ""declaration by authentic act"" prohibiting her husband from executing a mortgage on her home without her consent.  The ""absence of an insurmountable barrier"" will not redeem an otherwise unconstitutionally discriminatory law.  Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U. S. 762,  430 U. S. 774.  Because appellant has failed to offer any justification for the challenged classification, and because the State, by declining to appeal from the decision below, has apparently abandoned any claim that an 
Page 450 U. S. 456
 important government objective was served by Art. 2404, the Court of Appeals' judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  450 U. S. 459-461.
2. There is no ambiguity on the only other question properly before this Court, which is whether the Court of Appeals' prospective decision applies to the mortgage in this case.  The dispute between the parties, at its core, involves the validity of a single mortgage -- that executed by appellee's husband -- and in passing on the constitutionality of Art. 2404, the Court of Appeals clearly intended to resolve that controversy adversely to appellant.  Pp.  450 U. S. 461-463.

The husband executed the mortgage pursuant to a now superseded Louisiana statute (Art. 2404) that gave a husband the unilateral right to dispose of jointly owned community property without his spouse's consent.  In 1976, after appellee refused to pay her husband's note, appellant commenced foreclosure proceedings and instituted the instant action in Federal District Court for declaratory relief.  Appellee asserted a counterclaim challenging the constitutionality of Art. 2404, and Louisiana and its Governor were joined as third-party defendants on the counterclaim.  The District Court granted the State's motion for summary judgment.  While appellee's appeal to the Court of Appeals was pending, Louisiana completely revised its community property code provisions so as to grant spouses equal control over the disposition of such property.  Because the new code did not take effect until January 1, 1980, it did not control the mortgage executed by appellee's husband.  The Court of Appeals held that Art. 2404 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but limited its decision to prospective application because the ruling ""would create a substantial hardship with respect to property rights and obligations within the State of Louisiana.""
Held:
1. Article 2404 violated the Equal Protection Clause.  Gender-based discrimination is unconstitutional absent a showing that the classification substantially furthers an important governmental interest, and it is immaterial that, under the earlier statutory provisions, appellee could have made a ""declaration by authentic act"" prohibiting her husband from executing a mortgage on her home without her consent.  The ""absence of an insurmountable barrier"" will not redeem an otherwise unconstitutionally discriminatory law.  Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U. S. 762,  430 U. S. 774.  Because appellant has failed to offer any justification for the challenged classification, and because the State, by declining to appeal from the decision below, has apparently abandoned any claim that an 
Page 450 U. S. 456
 important government objective was served by Art. 2404, the Court of Appeals' judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  450 U. S. 459-461.
2. There is no ambiguity on the only other question properly before this Court, which is whether the Court of Appeals' prospective decision applies to the mortgage in this case.  The dispute between the parties, at its core, involves the validity of a single mortgage -- that executed by appellee's husband -- and in passing on the constitutionality of Art. 2404, the Court of Appeals clearly intended to resolve that controversy adversely to appellant.  Pp.  450 U. S. 461-463.
609 F.2d 727, affirmed.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, then a 17 1/2-year-old male, was charged with violating California's ""statutory rape"" law, which defines unlawful sexual intercourse as ""an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator, where the female is under the age of 18 years.""  Prior to trial, petitioner sought to set aside the information on both state and federal constitutional grounds, asserting that the statute unlawfully discriminated on the basis of gender since men alone were criminally liable thereunder.  The trial court and the California Court of Appeal denied relief, and on review the California Supreme Court upheld the statute.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  450 U. S. 468-476;  450 U. S. 481-487.
25 Cal.3d 608, 601 P.2d 572, affirmed.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, JUSTICE STEWART, and JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that the statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  450 U. S. 468-476.
(a) Gender-based classifications are not ""inherently suspect"" so as to be subject to so-called ""strict scrutiny,"" but will be upheld if they bear a ""fair and substantial relationship"" to legitimate state ends.  Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71.  Because the Equal Protection Clause does not ""demand that a statute necessarily apply equally to all persons"" or require ""things which are different in fact . . . to be treated in law as though they were the same,"" Rinaldi v. Yeager, 384 U. S. 305,  384 U. S. 309, a statute will be upheld where the gender classification is not invidious, but rather realistically reflects the fact that the sexes are not similarly situated in certain circumstances.  Pp.  450 U. S. 468-469.
(b) One of the purposes of the California statute in which the State has a strong interest is the prevention of illegitimate teenage pregnancies.  The statute protects women from sexual intercourse and pregnancy at an age when the physical, emotional, and psychological consequences are particularly severe.  Because virtually all of the significant harmful and identifiable consequences of teenage pregnancy fall on the female, a legislature acts well within its authority when it 
Page 450 U. S. 465
 elects to punish only the participant who, by nature, suffers few of the consequences of his conduct.  Pp.  450 U. S. 470-473.
(c) There is no merit in petitioner's contention that the statute is impermissibly underinclusive, and must, in order to pass judicial scrutiny, be broadened so as to hold the female as criminally liable as the male.  The relevant inquiry is not whether the statute is drawn as precisely as it might have been, but whether the line chosen by the California Legislature is within constitutional limitations.  In any event, a gender-neutral statute would frustrate the State's interest in effective enforcement, since a female would be less likely to report violations of the statute if she herself would be subject to prosecution.  The Equal Protection Clause does not require a legislature to enact a statute so broad that it may well be incapable of enforcement.  Pp.  450 U. S. 473-474.
(d) Nor is the statute impermissibly overbroad because it makes unlawful sexual intercourse with prepubescent females, incapable of becoming pregnant.  Aside from the fact that the statute could be justified on the grounds that very young females are particularly susceptible to physical injury from sexual intercourse, the Constitution does not require the California Legislature to limit the scope of the statute to older teenagers and exclude young girls.  P.  450 U. S. 475.
(e) And the statute is not unconstitutional as applied to petitioner who, like the girl involved, was under 18 at the time of sexual intercourse, on the asserted ground that the statute presumes in such circumstances that the male is the culpable aggressor.  The statute does not rest on such an assumption, but instead is an attempt to prevent illegitimate teenage pregnancy by providing an additional deterrent for men.  The age of the man is irrelevant, since young men are as capable as older men of inflicting the harm sought to be prevented.  P.  450 U. S. 475.
BLACKMUN, J., concluded that the California statutory rape law is a sufficiently reasoned and constitutional effort to control at its inception the problem of teenage pregnancies, and that the California Supreme Court's judgment should be affirmed on the basis of the applicable test for gender-based classifications as set forth in Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71,  404 U. S. 76, and Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190,  429 U. S. 197.  Pp.  450 U. S. 481-487.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 23, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice POWELL, with whom Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting. 
 This securities controversy, which has been in litigation for 11 years, involves sales of commercial paper in the 1960's. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has heard the case four times on various issues over the years, and the present petition for certiorari is the third to come before the Supreme Court. The Court today denies further review, and it is indeed long past time that this litigation should come to rest. I dissent from the denial of certiorari, however, because I believe that the Court of Appeals has seriously misapplied the Securities Act of 1933. Its decision could 
Page 450 U.S. 1005 , 1006
 affect adversely the efficiency of the Nation's short-term financing markets. 
 Justice STEVENS took no part in the consideration or decision of this petition. 
 I  
 John Nuveen & Co. (hereinafter petitioner) is a broker and dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the late 1960's, petitioner undertook to sell the short-term promissory notes- commercial paper-of Winter & Hirsch, Inc. (W&H), a consumer finance company. Relying on (i) the company's certified financial statements, (ii) responses to inquiries from banks, and (iii) a brief inspection of company records, petitioner issued a ""Commercial Paper Report,"" similar to a prospectus, on W&H commercial paper. The report reviewed the data in certified financial statements and noted that ""[t]he ratio of debt to capital funds came to 311%-Excellent! . . . Bad debts charged off came to $ 375,000, and recoveries in relation were $173,000-46%, an excellent showing."" Respondents and other customers of petitioner made purchases. 
 Unknown to petitioner and to the public W&H at the time was in serious financial trouble. W&H officers had conspired with auditors from the certified public accounting firm of Lieber, Bleiweis & Co. to tamper with the company's financial statements to make the company appear profitable. Its financial statement for 1968 showed that W&H had earned $ 500,000; in fact, it had lost about $1 million. 
 When the fraud was discovered in 1970, officials from W&H and Lieber, Bleiweis, were convicted of federal fraud charges. Holders of W&H commercial paper were paid about 65 cents on the dollar. A class of plaintiffs, respondents here, sued under a variety of theories to recover the remainder. The issue presently before the Court concerns liability under 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 84, as amended, 15 U. S.C. 77l (2), which provides, in pertinent part:

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 23, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice WHITE joins, dissenting. 
 This case presents the question whether attorney's fees may be awarded under 42 U.S.C. 1988 to plaintiffs in a civil rights action who obtain a preliminary injunction against a city when the city is later denied the right to appeal the issuance of the injunction because of mootness. In my view, the award of attorney's fees in such a situation is not authorized by any statute, and I dissent from the denial of the petition for a writ of certiorari. 
 Respondents brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1981 and 1983 against officials of the city of San Francisco and its police department challenging certain police practices which took place in April 1974 during what became known as ""Operation Zebra."" Beginning in late 1973, a series of vicious random killings and attempted killings took place on the streets of San Francisco. These murders became known as the ""Zebra"" killings. Between December 1973 and April 1974, 12 persons were murdered and 6 others were wounded. The police department of San Francisco responded to this violence by initiating a special investigatorial procedure known as ""Operation Zebra"" to attempt to identify and capture the killers. Police directives and memoranda authorized officers to stop and frisk black males resembling two composite drawings and having described physical characteristics. Over 600 persons were stopped and "" pat searched"" in the course of the operation. 
 Respondents brought two separate actions seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of black males who were stopped or were subject to being stopped pursuant to Opera- 
Page 450 U.S. 1012 , 1013
 tion Zebra practices. The District Court preliminarily enjoined the police procedure and also concluded that respondents were entitled to attorney's fees. Petitioners appealed the entry of the preliminary injunction but before the appeal was heard the Zebra killers were apprehended, convicted, and sentenced. The police investigation of the Zebra killings having ceased, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal as moot and the judgment of the District Court was vacated. Williams v. Alioto, 549 F.2d 136 (CA9 1977). Subsequently, the District Court entered an order awarding respondents a total of $45,000 in attorney's fees. The Court of Appeals affirmed that order, finding that ""by obtaining the preliminary injunction [respondents] 'prevailed on the merits of at least some of their claims.' . . . The preliminary injunction prevented [ petitioners] from continued enforcement of their original guidelines, which is precisely the relief [respondents] sought."" 625 F.2d 845, 847 ( 1980). 
 In my view, an award of attorney's fees under these circumstances is not authorized by 42 U.S.C. 1988. That section provides in pertinent part: 
 ""In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title, . . . the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs."" 
 To treat respondents as ""prevailing parties"" under 1988 because they secured a preliminary injunction is to ignore the fact that petitioners exercised their right to appeal the entry of that order and the fact that the propriety of the injunction was being challenged on appeal at the time the case became moot and the appeal dismissed. No permanent injunction ever issued and there has been no settlement or consent decree. 
 The question raised here is of significance because liability for attorney's fees inflicts severe financial penalties. Expo- [450 U.S. 1012 , 1014]

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES
COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.
In light of the facts of this case and the legal issues it presents, it is inexplicable to me why this Court fails to grant the petition for certiorari and give the case plenary consideration.  Against the backdrop of a death sentence, this case involves the voluntariness of a series of confessions, the proper standard of review of state and federal lower court determinations of ""voluntariness"" in a habeas corpus proceeding, and the applicability of the harmless error doctrine.

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES
COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.
In light of the facts of this case and the legal issues it presents, it is inexplicable to me why this Court fails to grant the petition for certiorari and give the case plenary consideration.  Against the backdrop of a death sentence, this case involves the voluntariness of a series of confessions, the proper standard of review of state and federal lower court determinations of ""voluntariness"" in a habeas corpus proceeding, and the applicability of the harmless error doctrine.  To be sure, the issues presented are difficult.  But that is

 Supreme Court of the United States March 23, 1981 Rehearing Denied May 18, 1981. 
 See 451 U.S. 1011. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice STEWART join, dissenting. 
 Respondent is a former employee of the Sheriff of Dallas County, Tex., who brought suit against the Sheriff on behalf of himself and others to enjoin the enforcement of certain of the Sheriff's rules on the grounds that they infringed certain First Amendment rights. Petitioners, Dallas County and various county officials, sought leave to intervene in this litigation because county funds might be liable for a judgment against the Sheriff. The trial court denied intervention and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. The Court of Appeals then granted the respondent's motion for an award of attorney's fees under 42 U. S.C. 1988 which provides in pertinent part: 
 ""In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title, . . . the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs."" 
 The Court of Appeals stated that respondent was a clear winner on the intervention issue and then explained: 
 ""[Respondent] has prevailed on his underlying claim against defendant Sheriff Thomas. Part of the cost involved in so prevailing was the devotion of his attorney's time and effort in successfully preventing the initial judgment against Thomas from being derailed as a result of [petitioners'] attempts to intervene. [Petitioners] cannot now be excused from bearing the burden of these 
Page 450 U.S. 1022 , 1023
 costs simply because we did not hold they were liable for the judgment on the merits against Sheriff Thomas, an issue never raised or considered by the trial court."" 
 The decision of the Court of Appeals relies in part on the fact respondent prevailed in the trial court on his underlying civil rights claim against the Sheriff. The Court of Appeals, however, ignores the fact respondent has only prevailed in the trial court on this claim. Appeal from that decision is still pending in the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals therefore has authorized an award of attorney's fees prior to there being a final determination that respondent prevailed in "" an action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986. . . ."" Petitioners are being prejudiced by a decision which in the statutory sense was only preliminary. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 40, 107 (1950). The merits of the denial of the motion to intervene, which are entirely separate from the civil rights claim, is the only issue dealt with by the Court of Appeals in its opinion affirming the denial. See Railroad Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U.S. 519, 524, 1390 (1947). Only last Term we explained in Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754 (1980): 
 The award of attorney's fees under 1988 against the petitioners who were not defendants in this civil rights litigation is permissible, if at all, only after there has been a final determination that the respondent has prevailed on the merits on at least some of his claims against the Sheriff. Conceivably, [450 U.S. 1022 , 1024]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 23, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice POWELL, dissenting. 
 The Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy ( DOE) compels 27 energy-producing companies, including petitioners, to submit data in response to 7,200 individual requests for information about their operations. These data concern virtually all aspects of these companies' finances. Upon request, DOE releases data submitted under this compulsion to other federal departments and agencies, including the offices in the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission charged with enforcing the antitrust laws. 
 Justice STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of this petition. 
 The dissemination of this extraordinary volume of data to those prosecutorial Government agencies raises a serious question, as these agencies thereby may obtain information that statutory and constitutional safeguards would bar them from obtaining directly in antitrust enforcement actions. The likelihood that rights of potential antitrust defendants will be violated increases as DOE demands increasingly more data from companies subject to its regulation and then disseminates the information to prosecutorial agencies. Congress has given DOE an investigative power that appears to be intrusive as well as excessively burdensome in its own right. But that power should not become a blanket discovery authority for the use of the Department of Justice and the 
Page 450 U.S. 1024 , 1025
 Federal Trade Commission without the safeguards provided by law against abuse of legal rights. 
 Because of the seriousness of the question whether Congress intended that information obtained by DOE be put to such use, I would grant the petition for certiorari and set the case for plenary consideration.

No. 80-5060
Argued January 14, 1981
Decided March 9, 1981
450 U.S. 288

Syllabus 
At petitioner's criminal trial in a Kentucky court in which no testimony was introduced on behalf of the defense, the trial judge refused petitioner's requested jury instruction that
""[t]he [defendant] is not compelled to testify, and the fact that he does not cannot be used as an inference of guilt, and should not prejudice him in any way.""
On appeal from petitioner's conviction, the Kentucky Supreme Court rejected his argument that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require the trial judge to give the requested instruction, holding that such instruction would have required the judge to ""comment upon"" the petitioner's failure to testify in violation of a Kentucky statute prohibiting such a comment.
Held:  Petitioner had a right to the requested instruction under the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination of the Fifth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, a state trial judge having a constitutional obligation, upon proper request, to minimize the danger that the jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant's failure to testify.  Pp.  450 U. S. 295-305.
(a) The penalty imposed upon a defendant for the exercise of his constitutional privilege not to testify is severe when there is an adverse comment on his silence, Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, but even without adverse comment, a jury, unless instructed otherwise, may well draw adverse inferences from a defendant's silence.  Instructions to the jury on the law are perhaps nowhere more important than in the context of the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.  While no judge can prevent jurors from speculating about why a defendant stands mute in the face of a criminal accusation, a judge can, and must, if requested to do so, use the unique power of the jury instruction to reduce that speculation to a minimum.  Pp. 450 U. S. 299-303.
(b) Kentucky's interest in protecting the defendant is insufficient justification for refusing the requested instruction, since ""[i]t would be strange indeed to conclude that this cautionary instruction violates the very constitutional provision it is intended to protect.""  Lakeside v. Oregon, 435 U. S. 333,  435 U. S. 339.  The fact that the jury was instructed to determine petitioner's guilt ""from the evidence alone"" does not excuse 
Page 450 U. S. 289
 the refusal to give the requested instruction, since a jury, not knowing the technical meaning of ""evidence,"" can be expected to notice  defendant's failure to testify, and, without limiting instructions, to speculate about incriminating inferences from a defendant's silence.  Nor was an instruction that the law presumes  defendant to be innocent a substitute for the requested instruction, since it is doubtful that it contributed significantly to the jury's proper understanding of petitioner's failure to testify.  And defense counsel's own argument that petitioner did not have to take the stand could not have had the purging effect that the requested instruction would have had.  Pp.  450 U. S. 303-304.

Syllabus 
The Interstate Commerce Act authorizes the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to regulate interstate rail carriers' abandonment of railroad lines, including branch lines.  Under the Act, no such carrier may abandon a line unless it first obtains a certificate from the ICC that the present or future public convenience and necessity permit such an abandonment.  After petitioner interstate rail carrier's branch line in Iowa had been damaged by mud slides, it ultimately decided not to repair, and to stop using, the line, so notified respondent brick manufacturer, which had shipped its products over the line, and applied to the ICC for a certificate permitting it to abandon the line.  The ICC granted the application, finding that petitioner had abandoned the line due to conditions beyond its control, that further repairs would not have been sufficient to insure continuous operation, that the abandonment was not ""willful,"" that respondent had no right to insist that the line be maintained solely for its use, and that continued operation would be an unnecessary burden on petitioner and on interstate commerce.  Respondent had appeared to oppose the application, but never perfected its filing before the ICC and did not seek judicial review of the ICC's decision, but, instead, brought a damages action in an Iowa state court while the abandonment application was still pending.  It alleged that petitioner had violated an Iowa statute and state common law by refusing to provide cars on the branch line, by negligently failing to maintain the roadbed, and by tortiously interfering with respondent's contractual relations with its customers.  The state trial court dismissed the action on the ground that the Interstate Commerce Act preempted state law as to the matters in contention.  The Iowa Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the state abandonment law was not preempted and that the state and federal schemes complemented one another.
Held:  The Interstate Commerce Act precludes a shipper from pressing a state court action for danages against a regulated rail carrier when, as here, the ICC, in approving the carrier' application for abandonment, reaches the merit of the matter the shipper seeks to raise in state court.  Pp.  450 U. S. 317-332. 
Page 450 U. S. 312

(a) ""[T]here can be no divided authority over interstate commerce, and . . . the acts of Congress on that subject are supreme and exclusive.""  Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Stroud, 267 U. S. 404,  267 U. S. 408.  Consequently, state efforts to regulate commerce must fall when they conflict with or interfere with federal authority over the same activity.  Pp.  450 U. S. 317-319.
(b) The ICC's authority under the Interstate Commerce Act to regulate railroad line abandonments is exclusive and plenary.  This authority is critical to the congresfional scheme, which contemplates comprehensive administrative regulation of interstate commerce.  The Act's structure makes it clear that Congress intended that an aggrieved shipper should seek relief in the first instance from the ICC.  Pp.  450 U. S. 319-323.
(c) Both the letter and spirit of the Interstate Commerce Act are inconsistent with Iowa law as construed by the Iowa Court of Appeals.  That court's decision amounts to a holding that a State can impose sanctions upon a regulated carrier for doing that which only the ICC has the power to declare unlawful or unreasonable.  A system under which each State could, through its courts, impose on railroad carriers its own version of reasonable service requirements could hardly be more at odds with the uniformity contemplated by Congress in enacting the Interstate Commerce Act.  Even though the abandonment approval did not come here until after respondent filed its civil suit, it would be contrary to the language of the statute to permit litigation challenging the lawfulness of the carrier's actions to go forward when the ICC has expressly found them to be reasonable.  Accordingly, Iowa's statutory cause of action for failure to furnish cars cannot be asserted against an interstate rail carrier on the facts of this case.  The same reasoning applies to respondent's asserted common law causes of action, because they, too, are essentially attempts to litigate the issues underlying petitioner's abandonment of the branch line in issue.  The questions respondent seeks to raise in the state court -- whether roadbed maintenance was negligent or reasonable and whether petitioner abandoned its line with some tortious motive -- are precisely the sorts of concerns that Congress intended the ICC to address in weighing abandonment requests.  Consequently, on the facts of this case, the Interstate Commerce Act also preempts Iowa's common law causes of action when the judgments of fact and of reasonableness necessary to the decision havc already been made by the ICC.

Petitioners received consecutive sentences on each count, the length of each of their combined sentences exceeding the maximum which could have been imposed either for a conviction of conspiracy to import or for a conviction of conspiracy to distribute.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences.
Held:
1. Congress intended to permit the imposition of consecutive sentences for violations of  846 and 963 even though such violations arose from a single agreement or conspiracy having dual objectives.  Pp.  450 U. S. 336-343.
(a) In determining whether Congress intended to authorize cumulative punishments, the applicable rule, announced in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299,  284 U. S. 304, is that
""where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.""
The statutory provisions involved here specify different ends as the proscribed object of the conspiracy -- ""distribution"" and ""importation"" -- and clearly satisfy the Blockburger test.  Each provision requires proof of a fact that the other does not, and thus  846 and 963 proscribe separate statutory offenses the violations of which can result in the imposition of consecutive sentences.  Braverman v. United States, 317 U. S. 49 distinguished.  Pp.  450 U. S. 337-340.
(b) While the Blockburger test is not controlling where there is a clear indication of contrary legislative intent, if anything is to be assumed from the legislative history's silence on the question whether consecutive sentences can be imposed for a conspiracy to import and distribute drugs, it is that Congress was aware of the Blockburger rule, 
Page 450 U. S. 334
 and legislated with it in mind.  And the rule of lenity has no application in this case, since there is no statutory ambiguity.  Pp.  450 U. S. 340-343.
2. The imposition of consecutive sentences for petitioners' violations of  846 and 963 does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  In determining whether punishments imposed after a conviction are unconstitutionally multiple, the dispositive question is whether Congress intended to authorize separate punishments for the crimes.  Where Congress intended, as it did here, to impose multiple punishments, imposition of such sentences does not violate the Constitution.  Pp.  450 U. S. 343-344.

Argued November 12, 1980

450 U.S. 346

Syllabus 
Held:  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 -- which provides that, if a plaintiff rejects a defendant's formal settlement offer ""to allow judgment to be taken against him,"" and if ""the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer,"" the plaintiff ""must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer"" -- does not apply to a case in which judgment is entered against the plaintiff-offeree and in favor of the defendant-offeror.  Pp.  450 U. S. 350-361.
(a) This interpretation is dictated by Rule 68's plain language -- ""judgment finally obtained by the offeree . . . not more favorable than the offer"" -- which confines the Rule's effect to a case in which the plaintiff has obtained a judgment for an amount less favorable than the defendant's settlement offer.  Moreover, because the Rule contemplates that a ""judgment taken"" against a defendant is one favorable to the plaintiff, it follows that a judgment ""obtained"" by the plaintiff is also a favorable one.  Pp.  450 U. S. 350-352.
(b) Such interpretation of Rule 68 is also consistent with the Rule's purpose to encourage the settlement of litigation, since the Rule provides an inducement to settle those cases in which there is a strong probability that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment but the amount of recovery is uncertain.  It could not have been reasonably intended, on the one hand, affirmatively to grant the district judge discretion to deny costs to the prevailing party under Rule 54 (d) -- which provides that costs shall be allowed to the prevailing party unless the trial court otherwise directs -- and then, on the other hand, to give defendants -- and only defendants -- the power to take away that discretion by performing a token act of making a nominal settlement offer.  In both of the situations in which Rule 68 does not apply -- judgments in the defendant's favor or in the plaintiff's favor for an amount greater than the settlement offer -- the trial judge retains his Rule 54(d) discretion.  Rule 68's plain language makes it unnecessary to read a requirement into the Rule that only a reasonable settlement offer triggers the rule.  A literal interpretation avoids the problem of sham offers, because such an offer will serve no purpose, and a defendant will be encouraged to make only realistic settlement offers.  Pp.  450 U. S. 352-356.
(c) The above interpretation of Rule 68 is further compelled by its

 Patrick SIMPSON, petitioner,v. State of GEORGIANo. 80-5589 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 9, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Georgia. 
 The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals of Georgia for further consideration in light of Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S. 261. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 I agree with Justice WHITE that the record in this case presents clear evidence of waiver and that remand is therefore inappropriate. Rather than grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, however, I would vote to summarily reverse the conviction for distributing obscene materials in violation of Ga.Code 26-2101 (1975) under the view I have frequently expressed, and to which I adhere, that such an obscenity statute is facially unconstitutional. See Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 73, 113, 2664, 2662 (1973) ( BRENNAN, J., dissenting); McKinney v. Alabama, 424 U.S. 669, 678, 1195 (1976) (separate opinion of BRENNAN, J.). 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 We granted certiorari in Wood v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 951 in order to decide whether it is permissible under the Equal Protection Clause for a State to revoke an offender's probation for failure to make regular payments toward the satisfaction of a fine when nonpayment is due to the offender's indigency. This case raises the identical issue. 
 The majority vacated and remanded Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S. 261, on the ground that petitioners were perhaps deprived of 
Page 450 U.S. 972 , 973
 their constitutional right to adequate assistance of counsel by the possibly divided loyalties of their counsel. For reasons that I have explained in my dissent in that case, ante, at 275, I do not believe that the Court's disposition of Wood falls within the limits of our jurisdiction. The same jurisdictional limits apply to this case: petitioner at no point sought relief in the Georgia courts on the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, nor has there been a final decision on this issue by the highest state court in which a decision could be had, as is required by 28 U.S.C. 1257(3). Beyond that, however, the State abandoned any suggestion of conflicting interest and has not raised it here. 
 There is, in my view, even less justification for the majority's disposition of this case than there is for the conclusion reached in Wood. Here, the potential conflict of interest was explained by the trial court to petitioner, and petitioner waived whatever constitutional right he might have had to a different attorney. The transcript in this case shows that the State's attorney raised the conflict of interest issue: 
 ""It is my contention, and the facts would show, . . . that [ petitioner] worked for an organization headquartered on Marietta Street; that they promised they would pay all fines, if any, the lawyer's fees, bond fees and what not and he is now in a position that if his fine had been paid, he would not be where he is. He would not be in jail. . . . [T]he people who promised him that were the people that employed Mr. Zell to come and represent him. . . . If he has employed Mr. Zell, that is one thing, but if they have employed Mr. Zell to come down here and act on his behalf in this matter, I say that there is a clear and distinct conflict of interest ."" Tr. 2. 
 The trial court responded to this charge by asking petitioner if Mr. Zell was representing him and petitioner answered: ""He is right now."" The court continued:

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 9, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Appellate Court of Illinois for the Second District. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice STEWART joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, who has been acquitted of speeding, has filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, claiming that his pending prosecution for perjury and obstruction of justice would constitute double jeopardy under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments if the prosecution were allowed to proceed. I would grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment below insofar as it permitted prosecution of the perjury charge. 
 At petitioner's trial for speeding, the arresting state trooper testified that, after clocking petitioner's speed by radar, he stopped petitioner's car and took his license. When petitioner told the trooper that he was a county board member and was late for an important meeting at the office of the Forest Preserve District, the trooper allowed petitioner to proceed to that office. The trooper followed petitioner, parked behind petitioner's car after arriving at the office of the Forest Preserve District, and then wrote up the citation. The citation listed petitioner's name, address, and driver's license 
Page 450 U.S. 986 , 987
 number and described his vehicle as a 1978 silver Chevrolet, bearing Illinois dealer license plates, number D/L 80E. Petitioner signed his name and address on the back of the ticket. 
 Petitioner, appearing pro se, testified that, on the day in question, he was driving a green Cadillac which did not bear dealer plates. When the prosecutor asked whether petitioner had borrowed or rented a car that day, petitioner responded that he had never driven a car with dealer plates, had never driven a silver Chevrolet, and had not driven a Chevrolet in the preceding 15 years. Petitioner was acquitted of the speeding charge. 
 After the acquittal, petitioner was indicted for perjury and for obstruction of justice. The perjury charge was based on petitioner's testimony that he was driving a Cadillac, not a Chevrolet. The trial court dismissed the indictment on the ground that prosecution of these charges was barred ""under the doctrine of collateral estoppel."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. The Appellate Court of Illinois reversed, concluding that the doctrine of collateral estoppel embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment was inapplicable and that, accordingly, Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436 (1970), did not bar prosecution of the indictment. 84 Ill.App.3d 523, 40 Ill.Dec. 265, 405 N.E.2d 1357. 
 I believe that the Court's opinion in Ashe v. Swenson forbids prosecution of petitioner for perjury. In Ashe, we held that the double jeopardy guarantee encompasses the doctrine of collateral estoppel as a constitutional requirement. Determining the applicability of that doctrine ""requires a court to 'examine the record of a prior proceeding, taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant matter, and conclude whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.' "" 397 U.S., at 444. Thus, in Ashe, petitioner's acquittal of the charge of robbing one of six men playing poker precluded a prosecution for robbing another of the six men, because [450 U.S. 986 , 988]

When the prosecutor asked whether petitioner had borrowed or rented a car that day, petitioner responded that he had never driven a car with dealer plates, had never driven a silver Chevrolet, and had not driven a Chevrolet in the preceding 15 years. Petitioner was acquitted of the speeding charge. 
 After the acquittal, petitioner was indicted for perjury and for obstruction of justice. The perjury charge was based on petitioner's testimony that he was driving a Cadillac, not a Chevrolet. The trial court dismissed the indictment on the ground that prosecution of these charges was barred ""under the doctrine of collateral estoppel."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. The Appellate Court of Illinois reversed, concluding that the doctrine of collateral estoppel embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment was inapplicable and that, accordingly, Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436 (1970), did not bar prosecution of the indictment. 84 Ill.App.3d 523, 40 Ill.Dec. 265, 405 N.E.2d 1357. 
 I believe that the Court's opinion in Ashe v. Swenson forbids prosecution of petitioner for perjury. In Ashe, we held that the double jeopardy guarantee encompasses the doctrine of collateral estoppel as a constitutional requirement. Determining the applicability of that doctrine ""requires a court to 'examine the record of a prior proceeding, taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant matter, and conclude whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.' "" 397 U.S., at 444. Thus, in Ashe, petitioner's acquittal of the charge of robbing one of six men playing poker precluded a prosecution for robbing another of the six men, because [450 U.S. 986 , 988]

Syllabus 
The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which is part of the Social Security Act, provides a subsistence allowance to needy aged, blind, and disabled persons.  Inmates of public institutions are generally excluded from this program, except that, under  1611(e)(1)(B) of the Act, a reduced amount of SSI benefits are provided to otherwise eligible persons in a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility receiving Medicaid funds for their care.  Appellees, aged 21 through 64 and residing in public mental institutions that do not receive Medicaid funds for their care, brought a class action in Federal District Court challenging their exclusion from the reduced SSI benefits.  The District Court held such exclusion unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection guarantees of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment on the ground that the ""mental health"" classification could not withstand judicial scrutiny because it did not have a ""substantial relation"" to the object of the legislation in light of its ""primary purpose.""
Held:  Appellees' rights to equal protection were not violated by denying them SSI benefits.  Pp.  450 U. S. 230-239.
(a) In  1611(e)(1)(B), Congress made a distinction not between the mentally ill and a group composed of nonmentally ill, but between residents in public institutions receiving Medicaid funds for their care and residents in such institutions not receiving such funds.  To the extent that the statute has an indirect impact upon the mentally ill as a subset of publicly institutionalized persons, the record in this case presents no statistical support for a contention that the mentally ill as a class are burdened disproportionately to any other class affected by the classification.  The indirect deprivation worked by this legislation upon appellees' class, whether or not the class is considered ""suspect,"" does not, in the absence of any evidence that Congress deliberately intended to discriminate against the mentally ill, move this Court to regard it with a heightened scrutiny.  Pp.  450 U. S. 230-234.
(b) The classification employed in  1611(e)(1)(B) is to be judged under the rational basis standard, which does not allow this Court to

 substitute its personal notions of good public policy for those of Congress.  Under this standard, and based on the legislative history, it was not irrational for Congress to elect, in view of budgetary constraints, to shoulder only part of the burden of supplying a ""comfort money"" allowance, leaving the States with the primary responsibility for making such an allowance available to those residents in state-run institutions, and to decide that it is the Medicaid recipients in public institutions who are the most needy and deserving of the SSI benefits.

Syllabus 
Respondent filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that her termination of employment with petitioner was predicated on gender discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The District Court found that the testimony for petitioner sufficiently had rebutted respondent's allegation of gender discrimination in the decision to terminate her employment.  The Court of Appeals reversed this finding, holding that the defendant in a Title VII case bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment action, and also must prove by objective evidence that those hired were better qualified than the plaintiff, and that the testimony for petitioner did not carry either of these burdens.
Held:  When the plaintiff in a Title VII case has proved a prima facie case of employment discrimination, the defendant bears only the burden of explaining clearly the nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions.  Pp.  450 U. S. 252-260.
(a) As set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, the basic allocation of burdens and order of presentation of proof in a Title VII case, is as follows.  First, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination.  Second, if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant ""to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection.""  Id. at  411 U. S. 802.  Third, should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.  The defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons, but it is sufficient if the defendant's evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.  To accomplish this, the defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for the plaintiff's rejection.  Pp.  450 U. S. 252-256. 
Page 450 U. S. 249

(b) The Court of Appeals erred by requiring petitioner to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating respondent.  By doing this, the court required much more than is required by McDonnell Douglas, supra. and its progeny:  it placed on petitioner the burden of persuading the court that it had convincing, objective reasons for preferring the chosen applicant above the respondent.  Limiting the defendant's evidentiary obligation to a burden of production will not unduly hinder the plaintiff.  Pp.  450 U. S. 256-258.
(c) The Court of Appeals also erred in requiring petitioner to prove by objective evidence that the person hired was more qualified than respondent.  It is the plaintiff's task to demonstrate that similarly situated employees were not treated equally, but the Court of Appeals' rule would require the employer to show that the plaintiff's objective qualifications were inferior to those of the person selected, and, if it cannot, a court would, in effect, conclude that it has discriminated.  The Court of Appeals' views can also be read as requiring the employer to hire the minority or female applicant whenever that person's objective qualifications were equal to those of a white male applicant.  But Title VII does not obligate an employer to accord this preference.

Syllabus 
Petitioners, former employees of an ""adult"" movie theater and bookstore, were convicted of distributing obscene materials in violation of a Georgia statute and received fines and jail sentences, but were placed on probation on the condition that they make monthly installment payments toward the satisfaction of the fines.  When petitioners failed to make the payments, a probation revocation hearing was held. Petitioners, who had by that time left their jobs in the ""adult"" establishments, offered evidence of their inability to make the payments and stated that they had expected their former employer to pay the fines for them.  When petitioners were unable to make up their arrearages, the Georgia trial court denied their motion to modify the probation conditions and ordered petitioners to serve the remaining portions of their jail sentences.  After the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed, this Court granted a writ of certiorari to decide whether it is constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause to imprison a probationer solely because of his inability to make installment payments on fines.
Held:  This is an inappropriate case in which to decide the equal protection question.  Since the record suggests that petitioners may be in their present predicament because of their counsel's divided loyalties, a possible due process violation is apparent, and the case is remanded for further findings concerning such possible violation.  Pp.  450 U. S. 264-274.
(a) The transcript of the revocation hearing shows that petitioners understood that their former employer would provide legal assistance if they should face legal trouble as a result of their employment, would pay any fines, and would post any necessary bonds.  Petitioners have been represented since the time of their arrest by a single lawyer, who was paid by the employer and who posted bonds in this case and paid other fines when each of the petitioners was arrested a second time.  If petitioners' counsel was serving the employer's interest in obtaining an equal protection ruling that offenders cannot be jailed for failure to pay fines that are beyond their means, which could only occur if petitioners received fines beyond their own means and then risked jail by failing to pay, this conflict in goals may have influenced the trial court's decisions to impose large fines and to revoke the probations, rather than modify the conditions thereof.  Pp.  450 U. S. 264-268. 
Page 450 U. S. 262

(b) If counsel was influenced in his basic strategic decisions by the employer's interest, petitioners' due process right to representation free from conflicts of interest was not respected at the revocation hearing, or at earlier stages of the proceedings.  The possibility of a conflict of interest was sufficiently apparent at the time of the revocation hearing to impose upon the court a duty to inquire further.  If, on remand, the court finds that an actual conflict of interest existed at the time of the probation revocation or earlier, and that there was no valid waiver of the right to independent counsel, it must hold a new revocation hearing untainted by a legal representative serving conflicting interests.

No. 79-1907
Argued January 13, 1981
Decided March 3, 1981
450 U.S. 156

Syllabus 
Respondent mines cement rock and manufactures it into Portland cement.  Section 611(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 allows respondent, as a miner, to deduct from its taxable income a percentage of its gross income from mining as a recoupment of capital investment in the depleting mineral.  Because respondent, as an integrated miner-manufacturer, has no actual gross income from mining, it must base its depletion deduction upon a constructive gross income from mining.  For each of the tax years at issue in this case, respondent used the proportionate profits method prescribed by the Treasury Regulations to compute such constructive gross income.  This method uses the costs of and proceeds from the taxpayer's ""first marketable product"" to derive the constructive gross income.  The regulations define ""first marketable product"" as
""the product (or group of essentially the same products) produced by the taxpayer as a result of the application of nonmining processes, in the form or condition in which such product or products are first marketed in significant quantities by the taxpayer.""
The regulations provide that bulk and packaged products are considered to be essentially the same product for this purpose.  The method required respondent to derive the portion of total proceeds that reflects the ratio between its mining costs and its total costs. Under the regulations, respondent must include in the total costs figure ""all the mining and nonmining costs paid or incurred to produce, sell, and transport the first marketable product.""  Respondent took the position that its ""first marketable product"" was cement sold in bulk, rather than all cement sold, whether in bulk or in bags.  The costs of bags and bagging exceeded respondent's bagging premium (the increase in proceeds for selling cement in bags).  Hence, respondent did not include proceeds from the sale of cement in bags in the total proceeds figure of the proportionate profits method.  Nor did respondent include in the total costs figure of the method the costs incurred for bags, bagging, storage, distribution, and sales.  The result was that the proportionate profits method yielded a greater constructive gross income from mining, and respondent reported a correspondingly greater depletion deduction, than 
Page 450 U. S. 157
 it would have if it had included those proceeds in costs in its computation by such method.  Petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that respondent's reported tax liabilities were deficient, taking the position that respondent's ""first marketable product"" is cement, whether sold in bulk or in bags, and that respondent should have included proceeds from its sale of bagged cement in its calculation by the method, and also the costs incurred for bags, bagging, storage, distribution, and sales.  Respondent then filed suit in the Tax Court for a redetermination.  That court accepted respondent's position, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Treasury Regulations defining ""first marketable product"" and prescribing the treatment of the costs of bags, bagging, storage, distribution, and sales support the Commissioner's position.  Pp.  450 U. S. 165-174.
(a) This Court customarily defers to Treasury Regulations that ""implement the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner.""  United States v. Correll, 389 U. S. 299,  389 U. S. 307.  P.  450 U. S. 169.
(b) Respondent's contention that the Commissioner's position will yield a distorted constructive gross income from mining if it is applied without regard to the particular circumstances in this case, i.e., that respondent's bagging costs exceed its bagging premium, misperceives both the meaning of ""gross income from mining"" and the holding in United States v. Cannelton Sewer Pipe Co., 364 U. S. 76.  Under the Code and regulations, gross income from mining means income received, whether actually or constructively, without regard to value.  In Cannelton, in interpreting an earlier statutory definition of ""mining,"" the Court said that
""Congress intended integrated mining-manufacturing operations to be treated as if the operator were selling the mineral mined to himself for fabrication.""
Id. at  364 U. S. 89.  This statement, in the context in which it occurs, does not support respondent's contention that the method used to determine constructive gross income must take into account forces that might cause income to differ from value.  Nor does the difference between bagging costs and the bagging premium warrant a deviation from the regulation's definition of ""first marketable product.""  Pp.  450 U. S. 170-173.
(c) The statutory definition of ""mining"" to include all processes up to the introduction of the kiln feed into the kiln, ""but not . . . any subsequent processes,"" forecloses respondent's further contention that the costs it incurred in the storage, distribution, and sales of its first marketable product, if they must be included in the proportionate profits method, should be treated as indirect costs which benefit the entire mining-manufacturing operation, and hence should be allocated between mining and manufacturing.  The regulations recognizing that 
Page 450 U. S. 158
 storage, distribution, and sales are ""subsequent processes"" are reasonable.  Pp.  450 U. S. 173-174.

Nor did respondent include in the total costs figure of the method the costs incurred for bags, bagging, storage, distribution, and sales.  The result was that the proportionate profits method yielded a greater constructive gross income from mining, and respondent reported a correspondingly greater depletion deduction, than 
Page 450 U. S. 157
 it would have if it had included those proceeds in costs in its computation by such method.  Petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that respondent's reported tax liabilities were deficient, taking the position that respondent's ""first marketable product"" is cement, whether sold in bulk or in bags, and that respondent should have included proceeds from its sale of bagged cement in its calculation by the method, and also the costs incurred for bags, bagging, storage, distribution, and sales.  Respondent then filed suit in the Tax Court for a redetermination.  That court accepted respondent's position, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Treasury Regulations defining ""first marketable product"" and prescribing the treatment of the costs of bags, bagging, storage, distribution, and sales support the Commissioner's position.  Pp.  450 U. S. 165-174.
(a) This Court customarily defers to Treasury Regulations that ""implement the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner.""  United States v. Correll, 389 U. S. 299,  389 U. S. 307.  P.  450 U. S. 169.
(b) Respondent's contention that the Commissioner's position will yield a distorted constructive gross income from mining if it is applied without regard to the particular circumstances in this case, i.e., that respondent's bagging costs exceed its bagging premium, misperceives both the meaning of ""gross income from mining"" and the holding in United States v. Cannelton Sewer Pipe Co., 364 U. S. 76.  Under the Code and regulations, gross income from mining means income received, whether actually or constructively, without regard to value.  In Cannelton, in interpreting an earlier statutory definition of ""mining,"" the Court said that
""Congress intended integrated mining-manufacturing operations to be treated as if the operator were selling the mineral mined to himself for fabrication.""
Id. at  364 U. S. 89.  This statement, in the context in which it occurs, does not support respondent's contention that the method used to determine constructive gross income must take into account forces that might cause income to differ from value.  Nor does the difference between bagging costs and the bagging premium warrant a deviation from the regulation's definition of ""first marketable product.""  Pp.  450 U. S. 170-173.
(c) The statutory definition of ""mining"" to include all processes up to the introduction of the kiln feed into the kiln, ""but not . . . any subsequent processes,"" forecloses respondent's further contention that the costs it incurred in the storage, distribution, and sales of its first marketable product, if they must be included in the proportionate profits method, should be treated as indirect costs which benefit the entire mining-manufacturing operation, and hence should be allocated between mining and manufacturing.  The regulations recognizing that 
Page 450 U. S. 158
 storage, distribution, and sales are ""subsequent processes"" are reasonable.  Pp.  450 U. S. 173-174.

450 U.S. 175

Syllabus 
Respondents filed a patent application claiming invention for a process for molding raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured precision products.  While it was possible, by using well-known time, temperature, and cure relationships, to calculate by means of an established mathematical equation when to open the molding press and remove the cured product, according to respondents, the industry had not been able to measure precisely the temperature inside the press, thus making it difficult to make the necessary computations to determine the proper cure time.  Respondents characterized their contribution to the art to reside in the process of constantly measuring the temperature inside the mold and feeding the temperature measurements into a computer that repeatedly recalculates the cure time by use of the mathematical equation and then signals a device to open the press at the proper time.  The patent examiner rejected respondents' claims on the ground that they were drawn to nonstatutory subject matter under 35 U.S.C.  101, which provides for the issuance of patents to
""[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof. . . .""
The Patent and Trademark Office Board of Appeals agreed, but the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed.
Held:  Respondents' claims recited subject matter that was eligible for patent protection under  101.  Pp.  450 U. S. 181-193.
(a) For purposes of  101, a ""process"" is
""an act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.  If new and useful, it is just as patentable as is a piece of machinery. . . .  The machinery pointed out as suitable to perform the process may or may not be new or patentable.""
Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780,  94 U. S. 788.  Industrial processes such as respondents' claims for transforming raw, uncured synthetic rubber into a different state or thing are the types which have historically been eligible to receive patent law protection.  Pp.  450 U. S. 181-184.
(b) While a mathematical formula, like a law of nature, cannot be the subject of a patent, cf. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63; Parker v. 
Page 450 U. S. 176
 Flook, 437 U. S. 54, respondents do not seek to patent a mathematical formula, but instead seek protection for a process of curing synthetic rubber.  Although their process employs a well-known mathematical equation, they do not seek to preempt the use of that equation, except in conjunction with all of the other steps in their claimed process.  A claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory does not become nonstatutory simply because it uses a mathematical formula, computer program, or digital computer.  Respondents' claims must be considered as a whole, it being inappropriate to dissect the claims into old and new elements and then to ignore the presence of the old elements in the analysis.  The questions of whether a particular invention meets the ""novelty"" requirements of 35 U.S.C.  102 or the ""nonobviousness"" requirements of  103 do not affect the determination of whether the invention falls into a category of subject matter that is eligible for patent protection under  101.  Pp.  450 U. S. 185-191.
(c) When a claim containing a mathematical formula implements or applies the formula in a structure or process which, when considered as a whole, is performing a function which the patent laws were designed to protect (e.g., transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing), then the claim satisfies  101's requirements.

Syllabus 
Respondents, husband and wife who are citizens of Korea and who had been ordered to be deported after an administrative hearing, subsequently moved to reopen the deportation proceedings, seeking a suspension of deportation for ""extreme hardship"" under  244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and applicable regulations.  They alleged that deportation would result in extreme hardship to their two American-born children through loss of ""educational opportunities,"" and to themselves and their children from the forced liquidation, at a possible loss, of their assets, which included a home and a dry cleaning business.  The Board of Immigration Appeals denied the motion without a hearing, concluding that respondents had failed to establish a prima facie case of extreme hardship.  The Court of Appeals reversed, directing that a hearing be held and holding that the extreme hardship requirement of  244 is satisfied if an alien produces sufficient evidence to suggest that the hardship from deportation would be different and more severe than that suffered by the ordinary alien who is deported.
Held:  The Board did not exceed its authority, and the Court of Appeals erred in ordering that the case be reopened.  Respondents' allegations of hardship were, in the main, conclusory and unsupported by affidavit, as required by the applicable regulations.  Moreover, the Court of Appeals improvidently encroached on the authority which the Act confers on the Attorney General and his delegates to define ""extreme hardship"" in the first instance.  They may construe the term narrowly should they deem it wise to do so, and their construction and application of the standard should not be overturned simply because the reviewing court may prefer another interpretation of the statute.

Petitioners, representing a class of present and former black employees and job applicants, sought injunctive and declaratory relief and damages in an action under 42 U.S.C.  1981 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging that respondent employer and unions had engaged in racially discriminatory employment practices.  The parties negotiated a settlement and jointly moved the District Court to enter a proposed consent decree which would permanently enjoin respondents from discriminating against black employees and would require them to give hiring and seniority preferences to black employees and to fill one-third of certain supervisory positions with qualified blacks.  The court denied the motion, holding that, since there was no showing of present or past discrimination, the proposed decree illegally granted racial preferences to the petitioner class, and that, in any event, the decree would be illegal as extending relief to all present and future black employees, not just to actual victims of the alleged discrimination.  The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioners' appeal for want of jurisdiction, holding that the District Court's order was not appealable under 28 U.S.C.  1292(a)(1), which permits appeals as of right to the courts of appeals from interlocutory orders of district courts ""refusing . . . injunctions.""
Held:  The District Court's interlocutory order refusing to enter the consent decree was an order ""refusing"" an ""injunction"" and was therefore appealable under  1292(a)(1).  Pp.  450 U. S. 83-90.
(a) The order, although not in terms refusing an injunction, had the practical effect of doing so.

450 U.S. 91

Syllabus 
After an on-the-record hearing before an Administrative Law Judge and review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in which the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof was employed, the SEC held that petitioner had violated various antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and sanctions were imposed.  Petitioner sought review in the Court of Appeals on the alleged ground, inter alia, that the SEC's use of the preponderance of the evidence, rather than the clear and convincing, standard of proof in determining whether he had violated the securities laws, was improper.  The Court of Appeals rejected the argument.
Held:
1. In adjudicatory proceedings before the SEC,  7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act applies.  It provides in pertinent part that a sanction may not be imposed by an administrative agency except on consideration of the whole record or parts thereof cited by a party and supported by and ""in accordance with the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.""  Pp.  450 U. S. 95-97.
2. The SEC properly used the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof in determining whether the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws had been violated.  Pp.  450 U. S. 97-104.
(a) Section 7(c)'s language implies the enactment of a standard of proof.  By allowing sanctions to be imposed only when they are ""in accordance with . . . substantial evidence,"" Congress implied that a sanction must rest on a minimum quantity of evidence.  And the phrase ""in accordance with"" lends further support to a construction of  7(c) as establishing a standard of proof, suggesting that the adjudicatory agency must weigh the evidence and decide, based on the weight of the evidence, whether a disciplinary order should be issued.  Pp.  450 U. S. 98-100.
(b) While  7(c)'s language is somewhat opaque as to the precise standard of proof to be used, the legislative history clearly reveals that Congress intended to adopt a preponderance of the evidence standard.  Pp.  450 U. S. 100-102.

Syllabus 
Rules of the Democratic Party of the United States (National Party) provide that only those who are willing to affiliate publicly with the Democratic Party may participate in the process of selecting delegates to the Party's National Convention.  Wisconsin election laws allow voters to participate in its Democratic Presidential candidate preference primary without regard to party affiliation and without requiring a public declaration of party preference.  While the Wisconsin delegates to the National Convention are chosen separately, after the primary, at caucuses of persons who have stated their affiliation with the Democratic Party, those delegates are bound to vote at the Convention in accord with the results of the open primary election.  Thus, while Wisconsin's open Presidential preference primary does not itself violate the National Party's rules, the State's mandate that primary results shall determine the allocation of votes cast by the State's delegates at the National Convention does.  When the National Party indicated that Wisconsin delegates would not be seated at the 1980 National Convention because the Wisconsin delegate selection system violated the National Party's rules, an original action was brought in the Wisconsin Supreme Court on behalf of the State, seeking a declaration that such system was constitutional as applied to appellants (the National Party and Democratic National Committee) and that they could not lawfully refuse to seat the Wisconsin delegation.  Concluding, inter alia, that the State had not impermissibly impaired the National Party's freedom of political association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the State's delegate selection system was constitutional and binding upon appellants, and that they could not refuse to seat delegates chosen in accord with Wisconsin law.
Held:  Wisconsin cannot constitutionally compel the National Party to seat a delegation chosen in a way that violates the Party's rules.  Cousins v. Wigoda, 419 U. S. 477, controlling.  Pp.  450 U. S. 120-126.
(a) The National Party and its adherents enjoy a constitutionally protected right of political association under the First Amendment, and 
Page 450 U. S. 108
 this freedom to gather in association for the purpose of advancing shared beliefs is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by any State, and necessarily presupposes the freedom to identify the people who constitute the association and to limit the association to those people only.  Here, the members of the National Party, speaking through their rules, chose to define their associational rights by limiting those who could participate in any binding process leading to the selection of delegates to their National Convention.  Pp.  450 U. S. 120-122.
(b) Wisconsin's asserted compelling interests in preserving the overall integrity of the electoral process, providing secrecy of the ballot, increasing voter participation in primaries, and preventing harassment of voters, go to the conduct of the open Presidential preference primary, not to the imposition of voting requirements upon those who, in a separate process, are eventually selected as delegates.

No. 79-5780
Argued November 5, 1980
Decided February 24, 1981
450 U.S. 24

Syllabus 
Held:  A Florida statute repealing an earlier statute and reducing the amount of ""gain time"" for good conduct and obedience to prison rules deducted from a convicted prisoner's sentence is unconstitutional as an ex post facto law as applied to petitioner, whose crime was committed before the statute's enactment.  Pp.  450 U. S. 28-36.
(a) For a criminal or penal law to be ex post facto, it must be retrospective, that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment, and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it.  Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397,  301 U. S. 401; Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386,  3 U. S. 390.  It need not impair a ""vested right.""  Even if a statute merely alters penal provisions accorded by the grace of the legislature, it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if it is both retrospective and more onerous than the law in effect on the date of the offense.  Pp.  450 U. S. 28-31.
(b) The effect, not the form, of the law determines whether it is ex post facto.  Although the Florida statute, on its face, applies only after its effective date, respondent conceded that the statute is used to calculate the gain time available to prisoners, such as petitioner, convicted for acts committed before the statute's effective date.  Regardless of whether or not the prospect of gain time was in some technical sense part of the petitioner's sentence, the statute substantially alters the consequences attached to a crime already completed, changing the quantum of punishment, and thus is a retrospective law which can be constitutionally applied to petitioner only if it is not to his detriment.  Pp.  450 U. S. 31-33.
(c) The Florida statute is disadvantageous to petitioner and other similarly situated prisoners.  The reduction in gain time that had been available under the repealed statute for abiding by prison rules and adequately performing assigned tasks lengthens the period that someone in petitioner's position must spend in prison.  It is immaterial that other statutory provisions were also enacted whereby a prisoner might earn extra gain time by satisfying extra conditions.  The award of such extra gain time is purely discretionary, contingent on both the correctional authorities' wishes and the inmate's special behavior, and thus none of the provisions for extra gain time compensates for the reduction of gain time available solely for good conduct.  The new provision therefore constricts the inmate's opportunity to earn early release, and thereby

 makes more onerous the punishment for crimes committed before its enactment.  Pp.  450 U. S. 33-36.

Held:  Louisiana violated the Double Jeopardy Clause by prosecuting petitioner a second time for first-degree murder after the judge at the first trial granted petitioner's motion for new trial on the ground that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the jury's guilty verdict.  This case is controlled by Burks v. United States, 437 U.

Id. at  437 U. S. 18.  Burks is not to be read as holding that double jeopardy protections are violated only when the prosecution has adduced no evidence at all of the crime or an element thereof.  The record does not support the State's contention that the trial judge granted a new trial only because, as a ""13th juror,"" he entertained personal doubts about the verdict and would have decided it differently from the other 12 jurors.

450 U.S. 46

Syllabus 
Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act authorizes the Federal Reserve Board (Board) to allow bank holding companies to acquire or retain ownership in companies whose activities are ""so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.""  In 1972, the Board amended its Regulation Y, and issued an interpretive ruling in connection therewith, enlarging the category of activities that it would regard as ""closely related to banking"" under  4(c)(8) by permitting bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries to act as an investment adviser to a closed-end investment company.  Section 16 of the Banking Act of 1933 (Glass-Steagall Act) prohibits a bank from ""underwriting"" any issue of a security or purchasing any security for its own account, and  21 of that Act prohibits any organization ""engaged in the business of issuing, underwriting, selling, or distributing"" securities from engaging in banking.  Respondent trade association of open-end investment companies, in proceedings before the Board and on direct review in the Court of Appeals, challenged, on the basis of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Board's authority to determine that investment adviser services are ""closely related"" to banking.  While rejecting respondent's argument that Regulation Y, as amended, violated the Glass-Steagall Act, the Court of Appeals nevertheless held that  4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act did not authorize the regulation, because the activities that it permitted were not consistent with the congressional intent in both of these Acts to effect as complete a separation as possible between the securities and commercial banking businesses.
Held:  The amendment to Regulation Y does not exceed the Board's statutory authority.  Pp.  450 U. S. 55-78.
(a) The Board's determination that services performed by an investment adviser for a closed-end investment company are ""so closely related to banking . . . as to be a proper incident thereto"" is supported not only by the normal practice of banks in performing fiduciary functions in various capacities but also by a normal reading of the language of  4(c)(8).  And the Board's determination of what activities are 
Page 450 U. S. 47
 ""closely related"" to banking is entitled to the greatest deference.  Pp.  450 U. S. 55-58.
(b) Investment adviser services by a bank do not necessarily violate either  16 or  21 of the Glass-Steagall Act.  The Board interpretive ruling here prohibits a bank holding company or its subsidiaries from participating in the ""sale or distribution"" of, or from purchasing, securities of any investment company for which it acts as an investment adviser.  Thus, if such restrictions are followed, investment advisory services -- even if performed b a bank -- would not violate  16's requirements.  And the management of a customer's investment portfolio is not the kind of selling activity contemplated in the prohibition in  21, which was intended to require securities firms, such as underwriters or brokerage houses, to sever their banking connections.  In any event, even if the Glass-Steagall Act did prohibit banks from acting as investment advisers, that prohibition would not necessarily preclude the Board from determining that such adviser services would be permissible under  4(c)(8).  Pp.  450 U. S. 58-64.
(c) Since the interpretive ruling issued with the amendment to Regulation Y prohibits a bank holding company acting as an investment adviser from issuing, underwriting, selling, or redeeming securities, Regulation Y, as amended, avoids the potential hazards involved in any association between a bank affiliate and a closed-end investment company.  Cf. Investment Company Institute v. Camp, 401 U. S. 617.  Pp.  450 U. S. 64-68.
(d) Regulation Y, as amended, is consistent with the legislative history of both the Bank Holding Company Act and the Glass-Steagall Act.  More specifically, such legislative history indicates that Congress did not intend the Bank Holding Company Act to limit the Board's discretion to approve securities-related activity as closely related to banking beyond the prohibitions already contained in the Glass-Steagall Act.

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice BLACKMUN join, dissenting. 
 This Court has been asked to review a determination by a Federal Court of Appeals that a state-court murder conviction was obtained in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause 
Page 450 U.S. 936 , 937
 of the Fifth Amendment. Because I think the conclusion of the Court of Appeals is wrong and has erroneously expanded the role that court was to play in providing habeas corpus review of state-court criminal convictions, I dissent from denial of the petition for certiorari.

This determination was entered on the court's docket as a journal entry which is the only record of what transpired at that hearing. The journal entry reads:

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 23, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice BLACKMUN join, dissenting. 
 This Court has been asked to review a determination by a Federal Court of Appeals that a state-court murder conviction was obtained in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause 
Page 450 U.S. 936 , 937
 of the Fifth Amendment. Because I think the conclusion of the Court of Appeals is wrong and has erroneously expanded the role that court was to play in providing habeas corpus review of state-court criminal convictions, I dissent from denial of the petition for certiorari. 
 On Respondent was taken into custody and brought before the Juvenile Court on March 27, 1962, for a hearing; no transcript or record of that hearing was made. In accordance with then Ohio Rev.Code Ann. 2151.26 ( 1954),* the Juvenile Court decided to bind respondent over to the Criminal Division of the Court of Common Pleas for trial as an adult. This determination was entered on the court's docket as a journal entry which is the only record of what transpired at that hearing. The journal entry reads: "|

 PRINCE EDWARD SCHOOL FOUNDATION v. UNITED STATES  No. 80-484 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 23, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice STEWART and Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 The initial question presented by this petition is whether the Internal Revenue Service is entitled to deny tax-exempt status to a private school which discriminates in its admissions policy. If so, the additional question posed is what steps a private school must take in order to establish that its admissions policy is in fact nondiscriminatory. 
 Petitioner, Prince Edward School Foundation, was formed as a nonprofit private school foundation to operate elementary and secondary schools in Prince Edward County, Va. The principal purpose for petitioner's establishment was to ensure a segregated education for the white children who attended petitioner's schools. Griffin v. School Board of Prince Edward- 
Page 450 U.S. 944, 945
 County, 377 U.S. 218, 223, 231 S., 84 S.Ct. 1226, 1229, 1233, 12 L.Ed.2d 256 ( 1964). Presently, petitioner's sole activity is the operation of one private school, Prince Edward Academy. 
 From 1959 until 1970, petitioner was considered by the Service as a tax-exempt organization within the terms of 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3). Section 501(a) of the Code exempts from the federal income taxes organizations described in 501(c)( 3), and this latter provision includes corporations or foundations "" organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific , . . . literary, or educational purposes. . . ."" 
 In 1970, the Service announced that it would no longer recognize the tax-exempt status of any private school unless the school adopted and administered a nondiscriminatory admissions policy. This new position was announced during the course of litigation in Green v. Connally, 330 F.Supp. 1150 (DC 1971), in which the Service's prior policy was being challenged. A three-judge panel in Green thereafter ruled that a private school is not entitled to acquire or retain exempt status under 501(c)(3) unless it has a racially nondiscriminatory admissions policy. Although 501(c)(3) does not, by its express terms, impose such a limitation on the right to tax-exempt status, the Green court reasoned that such a limitation was mandated by both public policy and the common-law definition of "" charitable."" 1 
 To effectuate its new policy regarding tax exemptions for private schools, the Service issued Revenue Procedure 72-54 (currently Rev.Proc. 75-50, 1975-2 Cum.Bull. 587), which requires a private school seeking tax- exempt status to publicize its nondiscriminatory admissions policy to all segments [450 U.S. 944, 946]

 SHEET METAL WORKERS' INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AFL-CIOv. Ben CARTERNo. 80- 733 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 23, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held in this case that an order of the District Court for the Southern District of Georgia remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed was reviewable through a petition for a writ of mandamus. This conclusion is directly contrary to the plain language of 28 U.S.C. 1447(d), which provides that ""[a]n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise."" Such manifest disregard of the language of Congress should in my opinion warrant at least review by this Court, if not summary reversal. 
 The complicated course of this litigation began in 1972, when respondent filed an action against petitioner International Union in state court. Petitioner did not answer the 
Page 450 U.S. 949 , 950
 complaint but instead moved to dismiss it for improper service. This motion was denied and a default judgment eventually entered against petitioner. A state trial was held for the sole purpose of calculating damages. The judgment entered for respondent, however, was ultimately reversed by the Georgia Supreme Court on the ground that the International had not been properly served. Sheet Metal Workers' International Assn. v. Carter, 241 Ga. 220, 244 S.E.2d 860 (1978). When the action was reinstituted and petitioner was properly served, it removed the action to federal court. As early as pretrial conference it clearly developed that respondent's only claim was a state-law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a, but respondent never moved to remand the case and the court did not do so sua sponte. The case proceeded to trial and the jury awarded compensatory and punitive damages in favor of respondent. Petitioner then moved to have the judgment vacated and the case remanded for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The District Court concluded that jurisdiction was lacking, set aside the verdict and judgment, and remanded the action to state court. The court then stated: ""Notwithstanding 28 U.S.C. 1447(d), this Court hopes this Order is appealable. Perhaps another exception may be carved out of the statute."" Id., at 3a. 
 The Court of Appeals acceded to the wishes of the District Court. It granted respondent's petition for a writ of mandamus, vacated the remand order, and directed the District Court to consider if it had pendent jurisdiction of the state-law claim. It overcame to its satisfaction the seemingly clear prohibition of 1447(d) on the ground that 1447(c) required remand ""[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction,"" while the District Court ordered remand after final judgment.

 February 23, 1981
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 In 1972, respondent was tried in a Louisiana state court for possessing and distributing cocaine and heroin. Pursuant to the state law applicable at that time, the jury consisted of five members. La.Code Crim. Proc.Ann., Art. 782 (West 1967) (amended 1975). Respondent raised no objection to its size. The jury unanimously voted to convict respondent, and he was sentenced to a prison term. 
 More than six years later, after exhausting state remedies, respondent sought habeas corpus in Federal District Court. [Footnote 1] 
Page 450 U.S. 953 , 954
 Relying on this Court's decision in Ballew v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 223, 98 S. Ct. 1029 (1978), respondent argued that his trial violated the Sixth Amendment (applicable to the States through the Fourteenth), because a jury of five persons was constitutionally inadequate. The District Court granted the writ in reliance on Ballew, App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a, 22a-31a, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, 623 F.2d 383 (1980). The Court of Appeals recognized that respondent's conviction had become final long before Ballew held that five- member juries are unconstitutional. It nevertheless held that Ballew should be applied retroactively to invalidate all convictions rendered by juries of that size. [Footnote 2] 

 I believe that the Court of Appeals improperly applied Ballew to reverse respondent's conviction. I therefore would grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals. 
 Three recent cases govern respondent's claim. In Ballew, supra, we held that juries in criminal cases must have at least six members to meet constitutional requirements. A smaller jury may be insufficient to "" foster effective group deliberation,"" 435 U.S., at 232, 234, 1036 (opinion of BLACKMUN, J.), and to provide a ""fair cross-section"" of the community, id., at 245-1042 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment). Our decision in Ballew was reaffirmed one year later in Burch v. Louisiana, 441 U.S. 130, 137, 1627, 60 L. Ed.2d 96 (1979), when we identified similar constitutional flaws in a conviction reached by a nonunanimous [450 U.S. 953 , 955]

After a lawful customs search revealed hashish in packages mailed from Germany, law enforcement officials arranged for a controlled delivery of the packages; obtained a warrant to search the place of delivery and seize the packages; delayed executing the warrant and followed respondent and others when they left the delivery place by automobile with the packages; and, after arresting the suspects, reopened the packages at the police station without obtaining a second search warrant.  The stay is warranted because the state court's decision was based on the Federal Constitution; the ""balance of equities"" favors the State, which must either retry or dismiss the case, whereas respondent has been free on bail since conviction; and the case presents issues of sufficient importance that four Justices of this Court probably will vote to grant certiorari.

No. 79-1260
Argued November 12, 1980
Decided January 26, 1981
449 U.S. 560

Syllabus 
The Florida Supreme Court, following a pilot program for televising judicial proceedings in the State, promulgated a revised Canon 3A (7) of the Florida Code of Judicial Conduct.  The Canon permits electronic media and still photography coverage of judicial proceedings, subject to the control of the presiding judge and to implementing guidelines placing on trial judges obligations to protect the fundamental right of the accused in a criminal case to a fair trial.  Appellants, who were charged with a crime that attracted media attention, were convicted after a jury trial in a Florida trial court over objections that the televising and broadcast of parts of their trial denied them a fair and impartial trial.  The Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed, finding no evidence that the presence of a television camera hampered appellants in presenting their case, deprived them of an impartial jury, or impaired the fairness of the trial.  The Florida Supreme Court denied review.  The Florida courts did not construe Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, as laying down a per se constitutional rule barring broadcast coverage under all circumstances.
Held:  The Constitution does not prohibit a state from experimenting with a program such as is authorized by Florida's Canon 3A(7).  Pp.  449 U. S. 569-583.
(a) This Court has no supervisory jurisdiction over state courts, and, in reviewing a state court judgment, is confined to evaluating it in relation to the Federal Constitution.  P.  449 U. S. 570.

			"|"Chandler v. Florida
No. 79-1260
Argued November 12, 1980
Decided January 26, 1981
449 U.S. 560

Syllabus 
The Florida Supreme Court, following a pilot program for televising judicial proceedings in the State, promulgated a revised Canon 3A (7) of the Florida Code of Judicial Conduct.  The Canon permits electronic media and still photography coverage of judicial proceedings, subject to the control of the presiding judge and to implementing guidelines placing on trial judges obligations to protect the fundamental right of the accused in a criminal case to a fair trial.  Appellants, who were charged with a crime that attracted media attention, were convicted after a jury trial in a Florida trial court over objections that the televising and broadcast of parts of their trial denied them a fair and impartial trial.  The Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed, finding no evidence that the presence of a television camera hampered appellants in presenting their case, deprived them of an impartial jury, or impaired the fairness of the trial.  The Florida Supreme Court denied review.  The Florida courts did not construe Estes v. Texas, 381 U. S. 532, as laying down a per se constitutional rule barring broadcast coverage under all circumstances.
Held:  The Constitution does not prohibit a state from experimenting with a program such as is authorized by Florida's Canon 3A(7).  Pp.  449 U. S. 569-583.
(a) This Court has no supervisory jurisdiction over state courts, and, in reviewing a state court judgment, is confined to evaluating it in relation to the Federal Constitution.  P.  449 U. S. 570.
(b) Estes v. Texas, supra, did not announce a constitutional rule that all photographic, radio, and television coverage of criminal trials is inherently a denial of due process.

v. Associated Dry Goods Corp.
No. 79-1068
Argued November 3, 1980
Decided January 26, 1981
449 U.S. 590

Syllabus 
Section 706(b) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that employment discrimination charges ""shall not be made public"" by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and bars public disclosure of anything ""said or done"" during informal Commission settlement endeavors.  Section 709(e) makes it a misdemeanor for any EEOC officer or employee ""to make public"" any information the EEOC obtains through its investigative powers before the institution of any proceeding involving such information.  After employment discrimination charges were filed against a department store division (Horne) of respondent, the EEOC requested Horne to provide it with the complainants' employment records and other information relating to Horne's personnel practices.  Horne refused to provide the information unless the EEOC agreed not to disclose it to the charging parties.  The EEOC refused to give this assurance, explaining its practice, pursuant to regulations and its Compliance Manual, of making limited disclosure to a charging party of information in his and other files when he needs that information in connection with a potential lawsuit.  When Horne continued to refuse to provide the requested information, the EEOC subpoenaed the material.  Respondent then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking to have the EEOC's limited disclosure practices declared in violation of Title VII and to enjoin enforcement of the subpoena.  The District Court held that such practices violated Title VII, and accordingly enforced the subpoena only on the condition that the EEOC treat charging parties as members of the ""public"" to whom it cannot disclose any information in its files.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Congress did not include charging parties within the ""public"" to whom disclosure of confidential information is illegal under  706(b) and 709(e).  Pp.  449 U. S. 598-604.
(a) The ""public"" to whom  706(b) and 709(e) forbid disclosure of charges and other information cannot logically include the parties to the agency proceeding, since the charges, of course, cannot be concealed from the charging party or from the respondent upon whom the statute requires notice to be served.  A consistent reading of the statute requires that the ""public"" to whom  709(e) prohibits disclosure 
Page 449 U. S. 591
 of information obtained in Commission investigations similarly exclude the parties.  P.  449 U. S. 598.
(b) The legislative history of  706(b) and 709(e) supports this reading of the statute.  Pp.  449 U. S. 598-600.
(c) Moreover, such reading of the statute is consistent with the coordinated scheme of administrative and judicial enforcement of Title VII.  Limited disclosure to the parties can speed the EEOC's required investigation and enhances its ability to carry out its statutory responsibility to resolve charges through informal conciliation and negotiation.  Pp.  449 U. S. 600-602.
(d) Even if disclosure to charging parties may encourage litigation in some instances, this result is not inconsistent with Title VII's ultimate purposes of permitting a private right of action as an important part of the enforcement scheme.  Pp.  449 U. S. 602-603.
(e) It was error to hold that respondent had a categorical right to refuse to comply with the EEOC subpoena unless the EEOC assured it that the information supplied would be held in absolute secrecy.  Respondent was only entitled to assurance that each employee filing a charge against Horne would see information in no file other than his or her own.  Pp.  449 U. S. 603-604.

|449 u.s. 609|"Consolidated Rail Corporation v. National Association
of Recycling Industries, Inc.
No. 80-568
Decided January 26, 1981
449 U.S. 609

Syllabus 
After conducting the investigation required by  204(a)(1) and (2) of the Railroad Revitaliation and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, the Interstate Commerce Commission ultimately concluded that the rail rate structure for recyclable and competing virgin materials unjustly discriminated against certain recyclables and that, in general, rates for recyclables were unreasonable high if they produced a ""revenue to variable"" cost ratio exceeding 180%.  The Commission's order, with regard to the elimination of discrimination, permitted the railroads to raise the rates for recyclables and competing virgin materials to a level above the previous levels for either commodity, if the new rate did not produce revenue in excess of the 180% ratio.  The Court of Appeals affirmed as to the Commission's findings on discrimination, but concluded that the Commission had erred as to the scope of the remedy and had failed adequately to justify the 180% ratio as indicative of reasonableness.  The court revoked the resulting rate increases for recyclables; remanded for a determination of whether the 180% ratio, or some other formula, provided the appropriate standard for determining reasonableness; and, until such a standard had been adequately justified, enjoined implementation of any rate increase for recyclables, except one caused by a general rate increase.
Held:  While the Court of Appeals had the power to order further proceedings to determine the propriety of the 180% ratio standard, it had no power to revoke rates implemented under the standard and to enjoin any further increases toward the 180% level.  The court did not reject the 180% ratio standard outright, but remanded to the Commission for further proceedings which could either produce a new standard or clarify the basis for the 180% ratio.  Such a posture provides no basis for either revoking or enjoining rate increases.

 Kurk Kendall JOHNSON, petitioner,v. State of OKLAHOMANo. 80-5161 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 26, 1981
 Rehearing Denied March 23, 1981. 
 See 450 U.S. 1026. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was charged by information on April 1, 1975, in the District Court of Tulsa County, Okla., with the crime of kidnaping for the purpose of extortion. On April 16, 1975, he was charged in the District Court of Osage County, Okla., with the crime of murder in the first degree arising out of the same criminal episode. Following preliminary hearings in both courts, petitioner was bound over for trial. He subsequently moved for and was granted a continuance of the murder trial pending completion of his kidnaping trial. 
 Petitioner was found guilty of kidnaping and sentenced to 60 years in prison. Petitioner then filed a pleading in the Osage County District Court, entitled ""Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus or Petition for Writ of Prohibition or Petition for Writ of Mandamus,"" alleging, inter alia, that a trial on the first-degree murder charge would violate his federal constitutional right against multiple trials and multiple punishments embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Before the District Court acted on his pleading, petitioner sought similar relief from the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, which was denied. The District Court later denied the requested relief. 
 Petitioner next filed in Osage County District Court a ""Plea 
Page 449 U.S. 1132 , 1133
 of Former Jeopardy,"" urging that his kidnaping conviction barred the murder trial on the ground that the two crimes were not separate and distinct offenses. He also moved to strike all references to the kidnaping in the Osage County information. Although the plea and the motion were denied by the District Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, upon application by petitioner for a writ of mandamus, vacated the trial court's ruling, holding that the plea and motion should have been granted. The court noted, however, that the kidnaping conviction would not prohibit a subsequent prosecution for second-degree murder. Contending that a second-degree murder trial was also barred, petitioner sought a rehearing and a writ of prohibition. The Court of Criminal Appeals, after vacating its previous opinion prohibiting a trial on first-degree murder but allowing a trial on second-degree murder, denied all of petitioner's requests for relief. Johnson v. Hampton, 572 P.2d 1301 (1978). 
 On petition for certiorari, this Court granted certiorari, vacated the Court of Criminal Appeals decision, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161 (1977), and Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U.S. 682 (1977). Johnson v. Hampton, 434 U.S. 947 (1977). On remand, the Court of Criminal Appeals granted a writ of prohibition against a trial for first-degree murder. The information was subsequently amended to charge second-degree murder, and to strike all references to the kidnaping. Petitioner again sought a writ of prohibition from the Court of Criminal Appeals, alleging, inter alia, that the trial would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. The court declined to assume jurisdiction and dismissed the writ. Petitioner then was tried and convicted of second- degree murder, and sentenced to 10 years to life. On appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. 611 P.2d 1137 (1980). 
 I would grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. I [449 U.S. 1132 , 1134]

Based on their discovery of sets of distinctive human footprints in the desert, Border Patrol officers deduced that on a number of occasions groups of from 8 to 20 persons had been guided by a person, whom they designated ""Chevron,"" from Mexico across an area of desert in Arizona, known to be heavily trafficked by aliens illegally entering the country.  These groups of aliens proceeded to an isolated point on a road to be picked up by a vehicle; the officers deduced the vehicle probably approached from the east and returned to the east after the pickup.  They also surmised, based on the times when the distinctive tracks were discovered, that ""Chevron"" generally traveled on clear nights during or near weekends, and arrived at the pickup point between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.  On the basis of this information, the officers stationed themselves at a point east of the probable pickup point on a night when they believed there was a strong possibility that ""Chevron"" would be smuggling aliens.  The officers observed a pickup truck with a camper shell suitable for carrying sizable groups pass them heading west, and then observed the same vehicle return within the estimated time for making a round trip to the pickup point.  The officers stopped the vehicle, which was being driven by respondent Cortez and in which respondent Hernandez-Loera, who was wearing shoes with soles matching the distinctive ""chevron"" shoeprint, was a passenger.  Cortez voluntarily opened the door of the camper, and the officers then discovered illegal aliens.  Prior to trial on charges of transporting illegal aliens, respondents sought to suppress the evidence of the presence of the aliens discovered as a result of the stopping of their vehicle, contending that the officers did not have adequate cause to make the investigative stop.  The District Court denied the motion, and respondents were convicted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the officers lacked a sufficient basis to justify stopping the vehicle, and thus respondents' Fourth Amendment rights were violated.

Syllabus 
Section 17 (n) of the Securities Act of 1933 prohibits fraud in the ""offer or sale"" of any securities.  Section 2(3) of the Act defines ""sale"" as including ""every . . . disposition of a security or interest in a security, for value,"" and ""offer"" as including ""every attempt or offer to dispose of . . . a security or interest in a security, for value.""  Petitioner was convicted of conspiracy to violate  17(a) by making false representations to a bank concerning shares of stock pledged as collateral for loans.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contention that the stock pledges did not constitute ""offers"" or ""sales"" under  17(a).
Held:  The pledge of stock to a bank as collateral for a loan is an ""offer or sale"" of a security under  17(a).  Pp.  449 U. S. 428-431.
(a) Obtaining a loan secured by a pledge of stock unmistakably involves a ""disposition of [an] interest in a security, for value"" within the statutory definition.  Although pledges transfer less than absolute title, the interest thus transferred nonetheless is an ""interest in a security,"" and it is not essential under the terms of the Act that full title pass to a transferee for the transaction to be an ""offer"" or ""sale.""  Pp.  449 U. S. 429-430.
(b) When the terms of a statute are unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete, except in rare and exceptional circumstances; no such circumstances are present here.  Treating pledges as included among ""offers"" and ""sales"" comports with the Act's purpose and, specifically, with  17(a)'s purpose to protect against fraud and promote the free flow of information in the public dissemination of securities.  The economic considerations and realities present when a lender parts with value and accepts securities as collateral for a loan are similar in important respects to the risk an investor undertakes when purchasing securities.  Both rely on the value of the securities themselves, and both must be able to depend on the transferor's representations, regardless of whether the transferor passes full title or only a conditional and defeasible interest to secure repayment of a loan.

Syllabus 
While respondent was serving a sentence in a Pennsylvania correctional institution, the Camden County, N.J., prosecutor's office lodged a detainer against him and sought custody pursuant to Art. IV of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (Detainer Agreement) in order to try him in New Jersey on criminal charges.  Article IV, which provides the procedure whereby the receiving State may initiate the prisoner's transfer, states in paragraph (d) that nothing in the Article shall be construed to deprive the prisoner ""of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof,"" but that such delivery may not be opposed on the ground that the sending State's executive authority has not affirmatively consented to or ordered the delivery.  Respondent filed an action in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under 42 U.S.C.  1981 and 1983, alleging that petitioners had violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses by failing to grant him the pretransfer hearing that would have been available had his transfer been sought under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (Extradition Act), and that petitioners had violated the Due Process Clause by failing to inform him of his right under Art. IV (a) of the Detainer Agreement to petition Pennsylvania's Governor to disapprove New Jersey's request for custody.  The District Court dismissed respondent's complaint.  The Court of Appeals vacated the District Court judgment and remanded the case, finding it unnecessary to reach respondent's constitutional claims and holding as a matter of statutory construction under federal law that respondent had a right under Art. IV (d) of the Detainer Agreement to the procedural safeguards, including a pretransfer hearing, prescribed by the Extradition Act.
Held:
1. The Detainer Agreement is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact the interpretation of which presents a question of federal law.  An interstate agreement does not fall within the scope of the Federal Constitution's Compact Clause, and will not be invalidated for lack of congressional consent, where the agreement is not
""directed to the 
Page 449 U. S. 434
 formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States.""
But where Congress has authorized the States to enter into a cooperative agreement and the subject matter of that agreement is an appropriate subject for congressional legislation, Congress' consent transforms the States' agreement into federal law under the Compact Clause, and construction of that agreement presents a federal question.  Here, Congress gave its consent to the Detainer Agreement in advance by enacting the Crime Control Consent Act of 1934.  That Act was intended to be a grant of consent under the Compact Clause, and the subject matter of the Act is an appropriate subject for congressional legislation.  Pp.  449 U. S. 438-442.
2. As a matter of statutory construction, a prisoner incarcerated in a jurisdiction that has adopted the Extradition Act is entitled to the procedural protections of that Act, including the right to a pretransfer hearing, before being transferred to another jurisdiction pursuant to Art. IV of the Detainer Agreement.  Both the language and legislative history of the Detainer Agreement support the interpretation that, whereas a prisoner initiating the transfer procedure under Art. III waives rights which the sending State affords persons being extradited, including rights provided under the Extradition Act, a prisoner's extradition rights are preserved when the receiving State seeks the prisoner's involuntary transfer under Art. IV of the Detainer Agreement.  The phrase ""as provided in paragraph (a) hereof,"" contained in Art. IV (d), modifies ""delivery,"" not ""right,"" and thus Art. IV (d) preserves all the prisoner's extradition rights under state or other law except his right, otherwise available under the Extradition Act, to oppose his transfer on the ground that the sending State's Governor had not explicitly approved the custody request.  Moreover, the remedial purpose of the Detainer Agreement in protecting prisoners against whom detainers are outstanding supports an interpretation that gives prisoners the right to a judicial hearing in which they can bring a limited challenge to the receiving State's custody request.

Syllabus 
For the stated purposes of promoting resource conservation, easing solid waste disposal problems, and conserving energy, the Minnesota Legislature enacted a statute banning the retail sale of milk in plastic nonreturnable, nonrefillable containers, but permitting such sale in other nonreturnable, nonrefillable containers, such as paperboard cartons.  Respondents filed suit in Minnesota District Court, seeking to enjoin enforcement of the statute on constitutional grounds.  The District Court held that the statute violated, inter alia, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause.  Finding that ""the evidence conclusively demonstrate[d] that the discrimination against plastic nonrefillables [was] not rationally related to the Act's objectives,"" the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed on the equal protection ground without reaching the Commerce Clause issue.
Held:
1. The ban on plastic nonreturnable milk containers bears a rational relation to the State's objectives, and must be sustained under the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  449 U. S. 461-470.
(a) The Equal Protection Clause does not deny Minnesota the authority to ban one type of milk container conceded to cause environmental problems merely because another already established type is permitted to continue in use.  Whether in fact the statute will promote more environmentally desirable milk packaging is not the question.  The Equal Protection Clause is satisfied if the Minnesota Legislature could rationally have decided that its ban on plastic milk jugs might foster greater use of environmentally desirable alternatives.  Pp.  449 U. S. 465-466.
(b) The fact that the state legislature, having concluded that nonreturnable, nonrefillable milk containers pose environmental hazards, decided to ban the most recent entry in the field, and thus, in effect, ""grandfathered"" paperboard containers, at least temporarily, does not make the ban on plastic containers arbitrary or irrational.  Cf. New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297.  Pp.  449 U. S. 466-468.
(c) Where the evidence as to whether the statute would help to conserve energy was ""at least debatable,"" the Minnesota Supreme Court erred in substituting its judgment for that of the legislature by finding, contrary to the legislature, that the production of plastic nonrefillable 
Page 449 U. S. 457
 containers required less energy than production of paper containers.  Pp.  449 U. S. 468-69.
(d) Similarly, the Minnesota Supreme Court erred in finding, contrary to the legislature's finding based on a reputable study, that plastic milk jugs take up less space in landfills and present fewer solid waste disposal problems than do paperboard containers.  Pp.  449 U. S. 469-470.
2. The statute does not violate the Commerce Clause as constituting an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.  Pp.  449 U. S. 470-474.
(a) The statute does not discriminate between interstate and intrastate commerce, but regulates evenhandedly by prohibiting all milk retailers from selling their products in plastic containers, without regard to whether the milk, the containers, or the sellers are from outside the State.  Pp.  449 U. S. 471-472.
(b) The incidental burden imposed on interstate commerce by the statute is not excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.  Milk products may continue to move freely across the Minnesota border, and since most dairies package their products in more than one type of container, the inconvenience of having to conform to different packaging requirements in Minnesota and the surrounding States should be slight.  Even granting that the out-of-state plastics industry is burdened relatively more heavily than the Minnesota pulpwood industry, this burden is not ""clearly excessive"" in light of the substantial state interest in promoting conservation of energy and other natural resources and easing solid waste disposal problems.  These local benefits amply support Minnesota's decision under the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  449 U. S. 472-474.

Syllabus 
The Displaced Persons Act of 1948 (DPA) enabled European refugees driven from their homelands by World War II to emigrate to the United States without regard to traditional immigration quotas.  It provided that any person
""who shall willfully make a misrepresentation for the purpose of gaining admission into the United States as an eligible displaced person shall thereafter not be admissible into the United States,""
and the applicable definition of ""displaced persons"" specifically excluded individuals who had ""assisted the enemy in persecuting civil[ians]"" or had ""voluntarily assisted the enemy forces"" in their operations.   Petitioner was admitted to the United States under a DPA visa that had been issued on the basis of his 1949 application, which misrepresented his wartime activities and concealed the fact that, after being captured by the Germans while serving in the Russian Army, he had served as an armed guard at the Nazi concentration camp at Treblinka in Poland.  Subsequently, he became an American citizen in 1970 on the basis of his visa papers and his naturalization application, which also did not disclose his wartime service as a concentration camp guard.  The Government thereafter brought this denaturalization action under  340(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which requires revocation of United States citizenship that was ""illegally procured"" or ""procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.""  The Government charged that petitioner, in applying for his DPA visa and for citizenship, had willfully concealed that he had served as an armed guard at Treblinka and had committed crimes against inmates of the camp because they were Jewish, and that therefore he had procured his naturalization illegally or by willfully misrepresenting material facts.  The Government presented witnesses who testified that they had seen petitioner commit acts of violence against camp inmates, and an expert witness in the interpretation and application of the DPA, who testified that petitioner would have been found ineligible for a visa as a matter of law if it had been determined that he had been an armed guard at the camp, regardless of whether or not he had volunteered for service or had committed atrocities against inmates.  In his testimony, petitioner admitted that he deliberately gave false information in connection with 
Page 449 U. S. 491
 his application for the DPA visa but claimed that he had been forced to serve as a guard and denied any personal involvement in the atrocities committed at the camp.  The District Court entered judgment for petitioner, finding, inter alia, that, although petitioner had lied about his wartime activities when he applied for a visa in 1949, he had been forced to serve as a guard, and the Government had not met its burden of proving that he had committed war crimes or atrocities at Treblinka.  The court held that, because disclosure of petitioner's involuntary service as a concentration camp guard would not have been grounds for denial of citizenship, his false statements about his wartime activities were not misrepresentations of ""material facts"" within the meaning of the denaturalization statute under the materiality standard announced in Chaunt v. United States, 364 U. S. 350.  As an alternative basis for its decision, the court held that, even assuming misrepresentation of material facts, equitable and mitigating circumstances -- the inconclusiveness of the evidence that petitioner had committed war crimes or atrocities and the uncontroverted evidence that he had been responsible and law-abiding since coming to the United States -- required that he be permitted to retain his citizenship.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court had misinterpreted the Chaunt test and that it had no discretion to enter judgment for petitioner in the face of a finding that he had procured his naturalization by willfully concealing material facts.
Held:  Petitioner's citizenship must be revoked under  340(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act because it was ""illegally procured.""  Pp.  449 U. S. 505-518.
(a) The Government carries a heavy burden of proof in a denaturalization proceeding, and evidence justifying revocation of citizenship must be clear, unequivocal, and convincing, and not leave the issue in doubt.  However, there must be strict compliance with all the congressionally imposed prerequisites to the acquisition of citizenship.  Failure to comply with any of these conditions renders the certificate of citizenship ""illegally procured,"" and naturalization that is unlawfully procured can be set aside.  Pp.  449 U. S. 505-507.
(b) The DPA's prohibition against admission of any person ""who shall willfully make a misrepresentation"" to gain admission into the United States as an ""eligible displaced person,"" only applies to willful misrepresentations about ""material facts.""  Under the analysis of the courts below, the misrepresentation that raised the materiality issue in this case was contained in petitioner's application for a visa.  The plain language of the definition of ""displaced persons"" for purposes of the DPA as excluding individuals who ""assisted the enemy in persecuting 
Page 449 U. S. 492
 civil[ians]"" mandates the literal interpretation, rejected by the District Court, that an individual's service as a concentration camp armed guard -- whether voluntary or involuntary -- made him ineligible for a visa.  Since a misrepresentation must be considered material if disclosure of the true facts would have made the applicant ineligible for a visa, and since disclosure of the true facts here would, as a matter of law, have made petitioner ineligible for a visa, it is unnecessary to determine whether the materiality test of Chaunt as to applications for citizenship also applies to false statements in visa applications.  Pp.  449 U. S. 507-514.
(c) In 1970, when petitioner filed his petition for and was admitted to citizenship, the Immigration and Nationality Act required an applicant for citizenship to be lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, which admission, in turn, required that the individual possess a valid unexpired immigrant visa.  And, under the law applicable at the time of petitioner's initial entry into the United States, a visa obtained through a material misrepresentation was not valid.  Since petitioner thus failed to satisfy a statutory requirement which Congress had imposed as a prerequisite to the acquisition of citizenship by naturalization, his citizenship must be revoked because it was ""illegally procured.""  Pp.  449 U. S. 514-516.
(d) Although a denaturalization action is a suit in equity, a district court lacks equitable discretion to refrain from entering a judgment of denaturalization against a naturalized citizen whose citizenship was procured illegally or by willful misrepresentation of material facts.  Once a district court determines that the Government has met its burden of proving that a naturalized citizen obtained his citizenship illegally or by willful misrepresentation, it has no discretion to excuse the conduct.

Decided January 21, 1981
449 U.S. 539

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder in a California state court after a trial at which eyewitnesses identified him as participating in the murder.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, rejecting respondent's contention, made for the first time, that the pretrial photographic identification employed by the police violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.  The court concluded upon review of the trial record that ""the facts of the present case"" did not adequately support respondent's claim.  Respondent did not seek review by the California Supreme Court, but later raised the pretrial identification issue in state habeas corpus proceedings, which resulted in denial of relief by the trial court, the California Court of Appeal, and the California Supreme Court.  Respondent then sought federal habeas corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. $ 2254, but the Federal District Court denied the petition.  The United States Court of Appeals, employing the same standard used by the state courts, reversed.  On the basis of findings considerably at odds with the findings of the California Court of Appeal, the United States Court of Appeals, after reviewing the state court trial record, concluded that the photographic identification was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.  The Court of Appeals' opinion did not refer to 28 U.S.C. $ 2254(d), which provides that, in federal habeas corpus proceedings instituted by a state prisoner, ""a determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue"" made by a state court of competent jurisdiction and ""evidenced by a written finding, written opinion, or other reliable and adequate written indicia, shall be presumed to be correct"" unless one of seven specified conditions is found to exist or unless the habeas court concludes that the relevant state court determination ""is not fairly supported by the record.""
Held:  The Court of Appeals did not properly analyze respondent's challenge to his state court conviction, given the limited nature of the review provided federal courts by  2254.  Pp.  449 U. S. 543-552.
(a) Section 2254(d) applies to factual determinations made by state courts, whether the court be a trial court or an appellate court.  The California Court of Appeal held a ""hearing"" within the meaning of 
Page 449 U. S. 540
  2254(d), since both respondent and the State were formally before the court, respondent was given an opportunity to be heard, and his claim received plenary consideration.  The interest in federalism recognized by Congress in enacting  2254(d) requires deference by federal courts to factual determinations of all state courts, and this is true particularly in a case such as this, where a federal court makes its determination based on the identical record that was considered by the state appellate court, and where there was no reason for the state trial court to consider the issue because respondent failed to raise it at that level.  Pp.  449 U. S. 545-547.
(b) Given the applicability of  2254(d) to the present case, it is not apparent that the Court of Appeals, whose opinion gave no indication that  2254 was even considered, applied the ""presumption of correctness"" which is mandated by the statute to the factual determinations made by the California state court.  When Congress provided in  2254(d) that a habeas court could not dispense with the ""presumption of correctness"" embodied therein unless it concluded that the factual determinations were not supported by the record, it contemplated at least some reasoned written references (not present here) to  2254(d) and the state court findings.  Pp.  449 U. S. 547-549.
(c) In providing in  2254(d) that, absent any of the enumerated factors, the burden rests on the habeas petitioner to establish ""by convincing evidence that the factual determination of the State court was erroneous,"" Congress meant to insure that a state finding not be overturned merely on the basis of the usual ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard.  To ensure that this mandate of Congress is enforced, a federal habeas court should include in its opinion granting the writ the reasoning which led it to conclude that any of the first seven factors were present, or the reasoning which led it to conclude that the state finding was ""not fairly supported by the record.""

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 The decision by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in this case seriously undermines our recent decision in Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324 (1977), and accordingly I would grant certiorari. 
 Respondent, a black employee of petitioner, filed this Title VII action on July 15, 1974, alleging that petitioner discriminated against black employees in promotion decisions at its Dallas, Tex., plant. Pursuant to the provisions of a collective-bargaining agreement, promotions at the plant are based on seniority when the ability and merit of competing employees are approximately equal. For most jobs at the plant, ability and merit are determined by evaluating work performance, absentee record, disciplinary history, and medical condition. Promotion to certain ""critical"" jobs is governed by the results of an evaluation system known as the 
Page 449 U.S. 1115 , 1116
 ""total assessment process,"" involving examinations, interviews, and questionnaires. Employees bidding for promotion to one of the critical jobs are ranked, pursuant to this process, as ""strong,"" ""acceptable,"" "" borderline,"" or ""weak."" The promotion is awarded to the most senior bidder receiving an ""acceptable"" rating. 
 In an opinion filed one month prior to our decision in Teamsters, the District Court concluded that petitioner's seniority system was not bona fide under 703(h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(h),1 and that petitioner had discriminated against respondent and the class he represented. In Teamsters, however, we held that an otherwise valid seniority system did not lose its bona fide character simply because its operation may perpetuate past discrimination. On appeal after Teamsters, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the District Court had erred and that petitioner's seniority system was bona fide and legally valid under 703(h). 613 F.2d 527, 542. The court nonetheless ""saved"" the District Court decision on the ground that it was based not only on the existence of a seniority system which perpetuated past acts of discrimination but also on a finding of active, current discrimination. The support for this finding consisted of statistical evidence demonstrating that black employees ""are marked by their conspicuous presence in the 'lower echelons' of the employee hierarchy."" Id., at 543. 
 The difficulty with the lower court's reliance on this statistical evidence of disparate impact to support the ultimately required finding of discriminatory intent is that the court completely failed to consider the effect of the bona fide seniority system on the significance of the statistics.

 In an opinion filed one month prior to our decision in Teamsters, the District Court concluded that petitioner's seniority system was not bona fide under 703(h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(h),1 and that petitioner had discriminated against respondent and the class he represented. In Teamsters, however, we held that an otherwise valid seniority system did not lose its bona fide character simply because its operation may perpetuate past discrimination. On appeal after Teamsters, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the District Court had erred and that petitioner's seniority system was bona fide and legally valid under 703(h). 613 F.2d 527, 542. The court nonetheless ""saved"" the District Court decision on the ground that it was based not only on the existence of a seniority system which perpetuated past acts of discrimination but also on a finding of active, current discrimination. The support for this finding consisted of statistical evidence demonstrating that black employees ""are marked by their conspicuous presence in the 'lower echelons' of the employee hierarchy."" Id., at 543. 
 The difficulty with the lower court's reliance on this statistical evidence of disparate impact to support the ultimately required finding of discriminatory intent is that the court completely failed to consider the effect of the bona fide seniority system on the significance of the statistics.

Syllabus 
Respondent's husband died of injuries suffered when a motorcycle on which he was a passenger was struck by an automobile.  The accident occurred in Wisconsin near the Minnesota border.  The operators of both vehicles were Wisconsin residents, as was the decedent, who, however, had been employed in Minnesota and had commuted daily to work from Wisconsin.  Neither vehicle operator carried valid insurance, but the decedent held a policy issued by petitioner covering three automobiles owned by him and containing an uninsured motorist clause insuring him against loss incurred from accidents with uninsured motorists, but limiting such coverage to $15,000 for each automobile.  After the accident, respondent moved to and became a resident of Minnesota, and was subsequently appointed in that State as personal representative of her husband's estate.  She then brought an action in a Minnesota court seeking a declaration under Minnesota law that the $15,000 uninsured motorist coverage on each of her late husband's three automobiles could be ""stacked"" to provide total coverage of $45,000.  Petitioner defended on the ground that whether the three uninsured motorist coverages could be stacked should be determined by Wisconsin law, since the insurance policy was delivered in Wisconsin, the accident occurred there, and all persons involved were Wisconsin residents at the time of the accident.  The trial court, interpreting Wisconsin law to disallow stacking, concluded that Minnesota's choice of law rules required the application of Minnesota law permitting stacking, and granted summary judgment for respondent.  The Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  449 U. S. 307-320;  449 U. S. 322-331.
289 N.W.2d 43, affirmed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE WHITE, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that Minnesota has a significant aggregation of contacts with the parties and the occurrence, creating state interests, such that application of its law is neither arbitrary nor fundamentally unfair, and, accordingly, the choice of law by the Minnesota Supreme Court does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  Pp.  449 U. S. 307-320.

(a) Respondent's decedent was a member of Minnesota's workforce.  The State of employment has police power responsibilities towards nonresident employees that are analogous to those it has towards residents, as such employees use state services and amenities and may call upon state facilities in appropriate circumstances.  Also, the State's interest in its commuting nonresident employees, such as respondent's decedent, reflects a state concern for the safety and wellbeing of its workforce and the concomitant effect on Minnesota employers.  That the decedent was not killed while commuting to work or while in Minnesota does not dictate a different result, since vindication of the rights of the estate of a Minnesota employee is an important state concern.  Nor does the decedent's residence in Wisconsin constitutionally mandate application of Wisconsin law to the exclusion of forum law.  Employment status is not a sufficiently less important status than residence, when combined with the decedent's daily commute across state lines and the other Minnesota contacts present, to prohibit the choice of law result in this case on constitutional grounds.  Pp.  449 U. S. 313-317.
(b) Petitioner was at all times present and doing business in Minnesota.  By virtue of such presence, petitioner can hardly claim unfamiliarity with the laws of the host jurisdiction and surprise that the state courts might apply forum law to litigation in which the company is involved.  Moreover, such presence gave Minnesota an interest in regulating the company's insurance obligations insofar as they affected both a Minnesota resident and court-appointed representative (respondent) and a longstanding member of Minnesota's workforce (respondent's decedent).  Pp.  449 U. S. 317-318.
(c) Respondent became a Minnesota resident prior to institution of the instant litigation.  Such residence and subsequent appointment in Minnesota as personal representative of her late husband's estate constitute a Minnesota contact which gives Minnesota an interest in respondent's recovery.  Pp.  449 U. S. 318-319.
JUSTICE STEVENS concluded:
1. The Full Faith and Credit Clause did not require Minnesota, the forum State, to apply Wisconsin law to the contract interpretation question presented.  Although the Minnesota courts' decision to apply Minnesota law was unsound as a matter of conflicts law, no threat to Wisconsin's sovereignty ensued from allowing the substantive question as to the meaning of the insurance contract to be determined by the law of another State.  Pp.  449 U. S. 322-326.
2. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not prevent Minnesota from applying its own law.  Neither the ""stacking"" rule itself nor Minnesota's application of it to these litigants raised any 
Page 449 U. S. 304
 serious question of fairness.  Nor did the Minnesota courts' decision to apply this rule violate due process because that decision frustrated the contracting parties' reasonable expectations.  The decision was consistent with due process because it did not result  unfairness to either litigant, not because Minnesota had an interest in the plaintiff as resident or the decedent as employee.

Held:  A state criminal court is not required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to conduct a hearing out of the jury's presence whenever a defendant contends that a witness' identification of him was arrived at improperly.  Pp.  449 U. S. 345-349.
(a) Where identification evidence is at issue, no such special considerations as exist where the issue of the voluntariness of a confession is presented -- an involuntary confession being inadmissible both because it is likely to be unreliable and because of society's aversion to forced confessions, even if true, Jackson v.

Federal agents, aware that respondent had been indicted on federal drug charges and had retained counsel, met with her without her counsel's knowledge or permission, seeking her cooperation in a related investigation.  The agents disparaged respondent's counsel and indicated that she would gain various benefits if she cooperated and would face a stiff jail term if she did not, but she declined to cooperate, and notified her attorney.  The agents visited respondent again in the absence of counsel, but she did not agree to cooperate with them, nor did she incriminate herself or supply any information pertinent to her case.  Subsequently, respondent moved to dismiss the indictment with prejudice on the ground that the agents' conduct violated her Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  The agents' egregious behavior was described as having ""interfered"" in some unspecified way with respondent's right to counsel, but it was not alleged that the claimed violation had prejudiced the quality or effectiveness of her legal representation or that the agents' conduct had any adverse impact on her legal position.  The District Court denied the motion and respondent, pursuant to a prior agreement with the Government, entered a conditional plea of guilty to one count of the indictment.

Respondent is lead counsel for the plaintiffs in four consolidated product liability suits in Federal District Court against petitioner and other manufacturers.  Petitioner moved to disqualify respondent from further representation of the plaintiffs because of an alleged conflict of interest arising from the fact that petitioner's liability insurer was also an occasional client of respondent's law firm.  Petitioner argued that respondent's representation of the insurer would give him an incentive to structure the plaintiffs' claims for relief so as to enable the insurer to avoid any liability, thus increasing petitioner's own potential liability.  In accordance with the District Court's order, respondent obtained the consent of both the plaintiffs and the insurer to his continuing representation, and the court then allowed him to continue his representation of the plaintiffs.  Petitioner filed a notice of appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1291, which vests the courts of appeals with ""jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts . . . except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.""  The Court of Appeals held that district court orders denying disqualification motions were not immediately appealable under  1291, but, because it was overruling prior cases, the court made its decision prospective only and, on the merits, affirmed the District Court's order permitting respondent to continue representing the plaintiffs.
Held:
1. Orders denying motions to disqualify the opposing party's counsel in a civil case are not appealable final decisions under  1291.  Such an order does not fall within the ""collateral order"" exception of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, to the requirement that all appeals under  1291 must await final judgment on the merits in the underlying litigation.  Petitioner has made no showing, as required under the Cohen doctrine of immediately appealable ""collateral orders,"" that an order denying disqualification is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment on the merits.  The propriety of a district court's denial of a disqualification motion will often be difficult to assess until its impact on the underlying litigation may be evaluated, which is normally after final judgment, and should the court of appeals conclude

2. The Court of Appeals, after properly concluding that the District Court's order was not immediately appealable under  1291, erred in reaching the merits of the District Court's order.  The finality requirement of  1291 is jurisdictional in nature.  If an appellate court finds that the order from which a party seeks to appeal does not fall within the statute, its inquiry is over.  A court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction, and thus a jurisdictional ruling may never be made prospective only.  Pp.  449 U. S. 379-380.

Syllabus 
When the General Counsel for petitioner pharmaceutical manufacturing corporation (hereafter petitioner) was informed that one of its foreign subsidiaries had made questionable payments to foreign government officials in order to secure government business, an internal investigation of such payments was initiated.  As part of this investigation, petitioner's attorneys sent a questionnaire to all foreign managers seeking detailed information concerning such payments, and the responses were returned to the General Counsel.  The General Counsel and outside counsel also interviewed the recipients of the questionnaire and other company officers and employees.  Subsequently, based on a report voluntarily submitted by petitioner disclosing the questionable payments, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began an investigation to determine the tax consequences of such payments and issued a summons pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  762 demanding production of, inter alia, the questionnaires and the memoranda and notes of the interviews.  Petitioner refused to produce the documents on the grounds that they were protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and constituted the work product of attorneys prepared in anticipation of litigation.  The United States then filed a petition in Federal District Court seeking enforcement of the summons.  That court adopted the Magistrate's recommendation that the summons should be enforced, the Magistrate having concluded, inter alia, that the attorney-client privilege had been waived, and that the Government had made a sufficient showing of necessity to overcome the protection of the work product doctrine.  The Court of Appeals rejected the Magistrate's finding of a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, but held that, under the so-called ""control group test,"" the privilege did not apply
""[t]o the extent that the communications were made by officers and agents not responsible for directing [petitioner's] actions in response to legal advice . . . for the simple reason that the communications were not the 'client's'.'""
The court also held that the work product doctrine did not apply to IRS summonses.
Held:
1. The communications by petitioner's employees to counsel are covered by the attorney-client privilege insofar as the responses to the 
Page 449 U. S. 384
 questionnaires and any notes reflecting responses to interview questions are concerned.  Pp.  449 U. S. 389-397.
(a) The control group test overlooks the fact that such privilege exists to protect not only the giving of professional advice to those who can act on it, but also the giving of information to the lawyer to enable him to give sound and informed advice.  While in the case of the individual client the provider of information and the person who acts on the lawyer's advice are one and the same, in the corporate context, it will frequently be employees beyond the control group (as defined by the Court of Appeals) who will possess the information needed by the corporation's lawyers.  Middle-level -- and indeed lower-level -- employees can, by actions within the scope of their employment, embroil the corporation in serious legal difficulties, and it is only natural that these employees would have the relevant information needed by corporate counsel if he is adequately to advise the client with respect to such actual or potential difficulties.  Pp.  449 U. S. 390-392.
(b) The control group test thus frustrates the very purpose of the attorney-client privilege by discouraging the communication of relevant information by employees of the client corporation to attorneys seeking to render legal advice to the client.  The attorney's advice will also frequently be more significant to noncontrol employees than to those who officially sanction the advice, and the control group test makes it more difficult to convey full and frank legal advice to the employees who will put into effect the client corporation's policy.  P.  449 U. S. 392.
(c) The narrow scope given the attorney-client privilege by the Court of Appeals not only makes it difficult for corporate attorneys to formulate sound advice when their client is faced with a specific legal problem, but also threatens to limit the valuable efforts of corporate counsel to ensure their client's compliance with the law.  Pp.  449 U. S. 392-393.
(d) Here, the communications at issue were made by petitioner's employees to counsel for petitioner, acting as such, at the direction of corporate superiors in order to secure legal advice from counsel.  Information not available from upper-echelon management was needed to supply a basis for legal advice concerning compliance with securities and tax laws, foreign laws, currency regulations, duties to shareholders, and potential litigation in each of these areas.  The communications concerned matters within the scope of the employees' corporate duties, and the employees themselves were sufficiently aware that they were being questioned in order that the corporation could obtain legal advice.  Pp.  449 U. S. 394-395
2. The work product doctrine applies to IRS summonses.  Pp.  449 U. S. 397-402.
(a) The obligation imposed by a tax summons remains subject to the traditional privileges and limitations, and nothing in the language 
Page 449 U. S. 385
 or legislative.history of the IRS summons provisions suggests an intent on the part of Congress to preclude application of the work product doctrine.  P.  449 U. S. 398.
(b) The Magistrate applied the wrong standard when he concluded that the Government had made a sufficient showing of necessity to overcome the protections of the work product doctrine.  The notes and memoranda sought by the Government constitute work product based on oral statements.  If they reveal communications, they are protected by the attorney-client privilege.  To the extent they do not reveal communications, they reveal attorneys' mental processes in evaluating the communications.  As Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6, which accords special protection from disclosure to work product revealing an attorney's mental processes, and Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U. S. 495, make clear, such work product cannot be disclosed simply on a showing of substantial need or inability to obtain the equivalent without undue hardship.  P.  449 U. S. 401.

No. 79-886
Argued November 5, 1980
Decided January 13, 1981
449 U.S. 383

Syllabus 
When the General Counsel for petitioner pharmaceutical manufacturing corporation (hereafter petitioner) was informed that one of its foreign subsidiaries had made questionable payments to foreign government officials in order to secure government business, an internal investigation of such payments was initiated.  As part of this investigation, petitioner's attorneys sent a questionnaire to all foreign managers seeking detailed information concerning such payments, and the responses were returned to the General Counsel.  The General Counsel and outside counsel also interviewed the recipients of the questionnaire and other company officers and employees.  Subsequently, based on a report voluntarily submitted by petitioner disclosing the questionable payments, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) began an investigation to determine the tax consequences of such payments and issued a summons pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  762 demanding production of, inter alia, the questionnaires and the memoranda and notes of the interviews.  Petitioner refused to produce the documents on the grounds that they were protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and constituted the work product of attorneys prepared in anticipation of litigation.

449 U.S. 292

Syllabus 
Held:  The 1976 amendments of the minimum tax provisions of  56 and 57 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 -- increasing the rate of the minimum tax and decreasing the allowable exemption as to enumerated items of tax preference, including the deduction for 50% of any net long-term capital gain, and making the amendments effective for the taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975 -- may be applied to appellee taxpayers' sale of a house, resulting in a long-term capital gain, that took place in 1976 prior to the enactment of the amendments, without violating the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The retroactive application of an income tax statute to the entire calendar year in which enactment takes place does not per se violate that Clause.  Nor is the retroactive imposition of the minimum tax amendments so harsh and oppressive here as to deny due process, even though appellees would not have owed any minimum tax under the prior provisions.  Assuming, arguendo, that personal notice of tax changes is relevant, appellees cannot claim surprise, since the proposed increase in the minimum tax rate had been under public discussion for almost a year before its enactment.  And the amendments to the minimum tax did not create a ""new tax,"" since the minimum tax provision was imposed in 1969, and one of the original items of tax preference subjected to the minimum tax was the untaxed portion of any net long-term capital gain.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting. 
 In Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1, 12, 2106 (1979), we held that a Nebraska statute created an ""expectancy of release [on parole]"" that was ""entitled to some measure of constitutional protection."" The Nebraska statute provided in part: 
 ""(a) There is a substantial risk that he will not conform to the conditions of parole; 
Page 449 U.S. 1093 , 1094
 ""(b) His release would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or promote disrespect for law; 
 ""(c) His release would have a substantially adverse effect on institutional discipline; or 
 ""(d) His continued correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in the facility will substantially enhance his capacity to lead a law-abiding life when released at a later date."" 1 
 We emphasized that our decision rested on the ""unique structure and language"" of the Nebraska statute and cautioned that whether any other state statute created a liberty interest would have to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Id., at 12. 
 In this case respondent, a Delaware state prisoner, filed suit against petitioners, state prison officials, alleging that petitioners violated his due process rights when they denied him work release. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit examined the Delaware statutory provisions and regulations governing work release programs in light of Greenholtz and concluded that a liberty interest was implicated when respondent was denied work release. The court conceded that Delaware prison officials exercise substantial discretion in making work release decisions but concluded that their discretion is not unbounded. It determined that under Delaware law prison officials must exercise their discretion ""consistently with the purpose and policy behind work release."" 2 The court also observed that the State had established ""an elaborate institutional system"" for processing work release applications.

 and 
 Eddie SPRAGGINS v. State of GEORGIA No. 80-5775 
 and 
 William Anthony BROOKS v. State of GEORGIA No. 80-5850 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 20, 1981 Rehearings Denied June 1 and June 8, 1981. 
 See 452 U.S. 910, 932, 3069. 
 On petitions for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. [ Davis v. Georgia 451 U.S. 921 (1981) ][921-Continued.] 
 These cases were all remanded to the Supreme Court of Georgia for reconsideration in light of our opinion in Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420 (1980). On remand, that court reaffirmed petitioners' death sentences. Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment, I would grant the petitions for certiorari in these cases and vacate the judgments below insofar as they leave undisturbed the death sentences. I add a few extra lines, however, to point out that even accepting, arguendo, the prevailing view that there are circumstances in which the death sentence may constitutionally be imposed, the state court in these cases has ignored the mandates of this Court. 
 Under Georgia law, the jury is responsible for sentencing in death penalty cases. Petitioners in all three of these cases were sentenced to death after the jury found, pursuant to Ga.Code 27-2534.1(b)(7) (1978), that they had committed murders that were ""outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that [they] involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim."" This statutory language is so broad that it openly invites the jury to impose the death penalty in every murder case. It was 
Page 451 U.S. 921 , 922
 the recognition that this invitation was being accepted that led to our decision last Term in Godfrey. There, four Justices of this Court agreed that ""[a] person of ordinary sensibility could fairly characterize almost every murder"" as falling within the language of 27-2534.1(b)(7). 446 U.S., at 428-429. The plurality explained that in order to be constitutionally valid, a State's capital punishment scheme ""must channel the sentencer's discretion by 'clear and objective standards' that provide 'specific and detailed guidance,' and that 'make rationally reviewable the process for imposing a sentence of death.' "" Id., at 428-1765 (footnotes omitted). See id., at 436-437, 100 S. Ct., at 1769 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment). Because the Georgia courts had failed to provide such guidance to sentencing juries, the plurality reasoned that the death sentence imposed in that case had to be vacated. 
 Following our decision in Godfrey, we vacated the judgments in these and several other cases insofar as they left undisturbed the sentences of death. On remand, the Georgia Supreme Court has treated every case in exactly the same way: it has reviewed the record to discern whether the jury, if properly instructed, could still have found the existence of this aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. On the basis of this review, that court affirmed the death sentences imposed without a proper jury instruction. I would have thought that Godfrey made clear that this sort of appellate speculation is impermissible.

 On petitions for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. [ Davis v. Georgia 451 U.S. 921 (1981) ][921-Continued.] 
 These cases were all remanded to the Supreme Court of Georgia for reconsideration in light of our opinion in Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420 (1980). On remand, that court reaffirmed petitioners' death sentences. Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment, I would grant the petitions for certiorari in these cases and vacate the judgments below insofar as they leave undisturbed the death sentences. I add a few extra lines, however, to point out that even accepting, arguendo, the prevailing view that there are circumstances in which the death sentence may constitutionally be imposed, the state court in these cases has ignored the mandates of this Court. 
 Under Georgia law, the jury is responsible for sentencing in death penalty cases. Petitioners in all three of these cases were sentenced to death after the jury found, pursuant to Ga.Code 27-2534.1(b)(7) (1978), that they had committed murders that were ""outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that [they] involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim."" This statutory language is so broad that it openly invites the jury to impose the death penalty in every murder case. It was 
Page 451 U.S. 921 , 922
 the recognition that this invitation was being accepted that led to our decision last Term in Godfrey. There, four Justices of this Court agreed that ""[a] person of ordinary sensibility could fairly characterize almost every murder"" as falling within the language of 27-2534.1(b)(7). 446 U.S., at 428-429. The plurality explained that in order to be constitutionally valid, a State's capital punishment scheme ""must channel the sentencer's discretion by 'clear and objective standards' that provide 'specific and detailed guidance,' and that 'make rationally reviewable the process for imposing a sentence of death.' "" Id., at 428-1765 (footnotes omitted). See id., at 436-437, 100 S. Ct., at 1769 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment). Because the Georgia courts had failed to provide such guidance to sentencing juries, the plurality reasoned that the death sentence imposed in that case had to be vacated. 
 Following our decision in Godfrey, we vacated the judgments in these and several other cases insofar as they left undisturbed the sentences of death. On remand, the Georgia Supreme Court has treated every case in exactly the same way: it has reviewed the record to discern whether the jury, if properly instructed, could still have found the existence of this aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. On the basis of this review, that court affirmed the death sentences imposed without a proper jury instruction. I would have thought that Godfrey made clear that this sort of appellate speculation is impermissible. What I took to be the rule of Godfrey is that it is the discretion of the sentencer that must be properly narrowed. See also Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 189, 2932-2933 (1976) (opinion of STEWART, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.); Westbrook v. Balkcom, 449 U.S. 999, 1001, 541-542 (1980) (STEWART, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). In murder cases in the State of Georgia, only the trier of fact may impose a sentence of death.
