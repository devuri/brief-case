No. 81-878
Argued October 4, 1982
Decided December 13, 1982
459 U.S. 116

Syllabus 
A Massachusetts statute ( 16C) vests in the governing bodies of schools and churches the power to prevent issuance of liquor licenses for premises within a 500-foot radius of the church or school by objecting to the license applications.  Appellee restaurant operator's application for a liquor license was denied when a church located 10 feet from the restaurant objected to the application.  Appellee then sued the licensing authorities in Federal District Court, claiming that  16C, on its face and as applied, violated, inter alia, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  The District Court held that  16C is facially unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 16C violates the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  459 U. S. 120-127.
(a) Section 16C is not simply a legislative exercise of zoning power but delegates to private, nongovernmental entities power to reject certain liquor license applications, a power ordinarily vested in governmental agencies.  Under these circumstances, the deference normally due a legislative zoning judgment is not merited.  Pp.  459 U. S. 120-122.
(b) The valid secular objective of 16C in protecting schools and churches from the commotion associated with liquor outlets may readily be accomplished by other means.  Pp.  459 U. S. 123-124.
(c) The churches' power under 16C is standardless, calling for no reasons, findings, or reasoned conclusions, and can be seen as having a ""primary"" and ""principal"" effect of advancing religion.  Pp.  459 U. S. 125-126.
(d) Section 16C substitutes the unilateral and absolute power of a church for the reasoned decisionmaking of a public legislative body acting on evidence and guided by standards on issues with significant economic and political implications, and thus enmeshes churches in the processes of government and creates the danger of ""[p]olitical fragmentation and divisiveness on religious lines,"" Lemon v.

No. 81-1008
Argued November 3, 1982
Decided December 13, 1982
459 U.S. 131

Syllabus 
In 1974, San Antonio, Tex., negotiated with petitioner railroads to transport to San Antonio coal purchased under long-term contracts in Wyoming for use in the city's coal-fired electricity generating plants.  Because it was not satisfied with the railroads' quoted rate for moving the coal, San Antonio filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).  In 1976, the ICC issued a temporary order, subject to modification, establishing a rate of $10.93 per ton.  In 1978, on petition of the railroads, the ICC ordered the rate raised to $16.12 per ton.  But both San Antonio and the railroads were dissatisfied, and in 1979, the ICC issued a third order resulting in a rate of $17.23 per ton.  The railroads then filed tariffs at this rate.  Petitions for review of the 1978 and 1979 orders were filed by all parties in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which, in 1980, decided that both orders were arbitrary and capricious, and accordingly vacated them and remanded to the ICC.  The parties disagreed about the effect of this decision on the filed tariffs pending the ICC's decision on remand, the railroads continuing to treat the $17.23 rate as the one San Antonio was required to pay, and San Antonio claiming that the $10.93 rate was revived.  The railroads then asked the Court of Appeals for clarification of its decision.  Ultimately, after the parties, pending review, had carried on their controversy in other forums, including the ICC, which, in 1981, vacated the 1976 order, the Court of Appeals, later in 1981, held that, since it was without authority to determine interim policy pending remand proceedings in the ICC, the effect of the court's 1980 decision was necessarily to reinstate the 1976 order, which was ""revived"" by the vacation of the 1978 and 1979 orders, and that therefore tariffs set in excess of the 1976 rate were ""unlawful"" for the period after the court vacated the 1978 and 1979 orders, but before the ICC formally vacated the 1976 order.
Held:  The Court of Appeals should have deferred to the ICC on questions concerning the applicable rates.  Pp.  459 U. S. 138-144.
(a) Under the Interstate Commerce Act, primary jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of rates lies with the ICC.  Federal court authority to reject ICC rate orders extends to the orders alone, and not 
Page 459 U. S. 132
 to the rates.  Where there is a dispute about the appropriate rate, the equities favor allowing the carriers' rate to control pending a decision by the ICC, since, under the Act, the shipper may receive reparations for overpayment, while the carrier can never be made whole after underpayment.  Pp.  459 U. S. 138-142.
(b) By declaring that the 1976 rate order was ""revived"" for the period indicated, the Court of Appeals did what a federal court may not do, i.e., freeze the rate the railroads charge shipper prior to a decision by the ICC as to what a reasonable rate should be.  This undermines the ICC' ability to exercise its primary jurisdiction to insure equitable and uniform rate.  Moreover, the Court of Appeals' determination requires the railroads to accept a return that was considered temporary when it was approved in 1976, and ""below a maximum reasonable rate"" when it was modified in 1978.  If the court was unsure about the continued vitality of the 1976 order, the more appropriate course would have been to remand to the ICC for explanation, rather than to undertake itself to construe the order, and in so doing interfere with the ICC's primary jurisdiction.  In striking the 1978 and 1979 orders, the court's action operated to leave in effect the rates filed under the ICC's authority pending the ICC's redetermination of a reasonable rate and subject to reparations to protect the shipper should the ICC find that these rates were too high.  Pp.  459 U. S. 142-144.

No. 81-1489
Argued November 10, 1982
Decided December 13, 1982
459 U.S. 145

Syllabus 
Appellant, a New York corporation that manufactures and sells copying machines, shipped machine parts manufactured in this country to Mexico City, Mexico, for assembly by its affiliate there.  After assembly, the copiers were transported by a customs bonded trucking company to a customs bonded warehouse in Houston, Tex., where they were segregated from other merchandise and stored while awaiting sale and shipment to appellant's affiliates in Latin America.  None of these copiers were ever sold to customers for domestic use, but remained under the continuous control and supervision of the United States Customs Service from the time they entered the warehouse until they cleared United States Customs at their export ports.  In 1977, both the city of Houston and Harris County (appellees) assessed ad valorem personal property taxes on the copiers stored in the Houston warehouse.  Appellant sought declaratory and injunctive relief in state court, claiming that the taxes were unconstitutional.  Appellees counterclaimed for the taxes assessed.  The trial court entered judgment for appellant, holding that the taxes violated the Import-Export and Commerce Clauses of the Constitution.  The Texas Court of Civil Appeals reversed and granted judgment to appellees on their counterclaims, holding that the taxes violated neither Clause of the Constitution and, alternatively, that the trial court had violated state law in granting injunctive relief.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C.  1257(2).  Notwithstanding appellees' argument that this Court lacks jurisdiction because the Court of Civil Appeals' decision reversing the grant of an injunction rested on an independent and adequate state ground, an indispensable predicate to the award of judgment to appellees on their counterclaims was a determination that the taxes were permissible under the Federal Constitution.  P.  459 U. S. 149.
2. State property taxes, such as those involved here, on goods stored under bond in a customs warehouse are preempted by Congress' comprehensive regulation of customs duties.  Under the customs system, established pursuant to Congress' powers under the Commerce Clause, imports may be stored duty-free in Government-supervised bonded 
Page 459 U. S. 146
 warehouses for prescribed periods, and during such periods may be withdrawn and reexported without payment of duty.  Only if the goods are withdrawn for domestic sale or stored beyond the prescribed period does any duty become due.  Congress created such duty-free enclaves under federal control in order to encourage merchants here and abroad to make use of American ports as transshipment centers for goods in foreign trade.  It would not be compatible with the comprehensive scheme Congress enacted to effect these goals if the states were free to tax such goods while they were lodged temporarily in Government-regulated bonded storage in this country.

No. 81-708
Argued October 6, 1982
Decided December 13, 1982
459 U.S. 159

Syllabus 
Under  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a covered State or political subdivision, such as appellant city of Port Arthur, must obtain federal preclearance of a change in its voting practices or procedures either from the Attorney General or by obtaining a declaratory judgment from the District Court for the District of Columbia that the proposed change has neither the purpose nor the effect of denying the right to vote on account of race.  In 1977 and 1978, Port Arthur was consolidated with two neighboring cities and annexed an incorporated area, with the result that the percentage of the black population within Port Arthur's borders decreased from 45.21% to 40.56%.  Appellant ultimately filed a  5 suit in the District Court, seeking approval of the consolidations and the annexation, and of a proposed expansion of its City Council from seven members (including a mayor), who had been previously elected at large by majority vote, to a nine-member Council.  After the rejection of earlier electoral plans, appellant submitted a plan involving election of councilmen from four single-member districts, two of which included black majorities; election of two members from two other districts, each of which consisted of two of the four single-member districts, and one of which had a black majority; and at-large election of two other members from the latter two districts and of the mayor.  All Council seats would be governed by a majority vote rule, requiring runoffs if none of the candidates received a majority of the votes cast.  Although concluding that the expansion of Port Arthur's borders could not be denied preclearance as being discriminatory in purpose, the District Court held that the electoral plan could not be approved under  5 because it insufficiently neutralized the adverse impact upon minority voting strength that resulted from the expansion.  However, the court stated that, if the plan were modified to eliminate the majority vote requirement with respect to the two nonmayoral, at-large candidates, and to permit election to those two seats to be made by a plurality vote, the court would consider the defect remedied, and would offer its approval.
Held:  The District Court did not exceed its authority in conditioning clearance of the electoral plan on the elimination of the majority vote requirement.  Pp.  459 U. S. 165-168. 
Page 459 U. S. 160

(a) Section 5 does not forbid all expansion of municipal borders that dilute the voting power of particular groups in the community.  However, such an expansion can be approved only if modifications in the electoral plan, calculated to neutralize to the extent possible any adverse effect on the political participation of minority groups, are adopted.  Pp.  459 U. S. 165-166.
(b) The District Court did not err in holding that the majority vote requirement as to the nonmayoral, at-large council seats must be eliminated in order to sufficiently dispel the impact of Port Arthur's expansion on the relative political strength of the black community.  Whether the plan adequately reflected black political strength in the enlarged city is not an issue that is determinable with mathematical precision.  Since the plan undervalued to some extent the political strength of the black community, eliminating the majority vote requirement was an understandable adjustment. And, even if the electoral scheme might otherwise be said to reflect the political strength of the minority community, elimination of the majority vote element was a reasonable hedge against the possibility that the scheme contained a purposefully discriminatory element.

No. 80, Orig.
Argued October 4, 1982
Decided December 13, 1982
459 U.S. 176

Syllabus 
The Vermejo River -- which originates in southern Colorado but is located primarily in New Mexico -- is at present fully appropriated by users in New Mexico.  Colorado seeks an equitable apportionment of the river's water in order to divert water for proposed uses.  The Special Master, after a trial, recommended in his report that Colorado be permitted a diversion of 4,000 acre-feet per year.  The Special Master recognized that strict application of the rule of prior appropriation would not permit any diversion.  In applying the principle of equitable apportionment, however, he did not focus exclusively on the rule of priority, but apparently rested his recommendation on the alternative grounds that New Mexico could compensate for some or all of the Colorado diversion through reasonable water conservation measures, and that the injury, if any, to New Mexico would be outweighed by the benefit to Colorado from the diversion.  New Mexico filed exceptions to the Special Master's report.
Held:
1. The flexible principle of equitable apportionment applies to a State's claim to divert water for future uses, and the criteria relied upon by the Special Master comport with this Court's prior cases.  Pp. 183188.
(a) When, as in this case, both States recognize the doctrine of prior appropriation, priority becomes the guiding principle, but not the sole criterion, in determining an equitable apportionment.  Pp.  459 U. S. 183-184.
(b) While the equities supporting the protection of established, senior uses are substantial, it is also appropriate to consider additional factors relevant to a just apportionment, such as the conservation measures available to both States here and the balance of harms and benefits to the States that might result from the diversion sought by Colorado.  Pp.  459 U. S. 184-187.
(c) A State seeking a diversion for future uses must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the benefits of the diversion substantially outweigh the harm that might result.  Pp.  459 U. S. 187-188.
2. However, the Special Master's report does not contain sufficient factual findings to enable this Court to assess the correctness of his application of the principle of equitable apportionment to the facts of this 
Page 459 U. S. 177
 case.  Accordingly, this Court remands for additional findings, including specific findings relating to the Special Master's reliance on the factors of the availability of conservation measures and the weighing of the harms and benefits that would result from the diversion.  Pp.  459 U. S. 189-190.

No. 81-1506
Argued November 1, 1982
Decided December 13, 1982
459 U.S. 197

Syllabus 
The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 2 U.S.C.  441b(a), prohibits corporations and labor unions from making contributions or expenditures in connection with federal elections.  The section, however, permits some participation by unions and corporations in the federal electoral process by allowing these organizations to establish and pay the expenses of ""separate segregated funds"" which may be used for political purposes during federal elections.  The Act restricts the operations of such segregated funds in several respects.  Of most relevance here, 2 U.S.C.  441b(b)(4)(A) and 441b(b)(4)(C) provide that a corporation without capital stock may solicit contributions to a fund it has established only from ""members"" of the corporation.  During 1976, respondent National Right to Work Committee (NRWC), a corporation without capital stock, solicited some 267,000 persons for contributions to a separate segregated fund that it sponsored.  Petitioner Federal Election Commission determined that NRWC's solicitation violated  441b(b)(4)(C), because the persons it had solicited were not its members.  Among other things, NRWC's solicitation letters did not mention membership, its articles of incorporation disclaim the existence of members, and members play no part in the operation or administration of the corporation.
Held:
1. The persons solicited by NRWC were insufficiently attached to the corporation to qualify as members under  441b(b)(4)(C).  This interpretation of the Act does not raise constitutional difficulties.  Pp.  459 U. S. 201-207.
2. The First Amendment associational rights asserted by NRWC are overborne by the interests Congress has sought to protect in enacting  441b.  The provision marks the culmination of a careful legislative adjustment of the federal electoral laws to prevent both actual and apparent corruption, and reflects a legislative judgment that the special characteristics of corporations require prophylactic measures.  Pp. 207-211.

Held:  The disclosure provisions of the Ohio Campaign Expense Reporting Law requiring every candidate for political office to report the names and addresses of campaign contributors and recipients of campaign disbursements, cannot be constitutionally applied to appellee Socialist Workers Party (SWP), a minor political party that historically has been the object of harassment by Government officials and private parties.

 ""Despite the eleventh-hour presentation of new issues, we have reviewed each of the new issues carefully and again reviewed each of the issues previously presented to us. Each member of this panel is acutely aware that Brooks' life may depend on our action. Each of us is determined to fulfill our sworn obligation to up-

Despite this, we would not hesitate to grant the stay were we aware of any argument of substance, any contention that would benefit by further briefing and oral argument. The application for stay has received the sober, reasoned, and deliberate consideration of Brooks' claim that the irrevocable nature of the penalty demands. Our granting of yet another stay at this late hour for further review of claims so often considered and of such little merit would be abdication of our duty to face and decide the issue before us in accordance with the Constitution and Laws of the United States.

 NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE et al. v. NORTH AMERICAN SOCCER LEAGUE et al  No. 81-2296 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 6, 1982 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 This lawsuit is an attack under 1 of the Sherman Act by the North American Soccer League and most of its member teams (""NASL"") on the cross- ownership rule imposed by the National Football League (""NFL"") on the owners of its member teams. The rule, in essence, prohibits NFL owners from obtaining a controlling interest in any other major league professional sports team. The Court of Appeals found that the rule violates 1 under the Rule of Reason, and enjoined the NFL from enforcing it. 
Page 459 U.S. 1074, 1075
 The NASL's complaint alleged that the cross-ownership rule excludes it from a substantial share of the market for ""professional sports capital and entrepreneural skill."" The NFL contended that the relevant market was for capital generally, and that the rule does not exclude anyone from a significant share of the capital market. The District Court decided that the relevant market is in between-a market for ""sports capital""-but did not define precisely the extent of this market. It then decided that any competition between the NFL and the NASL in that market is competition between two single economic entities. 505 F.Supp. 659 (SDNY 1980). It thus held that 1 of the Sherman Act does not apply because the NFL is a single economic entity that cannot combine or conspire with itself. Id., at 689. 
 The Court of Appeals rejected this view. 670 F.2d 1249 (CA2 1982). It thought ""[t]he characterization of the NFL as a single economic entity does not exempt from the Sherman Act an agreement between its members to restrain competition."" See Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 141-142, 88 S.Ct. 1981, 1985-1986, 20 L.Ed.2d 982 (1968); Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 598, 71 S.Ct. 971, 974 (1951). The Court of Appeals thought the objective of the cross-ownership rule is to protect individual teams as well as the league from competition. 
 At this point, the Court of Appeals had dealt with the District Court's entire holding. The District Court expressly declined to consider whether the cross-ownership rule violates the Rule of Reason. 505 F.Supp., at 689. The application of the Rule of Reason is to be made by ""the factfinder [who] weighs all of the circumstances of a case."" Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 49, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 2557, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977). See, e.g., Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 302 (CA2 1979). The proper course for the Court of Appeals thus would have been to remand for findings by the District Court. However, it proceeded to decide the merits on its own. [459 U.S. 1074, 1076]

The rule, in essence, prohibits NFL owners from obtaining a controlling interest in any other major league professional sports team. The Court of Appeals found that the rule violates 1 under the Rule of Reason, and enjoined the NFL from enforcing it. 
Page 459 U.S. 1074, 1075
 The NASL's complaint alleged that the cross-ownership rule excludes it from a substantial share of the market for ""professional sports capital and entrepreneural skill."" The NFL contended that the relevant market was for capital generally, and that the rule does not exclude anyone from a significant share of the capital market. The District Court decided that the relevant market is in between-a market for ""sports capital""-but did not define precisely the extent of this market. It then decided that any competition between the NFL and the NASL in that market is competition between two single economic entities. 505 F.Supp. 659 (SDNY 1980). It thus held that 1 of the Sherman Act does not apply because the NFL is a single economic entity that cannot combine or conspire with itself. Id., at 689. 
 The Court of Appeals rejected this view. 670 F.2d 1249 (CA2 1982). It thought ""[t]he characterization of the NFL as a single economic entity does not exempt from the Sherman Act an agreement between its members to restrain competition."" See Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 141-142, 88 S.Ct. 1981, 1985-1986, 20 L.Ed.2d 982 (1968); Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 598, 71 S.Ct. 971, 974 (1951). The Court of Appeals thought the objective of the cross-ownership rule is to protect individual teams as well as the league from competition. 
 At this point, the Court of Appeals had dealt with the District Court's entire holding. The District Court expressly declined to consider whether the cross-ownership rule violates the Rule of Reason. 505 F.Supp., at 689. The application of the Rule of Reason is to be made by ""the factfinder [who] weighs all of the circumstances of a case."" Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 49, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 2557, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977). See, e.g., Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 302 (CA2 1979). The proper course for the Court of Appeals thus would have been to remand for findings by the District Court. However, it proceeded to decide the merits on its own. [459 U.S. 1074, 1076]

No. 81-184
Argued October 6, 1982
Decided November 30, 1982
459 U.S. 70

Syllabus 
A provision of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 11 U.S.C.  522(f)(2) (1976 ed., Supp. V), permits individual debtors in bankruptcy proceedings to avoid nonpossessory, nonpurchase-money liens on certain property, including household furnishings and appliances.  Appellees loaned individual debtors money and obtained and perfected such liens on the debtors' household furnishings and appliances before the 1978 Act was enacted.  Subsequently, these debtors instituted separate bankruptcy proceedings under the 1978 Act.  Sections 522(b) and (d) exempt household items from the property included within debtors' estates.  The debtors claimed these exemptions, relying on  522(f)(2) to avoid the liens.  The Bankruptcy Courts refused to apply  522(f)(2) retroactively to abrogate the liens.  The Court of Appeals, in consolidated appeals, affirmed, holding that, although the 1978 Act was intended to apply retrospectively, and thus was designed to invalidate liens acquired before the enactment date, such an application violates the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Held:  Section 522(f)(2) was not intended to be applied retrospectively to destroy preenactment property rights.  Pp.  459 U. S. 74-82.
(a) Where there is substantial doubt whether retroactive destruction of appellees' liens would comport with the Fifth Amendment, the cardinal principle that this Court will first determine whether a construction of a statute is fairly possible by which the constitutional question may be avoided warrants a consideration of whether, as a matter of statutory construction,  522(f)(2) must necessarily be applied retroactively.  Pp.  459 U. S. 74-78.
(b) No bankruptcy law shall be construed to eliminate property rights that existed before the law was enacted in the absence of an explicit command from Congress.  In light of this principle, in the absence of a clear expression of Congress' intent to apply  522(f)(2) to property rights established before the enactment date, the statute will not be construed in a manner that could call upon this Court to resolve difficult and sensitive

459 U.S. 42

Syllabus 
Respondent, a soldier stationed in Missouri, after being arrested on a charge of rape and after consulting with private counsel and with an attorney provided him by the Army, requested a polygraph examination.  Immediately prior to the examination, which was conducted by an agent of the Army's Criminal Investigation Division (CID), respondent signed a consent document that included information of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436; the CID agent read to respondent a detailed statement that also explained his rights, including the right to stop answering questions at any time or to speak to a lawyer before answering further, even if he signed a waiver certificate; and respondent, in response to a question, stated that he did not want a lawyer present.  At the conclusion of the polygraph examination, the CID agent told respondent that there had been some deceit, and asked him if he could explain why his answers were bothering him; respondent then admitted having intercourse with the victim, but said that it had been consensual; the agent asked whether respondent wished to discuss the matter further with another CID agent and with the local Police Chief, and respondent said that he did.  The Police Chief read respondent his Miranda warnings once again before questioning him, and respondent repeated that his sexual contact with the victim had been consensual.  Respondent was convicted after trial in a Missouri state court, which denied his motion to suppress the testimony of the two CID agents and the Police Chief as to his ""confessions"" to voluntary intercourse, holding that he had waived his rights.  The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, and the Federal District Court denied respondent's subsequent petition for habeas corpus relief.  However, the Federal Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although respondent had waived his Fifth Amendment right to have counsel present while the polygraph examination itself was being conducted, the State failed to prove that he knowingly and intelligently waived his right to the presence of counsel at the examining CID agent's ""post-test interrogation.""  The court suggested that there would have been no violation if the agent merely had paused at the end of the polygraph examination to remind respondent of his rights. 
Page 459 U. S. 43

Held:  The Court of Appeals misconstrued Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, which establishes that, where an accused, after invoking his right to counsel, initiates subsequent dialogue with the authorities, the question whether there was a valid waiver of the right to counsel as to any interrogation that occurs during such dialogue is controlled by the ""totality of the circumstances,"" including the fact that the accused initiated the dialogue.  Here, respondent initiated not just a meeting with the authorities, but interrogation, by requesting the polygraph examination.  Respondent validly waived his right to have counsel present at ""post-test"" questioning unless the circumstances changed so seriously that his answers no longer were voluntary, or unless he no longer was waiving his rights knowingly and voluntarily.  To require new warnings merely because the examination had been discontinued and respondent was asked if he could explain the test's unfavorable results would be unreasonable.  The questions put to respondent after the examination would not have caused him to forget the rights of which he had been advised, and which he had understood, moments before.
Certiorari granted; 682 F.2d 154, reversed and remanded.

|459 u.s. 56|"Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co.
No. 82-5082
Decided November 29, 1982
459 U.S. 56

Syllabus 
The District Court entered judgment for petitioners in their civil action against respondent, which then filed a timely motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59.  While that motion was still pending, respondent filed a notice of appeal.  Thereafter, the District Court denied the motion to alter or amend the judgment, and the Court of Appeals accepted jurisdiction of the appeal and reversed the District Court's judgment.  The Court of Appeals held that, although Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4) provides that a notice of appeal, filed before the disposition of a motion filed in the district court to alter or amend the judgment, ""shall have no effect,"" and a new notice of appeal ""must be filed"" after entry of the order disposing of the motion, nevertheless an appellant who filed a premature notice of appeal could proceed unless the appellee showed prejudice resulting from the premature filing of the notice, which was not done here.
Held:  The Court of Appeals' analysis of Rule 4(a)(4) is contrary to the language and purposes of the 1979 amendments to the Rules of Appellate Procedure.  Prior to 1979, if a notice of appeal was filed pending disposition of a motion to vacate, alter, or amend the judgment, it was generally held that the district court retained jurisdiction to decide the motion, and the notice of appeal was adequate for purposes of beginning the appeals process.  However, after the 1979 amendments, when a premature notice of appeal is filed, it is as if no notice of appeal were filed at all, and thus the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to act.  The requirement of a timely notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 29, 1982
 On writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
 This case is restored to the calendar for reargument. In addition to the question presented in the petition for certiorari and previously argued here, the parties are requested to address the question whether the rule requiring the exclusion at a criminal trial of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961); Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 34 S. Ct. 341 (1914), should to any extent be modified, so as, for example, not to require the exclusion of evidence obtained in the reasonable belief that the search and seizure at issue was consistent with the Fourth Amendment. 

 Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Earlier this year the Court decided not to allow the Illinois Attorney General to argue the question it now asks the parties to address. That decision was consistent with the Court's settled practice of not permitting a party to advance a ground for reversal that was not presented below. The reversal today of the Court's earlier decision is not only a flagrant departure from its settled practice, but also raises serious questions concerning the Court's management of its certiorari jurisdiction . I am therefore unable to join the Court's decision to order reargument of this case. 
 I  
 As a matter of ordinary procedure, the burdens of litigation are minimized and the decisional process is expedited if a court is consistent in its rulings as a case progresses. We set a poor example for other judges when we suddenly reverse our prior rulings in the same case. 
Page 459 U.S. 1028 , 1029
 On February 8, 1982, the State of Illinois filed a motion seeking leave to amend or enlarge the question presented for review in this case. The motion asked the Court to incorporate the following question: 
 On March 1, 1982, the Court unanimously denied that motion. On October 13, 1982, the parties presented an hour of argument; they respected our decision and did not attempt to argue the question of good faith. Today, the Court asks the parties to reargue the case in order to address the very question it would not allow the parties to argue last month. This type of inconsistent decisionmaking always imposes unnecessary costs on litigants and is wasteful of the judiciary's most scarce resource-time. 
 II  
 As a matter of appellate practice, it is generally undesirable to permit a party to seek reversal of a lower court's judgment on a ground that the lower court had no opportunity to consider. [Footnote 1] It is especially poor practice to do so when the basis for reversal involves a factual issue on which neither party adduced any evidence. Those considerations apply with added force when the judgment of the highest court of a sovereign state is being reviewed. [Footnote 2] [459 U.S. 1028 , 1030]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Opinion of Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
 Opinions supporting denial of petitions for certiorari are understandably seldom filed, but this in my view is one of the 
Page 459 U.S. 1044 , 1045
 rare cases where the filing of such an opinion is justified. Cf. Estate of Wilson v. Aiken Industries, Inc., 439 U.S. 877d 191 (1978) (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in denial of writ of certiorari); Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, Inc., 338 U.S. 912 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., opinion respecting denial of writ of certiorari). 
 Petitioner, after conviction on federal criminal charges, filed a timely motion for reduction of sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. The motion was denied on July 7, 1981. For some reason, however, notice of the denial from the Clerk of the District Court was not received by either petitioner or the United States Attorney. Petitioner-who was incarcerated the entire time-first learned of it by happenstance in September 1981. He promptly requested leave from the District Court to appeal out of time, and that Court, after due investigation of the circumstances, granted his request. 
 The government explicitly refused to contest the propriety of the appeal before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals sua sponte dismissed the appeal, holding that district courts may not grant leave to appeal after the maximum extension period has passed. See Fed.R.App.P. 4(b). The court implied that the rigidity of Rule 4(b) could not be set aside even though this petitioner was ignorant, through no fault of his own, of the denial of his Rule 35 motion throughout the period of an allowable extension. Cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 49(c).1 Petitioner sought certiorari here, and the Solicitor General informed us that he ""do[es] not oppose vacation of the judgment of dismissal and remand to the [C]ourt of [A]ppeals.""

The court implied that the rigidity of Rule 4(b) could not be set aside even though this petitioner was ignorant, through no fault of his own, of the denial of his Rule 35 motion throughout the period of an allowable extension. Cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 49(c).1 Petitioner sought certiorari here, and the Solicitor General informed us that he ""do[es] not oppose vacation of the judgment of dismissal and remand to the [C]ourt of [A]ppeals.""

 KERR-McGEE CHEMICAL CORPORATION v. ILLINOISNo. 82-386 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 29, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Opinion of Justice BLACKMUN respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
 I realize that it is a tradition here that one seldom writes in support of the Court's decision to deny a petition for a writ of certiorari. See, however, Castorr v. Brundage, ___ U.S. ___, 73 L.Ed.2d ___ (1982) (Stevens, J.); Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, Inc., 338 U.S. 912 (1950) (Frankfurter, J.). 
 The reason I write in this case is that I fear that the content of the final paragraphs of the dissent will tend to create confusion in an area of law that seems to me to be fairly clear. It has been well established for many years that federal question jurisdiction is present "" only when the plaintiff's statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon [federal] laws or [the federal] Constitution."" Louisville & N.R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149, 152, 43 (1908). It is insufficient ""that the defendant would set up in defense certain laws of the United States."" Id., at 153. 
 The dissent asserts, post, at 1051, that the Second Circuit in North American Phillips Corp. v. Emery Air Freight Corp., 579 F.2d 229 (1978), held that ""the lack of reference to federal law in the complaint does not control the determination whether a federal question is presented."" It would be more accurate to say that the Second Circuit held that lack of reference to federal law does not control the determination whether a federal claim is presented by the complaint. In the present case, as the dissent explains, post, at 1052, the issue, is whether ""a defendant's federal pre-emption claim presents a federal question."" In other words, the issue is 
Page 459 U.S. 1049 , 1050
 whether a federal question is presented by a federal defense to a state law claim. If a federal claim is presented by the complaint, there is federal question jurisdiction even if the complaint is phrased in state law terms; if, however, the complaint presents only a state law claim, a federal defense does not create federal question jurisdiction. 
 I thus perceive no conflict between the present case and North American Phillips, and no conflict between the present case and other cases cited by petitioner. In each of those cases, the courts followed Mottley and focused on the federal basis for the plaintiff's claim. Here, in contrast, the plaintiff's claim has no federal basis. The plaintiff could not have stated a federal cause of action no matter how it pleaded its case. Because there is no conflict, the Court, it seems to me, is on sound ground in denying the petition for a writ of certiorari. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting from the denial of certiorari. 
 Petitioner Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation (Kerr-McGee) owns a facility within the city limits of West Chicago, Illinois, that has been used since World War II to produce compounds derived from radioactive natural ores. Since 1956, the facility has been licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its predecessor. Although the facility has not been in active operation since 1973, some nuclear materials continue to be stored at the site. 
 In 1980, respondent State of Illinois filed a complaint against petitioner in an Illinois state court alleging that the operation and maintenance of the facility violates the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 1111/2, 1001, et seq., and other state statutes pertaining to the disposal of hazardous wastes. Kerr-McGee petitioned to have the State's case removed to federal court, arguing that the state regulations have been preempted by the Atomic Energy Act, 42 U.S.C. [459 U.S. 1049 , 1051]

 DALLAS COUNTY HOSPITAL DISTRICTv. DALLAS ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FOR REFORM NOW et alNo. 82-446 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 29, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held in this case that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments a hospital, like city streets and parks is a ""public forum"" which must be made available to protestors and demonstrators subject only to reasonable ""time, place, and manner"" restrictions. I think the Court of Appeals misunderstood the distinction in our cases between public property, such as city streets and parks, which has been historically treated as a ""public forum,"" see Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496 (1939), and public property, such as jails, military bases, and postal delivery boxes, which has been held not to be a public forum. See Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39, 87 S. Ct. 242 (1966); Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828 (1976); United States Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations, 453 U.S. 114 (1981). The decision of the Court of Appeals, mistakenly I believe, thus requires a hospital to promulgate a set of ""regulations"" which would provide for access to at least a part of its premises by such protest groups as respondents. To say that the deci- 
Page 459 U.S. 1052 , 1053
 sion severely limits the ability of public hospitals to devote their premises to the purpose of furnishing medical care to the sick would be an understatement. 
 Justice BLACKMUN would grant certiorari and give this case plenary consideration. 
 The Court of Appeals relied primarily on our decisions in Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147 ( 1969), and Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Commission, 447 U.S. 530 (1980). Neither one of these cases speaks to the issue here. Shuttlesworth involved the public streets of Birmingham, Alabama. Consolidated Edison represented no effort on the part of private individuals to obtain access to public property; as the Court in that case pointed out: 
 ""Consolidated Edison has not asked to use the offices of the Commission as a forum from which to promulgate its views. Rather, it seeks merely to utilize its own billing envelopes to promulgate its views on controversial issues of public policy."" 447 U.S., at 539- 540. 
 We have recently summarized the teachings of this Court's cases as to the kind of government property involved here in United States Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations, supra: 
 ""Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of any reason why this Court should treat a letterbox differently for First Amendment access purposes than it has in the past treated the military base in Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828 [] (1976), the jail or prison in Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39 [d 149] (1966), and Jones v.

In all these cases, this Court recognized that the First Amendment does not guarantee access to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the government."" 453 U.S., at 129.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 29, 1982
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the Supreme Court of North Carolina. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Opinion of Justice STEVENS respecting the denial of the petitions for writ of certiorari. 
 In each of these three capital cases the trial judge instructed the jury that it had a duty to impose the death penalty if it found: (1) that one or more aggravating circumstances existed; (2) that the aggravating circumstances were sufficiently substantial to call for the death penalty; and (3) that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. There is an ambiguity in these instructions that may raise a serious question of compliance with this Court's holding in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978).1 
 On the one hand, the instructions may be read as merely requiring that the death penalty be imposed whenever the 
Page 459 U.S. 1056 , 1057
 aggravating circumstances, discounted by whatever mitigating factors exist, are sufficiently serious to warrant the extreme penalty. Literally read, however, those instructions may lead the jury to believe that it is required to make two entirely separate inquiries: First, do the aggravating circumstances, considered apart from the mitigating circumstances, warrant the imposition of the death penalty? And second, do the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors? It seems to me entirely possible that a jury might answer both of those questions affirmatively and yet feel that a comparison of the totality of the aggravating factors with the totality of mitigating factors leaves it in doubt as to the proper penalty. But the death penalty can be constitutionally imposed only if the procedure assures reliability in the determination that ""death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case ."" Lockett, supra, 438 U.S., at 601 (plurality opinion ), quoting Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 305, 2991 (1976) (opinion of STEWART, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.). 
 A quotation from a recent opinion by the Utah Supreme Court, which takes a less rigid approach to this issue, will illustrate my point. In State v. Wood, 648 P.2d 71, 83 (Utah 1982), that court wrote: 
 ""It is our conclusion that the appropriate standard to be followed by the sentencing authority-judge or jury-in a capital case is the following: 
 'After considering the totality of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, you must be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that total aggravation outweighs total mitigation, and you must further be persuaded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the imposition of the death penalty is justified and appropriate in the circumstances.' 
 ""These standards require that the sentencing body compare the totality of the mitigating against the totality of the aggravating factors, not in terms of the relative numbers of the aggravating and the mitigating factors, [459 U.S. 1056 , 1058]

No. 81-129
Argued October 5, 1982
Decided November 15, 1982
459 U.S. 21

Syllabus 
Section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (Act) permits the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to examine ""all aliens"" who seek ""admission or readmission to"" the United States and empowers immigration officers to take evidence concerning the privilege of any persons suspected of being an alien ""to enter, reenter, pass through, or reside"" in the United States, and to detain for further inquiry ""every alien"" who does not appear ""to be clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to"" enter.  Under  236(a), if an alien is so detained, the officer is directed to determine whether the alien ""shall be allowed to enter or shall be excluded and deported.""  Following an exclusion hearing, the INS denied respondent, a permanent resident alien, admission to the United States when she returned from a brief visit to Mexico that involved an attempt to smuggle aliens across the border.  Subsequently, respondent filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, seeking release from the exclusion order and contending that she was entitled to have the question of her admissibility litigated in a deportation proceeding where she would be entitled to procedural protections and substantive rights not available in exclusion proceedings.  The District Court vacated the INS's decision, instructing it to proceed against respondent, if at all, only in deportation proceedings.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The INS had statutory authority to proceed in an exclusion hearing to determine whether respondent was attempting to ""enter"" the United States and whether she was excludable.  The language and history of the Act both clearly reflect a congressional intent that, whether or not the alien is a permanent resident, admissibility shall be determined in an exclusion hearing.  Nothing in the language or history suggests that respondent's status as a permanent resident entitles her to a suspension of the exclusion hearing or requires the INS to proceed only through a deportation hearing.  Pp.  459 U. S. 25-28.
2. Contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals, it was not ""circular"" and ""unfair"" to allow the INS to litigate the question of ""entry"" in exclusion 
Page 459 U. S. 22
 proceedings simply because that question also went to the merits of respondent's admissibility.  Nor did the use of exclusion proceedings violate either the ""scope"" or ""spirit"" of Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449, where the Court held that an ""innocent, casual, and brief excursion"" by a resident alien outside this country's borders would not subject him to the consequences of an ""entry"" on his return.  Pp.  459 U. S. 28-32.
3. Although, under the circumstances, respondent is entitled to due process in her exclusion hearing, the case will be remanded to the Court of Appeals to consider whether she was accorded due process, because the factors relevant to due process analysis have not been adequately presented here to permit an assessment of the sufficiency of the hearing.  Pp.  459 U. S. 32-37.

 proceedings simply because that question also went to the merits of respondent's admissibility.  Nor did the use of exclusion proceedings violate either the ""scope"" or ""spirit"" of Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449, where the Court held that an ""innocent, casual, and brief excursion"" by a resident alien outside this country's borders would not subject him to the consequences of an ""entry"" on his return.

3. Although, under the circumstances, respondent is entitled to due process in her exclusion hearing, the case will be remanded to the Court of Appeals to consider whether she was accorded due process, because the factors relevant to due process analysis have not been adequately presented here to permit an assessment of the sufficiency of the hearing.

|459 u.s. 14|"Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Miranda
No. 82-29
Decided November 8, 1982
459 U.S. 14

Syllabus 
While in the United States after the expiration of his temporary visitor's visa, respondent alien married a United States citizen.  His wife filed a petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), requesting that he be granted an immigrant visa as her spouse, and respondent simultaneously applied to the INS for adjustment of his status to that of a permanent resident alien.  The wife's petition, if approved, would have satisfied  245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which conditions the granting of permanent resident status to an alien on the immediate availability of an immigrant visa.  The INS did not act on either the wife's petition or respondent's application for 18 months, and when the marriage broke up, the wife withdrew her petition.  The INS then denied respondent's application because an immigrant visa was not immediately available to him.  In subsequent administrative deportation proceedings, the INS rejected respondent's claims that his previous marriage was sufficient to support his application for permanent resident status, and that the INS was estopped from denying his application because of its ""unreasonable delay.""  Respondent sought review of the administrative decision in the Court of Appeals, which ultimately reversed, holding that the INS's unexplained 18-month delay in processing respondent's application was ""affirmative misconduct"" that estopped the Government from denying the application.
Held:  Regardless of whether or not even ""affirmative misconduct"" will estop the Government from enforcing the immigration laws, the evidence here did not rise to that level.  Respondent showed only that the Government failed to process his application promptly.  Even if the INS arguably was negligent in not acting more expeditiously, neither such conduct nor the harm to respondent was sufficient to estop the Government.  Cf. Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U. S. 308; INS v. Hibi, 414 U. S. 5; Schweiker v. Hansen, 450 U. S. 785.
Certiorari granted; 673 F.2d 1105, reversed.

 AVENUE BOOK STORE v. CITY OF TALLMADGE, OHIONo. 81-2313 Supreme Court of the United States November 8, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Ohio, Summit County. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting from the denial of certiorari. 
 In a common law public nuisance action instituted by the City of Tallmadge, Ohio, petitioner Avenue Book Store was found to have been selling obscene material. The trial court concluded that the operation of the bookstore constituted a public nuisance as ""a danger to the public morals and to the community welfare."" The rear portion of petitioner's bookstore, where the obscene material had been displayed and sold, was ordered permanently closed. 
 On appeal, the Ohio Court of Appeals upheld the injunction with some modifications. The injunction currently in effect provides: In abatement of the nuisance, defendant is enjoined from utilizing the rear section of the store for the exhibition, display or sale of materials which display or depict sexual conduct (activity) that is obscene as defined by R.C. 1907.01 and interpreted by the Ohio Supreme Court in State v. Burgun (1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 354 (384 N.E.2d 255). 
 City of Tallmadge, Ohio v. Avenue Book Store, No. 10038, (Ohio App. Summit County, Oct. 28, 1981) (unreported); App. to Pet. for Cert. 47. The Court of Appeals held that the injunction, as modified, did not constitute a prior restraint of protected communicative material in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments because ""no punishment will be imposed until it is proven that obscene material was indeed involved."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 48. Assuming the injunction was a prior restraint, the court held it was not an unconstitutional one because it did not ""carry with it any of the dangers of a censorship system"" against which the First Amendment protects. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49. Petitioner challenges both aspects of this holding. 
Page 459 U.S. 997 , 998
 In Vance v. Universal Amusement Co., 445 U.S. 308 (1980), this Court upheld a finding that a Texas public nuisance statute authorized an unconstitutional ""prior restraint of indefinite duration on the exhibition of motion pictures without a final judicial determination of obscenity and without any guarantee of prompt review of a preliminary finding of probable obscenity."" Fatal to that statute were particular procedural infirmities of the Texas nuisance scheme whereby the subject of an abatement order or injunction ""would be subject to contempt proceedings even if the film (was) ultimately found to be nonobscene."" Id., at 316. 
 The Court has never determined, however, whether abatement orders, such as the one involved in the present case, will pass constitutional muster when they permanently enjoin the use of a business premises for the sale or display of obscene material, but do not subject the owner to contempt sanctions unless there has been a judicial determination of obscenity. Various state courts have held that the exhibition, display, or sale of obscene material may not be enjoined unless there has been a prior judicial determination on the obscenity of the particular materials sought to be enjoined regardless of the procedural safeguards employed. See e.g., People ex rel. Busch v. Projection Room Theatre, 17 Cal.2d 42, 130 Cal. Rptr. 328, 550 P.2d 600, 610 (exhibition or sale of magazines or films not specifically determined to be obscene may not be enjoined), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 922 (1976); State ex rel. Cahalan v. Diversified Theatrical Corp., 59 Mich.App. 223, 229 N.W.2d 389, 398 (1975) ( upholding one year closure but rejecting permanent injunction on use of building for exhibition of lewd films-only films already adjudged obscene may be enjoined). 
 Other State courts have upheld such injunctions against a constitutional challenge. The present case is such a decision. See also State ex rel. Andrews v. Chateau X, Inc., 296 N.C. 251, 250 S.E.2d 603 ( 1979), vacated and remanded, 445 U.S. 947 ( 1980), reaffirmed, 302 N.C. 321, 275 S.E.2d [459 U.S. 997 , 999]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of New Jersey. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 Because of the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision in this case, ""(t) wo highly motivated senior citizens are left without redress for libelous publications holding them up to contempt and ridicule in the community in which they have lived for many years. This is the result of their sincere attempt to participate in local government."" 89 N.J. 451, 446 A.2d 469 ( 1982) (Schreiber, J., dissenting). Because I think that the decision of the Supreme Court of New Jersey was based on an erroneous belief that the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution required it, notwithstanding society's ""pervasive and strong interest in preventing and redressing attacks upon reputation,"" Rosenblatt v. Baer, 383 U.S. 75, 86, 676 (1966), I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
Page 459 U.S. 999 , 1000
 Petitioners, Lawrence and Simpson, were officers of a citizens group called Rahway Taxpayers Association. In 1974, the Association began a petition drive seeking a public referendum on plans to construct a new municipal firehouse. In late December, 1974, petitions containing over 5, 000 signatures were submitted to the Rahway City Clerk. On January 9, 1975, the Rahway News-Record, a newspaper owned and operated by respondents, printed the following headline across the top of its front page: ""City Attorney Rules Association Petitions Improper; Forgery Charges May Loom for Lawrence, Simpson."" The accompanying article stated in pertinent part: 
 ""In separate actions city attorney Alan Karcher ruled the petitions filed by the officials of the Rahway Taxpayers Association are improper and attorney Theodore J. Romankow was asked to take action by city officials against association leaders because of 'irregularities' in the petitions. 
 The Rahway News-Record learned Mr. Romankow was empowered to handle a case against Alonzo W. Lawrence, president of the Association, and James Simpson, the group's secretary-treasurer. 
 The case would be based on charges that forgery was involved in the gathering of approximately 5,000 signatures which the two men filed with the city clerk Robert W. Schrof on December 17, the News- Record was told. 
 In connection with this the men would also be charged with false swearing of oaths and affidavits, it was asserted.' 89 N.J., at 456, 446 A.2d., at 471. 
 In response to petitioners' request that the News-Record retract these allegations, the newspaper ran a second front-page story on April 17, 1975. The headline read: ""News-Record Asked to Retract Article on Firehouse Battle."" Rather than give a retraction, the newspaper proceeded to reiterate and defend its earlier story claiming that the story was based [459 U.S. 999 , 1001]

 James Martin SMITH v. Douglas GONZALES et alNo. 82-145 Supreme Court of the United States November 8, 1982 Rehearing Denied Jan. 10, 1983. See U.S.. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 The respondent police officer Lane went to the local district attorney's office with petitioner Smith's minor daughter, who averred that she had had sexual relations with her father. After hearing her story, an assistant district attorney swore out an affidavit and procured an arrest warrant from a judge. Lane, acting pursuant to the warrant, then arrested Smith on incest charges. After being tried and acquitted of these charges, Smith filed a 1983 damages action for deprivation of his constitutional rights, alleging, inter alia, that Lane's involvement in his arrest was malicious, harassing, and in bad faith. [Footnote 1] After a trial, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Lane. On appeal, the Court of Appeals held that the claim relating to the incest charges never should have gone to trial, but rather should have been dismissed. Assuming arguendo that Lane had, as alleged, acted maliciously by withholding evidence of Smith's innocence from the district attorney who obtained the arrest warrant,2 the court found that the officer was nevertheless insulated from 1983 liability, because ""if the facts supporting an arrest are put before an intermediary such as a magistrate or grand jury, the intermediary's decision to issue a warrant or return an indictment breaks the causal chain ...."" 670 F.2d 522, 526 ( CA5 1982). 
Page 459 U.S. 1005 , 1006
 The Fifth Circuit thus held that an officer cannot be liable even if, by wrongful means, he taints the independent judgment of the grand jury, magistrate, prosecutor, or other intermediary. This holding appears to conflict with statements of the courts in Smiddy v. Varney, 665 F.2d 261 ( CA9 1981), cert. denied, -- U.S. --, 73 L.Ed.2d -- (1982); Ames v. United States, 600 F.2d 183 (CA8 1979); and Dellums v. Powell, 184 U.S.App.D.C. 275, 566 F.2d 167, (1977), cert. denied, 438 U.S. 916, 98 S. Ct. 3146 (1978). The Ninth Circuit determined in Smiddy that an intermediary's independent decision breaks the causal chain and insulates the arresting officer from future liability if, but only if, the officer does not color the intermediary's independent judgment by, for example, exerting pressure or presenting false evidence. 665 F.2d, at 266- 267. The District of Columbia Circuit indicated in Dellums that pressure, undue influence, or knowing misstatements by the police could rebut the presumption of independent judgment by United States Attorneys and extend the ""chain of causation."" 566 F.2d, at 192-193. Likewise, the Eighth Circuit in Ames stated that ""the presentation of false evidence or the withholding of evidence"" might preclude an immunization of officers from tort liability. 600 F.2d, at 185. See also ALI, Restatement (2d) of Torts 653 (1977); W. Prosser, The Law of Torts 836-837 (4th ed. 1971). 
 The differing approaches to the causation problem are typified by three contrasting options in Rodriguez v. Ritchey, 556 F.2d 1185 (CA5 1977 ) (en banc) cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1047 ( 1978), which the court below in the present case purported to follow. The six plurality judges in Rodriguez reasoned that the defendant officers could not be liable for a wrongful arrest because an indictment by a properly-constituted grand jury ""conclusively"" determined the existence of probable cause. Id., at 1191 (opinion of Tjoflat, J.). Two specially concurring judges indicated that the plurality's rule might not be applicable should an officer ""maliciously or in bad faith seek to obtain an indictment from a grand jury.""

United States, 600 F.2d 183 (CA8 1979); and Dellums v. Powell, 184 U.S.App.D.C. 275, 566 F.2d 167, (1977), cert. denied, 438 U.S. 916, 98 S. Ct. 3146 (1978). The Ninth Circuit determined in Smiddy that an intermediary's independent decision breaks the causal chain and insulates the arresting officer from future liability if, but only if, the officer does not color the intermediary's independent judgment by, for example, exerting pressure or presenting false evidence. 665 F.2d, at 266- 267. The District of Columbia Circuit indicated in Dellums that pressure, undue influence, or knowing misstatements by the police could rebut the presumption of independent judgment by United States Attorneys and extend the ""chain of causation."" 566 F.2d, at 192-193. Likewise, the Eighth Circuit in Ames stated that ""the presentation of false evidence or the withholding of evidence"" might preclude an immunization of officers from tort liability. 600 F.2d, at 185. See also ALI, Restatement (2d) of Torts 653 (1977); W. Prosser, The Law of Torts 836-837 (4th ed. 1971). 
 The differing approaches to the causation problem are typified by three contrasting options in Rodriguez v. Ritchey, 556 F.2d 1185 (CA5 1977 ) (en banc) cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1047 ( 1978), which the court below in the present case purported to follow. The six plurality judges in Rodriguez reasoned that the defendant officers could not be liable for a wrongful arrest because an indictment by a properly-constituted grand jury ""conclusively"" determined the existence of probable cause. Id., at 1191 (opinion of Tjoflat, J.). Two specially concurring judges indicated that the plurality's rule might not be applicable should an officer ""maliciously or in bad faith seek to obtain an indictment from a grand jury.""

Decided November 1, 1982
459 U.S. 4

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder after a jury trial in a Michigan state court, and the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Michigan Supreme Court, on review of the record, denied relief.  Respondent then obtained habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, which held that the trial court's jury instruction allowing malice to be implied from the fact that a weapon was used unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to respondent and was inconsistent with the presumption of innocence.  The District Court also held that respondent had exhausted available state court remedies, as required by 28 U.S.C.  2254.  The Federal Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the exhaustion requirement was met because respondent had presented to the Michigan Court of Appeals the facts on which he based his federal claim, had argued that the malice instruction was ""reversible error,"" and had cited People v. Martin, 392 Mich. 553, 221 N.W.2d 33, -- a decision predicated solely on state law, but in which the defendant had argued broadly that failure to properly instruct a jury violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held:  The requirement under 28 U.S.C.  2254 that the state courts must have been provided a ""fair opportunity"" to apply controlling legal principles to the facts bearing upon the federal habeas petitioner's constitutional claim was not met here.  The ""substance"" of respondent's federal habeas corpus claim was not fairly presented to the state courts so as to meet  2254's exhaustion requirement.  The Michigan Court of Appeals interpreted respondent's claim as being predicated on the state law rule of Martin, supra, that malice should not be implied from the fact that a weapon was used, and the record shows that respondent's constitutional argument was never presented to, or considered by, the Michigan courts.
Certiorari granted; 664 F.2d 610, reversed and remanded.

 Supreme Court of the United States November 1, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of Georgia, Butts County. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. Adhering to my view that capital punishment is unconstitutional in all circumstances, I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence on this basis alone. However, even if I believed that the death sentence could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances, I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence imposed here. The decision below is inconsistent with this Court's decision in Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420 (1980). At the sentencing proceeding which followed petitioner's conviction of murder, the trial court instructed the jury, in the terms of the Georgia death penalty statute, that it could impose the death sentence if it found ""that the offense of murder for which the accused has been convicted was outrageously and wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman in that it involved torture and depravity of mind."" Ga.Code Ann. 27-2534.1(b)(7). The jury instruction did not in any way clarify or narrow the words of the statute. The Court recognized in Godfrey that an instruction reciting this statutory language does not provide a constitutionally adequate ""restraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death sentence,"" because it fails to ""channel the sentencer's discretion by 'clear and objective standards' that provide 'specific and detailed guidance,' and that 'make rationally reviewable the process for imposing a sentence of death.' "" 446 U.S., at 428 (plurality opinion) (footnotes omitted). Although the instruction in this case, like the instruction in Godfrey, did no more than restate the broad statutory language, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's death sentence without requiring a new sentencing proceeding. In failing to require resentencing, the Georgia 
Page 459 U.S. 982 , 983
 Supreme Court disregarded the clear mandate of Godfrey. Although the state appellate court concluded, upon reviewing the trial record, that petitioner deserved the death sentence, the fact remains that the critical sentencing decision was left to ""the uncontrolled discretion of a basically uninstructed jury,"" id., at 429 (plurality opinion). See Newlon v. Missouri, -- U.S. --, --d -- (1982) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Brooks v.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 On The stated purposes of the demonstration were to call attention to a planned May Day demonstration and to protest the prosecution of a leader of the political party to which petitioners belonged. During the demonstration, petitioners set fire to a privately owned United States flag. 
 The United States Attorney filed an information in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, charging petitioners with casting contempt on a United States flag by publicly burning it, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 700. That statute prohibits "" knowingly casting contempt upon any flag of the United States by publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning, or trampling upon it"" (emphasis added). 
 Petitioners filed motions to dismiss the information on the ground that 700 is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to them. The motions were denied after an evidentiary hearing. Petitioners were tried by jury before a United States Magistrate. They were convicted and sentenced to eight months' imprisonment each. The district court affirmed the convictions in an unpublished opinion, and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed for the reasons stated in the district court's opinion (affirmance order reported at 673 F.2d 1318 (CA4 1982)). 
Page 459 U.S. 949 , 950
 I would grant certiorari and set this case for oral argument because I feel sure the Court would be persuaded after full briefing and oral argument that petitioners' convictions violate their First Amendment rights under the principles established in Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405 (1974); Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58 (1970); Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576 (1969); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); and West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 ( 1943). 
 It is not seriously contested that petitioners' action in burning a flag was, at a minimum, expressive conduct ""sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First ... Amendmen(t)"", Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S., at 409. This Court has repeatedly recognized the communicative connotations of the use of flags, including the United States flag. 418 U.S., at 410. Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359 (1931). It is likewise clear from the context of petitioners' act that in burning a flag they were making a statement of political protest; here, as in Spence, ""it would have been difficult for the great majority of citizens to miss the drift of (petitioners') point"". 418 U.S., at 410, 94 S.Ct. at 2730.1 Indeed, the Government could hardly contend otherwise. The statute under which petitioners were convicted requires, as an element of the offense, that they ""knowingly cast contempt"" on the flag by burning it. See infra, at 954-956.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Ohio, Cuyahoga County. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was arrested on August 13, 1980, after one Francis J. Kelley reported that petitioner has taken his motorcycle from him at knife point earlier that day, along with title to the motorcycle and some cash. On August 26, two weeks later, a Cuyahoga County grand jury handed down a one-count indictment charging petitioner with receiving stolen property. Petitioner appeared on the following September 26, pleaded guilty to the charge, and received a sentence. Then, on October 7, the grand jury returned a second indictment that charged petitioner with receiving stolen property, aggravated robbery, and intimidating a witness. The receiving and aggravated robbery counts were based upon the same theft of Mr. Kelley's belongings for which petitioner had already been convicted. Petitioner moved to dismiss the second indictment on the ground that it violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment as applied to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court dismissed the receiving count in the second indictment at the state's request, but overruled petitioner's motion to dismiss the remaining counts. 
 Petitioner took an interlocutory appeal. With one judge dissenting, the Ohio Court of Appeals, Eighth District, affirmed the trial court's ruling. It held: 
Page 459 U.S. 957 , 958
 ""The intimidation and aggravated robbery charges raise no double jeopardy issue.... (T)he aggravated robbery count implicates not a duplicate, but an allied offense.... 
 ""The allied offense issue will arise only if the defendant is found guilty of aggravated robbery. He may be tried, but cannot be convicted, for both the aggravated robbery and for receiving the stolen property acquired in the theft offense, Maumee v. Geiger (1976 ), 45 Ohio St.2d 238, 244 (344 N.E.2d 133). Accordingly, the error assigned is without merit."" Petition for Writ of Certiorari, Appendix, at 17-18. 
 The Ohio Supreme Court overruled petitioner's motion for leave to appeal, and this petition followed. 
 We have jurisdiction to review final judgments by state courts denying a defendant's pre-trial motion to dismiss an indictment on former jeopardy grounds. Harris v. Washington, 404 U.S. 55, 56, 184 (1971); see Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 656-661, 2038-2041 (1977). I would grant the petition for certiorari and set the case for oral argument. The Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits ""a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction,"" North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717, 2076 (1969), and I adhere to the view that this prohibition requires states to prosecute in one proceeding ""all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction."" Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 453- 454, 1199 (1977) (BRENNAN, J., concurring); see Brooks v. Oklahoma, -- U.S. -- (1982) ( BRENNAN, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Thompson v. Oklahoma, 429 U.S. 1053 (1977) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), and cases cited therein.

 CARPENTERS 46 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES JOINT APPRENTICESHIP AND TRAINING COMMITTEE AND TRAINING BOARDv. Linda ELDREDGE, et alNo. 81-2027 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 12, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The motion of respondents for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 This case raises a question of the proper application of Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 1. Because I believe the Court of Appeals seriously misapprehended the import of the rule, I respectfully dissent. 
 Petitioner Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee (""JATC"") is the board of trustees for the Carpenters Ap- 
Page 459 U.S. 917 , 918
 prenticeship and Training Trust Fund for Northern California. The labor- management agreement that created JATC requires it to establish and maintain programs for training apprentices. Respondents, two women who sought unsuccessfully to become carpentry apprentices, sued JATC in the District Court, claiming its selection process discriminates against women in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2. The District Court set out the facts in detail in its first opinion, 440 F.Supp. 506, 510-14 (N.D.Cal. 1977). 
 JATC's program provides 4 years of classroom instruction for apprentices, who receive on-the-job training from an employer. In theory, applicants can become indentured apprentices in one of two ways. First, they can wait in line at a local JATC office to obtain a place on a referral list. Employers can call the local office, which will refer to them the applicant at the top of the list. Employers are entitled under their collective bargaining agreements to reject referred applicants ""for any reason."" If the employer hires the referred applicant, he or she is indentured and thus admitted to the training program. 
 Second, local JATC offices will give anyone a ""hunting license,"" which enables the holder to hunt for jobs directly from employers. If the applicant obtains a job, he or she is indentured without regard to the referral list. In practice, very few employers use the referral list and virtually all apprentices obtain their jobs through a hunting license. 
 As the Court of Appeals found, the essence of respondents' amended complaint is that JATC adopted the hunting license system knowing it has a discriminatory effect on women. Respondents claim that employers discriminate against women when hiring applicants with hunting licenses, and that JATC's use of the system therefore violates Title VII. 662 F.2d 534, 536 (CA9 1981). Respondents sought injunctive relief requiring JATC to adopt some other system. As the District Court noted: [459 U.S. 917 , 919]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 
 Justice WHITE, dissenting from the denial of certiorari. This petition seeks review of the Second Circuit's minimum standard of competence for an attorney to satisfy the Sixth Amendment's requirement that a defendant receive effective assistance of counsel. More than thirty years ago, the Second Circuit formulated what has become known as the "" farce and mockery"" test: ""A lack of effective assistance of counsel must be of such a kind as to shock the conscience of the Court and make the proceedings a farce and mockery of justice."" United States v. Wight, 176 F.2d 376, 379 (CA2 1949), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 950 (1950). Since that time, every other Federal Court of Appeals has adopted a ""reasonable competence"" standard or some variation thereof. United States v.

Crisp, 613 F.2d 275, 278 (CA10) (en banc), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 945 (1980). Despite the rejection of the ""farce and mockery"" standard by the rest of the nation's federal courts, the Second Circuit has remained steadfast in its adherence to the test. Indeed, it has ""reaffirmed this standard numerous times."" Rickenbacker v. Warden, 550 F.2d 62, 65 (CA2 1976) (citing cases). 
 In this case, a panel of the Second Circuit has applied the ""farce and mockery"" test in rejecting petitioner's claim that 
Page 459 U.S. 926 , 927
 he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Petitioner's contention of ineffective assistance is not frivolous. His trial attorney failed to offer exculpatory testimony given at a suppression hearing and failed to call witnesses to testify at trial who exonerated petitioner at the hearing. Perhaps the performance of petitioner's counsel satisfied the more exacting standard that the Court of Appeals has rejected, but there was no holding to that effect, and that question should be answered by the Court of Appeals after the level of minimum competence required by the Sixth Amendment has been determined by this Court. Unfortunately, despite conflicts among the Courts of Appeals, we have long refused to consider whether the ""farce and mockery"" test satisfies the constitutional imperative of effective assistance of counsel, or to otherwise clearly articulate what level of effectiveness is required by the Constitution. A more fundamental question to the administration of criminal justice in the state and federal courts can scarcely be envisioned. I have previously argued that the Court should review this issue, Maryland v. Marzullo, 435 U.S. 1011 (1978) (WHITE, J., joined by REHNQUIST, J., dissenting from the denial of certiorari), and I remain of that view. 
 I respectfully dissent.

 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting from the denial of certiorari. 
 Opinion of Justice STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
 It is, of course, not possible to explain the reasons supporting every order denying a petition for a writ of certiorari. An occasional explanation, however, may allay the possible concern that this Court is not faithfully performing its responsibilities. Cf. Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, Inc., 338 U.S. 912, 917-918, 254-255 (1950) (opinion of Frankfurter, J., respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari). In this case petitioners request the Court to resolve the conflict among the Circuits on the question whether constitutional claims not actually litigated in earlier state proceedings are barred in a subsequent 1983 action. 
Page 459 U.S. 928 , 929
 The general phrasing of the issue in the petition reflects the wholly unrealistic assumption that neither the character of the federal constitutional claim 1 nor the character of the earlier state proceeding 2 can affect its answer. 
 The case that gives rise to this petition does not squarely conflict with any previous decision. The Sixth Circuit wrote: 
 We do not hold that the application of the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel is mandatory in every case.

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice O'CONNOR joins, dissenting from the denial of certiorari. 
 Under 33(b) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. 933(b), the six-month period within which an injured longshoreman must commence a third-party negligence action against a shipowner begins upon his ""(a)cceptance of compensation under an award in a compensation order.""

This approach conflicts with that of the Second Circuit, which has

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 12, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of South Carolina. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that capital punishment is unconstitutional under all circumstances, I would grant certiorari and vacate petitioner's death sentence. However, even if I believed that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances, I would vacate the death sentence in this case because both the trial court's instructions concerning the standard of proof and the State Supreme Court's standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence failed to assure a reliable sentencing determination. 
 Following petitioner Horace Butler's conviction for murder, the trial court conducted a separate sentencing proceeding in accordance with South Carolina law, S.C. Code 16-3-20(B) (Supp. 1981). In order to impose the death penalty, the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of at least one statutory aggravating circumstance. 16-3- 20(C). The State alleged two aggravating circumstances: that the murder occurred during the commission of a rape and that the murder occurred during the 
Page 459 U.S. 932 , 933
 commission of a kidnapping. See 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(a) and (c). The trial judge initially stated that he was ""extremely dubious"" whether the state had presented sufficient evidence of either rape or kidnapping. [Footnote 1] He subsequently changed his mind concerning the sufficiency of the evidence of rape and submitted that aggravating circumstance to the jury, but he ruled that the evidence of kidnapping did not suffice as a matter of law. The jury then found that the state had established the aggravating circumstance of rape, and sentenced petitioner to death. The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. S.C., 290 S.E. 2d 1 (1982). 
 Recognizing the extraordinary consequences of the capital sentencing process, this Court has stressed ""the need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case."" Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 305, 2991d 944 (1976) (opinion of STEWART, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.) (footnote omitted). See Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 2964 (1978) (opinion of BURGER, C.J.). Accordingly, ""we have invalidated procedural rules that tended to diminish the reliability of the sentencing determination."" Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 638, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 2390 (1980). In this case, errors committed by the trial judge at the sentencing stage and by the State Supreme Court on appeal seriously undermined the reliability of the sentencing determination. 
 The sentencing court's instructions to the jury concerning reasonable doubt impermissibly lowered the standard of proof required to establish the aggravating circumstance of rape. South Carolina's death penalty statute requires that proof of aggravating circumstances be established beyond a [459 U.S. 932 , 934]

 commission of a kidnapping. See 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(a) and (c). The trial judge initially stated that he was ""extremely dubious"" whether the state had presented sufficient evidence of either rape or kidnapping. [Footnote 1] He subsequently changed his mind concerning the sufficiency of the evidence of rape and submitted that aggravating circumstance to the jury, but he ruled that the evidence of kidnapping did not suffice as a matter of law. The jury then found that the state had established the aggravating circumstance of rape, and sentenced petitioner to death. The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. S.C., 290 S.E. 2d 1 (1982). 
 Recognizing the extraordinary consequences of the capital sentencing process, this Court has stressed ""the need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case."" Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 305, 2991d 944 (1976) (opinion of STEWART, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.) (footnote omitted). See Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 2964 (1978) (opinion of BURGER, C.J.). Accordingly, ""we have invalidated procedural rules that tended to diminish the reliability of the sentencing determination."" Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 638, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 2390 (1980). In this case, errors committed by the trial judge at the sentencing stage and by the State Supreme Court on appeal seriously undermined the reliability of the sentencing determination. 
 The sentencing court's instructions to the jury concerning reasonable doubt impermissibly lowered the standard of proof required to establish the aggravating circumstance of rape. South Carolina's death penalty statute requires that proof of aggravating circumstances be established beyond a [459 U.S. 932 , 934]

 Rayfield NEWLON, petitioner,v. State of MISSOURINo. 81-6660 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 4, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Missouri. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and usual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri, insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. However, even if I believed that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances, I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence imposed here. 
 On Louis County, Mo., for capital murder. The evidence at trial was that Newlon, along with two others, Franz Williams and Walter West, agreed to rob a ""convenience"" store. Petitioner and Williams entered the store while West parked the car in front of the building. During the attempted robbery, the proprietor of the store, Mansfield Dave, was shot twice with a sawed-off shotgun. Newlon and Williams then ran from the store. Dave died from the gunshot wounds. 
 There was disputed testimony at trial as to whether Newlon or Williams fired the shots. West testified that petitioner had done the shooting, though there was considerable question whether West could possibly have seen what was happening inside the store from his position across the street. In a videotaped statement made prior to trial, Newlon said that he had gone to the back of the store to get a soda and to divert Dave's attention, and that while he was there, Williams had fired the shots. Newlon testified at trial and again denied responsibility for the shooting. 
Page 459 U.S. 884 , 885
 In his argument on summation, the prosecutor stressed that even if Newlon did not fire the shots, he was still guilty of capital murder as an accomplice of Williams. The trial judge instructed the jury as follows with respect to the elements of capital murder: 
 ""If you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt: 
 ""First, that on or about April 24, 1978, in the County of St. Louis, State of Missouri, the defendant or another caused the death of Mansfield Dave by shooting him, and 
 ""Second, that the defendant or another intended to take the life of Mansfield Dave, and 
 ""Third, that the defendant or another knew that they were practically certain to cause the death of Mansfield Dave, and 
 ""Fourth, that the defendant or another considered taking the life of Mansfield Dave and reflected upon this matter coolly and fully before doing so, and 
 ""Fifth, that the defendant acted either alone or knowingly and with common purpose together with another in the conduct referred to in the above paragraphs, then you will find the defendant guilty of capital murder."" (Emphasis added.) 
 The jury returned a guilty verdict. 
 A separate sentencing hearing was then held before the same jury. Under Missouri law the death penalty may be imposed for capital murder if the trier of fact finds aggravating circumstances that warrant the imposition of death and the absence of sufficient countervailing mitigating circumstances. 565.012, RSMo 1978. In this case the jury was instructed to consider two aggravating circumstances alleged by the prosecution. First, it was instructed to decide whether petitioner murdered Mansfield Dave for the purpose of receiving money. Second, it was instructed to decide whether the murder involved ""depravity of mind and ... as a result thereof ... was outrageously or wantonly [459 U.S. 884 , 886]

 Kenneth Darcell QUINCE v. FLORIDANo. 82-5096 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 4, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Adhering to my view that capital punishment is unconstitutional under all circumstances, I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence on this basis alone. However, even if I believed that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances, I would grant certiorari because the decision below undermines a critical premise of this Court's conclusion that Florida's capital sentencing procedures adequately guard against the ""arbitrary or capricious"" imposition of death sentences. Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242, 253, 2967 (1976) (opinion of STEWART, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.). 
 Petitioner pleaded guilty to burglary and felony-murder in the first degree. As part of the plea bargain, petitioner waived his right to a sentencing recommendation by a jury and agreed that the sentence would be determined solely by the trial judge. After conducting a sentencing hearing, the judge found three aggravating circumstances and one mitigating circumstance. The judge found as aggravating circumstances that the murder was heinous, that it was committed for pecuniary gain, and that it was committed during the commission of a rape. He found as a mitigating circumstance that ""(t)he capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired."" Fla.Stat.Ann. 921.141(6)(f) (Supp. 1982). The judge concluded, however, that this mitigating circumstance was "" not entitled to a great deal of weight,"" and was outweighed by the aggravating circumstances. Accordingly, he imposed the death sentence. Petitioner appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, contending 
Page 459 U.S. 895 , 896
 that the trial court erred in giving too little weight to the mitigating circumstance. 
 In its decision affirming the death sentence, the Florida Supreme Court declined to make an independent evaluation of the evidence concerning aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The court explained that its statutory duty to review death sentences does not require it to make such an evaluation: 
 Applying its deferential standard of review, the court affirmed the death sentence on the ground that ""(t)he trial judge was not unreasonable in failing to give great weight"" to petitioner's diminished capacity. Ibid. In the court's view it was significant that ""(t)he trial judge clearly did not ignore every aspect of the medical testimony as the judge did in Huckaby v. State, 343 So.2d 29 (Fla.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 920 () (1977)."" 414 So.2d, at 187. 
 The decision below undermines a fundamental premise of this Court's decision in Proffitt v. Florida upholding Florida's death penalty statute. The Florida statute, which was enacted in response to Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), provides for automatic review by the Florida Supreme Court of all death sentences. Fla.Stat.Ann. 921.141(4) (Supp.1982). [459 U.S. 895 , 897]

Argued April 27, 1982
Decided July 2, 1982
458 U.S. 747

Syllabus 
A New York statute prohibits persons from knowingly promoting a sexual performance by a child under the age of 16 by distributing material which depicts such a performance.  The statute defines ""sexual performance"" as any performance that includes sexual conduct by such a child, and ""sexual conduct"" is in turn defined as actual or simulated sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation, sado-masochistic abuse, or lewd exhibition of the genitals.  Respondent bookstore proprietor was convicted under the statute for selling films depicting young boys masturbating, and the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court affirmed.  The New York Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the statute violated the First Amendment as being both underinclusive and overbroad.  The court reasoned that, in light of the explicit inclusion of an obscenity standard in a companion statute banning the knowing dissemination of similarly defined material, the statute in question could not be construed to include an obscenity standard, and therefore would prohibit the promotion of materials traditionally entitled to protection under the First Amendment.
Held:  As applied to respondent and others who distribute similar material, the statute in question does not violate the First Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  458 U. S. 753-774.
(a) The States are entitled to greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic depictions of children for the following reasons:  (1) the legislative judgment that the use of children as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the child easily passes muster under the First Amendment; (2) the standard of Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, for determining what is legally obscene is not a satisfactory solution to the child pornography problem; (3) the advertising and selling of child pornography provide an economic motive for, and are thus an integral part of, the production of such materials, an activity illegal throughout the Nation; (4) the value of permitting live performances and photographic reproductions of children engaged in lewd exhibitions is exceedingly modest, if not de minimis; and (5) recognizing and classifying child pornography as a category of material outside the First Amendment's protection is not incompatible with this Court's decisions dealing with what speech is unprotected.  When a definable class of material, such as that covered by the New 
Page 458 U. S. 748
 York statute, bears so heavily and pervasively on the welfare of children engaged in its production, the balance of competing interests is clearly struck, and it is permissible to consider these materials as without the First Amendment's protection.  Pp.  458 U. S. 756-764.
(b) The New York statute describes a category of material the production and distribution of which is not entitled to First Amendment protection.  Accordingly, there is nothing unconstitutionally ""underinclusive"" about the statute, and the State is not barred by the First Amendment from prohibiting the distribution of such unprotected materials produced outside the State.  Pp.  458 U. S. 764-766.
(c) Nor is the New York statute unconstitutionally overbroad as forbidding the distribution of material with serious literary, scientific, or educational value.  The substantial overbreadth rule of Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, applies.  This is the paradigmatic case of a state statute whose legitimate reach dwarfs its arguably impermissible applications.

Syllabus 
Petitioner and a codefendant, at a jury trial in a Florida court, were convicted of first-degree murder and robbery of two elderly persons at their farmhouse, and were sentenced to death.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed.  The court held that, although the record supported no more than the inference that petitioner was the person in a car parked by the side of the road near the farmhouse at the time of the killings waiting to help the robbers and killers (the codefendant and another) escape, this was enough under Florida law to make petitioner a constructive aider and abettor and hence a principal in first-degree murder upon whom the death penalty could be imposed.  It was thus irrelevant to petitioner's challenge to the death sentence that he did not himself kill and was not present at the killings, or whether he intended that the victims be killed or anticipated that lethal force might be used to effectuate the robbery or escape.
Held:  The imposition of the death penalty upon petitioner is inconsistent with the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  458 U. S. 788-801.
(a) The current judgments of legislatures, juries, and prosecutors weigh heavily on the side of rejecting capital punishment for the crime at issue.  Only a small minority of States -- eight -- allow the death penalty to be imposed solely because the defendant somehow participated in the robbery in the course of which a murder was committed, but did not take or attempt or intend to take life, or intend that lethal force be employed.  And the evidence is overwhelming that American juries have repudiated imposition of the death penalty for crimes such as petitioner's, the statistics demonstrating that juries -- and perhaps prosecutors -- consider death a disproportionate penalty for those who fall within petitioner's category.  Pp.  458 U. S. 788-796.
(b) While robbery is a serious crime deserving serious punishment, it is not a crime ""so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death.""  Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153,  428 U. S. 184.  The death penalty, which is ""unique in its severity and irrevocability,"" id. at  428 U. S. 187, is an excessive penalty for the robber, who, as such, does not take human life.  Here, the focus must be on petitioner's culpability, not on those who committed the robbery and killings.  He did not kill or intend to kill, and thus his culpability is different from that of the robbers who killed, and it is impermissible for the State 
Page 458 U. S. 783
 to treat them alike and attribute to petitioner the culpability of those who killed the victims.  Pp.  458 U. S. 797-798.
(c) Neither deterrence of capital crimes nor retribution is a sufficient justification for executing petitioner.  It is unlikely that the threat of the death penalty for murder will measurably deter one, such as petitioner, who does not kill or intend to kill.  As to retribution, this depends on the degree of petitioner's culpability, which must be limited to his participation in the robbery.  Putting him to death to avenge two killings that he did not commit or intend to commit or cause would not measurably contribute to the retribution end of ensuring that the criminal gets his just deserts.

Held:  Federal law preempts New Mexico's tax imposed on the gross receipts that appellant non-Indian construction company received from appellant tribal school board for the construction of a school for Indian children on the reservation.  White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, controlling.  Pp.  458 U. S. 836-847.
(a) In view of the federal and tribal interests arising from Congress' broad power to regulate tribal affairs under the Indian Commerce Clause, Art. I,  8, cl. 3, and from the semi-autonomous status of Indian tribes, the exercise of state authority over commercial activity on an Indian reservation may be preempted by federal law, or it may interfere with the tribe's ability to exercise its sovereign functions.  Traditional notions of tribal sovereignty, and the recognition and encouragement of such sovereignty in congressional Acts promoting tribal independence and economic development, inform the preemption analysis.  Ambiguities in federal law should be construed generously, and federal preemption is not limited to those situations where Congress has explicitly announced an intention to preempt state activity.  Pp.  458 U. S. 837-839.
(b) Federal statutes (particularly the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act) reflect the federal policy of encouraging the development of Indian-controlled institutions on the reservation, and, under detailed regulations governing school construction, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has wide-ranging authority to monitor and review subcontracting agreements between the Indian organization, which is viewed as the general contractor, and the non-Indian firm that actually constructs the facilities.  The direction and supervision provided by the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme for the construction of Indian schools leave no room for the additional burden sought to be imposed by New Mexico.  There is no merit to the contention that the state tax is not preempted merely because the federal statutes and regulations do not specifically express the intention to preempt this exercise of state authority.  The interest asserted by the State relating to its providing services to the non-Indian contractor for its activities off the reservation is not a legitimate justification for a tax whose ultimate burden falls on the tribal organization.  Nor is the State's purpose in imposing the tax pursuant to a general desire to increase revenues sufficient to justify the additional burdens thereby imposed on the comprehensive federal

Syllabus 
Respondent was indicted in Federal District Court for transporting one Romero-Morales in violation of 8 U.S.C.  1324(a)(2), which prohibits the knowing transportation of an alien illegally in the United States who last entered the country within three years prior to the date of the transportation.  Two other illegal aliens -- who, with Romero-Morales, were passengers in the car being driven by respondent and were apprehended with respondent -- were deported after an Assistant United States Attorney concluded that they possessed no evidence material to respondent's prosecution.  Romero-Morales was detained to provide a nonhearsay basis for establishing that respondent had violated  1324(a)(2).  The District Court denied respondent's motion to dismiss the indictment on the asserted ground that the deportation of the other passengers deprived him of the opportunity to interview them to determine whether they could aid in his defense, and thus violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process and his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses.  Following a bench trial, respondent was convicted, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although a constitutional violation occurs only when ""the alien's testimony could conceivably benefit the defendant,"" the ""conceivable benefit"" test was satisfied -- without requiring the defendant to explain what beneficial evidence would have been provided by the alien -- whenever, as here, the deported alien was an eyewitness to the crime.
Held:  Respondent failed to establish a violation of the Fifth or Sixth Amendment.  Pp.  458 U. S. 863-874.
(a) In cases like this, the Executive Branch's responsibility faithfully to execute Congress' immigration policy of prompt deportation of illegal aliens justifies deportation of illegal alien witnesses upon the Executive's good faith determination that they possess no evidence favorable to the defendant in a criminal prosecution.  In addition to satisfying such policy, the prompt deportation of such witnesses is justified by practical considerations, including the financial and physical burdens imposed upon the Government in detaining alien eyewitnesses.  Pp.  458 U. S. 863-866.
(b) Respondent cannot establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees a criminal defendant the right to compulsory process 
Page 458 U. S. 859
 for obtaining witnesses ""in his favor,"" merely by showing that deportation of the aliens deprived him of their testimony.  He must at least make some plausible showing of how their testimony would have been both material and favorable to his defense.  Cf. Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14.  While a relaxation of the specificity required in showing materiality may be supported by the fact that, because the witnesses were deported, neither respondent nor his attorney had an opportunity to interview the witnesses to determine what favorable information they possessed, this does not afford a basis for wholly dispensing with a showing of materiality.  Cf. Roviaro v. United States, 353 U. S. 53.  Moreover, respondent was present throughout the commission of the crime, and no one knew better than he what the deported witnesses said in his presence that might bear upon whether he knew that Romero-Morales was an illegal alien who had entered the country within the past three years.  Pp.  458 U. S. 867-871.
(c) At least the same materiality requirement obtains with respect to a due process claim.  In order to establish a denial of due process, the acts complained of must be of such quality as necessarily prevents a fair trial.

v. Claiborne Hardware Co.
No. 81-202
Argued March 3, 1982
Decided July 2, 1982
458 U.S. 886

Syllabus 
In 1966, a boycott of white merchants in Claiborne County, Miss., was launched at a meeting of a local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) attended by several hundred black persons.  The purpose of the boycott was to secure compliance by both civic and business leaders with a lengthy list of demands for equality and racial justice.  The boycott was largely supported by speeches encouraging nonparticipants to join the common cause and by nonviolent picketing, but some acts and threats of violence did occur.  In 1969, respondent white merchants filed suit in Mississippi Chancery Court for injunctive relief and damages against petitioners (the NAACP, the Mississippi Action for Progress, and a number of individuals who had participated in the boycott, including Charles Evers, the field secretary of the NAACP in Mississippi and a principal organizer of the boycott).  Holding petitioners jointly and severally liable for all of respondents' lost earnings during a 7-year period from 1966 to the end of 1972 on three separate conspiracy theories, including the tort of malicious interference with respondents' businesses, the Chancery Court imposed damages liability and issued a permanent injunction.  The Mississippi Supreme Court rejected two theories of liability, but upheld the imposition of liability on the basis of the common law tort theory.  Based on evidence that fear of reprisals caused some black citizens to withhold their patronage from respondents' businesses, the court held that the entire boycott was unlawful, and affirmed petitioners' liability for all damages ""resulting from the boycott"" on the ground that petitioners had agreed to use force, violence, and ""threats"" to effectuate the boycott.
Held:
1. The nonviolent elements of petitioners' activities are entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.  Pp.  458 U. S. 907-915.
(a) Through exercise of their First Amendment rights of speech, assembly, association, and petition, rather than through riot or revolution, petitioners sought to bring about political, social, and economic change.  Pp.  458 U. S. 907-912.
(b) While States have broad power to regulate economic activities, there is no comparable right to prohibit peaceful political activity such as that found in the boycott in this case.  Pp.  458 U. S. 912-915. 
Page 458 U. S. 887

2. Petitioners are not liable in damages for the consequences of their nonviolent, protected activity.  Pp.  458 U. S. 915-920.
(a) While the State legitimately may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, it may not award compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity; only those losses proximately caused by the unlawful conduct may be recovered.  Pp.  458 U. S. 915-918.
(b) Similarly, the First Amendment restricts the ability of the State to impose liability on an individual solely because of his association with another.  Civil liability may not be imposed merely because an individual belonged to a group, some members of which committed acts of violence.  For liability to be imposed by reason of association alone, it is necessary to establish that the group itself possessed unlawful goals and that the individual held a specific intent to further those illegal aims.  Pp.  458 U. S. 918-920.
3. The award for all damages ""resulting from the boycott"" cannot be sustained, where the record discloses that all of the respondents' business losses were not proximately caused by violence or threats of violence.  Pp.  458 U. S. 920-932.
(a) To the extent that the Mississippi Supreme Court's judgment rests on the ground that ""many"" black citizens were ""intimidated"" by ""threats"" of ""social ostracism, vilification, and traduction,"" it is flatly inconsistent with the First Amendment.  The court's ambiguous findings are inadequate to assure the ""precision of regulation"" demanded by that Amendment.  Pp.  458 U. S. 920-924.
(b) Regular attendance and participation at the meetings of the Claiborne County Branch of the NAACP is an insufficient predicate on which to impose liability on the individual petitioners.  Nor can liability be imposed on such individuals simply because they were either ""store watchers"" who stood outside the boycotted merchants' stores to record the names of black citizens who patronized the stores or members of a special group of boycott ""enforcers.""  Pp.  458 U. S. 924-926.
(c) For similar reasons, the judgment against Evers cannot be separately justified, nor can liability be imposed upon him on the basis of speeches that he made, because those speeches did not incite violence or specifically authorize the use of violence.  His acts, being insufficient to impose liability on him, may not be used to impose liability on the NAACP, his principal.  Moreover, there is no finding that Evers or any other NAACP member had either actual or apparent authority from the NAACP to commit acts of violence or to threaten violent conduct or that the NAACP ratified unlawful conduct.  To impose liability on the NAACP without such a finding would impermissibly burden the rights of political association that are protected by the First Amendment.  Pp.  458 U. S. 926-932.

v. Claiborne Hardware Co.
No. 81-202
Argued March 3, 1982
Decided July 2, 1982
458 U.S. 886

Syllabus 
In 1966, a boycott of white merchants in Claiborne County, Miss., was launched at a meeting of a local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) attended by several hundred black persons.  The purpose of the boycott was to secure compliance by both civic and business leaders with a lengthy list of demands for equality and racial justice.  The boycott was largely supported by speeches encouraging nonparticipants to join the common cause and by nonviolent picketing, but some acts and threats of violence did occur.  In 1969, respondent white merchants filed suit in Mississippi Chancery Court for injunctive relief and damages against petitioners (the NAACP, the Mississippi Action for Progress, and a number of individuals who had participated in the boycott, including Charles Evers, the field secretary of the NAACP in Mississippi and a principal organizer of the boycott).  Holding petitioners jointly and severally liable for all of respondents' lost earnings during a 7-year period from 1966 to the end of 1972 on three separate conspiracy theories, including the tort of malicious interference with respondents' businesses, the Chancery Court imposed damages liability and issued a permanent injunction.  The Mississippi Supreme Court rejected two theories of liability, but upheld the imposition of liability on the basis of the common law tort theory.  Based on evidence that fear of reprisals caused some black citizens to withhold their patronage from respondents' businesses, the court held that the entire boycott was unlawful, and affirmed petitioners' liability for all damages ""resulting from the boycott"" on the ground that petitioners had agreed to use force, violence, and ""threats"" to effectuate the boycott.
Held:
1. The nonviolent elements of petitioners' activities are entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.  Pp.  458 U. S. 907-915.
(a) Through exercise of their First Amendment rights of speech, assembly, association, and petition, rather than through riot or revolution, petitioners sought to bring about political, social, and economic change.  Pp.  458 U. S. 907-912.
(b) While States have broad power to regulate economic activities, there is no comparable right to prohibit peaceful political activity such as that found in the boycott in this case.  Pp.  458 U. S. 912-915. 
Page 458 U. S. 887

2. Petitioners are not liable in damages for the consequences of their nonviolent, protected activity.  Pp.  458 U. S. 915-920.
(a) While the State legitimately may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, it may not award compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity; only those losses proximately caused by the unlawful conduct may be recovered.  Pp.  458 U. S. 915-918.
(b) Similarly, the First Amendment restricts the ability of the State to impose liability on an individual solely because of his association with another.  Civil liability may not be imposed merely because an individual belonged to a group, some members of which committed acts of violence.  For liability to be imposed by reason of association alone, it is necessary to establish that the group itself possessed unlawful goals and that the individual held a specific intent to further those illegal aims.  Pp.  458 U. S. 918-920.
3. The award for all damages ""resulting from the boycott"" cannot be sustained, where the record discloses that all of the respondents' business losses were not proximately caused by violence or threats of violence.  Pp.  458 U. S. 920-932.
(a) To the extent that the Mississippi Supreme Court's judgment rests on the ground that ""many"" black citizens were ""intimidated"" by ""threats"" of ""social ostracism, vilification, and traduction,"" it is flatly inconsistent with the First Amendment.  The court's ambiguous findings are inadequate to assure the ""precision of regulation"" demanded by that Amendment.  Pp.  458 U. S. 920-924.
(b) Regular attendance and participation at the meetings of the Claiborne County Branch of the NAACP is an insufficient predicate on which to impose liability on the individual petitioners.  Nor can liability be imposed on such individuals simply because they were either ""store watchers"" who stood outside the boycotted merchants' stores to record the names of black citizens who patronized the stores or members of a special group of boycott ""enforcers.""  Pp.  458 U. S. 924-926.
(c) For similar reasons, the judgment against Evers cannot be separately justified, nor can liability be imposed upon him on the basis of speeches that he made, because those speeches did not incite violence or specifically authorize the use of violence.  His acts, being insufficient to impose liability on him, may not be used to impose liability on the NAACP, his principal.  Moreover, there is no finding that Evers or any other NAACP member had either actual or apparent authority from the NAACP to commit acts of violence or to threaten violent conduct or that the NAACP ratified unlawful conduct.  To impose liability on the NAACP without such a finding would impermissibly burden the rights of political association that are protected by the First Amendment.  Pp.  458 U. S. 926-932.

Syllabus 
A Nebraska statute provides that any person who intends to withdraw groundwater from any well located in the State and transport it for use in an adjoining State must obtain a permit from the Nebraska Department of Water Resources.  If the Director of Water Resources finds that such withdrawal is reasonable, not contrary to the conservation and use of groundwater, and not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare, he will grant the permit if the State in which the water is to be used grants reciprocal rights to withdraw and transport groundwater from that State for use in Nebraska.  Appellants jointly own contiguous tracts of land in Nebraska and Colorado, on which a well on the Nebraska tract pumps groundwater for irrigation of both the Nebraska and Colorado tracts, but they never applied for the permit required by the statute.  Appellee brought an action in a Nebraska state court to enjoin appellants from transferring the water across the border without a permit.  Rejecting the defense that the statute imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce, the trial court granted the injunction.  The Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. Ground water is an article of commerce, and therefore subject to congressional regulation.  Pp.  458 U. S. 945-954.
(a) Although appellee's claimed greater ownership interest in groundwater than in certain other natural resources may not be irrelevant to Commerce Clause analysis, it does not remove Nebraska groundwater from such scrutiny, since appellee's argument is still based on the legal fiction of state ownership.  Pp.  458 U. S. 945-952.
(b) The States' interests in conserving and preserving scarce water resources in the arid Western States clearly have an interstate dimension.  The agricultural markets supplied by irrigated farms provide the archtypical example of commerce among the States for which the Framers of the Constitution intended to authorize federal regulation.  Here, the multistate character of the aquifer underlying appellants' tracts of land, as well as parts of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas, demonstrates that there is a significant federal interest in conservation as well as in fair allocation of diminishing water resources.  Pp.  458 U. S. 952-954.
2. The reciprocity requirement of the Nebraska statute violates the Commerce Clause as imposing an impermissible burden on interstate 
Page 458 U. S. 942
 commerce.  While the first three conditions set forth in the statute for granting a permit -- that the withdrawal of the groundwater be reasonable, not contrary to the conservation and use of groundwater, and not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare -- do not, on their faces, impermissibly burden interstate commerce, the reciprocity provision operates as an explicit barrier to commerce between Nebraska and its adjoining States.  Nebraska therefore has the initial burden of demonstrating a close fit between the reciprocity requirement and its asserted local purpose.  Such requirement, when superimposed on the first three restrictions, fails to clear this initial hurdle, since there is no evidence that it is narrowly tailored to the conservation and preservation rationale.  Thus, it does not survive the ""strictest scrutiny"" reserved for facially discriminatory legislation.  Pp.  458 U. S. 954-958.
3. Congress has not granted the States permission to engage in groundwater regulation that would otherwise be impermissible.  Although there are 37 federal statutes and a number of interstate compacts demonstrating Congress' deference to state water law, they do not indicate that Congress wished to remove federal constitutional restraints on such state law.  Neither the fact that Congress has chosen not to create a federal water law to govern water rights involved in federal water projects nor the fact that Congress has been willing to let the States settle their differences over water rights through mutual agreement constitutes persuasive evidence that Congress consented to the unilateral imposition of unreasonable burdens on commerce.

Syllabus 
Under  9 and 10 of petitioner School Board's rules, the Board has discretion to suspend a high school student for ""good cause,"" which is defined as including ""sale, use or possession of alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs.""  Section 11 of the rules provides for mandatory suspension for the remainder of the semester if a student has on school premises used, sold, or been under the influence or in possession of ""narcotics or other hallucinogenics, drugs, or controlled substances"" classified as such by an Arkansas statute.  That statute specifically exempts alcohol from its coverage of ""controlled substances.""  After a hearing before the Board, respondent, a 10th-grade student, was expelled for the remainder of the semester because he was on school premises while intoxicated.  Respondent then sought injunctive relief in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  While there was conflicting evidence concerning which section of its rules the Board had invoked, the Board's Chairman testified that the Board had suspended students under  11 for alcohol offenses for the past five years.  The District Court concluded that, as a matter of fact, the Board had acted under  11, that  11 did not apply to alcohol, and that the Board thus had acted unreasonably and had violated respondent's right to substantive due process, even though the Board had discretion to suspend him under  10.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The courts below plainly erred in replacing the Board's construction of  11 with their own notions under the facts of this case. The Board's interpretation of  11 is reasonable, since even though alcohol is not a ""controlled substance"" under  11, that section also covers ""drugs,"" and alcohol is a ""drug.""  It is reasonable to conclude that  11 requires suspension for any drug use, including use of alcohol, on school premises, while  10 permits discretionary suspension for drug use off school premises.  In any event, federal courts are not authorized to construe school regulations, Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, and thus the Board's interpretation of its regulations controls.

Syllabus 
Respondent Commonwealth of Puerto Rico filed suit in Federal District Court against petitioners, individuals and companies engaged in the apple industry in Virginia, alleging that petitioners had violated related provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, and implementing regulations.  The purposes of this statutory and regulatory scheme are to give United States workers, including citizens of Puerto Rico, a preference over temporary foreign workers for jobs that become available within this country, to ensure that working conditions of domestic employees are not adversely affected when foreign workers are brought in, and to prohibit discrimination against United States workers in favor of foreign workers.  It was alleged that, pursuant to the federal laws, petitioners had reported 787 job openings for temporary farm labor to pick the 1978 apple crop, and that, in violation of such laws, petitioners had discriminated against Puerto Rican workers by failing to provide employment for qualified Puerto Rican migrant farmworkers, by subjecting those Puerto Rican workers that were employed to working conditions more burdensome than those established for temporary foreign workers, and by improperly terminating employment of Puerto Rican workers.  Seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in its capacity as parens patriae, Puerto Rico asserted that this alleged discrimination deprived the Commonwealth of its right ""to effectively participate in the benefits of the Federal Employment Service System of which it is a part,"" and thereby caused irreparable injury to the Commonwealth's efforts ""to promote opportunities for profitable employment for Puerto Rican laborers and to reduce unemployment in the Commonwealth.""  The District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that Puerto Rico lacked standing to bring the action in view of the small number of individuals directly involved and the slight impact upon Puerto Rico's general economy that the loss of 787 temporary jobs could have.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Puerto Rico has parens patriae standing to maintain this suit.  Pp.  458 U. S. 600-610. 
Page 458 U. S. 593

(a) In order to maintain a parens patriae action, a State must articulate an interest apart from the interests of particular private parties, that is, the State must be more than a nominal party.  The State must express a ""quasi-sovereign"" interest, such as its interest in the health and wellbeing -- both physical and economic -- of its residents in general.  Although more must be alleged than injury to an identifiable group of individual residents, the indirect effects of the injury must be considered as well in determining whether the State has alleged injury to a sufficiently substantial segment of its population.  A State also has a quasi-sovereign interest in not being discriminatorily denied its rightful status within the federal system -- that is, in ensuring that the State and its general population are not excluded from the benefits that are to flow from participation in the federal system.  Pp.  458 U. S. 600-608.
(b) Under the above principles, Puerto Rico's allegations that petitioners discriminated against Puerto Ricans in favor of foreign laborers falls within the Commonwealth's quasi-sovereign interest in the general wellbeing of its citizens.  A State's interest in the wellbeing of its residents, which extends beyond mere physical interests to economic and commercial interests, also includes the State's substantial interest in securing its residents from the harmful effects of discrimination.  This interest is peculiarly strong in the case of Puerto Rico simply because of the fact that invidious discrimination frequently occurs along ethnic lines.  Alternatively, Puerto Rico has ""parens patriae"" standing to pursue its residents' interests in the Commonwealth's full and equal participation in the federal employment service scheme established by the laws involved here.

458 U.S. 613

Syllabus 
Burke County, Ga., a large, predominately rural county, has an at-large system for electing members of its governing Board of Commissioners.  No Negro has ever been elected to the Board.  Appellee black citizens of the county filed a class action in Federal District Court, alleging that the at-large system of elections violated, inter alia, appellees' Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights by diluting the voting power of black citizens.  Finding that blacks have always made up a substantial majority of the county's population, but that they are a minority of the registered voters, that there had been bloc voting along racial lines, and that past discrimination had restricted the present opportunity of blacks to participate effectively in the political process, the District Court held that, although the state policy behind the at-large electoral system was ""neutral in origin,"" the policy was being maintained for invidious purposes in violation of appellees' Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights.  The court then ordered the county to be divided into districts for purposes of electing County Commissioners.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the District Court properly required appellees to prove that the at-large system was maintained for a discriminatory purpose, that the District Court's findings were not clearly erroneous, and that its conclusion that the at-large system was maintained for invidious purposes was ""virtually mandated by the overwhelming proof.""
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals did not err in concluding that the District Court applied the proper legal standard where it appears that the District Court demonstrated its understanding of the controlling standard by observing that a determination of discriminatory intent was ""a requisite to a finding of unconstitutional vote dilution"" under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  Pp.  458 U. S. 616-622.
2. Where neither the District Court's ultimate findings of intentional discrimination nor its subsidiary findings of fact appear to be clearly erroneous, and such findings were agreed to by the Court of Appeals, this Court will not disturb the findings.  Pp.  458 U. S. 622-627.
3. Nor is there any reason to overturn the relief ordered by the District Court where neither that court nor the Court of Appeals discerned

Finding that blacks have always made up a substantial majority of the county's population, but that they are a minority of the registered voters, that there had been bloc voting along racial lines, and that past discrimination had restricted the present opportunity of blacks to participate effectively in the political process, the District Court held that, although the state policy behind the at-large electoral system was ""neutral in origin,"" the policy was being maintained for invidious purposes in violation of appellees' Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights.  The court then ordered the county to be divided into districts for purposes of electing County Commissioners.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the District Court properly required appellees to prove that the at-large system was maintained for a discriminatory purpose, that the District Court's findings were not clearly erroneous, and that its conclusion that the at-large system was maintained for invidious purposes was ""virtually mandated by the overwhelming proof.""
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals did not err in concluding that the District Court applied the proper legal standard where it appears that the District Court demonstrated its understanding of the controlling standard by observing that a determination of discriminatory intent was ""a requisite to a finding of unconstitutional vote dilution"" under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  Pp.  458 U. S. 616-622.
2. Where neither the District Court's ultimate findings of intentional discrimination nor its subsidiary findings of fact appear to be clearly erroneous, and such findings were agreed to by the Court of Appeals, this Court will not disturb the findings.  Pp.  458 U. S. 622-627.
3. Nor is there any reason to overturn the relief ordered by the District Court where neither that court nor the Court of Appeals discerned 
Page 458 U. S. 614
 any special circumstances that would militate against utilizing single-member districts.  Pp.  458 U. S. 627-628.
639 F.2d 1358, affirmed.

Syllabus 
A provision of California's alcoholic beverage laws states that a ""licensed importer shall not purchase or accept delivery of any brand of distilled spirits unless he is designated as an authorized importer of such brand by the brand owner or his authorized agent"" (designation statute).  The statute apparently was enacted in response to the perceived extraterritorial effects of Oklahoma's ""open wholesaling"" statutes, whereby a licensed California importer who was unable to obtain distilled spirits through the distiller's established distribution system could obtain them from Oklahoma wholesalers.  Prior to the designation statute's effective date, respondents sought an extraordinary writ from the California Court of Appeal to enjoin the enforcement of the statute.  The court entered judgment for respondents, holding that the conduct contemplated by the statute was per se illegal under  1 of the Sherman Act because it gave distillers the unfettered power to restrain competition by merely deciding who may or may not compete in handling the distillers' brands, and that thus the statute, on its face, was invalid pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution.
Held:
1. California's designation statute is not invalid on its face as being preempted by the Sherman Act.  Pp.  458 U. S. 659-662.
(a) A state statute, when considered in the abstract, may be condemned under the antitrust laws only if it mandates or authorizes conduct that necessarily constitutes a violation of those laws in all cases, or if it places irresistible pressure on a private party to violate the antitrust laws in order to comply with the statute.  Such condemnation will follow under  1 of the Sherman Act when the conduct contemplated by the statute is in all cases a per se violation.  If the activity addressed by the statute does not fall into that category, and therefore must be analyzed 
Page 458 U. S. 655
 under the rule of reason, the statute cannot be condemned in the abstract.  Pp.  458 U. S. 655-661.
(b) A distiller's invocation of California's statute would not be subject in all cases to a per se rule of illegality under the Sherman Act.  A manufacturer's use of vertical nonprice restraints is not per se illegal.  Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36.  California's designation statute merely enforces the distiller's decision to restrain intrabrand competition, preventing an unauthorized wholesaler from obtaining the distiller's products from outside the distiller's established distribution chain.  The effect of the statute is simply to counteract the perceived extraterritorial effects of Oklahoma's alcoholic beverage laws, thus restoring the distiller's ability to determine which wholesalers may import its products into California.  While the manner in which a distiller utilizes the designation statute and the arrangements a distiller makes with its wholesalers will be subject to Sherman Act analysis under the rule of reason, there is no basis for condemning the statute itself by force of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  458 U. S. 661-662.
2. The California statute is not preempted by  5(a) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, which prohibits a distiller or wholesaler from establishing exclusive retail outlets.  California's statute in no way requires exclusive retail outlets, and, by its terms, does not even require exclusive wholesale arrangements.  Pp.  458 U. S. 663-664.
3. The designation statute does not deny respondents due process of law.  Respondents do not possess any constitutionally protected liberty or property interest in obtaining the distiller's permission to deal in its products, and thus the Due Process Clause is not offended by the wholesaler's inability to challenge the distiller's decisionmaking.  P.  458 U. S. 664.
4. Nor does the designation statute violate the Equal Protection Clause because it discriminates between designated and nondesignated wholesalers.  The statute is rationally related to its legitimate purposes, enabling the distiller to place restraints on intrabrand competition in order to foster interbrand competition.  P.  458 U. S. 665.

Syllabus 
After respondents had located the wreck of a 17th-century Spanish galleon off the Florida coast, Florida immediately claimed ownership of the galleon pursuant to a Florida statute.  Contracts were then entered into between the Florida Division of Archives, as owner of the galleon and its cargo, and respondents, whereby respondents agreed to conduct underwater salvage operations in exchange for the Division's agreement to transfer ownership of 75% of the appraised value of all material recovered from the galleon to respondents.  The contracts did not purport to transfer ownership of any property to the Division.  Ultimately, many valuable artifacts of the galleon were discovered.  In the meantime, in proceedings unrelated to the salvage operations, it was held in United States v. Florida, 420 U. S. 531, that, as against Florida, the United States was entitled to the lands, minerals, and other natural resources in the area in which the remains of the galleon had come to rest.  Respondents thereafter filed an admiralty in rem action in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida, naming the galleon as defendant but not the State of Florida and seeking a declaration of title to the galleon.  Throughout the ensuing proceedings, in which the United States intervened and in which both the District Court and the Court of Appeals on appeal rejected the United States' claim to ownership of the galleon, some of the valuable artifacts remained in the custody of officials of the Florida Division of Archives in Tallahassee, which is located beyond the District Court's territorial jurisdiction.  After the Court of Appeals' decision, respondents filed a motion in the District Court for an order commanding the United States Marshal to arrest and take custody of those artifacts and bring them within the court's jurisdiction.  The District Court granted the motion and issued a warrant of arrest.  Although the warrant was addressed to the state officials, the State itself filed a motion to quash the warrant, but the court denied this motion, ruling that the extraterritorial seizure was proper under Supplemental Admiralty Rule C(5), and issued an order to show cause why the State should not deliver the artifacts into the Marshal's custody.  The State then argued that the Eleventh Amendment barred exercise of the District Court's jurisdiction, but the District Court rejected this argument, 
Page 458 U. S. 671
 holding that the State had waived the Eleventh Amendment as to any claim to the property, and that, apart from any such claim, the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the seizure of the artifacts and subsequent transfer to the Marshal's custody.  On the merits, the court also rejected the State's claim to the property based on the salvage contracts with respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
621 F.2d 1340, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that:
1. The Eleventh Amendment did not bar the process issued by the District Court to secure possession of the artifacts held by the state officials.  Pp.  458 U. S. 683-699.
(a) The Eleventh Amendment, while barring an action directly against the state itself or any agency thereof, does not bar an action against a state official that is based on the theory that the official acted beyond the scope of his statutory authority or, if within that authority, that such authority is unconstitutional.  The Eleventh Amendment, however, limits the relief that may be recovered in the latter kind of action; the judgment may not compel the State to use its funds to compensate the plaintiff for his injury.  Pp.  458 U. S. 683-690.
(b) Here, the process at issue is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment as a direct action against the State, because it was directed only at state officials.  Neither the fact that the State elected to defend on behalf of the officials, nor the fact that the District Court purported to adjudicate the State's rights, deprives that court of jurisdiction that had been properly invoked over other parties.  Pp.  458 U. S. 691-692.
(c) The state officials named in the warrant of arrest do not have a colorable claim to possession of the artifacts, and thus may not invoke the Eleventh Amendment to block execution of the warrant.  The salvage contracts, whether valid or not, provide no authority for the officials' refusal to surrender possession of the artifacts, and no statutory provision that even arguably would authorize the officials to retain the artifacts has been advanced.  Pp.  458 U. S. 692-697.
(d) The relief sought by respondents is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment, but is consistent with the principles of Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651.  The warrant of arrest sought possession of specific property.  It did not seek any attachment of state funds, and would impose no burden on the state treasury.  And respondents are not asserting a claim for damages against either the State or its officers.  Pp.  458 U. S. 697-699.
2. The proper resolution of the Eleventh Amendment issue does not require -- or permit -- a determination of the State's ownership of the artifacts, 
Page 458 U. S. 672
 and hence the Court of Appeals improperly adjudicated the State's right to the artifacts.  Pp.  458 U. S. 699-700.
JUSTICE BRENNAN while agreeing with the opinion that the State of Florida has not established even a colorable claim to the artifacts, concluded that the Eleventh Amendment is inapplicable in this case because both respondents are Florida corporations, and thus the suit was not ""commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another State,"" as the Eleventh Amendment provides.  Pp.  458 U. S. 700-702.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by JUSTICE POWELL, JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurred in the Court's judgment insofar as it reverses the Court of Appeals' determination of the State's ownership of the artifacts.  P.  458 U. S. 703, n.

458 U.S. 718

Syllabus 
Held:  The policy of petitioner Mississippi University for Women (MUW), a state-supported university which has from its inception limited its enrollment to women, of denying otherwise qualified males (such as respondent) the right to enroll for credit in its School of Nursing violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  458 U. S. 723-733.
(a) The party seeking to uphold a statute that classifies individuals on the basis of their gender must carry the burden of showing an ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" for the classification.  Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U. S. 455,  450 U. S. 461; Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256,  442 U. S. 273.  The burden is met only by showing at least that the classification serves ""important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed"" are ""substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.""  Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Insurance Co., 446 U. S. 142,  446 U. S. 150.  The test must be applied free of fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females.  Pp.  458 U. S. 723-727.
(b) The single-sex admissions policy of MUW's School of Nursing cannot be justified on the asserted ground that it compensates for discrimination against women and, therefore, constitutes educational affirmative action.  A State can evoke a compensatory purpose to justify an otherwise discriminatory classification only if members of the gender benefited by the classification actually suffer a disadvantage related to the classification.  Rather than compensating for discriminatory barriers faced by women, MUW's policy tends to perpetuate the stereotyped view of nursing as an exclusively woman's job.  Moreover, the State has not shown that the gender-based classification is substantially and directly related to its proposed compensatory objective.  To the contrary, MUW's policy of permitting men to attend classes as auditors fatally undermines its claim that women, at least those in the School of Nursing, are adversely affected by the presence of men.  Thus, the State has fallen far short of establishing the ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" needed to sustain the gender-based classification.  Pp.  458 U. S. 727-731.
(c) Nor can the exclusion of men from MUW's School of Nursing be justified on the basis of the language of  901(a)(5) of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which exempts from  901(a)'s general prohibition 
Page 458 U. S. 719
 of gender discrimination in federally funded education programs the admissions policies of public institutions of undergraduate higher education ""that traditionally and continually from [their] establishment [have] had a policy of admitting only students of one sex.""  It is not clear that, as argued by the State, Congress enacted the statute pursuant to its power granted by  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce that Amendment, and thus placed a limitation upon the broad prohibitions of the Equal Protection Clause.  Rather, Congress apparently intended, at most, to create an exemption from Title IX's requirements.  In any event, Congress' power under  5
""is limited to adopting measures to enforce the guarantees of the Amendment;  5 grants Congress no power to restrict, abrogate, or dilute these guarantees.""

Moreover, the State has not shown that the gender-based classification is substantially and directly related to its proposed compensatory objective.  To the contrary, MUW's policy of permitting men to attend classes as auditors fatally undermines its claim that women, at least those in the School of Nursing, are adversely affected by the presence of men.  Thus, the State has fallen far short of establishing the ""exceedingly persuasive justification"" needed to sustain the gender-based classification.  Pp.  458 U. S. 727-731.
(c) Nor can the exclusion of men from MUW's School of Nursing be justified on the basis of the language of  901(a)(5) of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which exempts from  901(a)'s general prohibition 
Page 458 U. S. 719
 of gender discrimination in federally funded education programs the admissions policies of public institutions of undergraduate higher education ""that traditionally and continually from [their] establishment [have] had a policy of admitting only students of one sex.""  It is not clear that, as argued by the State, Congress enacted the statute pursuant to its power granted by  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce that Amendment, and thus placed a limitation upon the broad prohibitions of the Equal Protection Clause.  Rather, Congress apparently intended, at most, to create an exemption from Title IX's requirements.  In any event, Congress' power under  5
""is limited to adopting measures to enforce the guarantees of the Amendment;  5 grants Congress no power to restrict, abrogate, or dilute these guarantees.""

Syllabus 
A New York statute provides that a landlord must permit a cable television (CATV) company to install its CATV facilities upon his property and may not demand payment from the company in excess of the amount determined by a State Commission to be reasonable.  Pursuant to the statute, the Commission ruled that a one-time $1 payment was a reasonable fee.  After purchasing a five-story apartment building in New York City, appellant landlord discovered that appellee CATV companies had installed cables on the building, both ""crossovers"" for serving other buildings and ""noncrossovers"" for serving appellant's tenants.  Appellant then brought a class action for damages and injunctive relief in a New York state court, alleging, inter alia, that installation of the cables insofar as appellee companies relied on the New York statute constituted a taking without just compensation.  Appellee New York City, which had granted the companies an exclusive franchise to provide CATV within certain areas of the city, intervened.  Upholding the New York statute, the trial court granted summary judgment to appellees.  The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court affirmed, and, on further appeal, the New York Court of Appeals also upheld the statute, holding that it serves the legitimate police power purpose of eliminating landlord fees and conditions that inhibit the development of CATV, which has important educational and community benefits.  Rejecting appellant's argument that a physical occupation authorized by government is necessarily a taking, the court further held that the statute did not have an excessive economic impact upon appellant when measured against her aggregate property rights, did not interfere with any reasonable investment-backed expectations, and accordingly did not work a taking of appellant's property.
Held:  The New York statute works a taking of a portion of appellant's property for which she is entitled to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  458 U. S. 425-441.
(a) When the ""character of the governmental action,"" Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104,  438 U. S. 124, is a permanent physical occupation of real property, there is a taking to the extent 
Page 458 U. S. 420
 of the occupation without regard to whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner.  Pp.  458 U. S. 426-435.
(b) To the extent that the government permanently occupies physical property, it effectively destroys the owner's rights to possess, use, and dispose of the property.  Moreover, the owner suffers a special kind of injury when a stranger invades and occupies the owner's property.  Such an invasion is qualitatively more severe than a regulation of the use of property, since the owner may have no control over the timing, extent, or nature of the invasion.  And constitutional protection for the rights of private property cannot be made to depend on the size of the area permanently occupied.  Pp.  458 U. S. 435-438.
(c) Here, the cable installation on appellant's building constituted a taking under the traditional physical occupation test, since it involved a direct physical attachment of plates, boxes, wires, bolts, and screws to the building, completely occupying space immediately above and upon the roof and along the building's exterior wall.  There is no constitutional difference between a crossover and noncrossover installation, since portions of the installation necessary for both types of installation permanently appropriated appellant's property.  The fact that the New York statute applies only to buildings used as rental property does not make it simply a regulation of the use of real property.  Physical occupation of one type of property but not another is no less a physical occupation.  The New York statute does not purport to give the tenant any enforceable property rights with respect to CATV installation, and thus cannot be construed as merely granting a tenant a property right as an appurtenance to his leasehold.  Application of the physical occupation rule in this case will not have dire consequences for the government's power to adjust landlord-tenant relationships, since it in no way alters the usual analysis governing a State's power to require landlords to comply with building codes.

|458 u.s. 457|"Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1
No. 81-9
Argued March 22, 1982
Decided June 30, 1982
458 U.S. 457

Syllabus 
In 1978, appellee Seattle School District No. 1 (District) enacted the so-called Seattle Plan for desegregation of its schools.  The plan makes extensive use of mandatory busing.  Subsequently, a statewide initiative (Initiative 350) was drafted to terminate the use of mandatory busing for purposes of racial integration in the public schools of the State of Washington.  The initiative prohibits school boards from requiring any student to attend a school other than the one geographically nearest or next nearest to his home.  It sets out a number of broad exceptions to this requirement, however:  a student may be assigned beyond his neighborhood school if he requires special educational programs, or if the nearest or next nearest school is overcrowded or unsafe, or if it lacks necessary physical facilities.  These exceptions permit school boards to assign students away from their neighborhood schools for virtually all of the nonintegrative purposes required by their educational policies.  After the initiative was passed at the November, 1978, general election, the District, together with two other districts, brought suit against appellant State in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of Initiative 350 under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court held the initiative unconstitutional on the ground, inter alia, that it established an impermissible racial classification in violation of Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385, and Lee v. Nyquist, 318 F.Supp. 710 (WDNY), summarily aff'd, 402 U.S. 935, ""because it permits busing for non-racial reasons but forbids it for racial reasons.""  The court permanently enjoined implementation of the initiative's restrictions.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Initiative 350 violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  458 U. S. 467-487.
(a) When a State allocates governmental power nonneutrally, by explicitly using the racial nature of a decision to determine the decisionmaking process, its action ""places special burdens on racial minorities within the governmental process,"" Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. at  393 U. S. 391, thereby ""making it more difficult for certain racial and religious minorities [than for other members of the community] to achieve legislation that is in their interest.""  Id. at  393 U. S. 395.  Such a structuring of the political 
Page 458 U. S. 458
 process is ""no more permissible than [is] denying [members of a racial minority] the vote, on an equal basis with others.""  Id. at  393 U. S. 391.  Pp.  458 U. S. 467-470.
(b) Initiative 350 must fall because it does ""not attemp[t] to allocate governmental power on the basis of any general principle,"" Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. at  393 U. S. 395, but instead uses the racial nature of an issue to define the governmental decisionmaking structure, thus imposing substantial and unique burdens on racial minorities.  The initiative worked a major reordering of the State's educational decisionmaking process.  Before adoption of the initiative, the power to determine what programs would most appropriately fill a school district's educational needs -- including programs involving student assignment and desegregation -- was committed to the local board's discretion.  After passage of Initiative 350, authority over all but one of these areas remained in the local board's hands.  By placing power over desegregative busing at the state level, the initiative thus ""differentiates between the treatment of problems involving racial matters and that afforded other problems in the same area.""  Lee v. Nyquist, 318 F.Supp. at 718.  And Initiative 350 works something more than the ""mere repeal"" of a desegregation law by the political entity that created it.  It burdens all future attempts to integrate Washington schools by lodging decisionmaking authority over the question at a new and remote level of government.  This makes the enactment of racially beneficial legislation uniquely difficult, and therefore imposes direct and undeniable burdens on minority interests.  Pp  458 U. S. 470-484.
(c) Contrary to appellants' suggestion, Hunter v. Erickson was not effectively overruled by Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, and Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U. S. 252.  While Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights considered classifications facially unrelated to race, Hunter -- like this case -- involved an attempt to use explicitly racial criteria to define the community's decisionmaking structure.  In so doing, the legislation at issue there directly and invidiously curtailed ""the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.""  United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144,  304 U. S. 152-153, n. 4.  Hunter's principle -- that meaningful and unjustified distinctions based on race are impermissible -- is still vital.  Pp.  458 U. S. 484-487.

Syllabus 
In a California state court action seeking desegregation of the schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District (District), the trial court, in 1970, found de jure segregation in violation of both the State and Federal Constitutions and ordered the District to prepare a desegregation plan.  The California Supreme Court affirmed, but based its decision solely upon the Equal Protection Clause of the State Constitution, which bars de facto as well as de jure segregation.  On remand, the trial court approved a desegregation plan that included substantial mandatory pupil reassignment and busing.  While the trial court was considering alternative new plans in 1979, the voters of California ratified an amendment (Proposition I) to the State Constitution which provides that state courts shall not order mandatory pupil assignment or transportation unless a federal court ""would be permitted under federal decisional law"" to do so to remedy a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  The trial court denied the District's request to halt all mandatory reassignment and busing, holding that Proposition I was not applicable in light of the court's 1970 finding of de jure segregation in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court then ordered implementation of a revised plan that again included substantial mandatory pupil reassignment and busing.  The California Court of Appeal reversed, concluding that the trial court's 1970 findings of fact would not support the conclusion that the District had violated the Federal Constitution through intentional segregation.  The Court of Appeal also held that Proposition I was constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and barred that part of the plan requiring mandatory student reassignment and busing.
Held:  Proposition I does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  458 U. S. 535-545.
(a) This Court's decisions will not support the contention that, once a State chooses to do ""more"" than the Fourteenth Amendment requires, it may never recede.  Such an interpretation of that Amendment would be destructive of a State's democratic processes and of its ability to experiment in dealing with the problems of a heterogeneous population.  Proposition I does not embody, expressly or implicitly, a racial classification.  
Page 458 U. S. 528
 The simple repeal or modification of desegregation or antidiscrimination laws, without more, does not embody a presumptively invalid racial classification.  Pp.  458 U. S. 535-540.
(b) Proposition I cannot be characterized as something more than a mere repeal.  Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385, distinguished.  The State Constitution still places upon school boards a greater duty to desegregate than does the Fourteenth Amendment.  Nor does Proposition I allocate governmental or judicial power on the basis of a discriminatory principle.  A ""dual court system"" -- one for the racial majority and one for the racial minority -- is not established simply because civil rights remedies are different from those available in other areas.  It was constitutional for the people of the State to determine that the Fourteenth Amendment's standard was more appropriate for California courts to apply in desegregation cases than the standard repealed by Proposition I.  Pp.  458 U. S. 540-542.
(c) Even if it could be assumed that Proposition I had a disproportionate adverse effect on racial minorities, there is no reason to differ with the state appellate court's conclusion that Proposition I in fact was not enacted with a discriminatory purpose.  The purposes of the Proposition -- chief among them the educational benefits of neighborhood schooling -- are legitimate, nondiscriminatory objectives, and the state court characterized the claim of discriminatory intent on the part of millions of voters as but ""pure speculation.""

No. 81-614
Argued April 26, 1982

458 U.S. 564

Syllabus 
Title 46 U.S.C.  596, after obligating the master or owner of a vessel making coasting or foreign voyages to pay a seaman's unpaid wages within specified periods after his discharge, provides that a master or owner who fails to make such payment
""without sufficient cause shall pay to the seaman a sum equal to two days' pay for each and every day during which payment is delayed beyond the respective periods.""
Petitioner, who was injured while working aboard respondent's vessel in foreign waters, brought suit under the Jones Act and general maritime law in Federal District Court after respondent refused to pay his medical expenses and to furnish transportation back to the United States.  In addition to damages, petitioner sought to recover penalty wages under  596 for respondent's failure to pay $412.50 in earned wages allegedly due upon discharge.  The court found, inter alia, that petitioner had been discharged from respondent's employ on the day of the injury, and that respondent's failure to pay petitioner the $412.50 was ""without sufficient cause.""  In assessing the penalty wages at $6,881.60, the court held that
""[t]he period during which the penalty runs is to be determined by the sound discretion of the district court, and depends on the equities of the case.""
It determined that the appropriate penalty period was the 34-day period from the date of discharge through the date when petitioner began work for another company.  Petitioner appealed the award of damages as inadequate, but the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The district courts have no discretion to limit the period during which the wage penalty is assessed.  Imposition of the penalty is mandatory for each day that payment is withheld in violation of  596.  Pp.  458 U. S. 569-577.
(a) The words chosen by Congress, given their plain meaning, leave no room for the exercise of discretion either in deciding whether to exact payment or in choosing the period of days by which the payment is to be calculated.  After the District Court found that respondent had refused to pay petitioner the balance of his earned wages promptly after discharge and that its refusal was ""without sufficient cause,"" nothing in  596's language vested the court with discretion to limit the penalty assessment to the period of petitioner's unemployment.  Pp.  458 U. S. 569-571. 
Page 458 U. S. 565

(b) This is not the type of case where literal application of a statute would thwart its obvious purpose.  Section 596's ""evident purpose"" is
""to secure prompt payment of seamen's wages . . . , and thus to protect them from the harsh consequences of arbitrary and unscrupulous action of their employers, to which, as a class, they are peculiarly exposed.""
Collie v. Fergusson, 281 U. S. 52,  281 U. S. 55.  Although the statute's purpose is remedial, Congress has chosen to secure that purpose through the use of potentially punitive sanctions designed to deter negligent or arbitrary delays in payment.  The legislative history confirms that Congress intended the statute to mean exactly what its plain language says.  Pp.  458 U. S. 571-574.
(c) Nor is literal application of  596 in this case precluded on the asserted ground that it would produce an absurd and unjust result which Congress could not have intended.  Even though the penalty for respondent's failure to promptly pay the $412.50 in wages -- if computed on the basis of the period from petitioner's discharge until the date respondent actually paid the wages by satisfying the District Court's judgment -- would be over $300,000, awards made under  596 were not intended to be merely compensatory.  Since the District Court found that respondent's refusal to pay petitioner following his discharge was without sufficient cause, and since it made no finding that respondent's continuing delay in payment beyond the period petitioner was unable to work was for sufficient cause, its decision to limit the penalty was error.  Pacific Mail S.S. Co. v. Schmidt, 241 U. S. 245.  Pp.  458 U. S. 574-577.

No. 80-2015
Argued April 19, 1982
Decided June 29, 1982
458 U.S. 307

Syllabus 
Held:  The State of Idaho may not constitutionally include within the taxable income of appellant nondomiciliary parent corporation doing some business (primarily silver mining) in the State a portion of intangible income (dividends, interest payments, and capital gains from the sale of stock) that appellant received from subsidiary corporations having no other connection with the State.  Pp.  458 U. S. 315-330.
(a) As a general principle, a State may not tax value earned outside its borders.  ""[T]he linchpin of apportionability in the field of state income taxation is the unitary business principle.""  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vermont, 445 U. S. 425,  445 U. S. 439; Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S. 207,  447 U. S. 223.  Pp.  458 U. S. 315-320.
(b) Here, based on the findings in the state trial court and the undisputed facts, appellant succeeded in proving that no unitary business relationship existed between appellant and its subsidiaries.  Pp.  458 U. S. 320-324.
(c) To have, as Idaho proposes, corporate purpose define unitary business -- i.e., to consider intangible income as part of a unitary business if the intangible property (shares of stock) is ""acquired, managed or disposed of for purposes relating or contributing to the taxpayer's business"" -- would destroy the concept of unitary business.  Such a definition, which would permit nondomiciliary States to apportion and tax dividends ""[w]here the business activities of the dividend payor have nothing to do with the activities of the recipient in the taxing State,"" Mobil Oil Corp., supra, at  445 U. S. 442, cannot be accepted consistently with recognized due process standards.  While the dividend-paying subsidiaries in this case ""ad[d] to the riches"" of appellant, Wallace v. Hines, 253 U. S. 66,  253 U. S. 70 (1920), they are ""discrete business enterprise[s]"" that, in ""any business or economic sense,"" have ""nothing to do with the activities"" of appellant in Idaho.  Mobil Oil Corp., supra, at  445 U. S. 439-442.  Therefore, there is no ""rational relationship between [appellant's dividend] income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise.""  Mobil Oil Corp., supra, at  445 U. S. 437.  The Due Process Clause bars Idaho's effort to levy upon income that is not properly within the reach of its taxing power.  Pp.  458 U. S. 325-329.
(d) Under the same unitary business standard applied to the dividend income in question, Idaho's attempt to tax the interest and capital gains 
Page 458 U. S. 308

			"|"Asarco Inc. v. Idaho State Tax Commission
No. 80-2015
Argued April 19, 1982
Decided June 29, 1982
458 U.S. 307

Syllabus 
Held:  The State of Idaho may not constitutionally include within the taxable income of appellant nondomiciliary parent corporation doing some business (primarily silver mining) in the State a portion of intangible income (dividends, interest payments, and capital gains from the sale of stock) that appellant received from subsidiary corporations having no other connection with the State.  Pp.  458 U. S. 315-330.
(a) As a general principle, a State may not tax value earned outside its borders.  ""[T]he linchpin of apportionability in the field of state income taxation is the unitary business principle.""  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vermont, 445 U. S. 425,  445 U. S. 439; Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S. 207,  447 U. S. 223.  Pp.  458 U. S. 315-320.
(b) Here, based on the findings in the state trial court and the undisputed facts, appellant succeeded in proving that no unitary business relationship existed between appellant and its subsidiaries.  Pp.  458 U. S. 320-324.
(c) To have, as Idaho proposes, corporate purpose define unitary business -- i.e., to consider intangible income as part of a unitary business if the intangible property (shares of stock) is ""acquired, managed or disposed of for purposes relating or contributing to the taxpayer's business"" -- would destroy the concept of unitary business.  Such a definition, which would permit nondomiciliary States to apportion and tax dividends ""[w]here the business activities of the dividend payor have nothing to do with the activities of the recipient in the taxing State,"" Mobil Oil Corp., supra, at  445 U. S. 442, cannot be accepted consistently with recognized due process standards.  While the dividend-paying subsidiaries in this case ""ad[d] to the riches"" of appellant, Wallace v. Hines, 253 U. S. 66,  253 U. S. 70 (1920), they are ""discrete business enterprise[s]"" that, in ""any business or economic sense,"" have ""nothing to do with the activities"" of appellant in Idaho.  Mobil Oil Corp., supra, at  445 U. S. 439-442.  Therefore, there is no ""rational relationship between [appellant's dividend] income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise.""  Mobil Oil Corp., supra, at  445 U. S. 437.  The Due Process Clause bars Idaho's effort to levy upon income that is not properly within the reach of its taxing power.  Pp.  458 U. S. 325-329.
(d) Under the same unitary business standard applied to the dividend income in question, Idaho's attempt to tax the interest and capital gains 
Page 458 U. S. 308
 income derived from its subsidiaries also violates the Due Process Clause.  Pp.  458 U. S. 329-330.

Syllabus 
Appellant's principal place of business and commercial domicile are in New York, but it engages in chainstore retailing throughout the United States.  Under its income tax laws, New Mexico distinguishes between ""business"" income, which it apportions between it and other States, and ""nonbusiness"" income, which it generally allocates to a single State on the basis of commercial domicile.  Appellant reported its dividend income from four of its foreign subsidiaries, which engage in chainstore retailing in foreign countries, as ""nonbusiness"" income, none of which was to be allocated to New Mexico.  Similarly, appellant did not report as New Mexico ""business"" income a sum, commonly known as ""gross-up,"" that it never actually received from its foreign subsidiaries but that the Federal Government (for purposes of calculating appellant's federal foreign tax credit) deemed it to have received.  On audit, appellee determined that appellant should have included in its apportionable New Mexico income both the dividends and the gross-up figure.  Appellant's protest was denied, but appellee's decision was reversed by the New Mexico Court of Appeals.  However, the New Mexico Supreme Court, in turn, reversed, holding that both the dividends and the gross-up figure were apportionable New Mexico income.
Held:
1. New Mexico's tax on a portion of the dividends received by appellant from its foreign subsidiaries fails to meet established due process standards.  Pp.  458 U. S. 362-372.
(a) The linchpin of apportionability for state income taxation of an interstate enterprise is the ""unitary-business principle.""  Appellant -- as owner of all of the stock of three of its subsidiaries and a majority interest in the fourth -- potentially has the authority to operate these companies as integrated divisions of a single unitary business.  But the potential to operate a company as part of a unitary business is not dispositive when, as here, the dividend income from the subsidiaries in fact is derived from unrelated business activity of the subsidiaries, each of which operates a discrete business enterprise.  ASARCO Inc. v. Idaho State Tax Comm'n, ante, p.  458 U. S. 307; Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vermont, 445 U. S. 425.  P.  458 U. S. 362.
(b) For due process purposes, the income attributed to a State must be rationally related to values connected with the taxing State.  This 
Page 458 U. S. 355
 limitation is not satisfied merely because the nondomiciliary parent corporation derives some economic benefit from its ownership of stock in another corporation.  Pp.  458 U. S. 363-364.
(c) None of the factors relevant to a State's right to tax dividends from foreign subsidiaries exists in this case.  The record shows that appellant's and its subsidiaries' operations -- such as store site selection, advertising, accounting, purchasing, warehousing, and personnel training -- were not functionally integrated.  And except for the type of occasional oversight -- with respect to capital structure, major debt, and dividends -- that any parent gives to an investment in a subsidiary, there was little or no integration of business activities or centralization of management.  Thus, the subsidiaries were not a part of a ""unitary business.""  Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S. 207, distinguished.  Pp.  458 U. S. 364-372.
2. New Mexico's efforts to tax the ""gross-up"" income also contravenes the Due Process Clause.  The ""fictitious"" gross-up figure is treated for federal foreign tax credit purposes as a dividend in the same manner as a dividend actually received by the domestic corporation from a foreign corporation.  In this case, the foreign tax credit arose from the taxation by foreign nations of appellant's foreign subsidiaries that had no unitary business relationship with New Mexico.  Pp.  458 U. S. 372-373.

Argued March 3, 1982

458 U.S. 375

Syllabus 
Respondents -- the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and several black individuals representing a class of racial minorities who are skilled or seek work as operating engineers in the construction industry in Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware -- brought an action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1981, seeking to redress alleged racial discrimination in the operation of an exclusive hiring hall established in collective bargaining contracts between the local union representing operating engineers and petitioner trade associations and construction industry employers.  Respondents also alleged discrimination in the operation of an apprenticeship program established by the union and the trade associations and administered by the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (JATC), half of whose members are appointed by the union and half by the trade associations.  Named as defendants were the union and petitioners.  The District Court found that, although the hiring hall system was neutral on its face, the union, in administering the system, practiced a pattern of intentional discrimination, and the court also found similar discrimination in the JATC's administration of the apprenticeship program.  On the basis of these findings, the court held that the union and the JATC had violated  1981, and that, although petitioners as a class did not intentionally discriminate against minority workers and were not aware of the union's discriminatory practices, they were nevertheless liable under  1981 for the purpose of imposing an injunctive remedy.  The court reasoned that liability under  1981 requires no proof of purposeful conduct on any of the defendants' part, but it was sufficient that the employers delegated the hiring procedure to the union, and that the union, in effectuating this delegation, intentionally discriminated or, alternatively, produced a discriminatory impact.  The 
Page 458 U. S. 376
 court concluded that respondents had shown the requisite relationship among the employers, trade associations, and union to render applicable the theory of respondeat superior, thus making petitioners liable for the union's discriminatory acts.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Liability may not be imposed under  1981 without proof of intentional discrimination.  This conclusion is supported by the legislative history.  The fact that the prohibitions of  1981 encompass private, as well as governmental, action does not suggest that the statute reaches more than purposeful discrimination, whether public or private.  Pp.  458 U. S. 382-391.
2. The District Court was unable to find discriminatory intent on petitioners' part, and liability under  1981 cannot be vicariously imposed on them based on the discriminatory conduct of the union or the JATC.  Pp.  458 U. S. 391-397.
(a) There is no basis for holding petitioners liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior.  The union, in operating the hiring hall, performed no function as the agent or servant of petitioner trade associations.  Nor can the relationship between petitioner employers and the union be characterized as one between principal and agent without proof of a right to control the union's activities.  Such a conception is alien to the fundamental assumption upon which the federal labor laws are structured, and was not established by the evidence on which the District Court relied.  And there is no evidence that an agency relationship existed between petitioners and the JATC.  The fact that the employers fund the JATC does not render the JATC the employers' servant or agent, nor does the fact that the trade associations appoint half of the JATC's members infer a right of the associations to control the JATC.  Pp.  458 U. S. 391-395.
(b) Nor is there any basis for holding petitioners liable on the ground that  1981 imposes a ""nondelegable duty"" on them to see that discrimination does not occur in the selection of their workforce.  Section 1981 does no more than prohibit petitioners from intentionally depriving black workers of the rights enumerated in the statute, including the equal right to contract, and was not intended to make them guarantors of the workers' rights against third parties who would infringe them.  Pp.  458 U. S. 395-397.
3. The District Court had no inherent power under its traditional equitable authority to allocate to petitioners a portion of the costs of the remedial decree, absent a supportable finding of liability upon petitioners' part.  Nor does the All Writs Act constitute an independent basis for the injunctive portions of the District Court's order running against petitioners.  There was no need to treat petitioners as strangers to the 
Page 458 U. S. 377
 suit, and therefore to rely upon some extraordinary form of procedure or writ to bring them before the court, since they were named as defendants and litigated the issue of injunctive liability.  Pp.  458 U. S. 397-402.

458 U.S. 50

Syllabus 
The Bankruptcy Act of 1978 (Act) established a United States bankruptcy court in each judicial district as an adjunct to the district court for such district.  The bankruptcy court judges are appointed for 14-year terms, subject to removal by the judicial council of the circuit in which they serve on grounds of incompetence, misconduct, neglect of duty, or disability.  Their salaries are set by statute, and are subject to adjustment.  The Act grants the bankruptcy courts jurisdiction over ""all civil proceedings arising under title 11 [bankruptcy] [of the United States Code] or arising in or related to cases under title 11.""  See 28 U.S.C.  1471(b) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).  After it had filed a petition for reorganization in a Bankruptcy Court, appellant Northern Pipeline Construction Co. (Northern) filed in that court a suit against appellee Marathon Pipe Line Co. (Marathon) seeking damages for an alleged breach of contract and warranty, as well as for misrepresentation, coercion, and duress.  Marathon sought dismissal of the suit on the ground that the Act unconstitutionally conferred Art. III judicial power upon judges who lacked life tenure and protection against salary diminution.  The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion to dismiss, but on appeal the District Court granted the motion.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
12 B.R. 946, affirmed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that:
1. Section 1471's broad grant of jurisdiction to bankruptcy judges violates Art. III.  Pp.  458 U. S. 57-87.
(a) The judicial power of the United States must be exercised by judges who have the attributes of life tenure and protection against salary diminution specified by Art. III.  These attributes were incorporated into the Constitution to ensure the independence of the Judiciary from the control of the Executive and Legislative Branches.  There is 
Page 458 U. S. 51
 no doubt that bankruptcy judges created by the Act are not Art. III judges.  Pp.  458 U. S. 57-62.
(b) Article III bars Congress from establishing under its Art. I powers legislative courts to exercise jurisdiction over all matters arising under the bankruptcy laws.  The establishment of such courts does not fall within any of the historically recognized situations -- non-Art. III courts of the Territories or of the District of Columbia, courts-martial, and resolution of ""public rights"" issues -- in which the principle of independent adjudication commanded by Art. III does not apply.  The bankruptcy courts do not lie exclusively outside the States, like the courts of the Territories or of the District of Columbia, or bear any resemblance to courts-martial, nor can the substantive legal rights at issue in the present action -- the right to recover contract damages to augment Northern's estate -- be deemed ""public rights.""  There is no persuasive reason in logic, history, or the Constitution, why bankruptcy courts lie beyond the reach of Art. III.  Pp.  458 U. S. 63-76.
(c) Section 1471 impermissibly removed most, if not all, of the essential attributes of the judicial power from the Art. III district court and vested those attributes in a non-Art. III adjunct.  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, and United States v. Raddatz, 447 U. S. 667, distinguished.  Congress does not have the same power to create adjuncts to adjudicate constitutionally recognized rights and state-created rights as it does to adjudicate rights that it creates.  The grant of jurisdiction to bankruptcy courts cannot be sustained as an exercise of Congress' power to create adjuncts to Art. III courts.  Pp.  458 U. S. 76-87.
2. The above holding that the broad grant of jurisdiction in  1471 is unconstitutional shall not apply retroactively, but only prospectively.  Such grant of jurisdiction presents an unprecedented question of interpretation of Art. III, and retroactive application would not further the operation of the holding, but would visit substantial injustice and hardship upon those litigants who relied upon the Act's vesting of jurisdiction in the bankruptcy courts.  Pp.  458 U. S. 87-88.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded that, where appellee Marathon Pipe Line Co. has simply been named defendant in appellant Northern Pipeline Construction Co.'s suit on a contract claim arising under state law, the constitutionality of the Bankruptcy Court's exercise of jurisdiction over that kind of suit is all that need be decided in this case; that resolution of any objections Marathon might make to the exercise of authority conferred on bankruptcy courts by the Bankruptcy Act of 1978, on the ground that the suit must be decided by an Art. III court, should await the exercise of such authority; that so much of that Act as enables a Bankruptcy Court to entertain and decide 
Page 458 U. S. 52
 Northern's suit over Marathon's objection violates Art. III; and that the Court's judgment should not be applied retroactively.  Pp.  458 U. S. 89-92.

Syllabus 
As required by New York law, petitioner Union Labor Life Insurance Co. (ULL) issues health insurance policies covering certain policyholder claims for chiropractic treatments.  Some ULL policies limit the company's liability to ""reasonable"" charges for ""necessary"" medical care and services.  In order to determine whether particular chiropractors' treatments and fees were necessary and reasonable, ULL arranged with petitioner New York State Chiropractic Association (NYSCA), a professional association of chiropractors, to use the advice of its Peer Review Committee, which was established primarily to aid insurers in evaluating claims for chiropractic treatments, and which is composed of 10 practicing New York chiropractors.  Respondent is a licensed chiropractor practicing in New York.  On a number of occasions ULL referred his treatments of ULL policyholders, and his charges for those treatments, to the Committee for review.  The Committee sometimes concluded that respondent's treatments were unnecessary or his charges unreasonable.  Respondent brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging that petitioners' peer review practices violated  1 of the Sherman Act because petitioners had used the Committee as the vehicle for their conspiracy to fix the prices that chiropractors would be permitted to charge for their services.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment, dismissing respondent's complaint on the ground that ULL's use of NYSCA's Peer Review Committee was exempted from antitrust scrutiny by  2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which applies to the ""business of insurance.""  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the action for further proceedings.
Held:  ULL's use of NYSCA's Peer Review Committee does not constitute the ""business of insurance"" within the meaning of  2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and thus is not exempt from antitrust scrutiny.  Group Life  Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U. S. 205, controlling.  Pp.  458 U. S. 126-134. 
Page 458 U. S. 120

(a) There are three criteria relevant in determining whether a particular practice is part of the ""business of insurance"" exempted from the antitrust laws by  2(b):  first, whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder's risk; second, whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and third, whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry. Royal Drug Co., supra.  Pp.  458 U. S. 126-129.
(b) With regard to the first criterion, petitioners' arrangement plays no part in the spreading and underwriting of a policyholder's risk, because it is logically and temporally unconnected to the contract entered by the policyholder and ULL, which was the actual risk-transferring event.  As to the second criterion, ULL's use of NYSCA's Peer Review Committee is distinct from ULL's contracts with its policyholders, and constitutes a separate arrangement between the insurer and third parties not engaged in the business of insurance.  Nor does the challenged arrangement satisfy this criterion on the asserted ground that it directly involves the ""interpretation"" and ""enforcement"" of the insurance contract, because ULL's procedure for deciding whether claims are covered is a matter of indifference to the policyholder, whose only concern is whether his claim is paid, not why it is paid.  As respects the third criterion, it may be assumed that the challenged arrangement need not be denied the  2(b) exemption solely because it involves parties outside the insurance industry -- namely, practicing chiropractors serving on the Peer Review Committee.  But such arrangements can hardly be said to lie at the center of the legislative concern underlying  2(b), which was with the protection of intra-industry cooperation in the underwriting of risks.  More importantly, such arrangements may prove contrary to the spirit as well as the letter of  2(b), because they have the potential to restrain competition in noninsurance markets.  Pp.  458 U. S. 130-134.
650 F.2d 387, affirmed.

458 U.S. 141

Syllabus 
Section 5(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 (HOLA) empowers the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (Board), under such regulations as it may prescribe, to provide for the organization, operation, and regulation of federal savings and loan associations.  Pursuant to this authorization, the Board issued a regulation providing that a federal savings and loan association ""continues to have the power to include . . . in its loan instrument"" a ""due-on-sale"" clause, i.e., a provision that permits the association to declare the entire balance of the loan immediately due and payable if the property securing the loan is sold or otherwise transferred without the association's prior written consent.  A preamble to the regulation stated that the due-on-sale practices of federal savings and loan associations shall be governed ""exclusively by Federal law,"" and that the association ""shall not be bound by or subject to any conflicting State law which imposes different . . . due-on-sale requirements.""  Appellees each purchased California real property from one who had borrowed money from appellant Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan Association (Fidelity).  The borrowers had given Fidelity deeds of trust on the property; each deed contained a due-on-sale clause.  Fidelity, not having received prior notice of the purchases, proceeded to enforce the due-on-sale clauses to accelerate payment of the loans, and when they were not paid, instituted nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings.  Each appellee then filed suit against Fidelity in California Superior Court, asserting that Fidelity's exercise of the due-on-sale clauses violated the principles announced in Wellenkamp v. Bank of America, 21 Cal.3d 943, 582 P.2d 970, which limited a lender's right to exercise such a clause to cases where the lender can demonstrate that the transfer of the property has impaired its security.  The Superior Court consolidated the actions and granted Fidelity's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the Federal Government had totally occupied the regulation of federal savings and loan associations.  The California Court of Appeal reversed, holding that Wellenkamp was controlling, and that federal law had not expressly or impliedly preempted state due-on-sale law.
Held:  The Board's due-on-sale regulation preempts conflicting state limitations on the due-on-sale practices of federal savings and loan associations, 
Page 458 U. S. 142
 and thus bars application of the Wellenkamp rule to such associations.  Pp.  458 U. S. 152-170.
(a) The general principles governing preemption of state law that conflicts with federal law are not inapplicable here simply because real property is a matter of special concern to the States.  And federal regulations have no less preemptive effect than federal statutes.  Where Congress has empowered an administrator to promulgate regulations, regulations intended to preempt state law have that effect unless the administrator exceeded his statutory authority or acted arbitrarily.  Pp.  458 U. S. 152-154.
(b) The language of the Board's regulation, and especially the preamble thereto, clearly show the Board's intent to preempt the Wellenkamp doctrine.  The conflict between that doctrine and the regulation does not evaporate because the regulation simply permits, but does not compel, federal savings and loan associations to include a due-on-sale clause in their contracts and to enforce that clause when the security property is transferred.  While compliance with both the regulation and the Wellenkamp rule may not be a physical impossibility, that rule forbids a federal savings and loan association to enforce a due-on-sale clause at its option, and deprives the association of the flexibility given it by the Board.  The rule therefore creates an obstacle to the accomplishment of the regulation's purpose.  Pp.  458 U. S. 154-159.
(c) The Board acted within its statutory authority in issuing the preemptive due-on-sale regulation.  Both the language and legislative history of the HOLA indicate that the Board was authorized to regulate the lending practices of federal savings and loan associations.  Congress delegated power to the Board expressly for the purpose of creating and regulating these associations so as to ensure that they would remain financially sound and able to supply financing for home construction and purchase.  Consistent with that purpose, the Board reasonably exercised its authority in promulgating the due-on-sale regulation.  Pp.  458 U. S. 159-170.

The Education of the Handicapped Act (Act) provides federal money to assist state and local agencies in educating handicapped children.  To qualify for federal assistance, a State must demonstrate, through a detailed plan submitted for federal approval, that it has in effect a policy that assures all handicapped children the right to a ""free appropriate public education,"" which policy must be tailored to the unique needs of the handicapped child by means of an ""individualized educational program"" (IEP).  The IEP must be prepared (and reviewed at least annually) by school officials with participation by the child's parents or guardian.  The Act also requires that a participating State provide specified administrative procedures by which the child's parents or guardian may challenge any change in the evaluation and education of the child.  Any party aggrieved by the state administrative decisions is authorized to bring a civil action in either a state court or a federal district court.  Respondents -- a child with only minimal residual hearing who had been furnished by school authorities with a special hearing aid for use in the classroom and who was to receive additional instruction from tutors, and the child's parents -- filed suit in Federal District Court to review New York administrative proceedings that had upheld the school administrators' denial of the parents' request that the child also be provided a qualified sign-language interpreter in all of her academic classes.  Entering judgment for respondents, the District Court found that although the child performed better than the average child in her class and was advancing easily from grade to grade, she was not performing as well academically as she would without her handicap.  Because of this disparity between the child's achievement and her potential, the court held that she was not receiving a ""free appropriate public education,"" which the court defined as ""an opportunity to achieve [her] full potential commensurate with the opportunity provided to other children.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held:
1. The Act's requirement of a ""free appropriate public education"" is satisfied when the State provides personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the handicapped child to benefit educationally from that instruction.  Such instruction and services must be provided at public expense, must meet the State's educational standards, must approximate grade levels used in the State's regular education, and must comport with the child's IEP, as formulated in accordance with the Act's requirements.  If the child is being educated in regular classrooms, as here, the IEP should be reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.  Pp.  458 U. S. 187-204.
(a) This interpretation is supported by the definitions contained in the Act, as well as by other provisions imposing procedural requirements and setting forth statutory findings and priorities for States to follow in extending educational services to handicapped children.  The Act's language contains no express substantive standard prescribing the level of education to be accorded handicapped children.  Pp.  458 U. S. 187-190.
(b) The Act's legislative history shows that Congress sought to make public education available to handicapped children, but did not intend to impose upon the States any greater substantive educational standard than is necessary to make such access to public education meaningful.  The Act's intent was more to open the door of public education to handicapped children by means of specialized educational services than to guarantee any particular substantive level of education once inside.  Pp. 458 U. S. 191-197.
(c) While Congress sought to provide assistance to the States in carrying out their constitutional responsibilities to provide equal protection of the laws, it did not intend to achieve strict equality of opportunity or services for handicapped and nonhandicapped children, but rather sought primarily to identify and evaluate handicapped children, and to provide them with access to a free public education.  The Act does not require a State to maximize the potential of each handicapped child commensurate with the opportunity provided nonhandicapped children.  Pp.  458 U. S. 198-200.
2. In suits brought under the Act's judicial review provisions, a court must first determine whether the State has complied with the statutory procedures, and must then determine whether the individualized program developed through such procedures is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.  If these requirements are met, the State has complied with the obligations imposed by Congress, and the courts can require no more.  Pp.  458 U. S. 204-208. 
Page 458 U. S. 178

(a) Although the judicial-review provisions do not limit courts to ensuring that States have complied with the Act's procedural requirements, the Act's emphasis on procedural safeguards demonstrates the legislative conviction that adequate compliance with prescribed procedures will in most cases assure much, if not all, of what Congress wished in the way of substantive content in an IEP.  Pp.  458 U. S. 204-207.
(b) The courts must be careful to avoid imposing their view of preferable educational methods upon the States.  Once a court determines that the Act's requirements have been met, questions of methodology are for resolution by the States.  Pp.  458 U. S. 207-208.
3. Entrusting a child's education to state and local agencies does not leave the child without protection.  As demonstrated by this case, parents and guardians will not lack ardor in seeking to ensure that handicapped children receive all of the benefits to which they are entitled by the Act.  Pp.  458 U. S. 208-209.
4. The Act does not require the provision of a sign-language interpreter here.  Neither of the courts below found that there had been a failure to comply with the Act's procedures, and the findings of neither court will support a conclusion that the child's educational program failed to comply with the substantive requirements of the Act.  Pp.  458 U. S. 209-210.

No. 81-300
Argued April 20, 1982
Decided June 28, 1982
458 U.S. 219

Syllabus 
Held:  An employer charged with discrimination in hiring under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 can toll the continuing accrual of backpay liability under  706(g) of Title VII by unconditionally offering the claimant the job previously denied, and is not required to offer seniority retroactive to the date of the alleged discrimination.  Thus, absent special circumstances, the rejection of an employer's unconditional job offer ends the accrual of potential backpay liability.  Pp.  458 U. S. 225-241.
(a) This rule serves Title VII's objective of ending discrimination through voluntary compliance, for it gives the employer a strong incentive to hire the claimant.  To require a retroactive seniority offer in addition to the unconditional job offer fails to provide the same incentive, because it makes hiring the claimant more costly than hiring another applicant for the same job.  Pp.  458 U. S. 228-230.
(b) An unemployed or underemployed claimant's statutory obligation to minimize damages under  706(g) requires him to accept an unconditional job offer, even without retroactive seniority.  The rule announced here merely embodies such requirement of minimizing damages, without affecting the claimant's right to compensation.  Pp.  458 U. S. 230-234.
(c) The rule announced here also is consistent with the policy of full compensation when the claimant has had the good fortune to find a more attractive job than that offered by the employer charged with discrimination, because the availability of the better job terminates the ongoing ill effect of the latter's refusal to hire the claimant.  Pp.  458 U. S. 234-236.
(d) Since the rule announced here rests both on the statutory requirement that a claimant minimize damages and on the fact that he no longer incurs additional injury if he has been able to find other work at least as attractive as the charged employer's, the rule in almost all circumstances is consistent with Title VII's object of making injured claimants whole.  Pp.  458 U. S. 236-239.
(e) To require a retroactive seniority offer in addition to the unconditional job offer would threaten the interests of innocent incumbent employees by disrupting the established seniority hierarchy, with the attendant risk that an innocent employee would be unfairly laid off or 
Page 458 U. S. 220
 disadvantaged because a Title VII claimant has been granted seniority.  Pp.  458 U. S. 239-240.

Syllabus 
After the police had stopped respondent's automobile for a traffic violation, respondent, who was riding as a passenger, was arrested for possession of open intoxicants, and the driver was issued a citation for not having a driver's license.  An inventory search of the car was made before it was towed, disclosing marihuana in the unlocked glove compartment and, upon a more thorough search, a loaded revolver in an air vent under the dashboard.  Respondent was convicted in a Michigan state court for possession of a concealed weapon.  The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the warrantless search of respondent's automobile violated the Fourth Amendment.
Held:  There was no violation of respondent's Fourth Amendment rights by the warrantless search.  When police officers have probable cause to believe there is contraband inside an automobile that has been stopped on the road, the officers may conduct a warrantless search of the vehicle, even after it has been impounded and is in police custody.

Syllabus 
After respondents, originally indicted on two federal criminal counts in the Eastern District of Kentucky, obtained a change of venue to the Central District of California, the Government secured a superseding indictment which added four new counts.  The Government then obtained a voluntary dismissal of three of the counts (including one of the original counts), and respondents moved to dismiss the remaining counts on the ground that the superseding indictment manifested prosecutorial vindictiveness in retaliation for their exercising their right to a change of venue, and thus ran afoul of the rule announced in Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S. 21.  The District Court denied the motion, but stayed the trial to permit an appeal.  The Court of Appeals held that the denial of the motion to dismiss was immediately appealable as a ""final decision"" under 28 U.S.C.  1291, and that respondents had established a case of prosecutorial vindictiveness requiring dismissal of the superseding indictment.
Held:  The Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1291 to review the District Court's interlocutory order refusing to dismiss the indictment.  The policy embodied in  1291 is inimical to piecemeal appellate review of trial court decisions that do not terminate the litigation, and this policy is at its strongest in the field of criminal law.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 28, 1982
 On petition for writ of 
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from the denial of certiorari. 
 This case arises from a child custody dispute between private parties . A Virginia trial court awarded petitioner's ex-wife custody of their 3- year old son and ordered petitioner to pay child support. Petitioner then brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 against the trial judge, the state governor, and the state attorney general. His complaint sought monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief, premised on allegations that the custody and support award violated the First, Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court dismissed the suit without prejudice because 
Page 458 U.S. 1112 , 1113
 the constitutional questions could be addressed in the state court custody action. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. 673 F.2d 1309 ( 1981). In a brief per curiam opinion, the court explained: 
 Petitioner now seeks a writ of certiorari, and presents, as his fourth question, the question of whether the Court of Appeals has properly applied the Younger doctrine. [Footnote 1] 

 This question is not easily answered because the Fourth Circuit has, in at least two respects, gone beyond our cases in dismissing the action under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971). First, this Court has never applied the Younger doctrine to a case where the State was not a party to the pending state proceedings. Younger and its early progeny were criminal proceedings, in which, of course, the State is always a party. In Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 95 S. Ct. 1200 (1975), the initial application of Younger to a civil proceeding, the Court relied heavily on the State's direct participation.

Petitioner then brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 against the trial judge, the state governor, and the state attorney general. His complaint sought monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief, premised on allegations that the custody and support award violated the First, Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court dismissed the suit without prejudice because 
Page 458 U.S. 1112 , 1113
 the constitutional questions could be addressed in the state court custody action. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. 673 F.2d 1309 ( 1981). In a brief per curiam opinion, the court explained: 
 Petitioner now seeks a writ of certiorari, and presents, as his fourth question, the question of whether the Court of Appeals has properly applied the Younger doctrine. [Footnote 1] 

 This question is not easily answered because the Fourth Circuit has, in at least two respects, gone beyond our cases in dismissing the action under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971). First, this Court has never applied the Younger doctrine to a case where the State was not a party to the pending state proceedings. Younger and its early progeny were criminal proceedings, in which, of course, the State is always a party. In Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 95 S. Ct. 1200 (1975), the initial application of Younger to a civil proceeding, the Court relied heavily on the State's direct participation. "|

Syllabus 
Respondent school is a privately operated school for maladjusted high school students.  In recent years, nearly all of the students have been referred to the school by city school committees under a Massachusetts statute or by a state agency.  When the students are referred to the school by the city committees, these cities pay for the students' education.  The school also receives funds from a number of state and federal agencies.  Public funds have recently accounted for at least 90% of the school's operating budget.  To be eligible for tuition funding under the state statute, the school must comply with a variety of state regulations, but these regulations impose few specific personnel requirements.  Similarly, the school's contracts with the State and the city committees generally do not cover personnel policies.  Petitioners, a former vocational counselor and teachers at the school, brought separate actions in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, claiming that they had been discharged by the school in violation of their First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The court dismissed the counselor's action but denied a motion to dismiss the teachers' action, reaching conflicting conclusions as to whether the school had acted under color of state law so as to be subject to liability under  1983.  On appeal the cases were consolidated, and the Court of Appeals held that it was error to conclude that the school acted under color of state law, since, although regulated by the State, it was not dominated by the State, especially with respect to decisions involving discharge of personnel.
Held:  Respondent school did not act under color of state law when it discharged petitioner employees, and hence petitioners have not stated a claim for relief under  1983.  Pp.  457 U. S. 837-843.
(a) The ultimate issue in determining whether a person is subject to suit under  1983 is the same question posed in cases arising under the Fourteenth Amendment:  is the alleged infringement of federal rights fairly attributable to the State?  Pp.  457 U. S. 837-838.
(b) The school's receipt of public funds does not make the discharge decisions acts of the State.  Cf. Blum v. Yaretsky, post, p.  457 U. S. 991.  The school is not fundamentally different from many private corporations whose business depends primarily on contracts with the government, and whose acts do not become acts of the government by reason of their 
Page 457 U. S. 831
 significant or even total engagement in performing public contracts.  The decision to discharge petitioners was not compelled or even influenced by any state regulation, and the fact that the school performs a public function in educating maladjusted high school students does not make its acts state action.  Moreover, since the school's fiscal relationship with the State is not any different from that of many contractors performing services for the government, there is no ""symbiotic relationship"" between the school and the State.

Syllabus 
Petitioner Board of Education, rejecting recommendations of a committee of parents and school staff that it had appointed, ordered that certain books, which the Board characterized as ""anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Sem[i]tic, and just plain filthy,"" be removed from high school and junior high school libraries.  Respondent students then brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against the Board and petitioner Board members, alleging that the Board's actions had denied respondents their rights under the First Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment in petitioners' favor.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a trial on the merits of respondents' allegations.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
638 F.2d 404, affirmed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded:
1. The First Amendment imposes limitations upon a local school board's exercise of its discretion to remove books from high school and junior high school libraries.  Pp.  457 U. S. 863-872.
(a) Local school boards have broad discretion in the management of school affairs, but such discretion must be exercised in a manner that comports with the transcendent imperatives of the First Amendment.  Students do not ""shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,"" Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist., 393 U. S. 503,  393 U. S. 506, and such rights may be directly and sharply implicated by the removal of books from the shelves of a school library.  While students' First Amendment rights must be construed ""in light of the special characteristics of the school environment,"" ibid., the special characteristics of the school library make that environment especially appropriate for the recognition of such rights.  Pp.  457 U. S. 863-869.
(b) While petitioners might rightfully claim absolute discretion in matters of curriculum by reliance upon their duty to inculcate community values in schools, petitioners' reliance upon that duty is misplaced 
Page 457 U. S. 854
 where they attempt to extend their claim of absolute discretion beyond the compulsory environment of the classroom into the school library and the regime of voluntary inquiry that there holds sway.  P.  457 U. S. 869.
(c) Petitioners possess significant discretion to determine the content of their school libraries, but that discretion may not be exercised in a narrowly partisan or political manner.  Whether petitioners' removal of books from the libraries denied respondents their First Amendment rights depends upon the motivation behind petitioners' actions.  Local school boards may not remove books from school libraries simply because they dislike the ideas contained in those books and seek by their removal to ""prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion.""  West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624,  319 U. S. 642.  If such an intention was the decisive factor in petitioners' decision, then petitioners have exercised their discretion in violation of the Constitution.  Pp.  457 U. S. 869-872.
2. The evidentiary materials before the District Court must be construed favorably to respondents, given the procedural posture of this case.  When so construed, those evidentiary materials raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether petitioners exceeded constitutional limitations in exercising their discretion to remove the books at issue from their school libraries.  Respondents' allegations, and some of the evidentiary materials before the District Court, also fail to exclude the possibility that petitioners' removal procedures were highly irregular and ad hoc -- the antithesis of those procedures that might tend to allay suspicions regarding petitioners' motivation.  Pp.  457 U. S. 872-875.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded that a proper balance between the limited constitutional restriction imposed on school officials by the First Amendment and the broad state authority to regulate education would be struck by holding that school officials may not remove books from school libraries for the purpose of restricting access to the political ideas or social perspectives discussed in the books when that action is motivated simply by the officials' disapproval of the ideas involved.  Pp.  457 U. S. 879-882.
JUSTICE WHITE, while agreeing that there should be a trial to resolve the factual issues, concluded that there is no necessity at this point for discussing the extent to which the First Amendment limits the school board's discretion to remove books from the school libraries.

Syllabus 
This case concerns the relationship between the requirement of ""state action"" to establish a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the requirement of action ""under color of state law"" to establish a right to recover under 42 U.S.C.  1983, which provides a remedy for deprivation of constitutional rights when that deprivation takes place ""under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage"" of a State.  Respondents filed suit in Virginia state court on a debt owed by petitioner, and sought prejudgment attachment of certain of petitioner's property.  Pursuant to Virginia law, respondents alleged, in an ex parte petition, a belief that petitioner was disposing of or might dispose of his property in order to defeat his creditors; acting upon that petition, a Clerk of the state court issued a writ of attachment, which was executed by the County Sheriff; a hearing on the propriety of the attachment was later conducted; and 34 days after the levy, the trial judge dismissed the attachment for respondents' failure to establish the alleged statutory grounds for attachment.  Petitioner then brought this action in Federal District Court under  1983, alleging that in attaching his property respondents had acted jointly with the State to deprive him of his property without due process of law.  The District Court held that the alleged actions of the respondents did not constitute state action as required by the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the complaint therefore did not state a valid claim under  1983.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but on the basis that the complaint failed to allege conduct under color of state law for purposes of  1983 because there was neither usurpation or corruption of official power by a private litigant nor a surrender of judicial power to the private litigant in such a way that the independence of the enforcing officer was compromised to a significant degree.
Held:
1. Constitutional requirements of due process apply to garnishment and prejudgment attachment procedures whenever state officers act jointly with a private creditor in securing the property in dispute.  Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U. S. 337.  And if the challenged conduct of the creditor constitutes state action as delimited by this Court's prior decisions, then that conduct is also action under color of state law, and will support a suit under  1983.  Pp.  457 U. S. 926-935. 
Page 457 U. S. 923

2. Conduct allegedly causing the deprivation of a constitutional right protected against infringement by a State must be fairly attributable to the State.  In determining the question of ""fair attribution,"" (a) the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed by it or by a person for whom it is responsible, and (b) the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor, either because he is a state official, because he has acted together with or has obtained significant aid from state officials or because his conduct is otherwise chargeable to the State.  Pp.  457 U. S. 936-939.
3. Insofar as petitioner alleged only misuse or abuse by respondents of Virginia law, he did not state a cause of action under  1983, but challenged only private action.  Such challenged conduct could not be ascribed to any governmental decision, nor did respondents have the authority of state officials to put the weight of the State behind their private decision.  However, insofar as petitioner's complaint challenged the state statute as being procedurally defective under the Due Process Clause, he did present a valid cause of action under  1983.  The statutory scheme obviously is the product of state action, and a private party's joint participation with state officials in the seizure of disputed property is sufficient to characterize that party as a ""state actor"" for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Respondents were, therefore, acting under color of state law in participating in the deprivation of petitioner's property.  Pp.  457 U. S. 939-942.

Syllabus 
Article III,  19, of the Texas Constitution provides that
""[n]o judge of any court, Secretary of State, Attorney General, clerk of any court of record, or any person holding a lucrative office under the United States, or this State, or any foreign government shall during the term for which he is elected or appointed, be eligible to the Legislature.""
As interpreted by the Texas Supreme Court,  19 requires an officeholder to complete his current term of office -- if it overlaps the legislature's term -- before he may be eligible to serve in the state legislature.  Article XVI,  65, provides that, if holders of certain state and county offices whose unexpired term exceeds one year become candidates for any other state or federal office, this shall constitute an automatic resignation of the office then held.  Appellees -- who challenged these provisions in Federal District Court as violating the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution -- included officeholders subject to  65, each of whom alleged that he would have announced his candidacy for higher judicial office except that such announcement would constitute an automatic resignation from his current position, and one of whom (Baca), a Justice of the Peace, also alleged that he could not become a candidate for the state legislature because of  19.  The other appellees were voters who alleged that they would vote for the officeholder appellees were they to become candidates.  The District Court held that the challenged provisions denied appellees equal protection, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is reversed. 631 F.2d 731, reversed.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and V, concluding that:
1. The uncontested allegations in the complaint are sufficient to create an actual case or controversy between the officeholder appellees and those Texas officials charged with enforcing  19 and 6.  Pp.  457 U. S. 961-962.
2. Sections 19 and 65 do not violate the First Amendment.  The State's interests are sufficient to warrant the de minimis interference with appellees' First Amendment interests in candidacy.  In addition, 
Page 457 U. S. 958
 appellees' First Amendment challenge as elected state officeholders contesting restrictions on partisan political activity must fail, since  19 and 65 represent a far more limited restriction on political activity than has been upheld with regard to civil servants.  Cf. CSC v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548; Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601; United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75.  Pp.  457 U. S. 971-973.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded in Parts III and IV that neither of the challenged provisions of the Texas Constitution violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  457 U. S. 962-971.
(a) Candidacy is not a ""fundamental right"" that itself requires departure from traditional equal protection principles under which state law classifications need only be drawn in such a manner as to bear some rational relationship to a legitimate state end.  Decision in this area of constitutional adjudication is a matter of degree, and involves a consideration of the facts and circumstances behind the law, the interests the State seeks to protect by placing restrictions on candidacy, and the nature of the interests of those who may be burdened by the restrictions.  In determining whether the provisions challenged here deserve ""scrutiny"" more vigorous than that which the traditional principles would require, the nature of the interests affected and the extent of the burden the challenged provisions place on the candidacy of current officeholder must be examined.  Pp.  457 U. S. 962-966.
(b) As applied to Baca, a Justice of the Peace whose term of office is four years, whereas a state legislator's term is two years,  19 simply requires that Baca must wait, at most, two years -- one election cycle -- before he may run as a candidate for the legislature.  In establishing this maximum ""waiting period,""  19 places a de minimis burden on the political aspirations of a current officeholder.  This sort of insignificant interference with access to the ballot need only rest on a rational predicate in order to survive an equal protection challenge.  Section 19 clearly rests on a rational predicate, since it furthers Texas' interests in maintaining the integrity of its Justices of the Peace by ensuring that they will neither abuse their position nor neglect their duties because of aspirations for higher office.  Moreover, Texas has a legitimate interest in discouraging its Justices of the Peace from vacating their current terms of office, thereby avoiding the difficulties that accompany interim elections and appointments.  Nor is  19 invalid in that it burdens only those officeholders who desire to run for the legislature.  It would be a perversion of the Equal Protection Clause to conclude that Texas must restrict a Justice of the Peace's candidacy for all offices before it can restrict his candidacy for any office.  Pp.  457 U. S. 966-970. 
Page 457 U. S. 959

(c) The burdens imposed on candidacy by the automatic resignation provision of  65 are even less substantial than those imposed by  19.  Both provisions serve essentially the same state interests.  Nor is  65 invalid on the ground that it applies only to certain elected officials and not to others.  Its history shows that the resignation provision was a creature of state electoral reforms, and a regulation is not devoid of a rational predicate simply because it happens to be incomplete.  The Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit Texas from restricting one elected officeholder's candidacy for another elected office unless and until it places similar restrictions on other officeholders.

Syllabus 
As a participating State in the Medicaid program established by the Social Security Act, New York provides Medicaid assistance to eligible persons who receive care in private nursing homes, which are designated as either ""skilled nursing facilities"" (SNF's) or ""health related facilities"" (HRF's), the latter providing less extensive, and generally less expensive, medical care than the former.  The nursing homes are directly reimbursed by the State for the reasonable cost of health care services.  To obtain Medicaid assistance, an individual must satisfy eligibility standards in terms of income or resources and must seek medically necessary services.  As to the latter requirement, federal regulations require each nursing home to establish a utilization review committee (URC) of physicians whose functions include periodically assessing whether each patient is receiving the appropriate level of care, and thus whether the patient's continued stay in the facility is justified.  Respondents, who were Medicaid patients in an SNF, instituted a class action in Federal District Court after the nursing home's URC decided that they should be transferred to a lower level of care in an HRF and so notified local officials, and after administrative hearings resulting in affirmance by state officials of the local officials' decision to discontinue benefits unless respondents accepted transfer to an HRF.  Respondents alleged, inter alia, that they had not been afforded adequate notice either of the URC decisions and the reasons supporting them or of their right to an administrative hearing to challenge those decisions, as required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Respondents later added claims as to procedural safeguards that should also apply to URC decisions transferring a patient to a higher level of care and to transfers of any kind initiated by the nursing homes themselves or by the patients' attending physicians.  Ultimately, the court approved a consent judgment establishing procedural rights applicable to URC-initiated transfers to lower levels of care, and ruled in respondents' favor as to transfers to higher levels of care and all transfers initiated by the facility or its agent.  The court permanently enjoined petitioner state officials and all SNF's and HRF's in the State from permitting 
Page 457 U. S. 992
 or ordering discharges of class members, or their transfers to a different level of care, without prior written notice and an evidentiary hearing.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that URC-initiated transfers to a higher level of care, and all discharges and transfers by nursing homes or attending physicians, involved ""state action"" for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:
1. Respondents have standing to challenge the procedural adequacy of facility-initiated discharges and transfers to lower levels of care.  Although respondents were threatened only with URC-initiated transfers to lower levels of care, and although the consent judgment in the District Court halted implementation of such URC decisions, the threat that the nursing homes might determine, independently of the URC decisions, that respondents' continued stay at current levels of care was not medically necessary is not imaginary or speculative but is quite realistic.  However, the threat of transfers to higher levels of care is not of sufficient immediacy and reality that respondents presently have standing to seek an adjudication of the procedures attending such transfers.  Thus, the District Court exceeded its authority under Art. III in adjudicating the procedures governing transfers to higher levels of care.  Pp.  457 U. S. 999-1002.
2. Respondents failed to establish ""state action"" in the nursing homes' decisions to discharge or transfer Medicaid patients to lower levels of care, and thus failed to prove that petitioners have violated rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  457 U. S. 1002-1012.
(a) The mere fact that a private business is subject to state regulation does not, by itself, convert its action into that of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.  A State normally can be held responsible for a private decision only when it has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State.  Pp.  457 U. S. 1003-1005.
(b) The fact that the State responds to the nursing homes' discharge or transfer decisions by adjusting the patients' Medicaid benefits does not render it responsible for those decisions.  Moreover, the pertinent statutes and regulations do not constitute affirmative commands by the State for summary discharge or transfer of Medicaid patients who are thought to be inappropriately placed in nursing facilities.  The State, by requiring completion by physicians or nursing homes of forms relating to a patient's condition and discharge or transfer decisions, is not responsible for the decisions of the physicians or nursing homes.  Those decisions ultimately turn on medical judgments made by private parties according to professional standards that are not established by the State.  Similarly, regulations imposing penalties on nursing homes that fail to discharge or transfer patients whose continued stay is inappropriate do 
Page 457 U. S. 993
 not themselves dictate the decision to discharge or transfer in a particular case.  And even though the State subsidizes the cost of the facilities, pays the expenses of the patients, and licenses the facilities, the action of the nursing homes is not thereby converted into ""state action.""  Nor do the nursing homes perform a function that has been ""traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the State,"" Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U. S. 345,  419 U. S. 353, so as to establish the required nexus between the State and the challenged action.  Pp.  457 U. S. 1005-1012.

Syllabus 
After President Carter announced certain trade restrictions with the Soviet Union because of its intervention in Afghanistan, respondent International Longshoremen's Association announced that its members would not handle any cargo bound to, or coming from, the Soviet Union.  When an affiliated local union refused to load certain goods (not included in the Presidential embargo) bound for the Soviet Union, petitioners (hereafter collectively referred to as the Employer) brought suit in Federal District Court against respondents, the international union, its officers and agents, and the local union (hereafter collectively referred to as the Union), pursuant to  301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act.  The Employer alleged that the Union's work stoppage violated the terms of a collective bargaining agreement which contained a no-strike clause and a provision requiring arbitration of disputes.  As requested by the Employer, the court ordered the Union to arbitrate the question whether the work stoppage violated the collective bargaining agreement, and granted a preliminary injunction pending arbitration.  The court reasoned that the political motivation behind the work stoppage rendered inapplicable  4 of the Norris-La Guardia Act, which prohibits injunctions against strikes ""in any case involving or growing out of any labor dispute.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order insofar as it required arbitration, but disagreed with the conclusion that the Norris-La Guardia Act was not applicable.
Held:
1. The Norris-La Guardia Act applies to this case, which involves a ""labor dispute"" even though the work stoppage was politically motivated.  Pp.  457 U. S. 709-720.
(a) The plain language of the Act -- prohibiting injunctions in ""any"" labor dispute and defining ""labor dispute"" to include ""any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment"" -- does not except labor disputes having their genesis in political protests.  Here, the Employer sought injunctive relief as to the dispute over whether the work stoppage violated the no-strike clause of the bargaining agreement, not as to 
Page 457 U. S. 703
 the event that triggered the stoppage.  The term ""labor dispute"" must not be narrowly construed, the critical element in determining whether the Act applies being whether, as here, ""the employer-employee relationship [is] the matrix of the controversy.""  Columbia River Packers Assn. v. Hinton, 315 U. S. 143,  315 U. S. 147.  The existence of noneconomic motives does not make the Act inapplicable.  Pp.  457 U. S. 710-715.
(b) The legislative history of both the Norris-La Guardia Act and the 1947 amendments to the National Labor Relations Act indicates that the Norris-La Guardia Act was intended to apply to politically motivated work stoppages.  Pp.  457 U. S. 715-719.
(c) The Norris-La Guardia Act's broad prohibitions will not be constricted, except in narrowly defined situations where accommodation of the Act to specific congressional policy is necessary.  Pp.  457 U. S. 719-720.
2. Nor may the Union's work stoppage here be enjoined, pending arbitration, under the rationale of Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks, 398 U. S. 235, and Buffalo Forge Co. v. Steelworkers, 428 U. S. 397, on the asserted ground that the dispute underlying the stoppage is arbitrable under the collective bargaining agreement.  While Boys Markets recognized an exception to the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-La Guardia Act when the employer sought to enforce the union's contractual obligation to arbitrate grievances rather than to strike over them, Buffalo Forge makes it clear that a Boys Markets injunction pending arbitration may not issue unless the dispute underlying the work stoppage is arbitrable.  Here the underlying dispute, whether viewed as an expression of the Union's ""moral outrage"" at Soviet military policy or as an expression of sympathy for the people of Afghanistan, is plainly not arbitrable under the collective bargaining agreement.  Thus the strike may not be enjoined pending the arbitrator's ruling on the legality of the strike under the no-strike clause of the collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  457 U. S. 720-723.
626 F.2d 455, affirmed.

The court reasoned that the political motivation behind the work stoppage rendered inapplicable  4 of the Norris-La Guardia Act, which prohibits injunctions against strikes ""in any case involving or growing out of any labor dispute.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order insofar as it required arbitration, but disagreed with the conclusion that the Norris-La Guardia Act was not applicable.
Held:
1. The Norris-La Guardia Act applies to this case, which involves a ""labor dispute"" even though the work stoppage was politically motivated.  Pp.  457 U. S. 709-720.
(a) The plain language of the Act -- prohibiting injunctions in ""any"" labor dispute and defining ""labor dispute"" to include ""any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment"" -- does not except labor disputes having their genesis in political protests.  Here, the Employer sought injunctive relief as to the dispute over whether the work stoppage violated the no-strike clause of the bargaining agreement, not as to 
Page 457 U. S. 703
 the event that triggered the stoppage.  The term ""labor dispute"" must not be narrowly construed, the critical element in determining whether the Act applies being whether, as here, ""the employer-employee relationship [is] the matrix of the controversy.""  Columbia River Packers Assn. v. Hinton, 315 U. S. 143,  315 U. S. 147.  The existence of noneconomic motives does not make the Act inapplicable.  Pp.  457 U. S. 710-715.
(b) The legislative history of both the Norris-La Guardia Act and the 1947 amendments to the National Labor Relations Act indicates that the Norris-La Guardia Act was intended to apply to politically motivated work stoppages.  Pp.  457 U. S. 715-719.
(c) The Norris-La Guardia Act's broad prohibitions will not be constricted, except in narrowly defined situations where accommodation of the Act to specific congressional policy is necessary.  Pp.  457 U. S. 719-720.
2. Nor may the Union's work stoppage here be enjoined, pending arbitration, under the rationale of Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks, 398 U. S. 235, and Buffalo Forge Co. v. Steelworkers, 428 U. S. 397, on the asserted ground that the dispute underlying the stoppage is arbitrable under the collective bargaining agreement.  While Boys Markets recognized an exception to the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-La Guardia Act when the employer sought to enforce the union's contractual obligation to arbitrate grievances rather than to strike over them, Buffalo Forge makes it clear that a Boys Markets injunction pending arbitration may not issue unless the dispute underlying the work stoppage is arbitrable.  Here the underlying dispute, whether viewed as an expression of the Union's ""moral outrage"" at Soviet military policy or as an expression of sympathy for the people of Afghanistan, is plainly not arbitrable under the collective bargaining agreement.  Thus the strike may not be enjoined pending the arbitrator's ruling on the legality of the strike under the no-strike clause of the collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  457 U. S. 720-723.

Syllabus 
During the waning months of the Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, respondent, a management analyst with the Department of the Air Force, testified before a congressional Subcommittee about cost overruns and unexpected technical difficulties concerning the development of a particular airplane.  In January, 1970, during the Presidency of petitioner Richard M. Nixon, respondent was dismissed from his job during a departmental reorganization and reduction in force, in which his job was eliminated.  Respondent complained to the Civil Service Commission, alleging that his separation represented unlawful retaliation for his congressional testimony.  The Commission rejected this claim, but concluded that respondent's dismissal offended applicable regulations because it was motivated by ""reasons purely personal to"" respondent.  Respondent thereafter filed suit for damages in Federal District Court against various Defense Department officials and White House aides allegedly responsible for his dismissal.  An amended complaint later named petitioner as a defendant.  After earlier judicial rulings and extensive pretrial discovery, only three defendants were involved:  petitioner and two White House aides (petitioners in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, post, p.  457 U. S. 800).  Denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the court held that respondent had stated triable causes of action under two federal statutes and the First Amendment, and that petitioner was not entitled to claim absolute Presidential immunity.  Petitioner took a collateral appeal of the immunity decision to the Court of Appeals, which dismissed summarily.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction to determine the immunity question.  Pp.  457 U. S. 741-744.
(a) The case was ""in"" the Court of Appeals for purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1254, which authorizes this Court's review of ""[c]ases in"" the courts of appeals.  The Court of Appeals here dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  However, petitioner's appeal to the Court of Appeals falls within the ""collateral order"" doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, as raising a ""serious and unsettled 
Page 457 U. S. 732
 question"" of law.  Although the Court of Appeals had previously ruled in another case that the President was not entitled to absolute immunity, this Court had never so held.  Pp.  457 U. S. 741-743.
(b) Nor was the controversy mooted by an agreement to liquidate damages entered into between the parties after the petition for certiorari was filed and respondent had entered his opposition.  Under the terms of the agreement, petitioner paid respondent $142,000; respondent agreed to accept liquidated damages of $28,000 if this Court ruled that petitioner was not entitled to absolute immunity; and no further payments would be made if the decision upheld petitioner's immunity claim.  The limited agreement left both parties with a considerable financial stake in the resolution of the question presented in this Court.  Cf. Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U. S. 363.  Pp.  457 U. S. 743-744.
2. Petitioner, as a former President of the United States, is entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official acts.  Pp.  457 U. S. 744-758.
(a) Although there is no blanket recognition of absolute immunity for all federal executive officials from liability for civil damages resulting from constitutional violations, certain officials -- such as judges and prosecutors -- because of the special nature of their responsibilities, require absolute exemption from liability.  Cf. Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478.  Determination of the immunity of particular officials is guided by the Constitution, federal statutes, history, and public policy.  Pp.  457 U. S. 744-748.
(b) The President's absolute immunity is a functionally mandated incident of his unique office, rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by the Nation's history.  Because of the singular importance of the President's duties, diversion of his energies by concern with private lawsuits would raise unique risks to the effective functioning of government.  While the separation of powers doctrine does not bar every exercise of jurisdiction over the President, a court, before exercising jurisdiction, must balance the constitutional weight of the interest to be served against the dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.  The exercise of jurisdiction is not warranted in the case of merely private suits for damages based on a President's official acts.  Pp.  457 U. S. 748-754.
(c) The President's absolute immunity extends to all acts within the ""outer perimeter"" of his duties of office.  Pp.  457 U. S. 755-757.
(d) A rule of absolute immunity for the President does not leave the Nation without sufficient protection against his misconduct.  There remains the constitutional remedy of impeachment, as well as the deterrent effects of constant scrutiny by the press and vigilant oversight by Congress.  Other incentives to avoid misconduct may include a desire to

 earn reelection, the need to maintain prestige as an element of Presidential influence, and a President's traditional concern for his historical stature.  Pp.  457 U. S. 757-758.

Syllabus 
In respondent's civil damages action in Federal District Court based on his alleged unlawful discharge from employment in the Department of the Air Force, petitioners, White House aides to former President Nixon, were codefendants with him and were claimed to have participated in the same alleged conspiracy to violate respondent's constitutional and statutory rights as was involved in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, ante p.  457 U. S. 731.  After extensive pretrial discovery, the District Court denied the motions of petitioners and the former President for summary judgment, holding, inter alia, that petitioners were not entitled to absolute immunity from suit.  Independently of the former President, petitioners appealed the denial of their immunity defense, but the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal.
Held:
1. Government officials whose special functions or constitutional status requires complete protection from suits for damages -- including certain officials of the Executive Branch, such as prosecutors and similar officials, see Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, and the President, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, ante p.  457 U. S. 731 -- are entitled to the defense of absolute immunity.  However, executive officials in general are usually entitled to only qualified or good faith immunity.  The recognition of a qualified immunity defense for high executives reflects an attempt to balance competing values:  not only the importance of a damages remedy to protect the rights of citizens, but also the need to protect officials who are required to exercise discretion and the related public interest in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority.  Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232.  Federal officials seeking absolute immunity from personal liability for unconstitutional conduct must bear the burden of showing that public policy requires an exemption of that scope.  Pp.  457 U. S. 806-808.
2. Public policy does not require a blanket recognition of absolute immunity for Presidential aides.  Cf. Butz, supra.  Pp.  457 U. S. 808-813.
(a) The rationale of Gravel v. United States, 408 U. S. 606 -- which held the Speech and Debate Clause derivatively applicable to the ""legislative acts"" of a Senator's aide that would have been privileged if performed by the Senator himself -- does not mandate ""derivative"" absolute 
Page 457 U. S. 801
 immunity for the President's chief aides.  Under the ""functional"" approach to immunity law, immunity protection extends no further than its justification warrants.  Pp.  457 U. S. 809-811.
(b) While absolute immunity might be justified for aides entrusted with discretionary authority in such sensitive areas as national security or foreign policy, a ""special functions"" rationale does not warrant a blanket recognition of absolute immunity for all Presidential aides in the performance of all their duties.  To establish entitlement to absolute immunity, a Presidential aide first must show that the responsibilities of his office embraced a function so sensitive as to require a total shield from liability.  He then must demonstrate that he was discharging the protected function when performing the act for which liability is asserted.  Under the record in this case, neither petitioner has made the requisite showing for absolute immunity.  However, the possibility that petitioners, on remand, can satisfy the proper standards is not foreclosed.  Pp.  457 U. S. 811-813.
3. Petitioners are entitled to application of the qualified immunity standard that permits the defeat of insubstantial claims without resort to trial.  Pp.  457 U. S. 813-820.
(a) The previously recognized ""subjective"" aspect of qualified or ""good faith"" immunity -- whereby such immunity is not available if the official asserting the defense ""took the action with the malicious intention to cause a deprivation of constitutional rights or other injury,"" Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308,  420 U. S. 322 -- frequently has proved incompatible with the principle that insubstantial claims should not proceed to trial.  Henceforth, government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate ""clearly established"" statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.  Pp.  457 U. S. 815-819.
(b) The case is remanded for the District Court's reconsideration of the question whether respondent's pretrial showings were insufficient to withstand petitioners' motion for summary judgment.  Pp.  457 U. S. 819-820.

Syllabus 
Appellee Massachusetts trial court, relying on a Massachusetts statute providing for exclusion of the general public from trials of specified sexual offenses involving a victim under the age of 18, ordered the exclusion of the press and public from the courtroom during the trial of a defendant charged with rape of three minor girls.  Appellant newspaper publisher challenged the exclusion order, and ultimately, after the trial had resulted in the defendant's acquittal, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court construed the Massachusetts statute as requiring, under all circumstances, the exclusion of the press and public during the testimony of a minor victim in a sex-offense trial.
Held:
1. The fact that the exclusion order expired with completion of the trial at which the defendant was acquitted does not render the controversy moot within the meaning of Art. III.  The controversy is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review,"" since it can reasonably be assumed that appellant will someday be subjected to another order relying on the Massachusetts statute, and since criminal trials are typically of short duration.  Pp.  457 U. S. 602-603.
2. The Massachusetts statute, as construed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, violates the First Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  457 U. S. 603-607.
(a) To the extent that the First Amendment embraces a right of access to criminal trials, it is to ensure that the constitutionally protected ""discussion of governmental affairs"" is an informed one.  The right of access to criminal trials in particular is properly afforded protection by the First Amendment both because such trials have historically been open to the press and public and because such right of access plays a particularly significant role in the functioning of the judicial process and the government as a whole.  Pp.  457 U. S. 603-606.
(b) The right of access to criminal trials is not absolute, but the circumstances under which the press and public can be barred are limited.  The State must show that denial of such right is necessitated by a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  Pp.  457 U. S. 606-607. 
Page 457 U. S. 597

3. The Massachusetts statute cannot be justified on the basis of either the State's interest in protecting minor victims of sex crimes from further trauma and embarrassment or its interest in encouraging such victims to come forward and testify in a truthful and credible manner.  Pp.  457 U. S. 607-610.
(a) Compelling as the first interest is, it does not justify a mandatory closure rule.  Such interest could be just as well served by requiring the trial court to determine on a case-by-case basis whether the State's legitimate concern for the minor victim's wellbeing necessitates closure.  Such an approach ensures that the constitutional right of the press and public to gain access to criminal trials will not be restricted except where necessary to protect the State's interest.  Pp.  457 U. S. 607-609.
(b) The second asserted interest is not only speculative in empirical terms, but is also open to serious question as a matter of logic and common sense.  Although the statute was construed to bar the press and public from the courtroom during a minor sex victim's testimony, the press is not denied access to the transcript, court personnel, or any other source that could provide an account of such testimony, and thus the statute cannot prevent the press from publicizing the substance of that testimony, as well as the victim's identity.  Pp.  457 U. S. 609-610.

Appellee Massachusetts trial court, relying on a Massachusetts statute providing for exclusion of the general public from trials of specified sexual offenses involving a victim under the age of 18, ordered the exclusion of the press and public from the courtroom during the trial of a defendant charged with rape of three minor girls.  Appellant newspaper publisher challenged the exclusion order, and ultimately, after the trial had resulted in the defendant's acquittal, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court construed the Massachusetts statute as requiring, under all circumstances, the exclusion of the press and public during the testimony of a minor victim in a sex-offense trial.
Held:
1. The fact that the exclusion order expired with completion of the trial at which the defendant was acquitted does not render the controversy moot within the meaning of Art. III.  The controversy is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review,"" since it can reasonably be assumed that appellant will someday be subjected to another order relying on the Massachusetts statute, and since criminal trials are typically of short duration.  Pp.  457 U. S. 602-603.
2. The Massachusetts statute, as construed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, violates the First Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  457 U. S. 603-607.
(a) To the extent that the First Amendment embraces a right of access to criminal trials, it is to ensure that the constitutionally protected ""discussion of governmental affairs"" is an informed one.  The right of access to criminal trials in particular is properly afforded protection by the First Amendment both because such trials have historically been open to the press and public and because such right of access plays a particularly significant role in the functioning of the judicial process and the government as a whole.  Pp.  457 U. S. 603-606.
(b) The right of access to criminal trials is not absolute, but the circumstances under which the press and public can be barred are limited.  The State must show that denial of such right is necessitated by a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  Pp.  457 U. S. 606-607. 
Page 457 U. S. 597

3. The Massachusetts statute cannot be justified on the basis of either the State's interest in protecting minor victims of sex crimes from further trauma and embarrassment or its interest in encouraging such victims to come forward and testify in a truthful and credible manner.  Pp.  457 U. S. 607-610.
(a) Compelling as the first interest is, it does not justify a mandatory closure rule.  Such interest could be just as well served by requiring the trial court to determine on a case-by-case basis whether the State's legitimate concern for the minor victim's wellbeing necessitates closure.  Such an approach ensures that the constitutional right of the press and public to gain access to criminal trials will not be restricted except where necessary to protect the State's interest.  Pp.  457 U. S. 607-609.
(b) The second asserted interest is not only speculative in empirical terms, but is also open to serious question as a matter of logic and common sense.  Although the statute was construed to bar the press and public from the courtroom during a minor sex victim's testimony, the press is not denied access to the transcript, court personnel, or any other source that could provide an account of such testimony, and thus the statute cannot prevent the press from publicizing the substance of that testimony, as well as the victim's identity.  Pp.  457 U. S. 609-610.

Syllabus 
The Illinois Business Take-Over Act requires a tender offeror to notify the Secretary of State and the target company of its intent to make a tender offer and the terms of the offer 20 days before the offer becomes effective.  During that time, the offeror may not communicate its offer to the shareholders, but the target company is free to disseminate information to its shareholders concerning the impending offer.  The Act also requires any takeover offer to be registered with the Secretary of State.  A target company is defined as a corporation of which Illinois shareholders own 10% of the class of securities subject to the takeover offer or for which any two of the following conditions are met:  the corporation has its principal office in Illinois, is organized under Illinois laws, or has at least 10% of its stated capital and paid-in surplus represented within the State.  An offer becomes registered 20 days after a registration statement is filed with the Secretary of State unless he calls a hearing to adjudicate the fairness of the offer.  Appellee MITE Corp., a corporation organized under Delaware laws with its principal office in Connecticut, initiated a tender offer for all outstanding shares of Chicago Rivet & Machine Co., an Illinois corporation, by filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission the schedule required by the Williams Act.  MITE, however, did not comply with the Illinois Act, and brought an action in Federal District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the Illinois Act was preempted by the Williams Act and violated the Commerce Clause, and also seeking injunctive relief.  The District Court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the Illinois Act against MITE's tender offer.  MITE then published its offer.  Subsequently, the District Court issued the requested declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction.  Shortly thereafter, MITE and Chicago Rivet entered into an agreement whereby both MITE's tender offer and an offer made by Chicago Rivet before the District Court entered its judgment were withdrawn and MITE was given a specified time to make another offer.  Ultimately, MITE decided not to make another offer.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
633 F.2d 486, affirmed. 
Page 457 U. S. 625

JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and V-B, concluding that:
1. The case is not moot. Because the Secretary of State has indicated his intention to enforce the Illinois Act against MITE, a reversal of the District Court's judgment would expose MITE to civil and criminal liability for making an offer in violation of the Act.  P.  457 U. S. 630.
2. The Illinois Act is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, because it imposes burdens on interstate commerce that are excessive in light of the local interests the Act purports to further.  Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137.  Illinois' asserted interests in protecting resident security holders and regulating the internal affairs of companies incorporated under Illinois law are insufficient to outweigh such burdens.  Pp.  457 U. S. 643-646.

Syllabus 
An action to recover for the death of an occupant of a pleasure boat resulting from a collision with another pleasure boat on a river in Louisiana was instituted in Federal District Court on the asserted basis of admiralty jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1333(1).  The court dismissed the complaint, holding that there must be some relationship with traditional maritime activity for an injury sustained on navigable water to fall within federal admiralty jurisdiction, and that commercial maritime activity (not present here) is necessary to satisfy this relationship.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  In light of the need for uniform rules governing navigation, the potential impact on maritime commerce when two vessels collide on navigable waters, and the uncertainty and confusion that would necessarily accompany a jurisdictional test tied to the commercial use of a given boat, a complaint alleging a collision between two vessels -- including pleasure boats -- on navigable waters properly states a claim within the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts.  The holding in Executive Jet Aviation, Inc. v. City of Cleveland, 409 U. S. 249, that claims arising from airplane accidents, although occurring in a maritime locality, are cognizable in admiralty only when the wrong bears a significant relationship to traditional maritime activity, also applies to determinations of federal admiralty jurisdiction outside the context of aviation torts.  However, there is no requirement that the maritime activity be an exclusively commercial one.  The federal interest in protecting maritime commerce can be fully vindicated only if all operators of vessels on navigable waters -- not just individuals actually engaged in commercial maritime activity -- are subject to uniform rules of conduct.  This interpretation is consistent with congressional activity as to legislation governing ""vessels"" without regard to whether they engage in commercial activity.  Pp.  457 U. S. 672-677.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was arrested on a grocery store robbery charge without a warrant or probable cause, based on an uncorroborated informant's tip, and was taken to the police station, where he was given Miranda warnings, fingerprinted, questioned, and placed in a lineup.  After being told that his fingerprints matched those on grocery items handled by one of the participants in the robbery and after a short visit with his girlfriend, petitioner signed a written confession.  Over petitioner's objection, the confession was admitted into evidence at his trial in an Alabama state court, and he was convicted.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals reversed, holding that the confession should not have been admitted, but was, in turn, reversed by the Alabama Supreme Court.
Held:  Petitioner's confession should have been suppressed as the fruit of an illegal arrest.  Brown v. Illinois, 422 U. S. 590; Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200.  Pp.  457 U. S. 689-694.
(a) A confession obtained through custodial interrogation after an illegal arrest should be excluded unless intervening events break the causal connection between the arrest and the confession so that the confession is sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint.  Pp.  457 U. S. 689-690.
(b) Here, there was no meaningful intervening event.  The illegality of the initial arrest was not cured by the facts that six hours elapsed between the arrest and confession; that the confession may have been ""voluntary"" for Fifth Amendment purposes because Miranda warnings were given; that petitioner was permitted a short visit with his girlfriend; or that the police did not physically abuse petitioner.  Nor was the fact that an arrest warrant, based on a comparison of fingerprints, was filed after petitioner had been arrested and while he was being interrogated a significant intervening event, such warrant being irrelevant to whether the confession was the fruit of an illegal arrest.  The initial fingerprints, which were themselves the fruit of the illegal arrest and were used to extract the confession, cannot be deemed sufficient ""attenuation"" to break the connection between the illegal arrest and the confession merely because they formed the basis for the arrest warrant.

457 U.S. 423

Syllabus 
Under rules promulgated by the New Jersey Supreme Court pursuant to its authority under the State Constitution to license and discipline attorneys admitted to practice in the State, a claim of unethical conduct by an attorney is first considered by a local District Ethics Committee appointed by the Supreme Court.  If a complaint is issued, the attorney whose conduct is challenged is served with the complaint and has 10 days to answer.  Upon a determination that a prima facie case of unethical conduct exists, a formal hearing is held.  The attorney charged may have counsel, discovery is available, and all witnesses are sworn.  The Committee may ultimately dismiss the complaint, issue a private letter of reprimand, or forward a presentment to the statewide Disciplinary Review Board, which is also appointed by the Supreme Court.  After a de novo review, the Board is required to make formal findings and recommendations to the Supreme Court, which reviews all decisions beyond a private reprimand and which permits briefing and oral argument for cases involving disbarment or suspension for more than one year.  Respondent Hinds, a member of the New Jersey Bar, was served by petitioner, a local Ethics Committee, with a formal statement of charges of violating certain Supreme Court disciplinary rules.  Instead of filing an answer to the charges, Hinds and the three respondent organizations of lawyers filed suit in Federal District Court, contending that the disciplinary rules violated their rights under the Federal Constitution.  The court dismissed the complaint on the basis of the abstention principles of Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the disciplinary proceedings did not provide a meaningful opportunity to adjudicate constitutional claims, notwithstanding an affidavit stating that the New Jersey Supreme Court would directly consider Hinds' constitutional challenges and would consider whether such a procedure should be made explicit in the Supreme Court rules.
Held:  The federal courts should abstain from interfering with the ongoing disciplinary proceedings within the jurisdiction of the New Jersey Supreme Court.  Pp.  457 U. S. 431-437.
(a) The policies underlying Younger are fully applicable to noncriminal judicial proceedings when important state interests are involved.  
Page 457 U. S. 424
 Where such interests are involved, a federal court should abstain unless state law clearly bars the interposition of the constitutional claims.  The pertinent inquiry is whether the state proceedings afford an adequate opportunity to raise the constitutional claims.  Pp.  457 U. S. 431-432.
(b) The New Jersey Supreme Court considers its disciplinary proceedings, beginning with the filing of a complaint with the local Ethics Committee, as ""judicial in nature.""  As such, the proceedings are of a character to warrant federal court deference.  Pp.  457 U. S. 432-434.
(c) The State has an extremely important interest in maintaining and assuring the professional conduct of the attorneys it licenses.  The State's interest in the present litigation is demonstrated by the fact that petitioner, an agency of the New Jersey Supreme Court, is the named defendant in the present suit and was the body which initiated the state proceedings against Hinds.  The importance of the state interest in the pending state judicial proceedings and in the federal case calls Younger abstention into play.  Pp.  457 U. S. 434-435.
(d) In light of the unique relationship between the New Jersey Supreme Court and the local Ethics Committee, and in view of the nature of the proceedings, it cannot be concluded that there was no ""adequate opportunity"" for Hinds to raise his constitutional claims.  Any doubt as to this matter was laid to rest by the New Jersey Supreme Court's subsequent actions when, prior to the filing of the petition for certiorari in this Court, it sua sponte entertained the constitutional issues raised by Hinds.  And there is no reason to disturb the District Court's unchallenged findings that there was no bad faith or harassment on petitioner's part and that the state disciplinary rules were not ""flagrantly and patently"" unconstitutional.  Nor have any other extraordinary circumstances been presented to indicate that abstention would not be appropriate.  Pp.  457 U. S. 435-437.

Any doubt as to this matter was laid to rest by the New Jersey Supreme Court's subsequent actions when, prior to the filing of the petition for certiorari in this Court, it sua sponte entertained the constitutional issues raised by Hinds.  And there is no reason to disturb the District Court's unchallenged findings that there was no bad faith or harassment on petitioner's part and that the state disciplinary rules were not ""flagrantly and patently"" unconstitutional.  Nor have any other extraordinary circumstances been presented to indicate that abstention would not be appropriate.  Pp.  457 U. S. 435-437.

457 U.S. 440

Syllabus 
Respondent black employees of a Connecticut state agency were promoted provisionally to supervisors.  To attain permanent status as supervisors, they had to participate in a selection process that required, as a first step, a passing score on a written examination.  Subsequently, an examination was given to 48 black and 259 white candidates.  Fifty-four percent of the black candidates passed, this being approximately 68 percent of the passing rate for the white candidates.  Respondent black employees failed the examination, and were thus excluded from further consideration for permanent supervisory positions.  They then brought an action in Federal District Court against petitioners (the State of Connecticut and certain state agencies and officials), alleging that petitioners had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by requiring, as an absolute condition for consideration for promotion, that applicants pass a written test that disproportionately excluded blacks and was not job-related.  In the meantime, before trial, petitioners made promotions from the eligibility list, the overall result being that 22.9 percent of the black candidates were promoted, but only 13.5 percent of the white candidates.  Petitioners urged that this ""bottom-line"" result, more favorable to blacks than to whites, was a complete defense to the suit.  The District Court agreed, and entered judgment for petitioners, holding that the ""bottom line"" percentages precluded the finding of a Title VII violation and that petitioners were not required to demonstrate that the promotional examination was job-related.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court erred in ruling that the examination results alone were insufficient to support a prima facie case of disparate impact in violation of Title VII.
Held:  Petitioners' nondiscriminatory ""bottom line"" does not preclude respondents from establishing a prima facie case nor does it provide petitioners with a defense to such a case.  Pp.  457 U. S. 445-456.
(a) Despite petitioners' nondiscriminatory ""bottom line,"" respondents' claim of disparate impact from the examination, a pass-fail barrier to employment opportunity, states a prima facie case of employment discrimination under  703(a)(2) of Title VII, which makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to ""limit, segregate, or classify his employees"" in any way which would deprive ""any individual of employment 
Page 457 U. S. 441
 opportunities"" because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  To measure disparate impact only at the ""bottom line"" ignores the fact that Title VII guarantees these individual black respondents the opportunity to compete equally with white workers on the basis of job-related criteria.  Respondents' rights under  703(a)(2) have been violated unless petitioners can demonstrate that the examination in question was not an artificial, arbitrary, or unnecessary barrier, but measured skills related to effective performance as a supervisor.  Pp.  457 U. S. 445-451.
(b) No special haven for discriminatory tests is offered by  703(h) of Title VII, which provides that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to act upon results of an ability test if such test is ""not designed, intended, or used to discriminate"" because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  A non-job-related test that has a disparate impact and is used to ""limit"" or ""classify"" employees is ""used to discriminate"" within the meaning of Title VII, whether or not it was ""designed or intended"" to have this effect and despite an employer's efforts to compensate for its discriminatory effect.  Pp.  457 U. S. 451-452.
(c) The principal focus of  703(a)(2) is the protection of the individual employee, rather than the protection of the minority group as a whole.  To suggest that the ""bottom line"" may be a defense to a claim of discrimination against an individual employee confuses unlawful discrimination with discriminatory intent.  Resolution of the factual question of intent is not what is at issue in this case, but rather petitioners seek to justify discrimination against the black respondents on the basis of petitioners' favorable treatment of other members of these respondents' racial group.  Congress never intended to give an employer license to discriminate against some employees on the basis of race or sex merely because he favorably treats other members of the employees' group.

No. 81-225
Argued March 24, 1982
Decided June 21, 1982
457 U.S. 465

Syllabus 
Respondent employee was provided coverage under a prepaid group health plan purchased by her employer from petitioner Blue Shield of Virginia (Blue Shield).  The plan provided reimbursement for part of the cost incurred by subscribers for outpatient treatment for mental and nervous disorders, including psychotherapy.  However, Blue Shield's practice was to reimburse subscribers for services provided by psychiatrists, but not by psychologists unless the treatment was supervised by and billed through a physician.  Respondent was treated by a clinical psychologist and submitted claims to Blue Shield for the costs of the treatment.  After the claims were routinely denied because they had not been billed through a physician, respondent brought a class action in Federal District Court, alleging that Blue Shield and petitioner Neuropsychiatric Society of Virginia, Inc., had engaged in an unlawful conspiracy in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act to exclude psychologists from receiving compensation under Blue Shield's plans.  She further alleged that Blue Shield's failure to reimburse was in furtherance of the conspiracy and had caused injury to her business or property for which she was entitled to treble damages under  4 of the Clayton Act, which provides for recovery of such damages by ""[a]ny person"" injured ""by reason of anything"" prohibited in the antitrust laws.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss, holding that respondent had no standing under  4 to maintain her suit.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Respondent has standing to maintain the action under  4 of the Clayton Act.  Pp.  457 U. S. 472-485.
(a) The lack of restrictive language in  4 reflects Congress' expansive remedial purpose of creating a private enforcement mechanism to deter violators and deprive them of the fruits of their illegal actions, and to provide ample compensation to victims of antitrust violations.  In the absence of some articulable consideration of statutory policy suggesting a contrary conclusion in a particular factual setting,  4 is to be applied in accordance with its plain language and its broad remedial and deterrent objectives.  Pp.  457 U. S. 472-473.
(b) Permitting respondent to proceed does not offer the slightest possibility of a duplicative exaction from petitioners, Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U. S. 251, and Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 
Page 457 U. S. 466
 distinguished, since she had paid her psychologist, who thus was not injured by Blue Shield's refusal to reimburse respondent.  And whatever the adverse effect of Blue Shield's actions on respondent's employer, who purchased the plan, it is not the employer as purchaser, but its employees as subscribers, who are out of pocket as a consequence of the plan's failure to pay benefits.  Pp.  457 U. S. 473-475.
(c) In determining whether a particular injury is too remote from the alleged violation to warrant  4 standing, consideration is to be given (1) to the physical and economic nexus between the alleged violation and the harm to the plaintiff, and (2), more particularly, to the relationship of the injury alleged with those forms of injury about which Congress was likely to have been concerned in making defendant's conduct unlawful and in providing a private remedy under  4.  Pp.  457 U. S. 476-478.
(d) Respondent's injury is not rendered ""remote"" merely because the alleged goal of petitioners was to halt encroachment by psychologists into a market that physicians and psychiatrists sought to preserve for themselves.  Here, the  4 remedy cannot reasonably be restricted to those competitors whom petitioners hoped to eliminate from the market.  Denying reimbursement to subscribers for the cost of treatment was the very means by which it is alleged that Blue Shield sought to achieve its alleged illegal ends, and respondent's injury was precisely the type of loss that the claimed violations would be likely to cause.  Nor is the  4 remedy unavailable to respondent on the asserted ground that standing should be limited to participants in the restrained market in group health care plans -- that is, to entities, such as respondent's employer, who were purchasers of group health plans.  Respondent did not allege a restraint in the market for group health plans, but instead premised her claim on the concerted refusal to reimburse under a plan that would permit reimbursement for psychologists' services.  As a consumer of psychotherapy services entitled to financial benefits under the Blue Shield plan, she was within that area of the economy endangered by the breakdown of competitive conditions resulting from Blue Shield's selective refusal to reimburse.  Pp.  457 U. S. 478-481.
(e) Section 4 standing is not precluded on the asserted ground that respondent's injury does not reflect the ""anticompetitive"" effect of the alleged boycott.  Her injury was of a type that Congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the antitrust laws.  Respondent did not yield to Blue Shield's coercive pressure to induce its subscribers into selecting psychiatrists over psychologists for the services they required, but instead bore Blue Shield's sanction in the form of an increase in the net cost of her psychologist's services.

Syllabus 
Petitioner filed an action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 for declaratory or injunctive relief or damages, alleging that respondent employer had denied her employment opportunities solely on the basis of her race and sex.  The District Court granted respondent's motion to dismiss because petitioner had not exhausted available state administrative remedies.  The Court of Appeals vacated, holding that a  1983 plaintiff could be required to exhaust administrative remedies if certain specified conditions were met, and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether exhaustion would be appropriate in the instant case.
Held:  Exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to an action under  1983.  Pp.  457 U. S. 500-516.
(a) This conclusion is supported by the legislative histories of both  1983 and 42 U.S.C.  1997e (1976 ed., Supp. IV), which carves out a narrow exception to the general no-exhaustion rule established in this Court's prior decisions by creating a specific, limited exhaustion requirement for adult prisoners bringing actions pursuant to  1983.  A judicially imposed exhaustion requirement in cases other than adult prisoners' cases would be inconsistent with Congress' decision to adopt  1997e, would usurp policy judgments that Congress has reserved for itself, and would also be inconsistent with the detailed exhaustion scheme embodied in  1997e.  Pp.  457 U. S. 502-512.
(b) Even if, as respondent argues, an exhaustion requirement would lessen the burden that  1983 actions impose on federal courts, would further the goal of comity and improve federal-state relations, and would enable the state agency to enlighten the federal court's ultimate decision, these are policy considerations that alone cannot justify judicially imposed exhaustion unless exhaustion is consistent with congressional intent.  Moreover, difficult questions concerning the design and scope of an exhaustion requirement, which might be answered swiftly and surely by legislation, would create costly, remedy-delaying and court-burdening litigation if answered by the judiciary in the context of diverse constitutional claims relating to thousands of different state agencies.

Syllabus 
Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, held that the Fourth Amendment prohibits the police from making a warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect's home to make a routine felony arrest.  Before Payton was decided, respondent was arrested on a federal charge by Secret Service agents who had entered his home without an arrest warrant.  Subsequently, the Federal District Court denied respondent's pretrial motion to suppress incriminating statements he made after his arrest.  This evidence was admitted at his trial, and he was convicted.  While his case was still pending on direct appeal, Payton was decided.  On the strength of Payton, the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, holding that Payton applied retroactively.
Held:  A decision of this Court construing the Fourth Amendment is to be applied retroactively to all convictions that were not yet final at the time the decision was rendered, except where a case would be clearly controlled by existing retroactivity precedents.  Hence, Payton is to be applied retroactively to respondent's case.  Pp.  457 U. S. 542-563.
(a) Respondent's case does not present a retrospectivity problem clearly controlled by existing precedent.  Where a decision of this Court merely has applied settled principles to a new set of facts, it has been a foregone conclusion that the rule of the later case applies in earlier cases.

No. 80-1608
Argued February 24, 1982
Decided June 21, 1982
457 U.S. 537

Syllabus 
Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, held that the Fourth Amendment prohibits the police from making a warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect's home to make a routine felony arrest.  Before Payton was decided, respondent was arrested on a federal charge by Secret Service agents who had entered his home without an arrest warrant.  Subsequently, the Federal District Court denied respondent's pretrial motion to suppress incriminating statements he made after his arrest.  This evidence was admitted at his trial, and he was convicted.  While his case was still pending on direct appeal, Payton was decided.  On the strength of Payton, the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, holding that Payton applied retroactively.
Held:  A decision of this Court construing the Fourth Amendment is to be applied retroactively to all convictions that were not yet final at the time the decision was rendered, except where a case would be clearly controlled by existing retroactivity precedents.  Hence, Payton is to be applied retroactively to respondent's case.  Pp.  457 U. S. 542-563.
(a) Respondent's case does not present a retrospectivity problem clearly controlled by existing precedent.  Where a decision of this Court merely has applied settled principles to a new set of facts, it has been a foregone conclusion that the rule of the later case applies in earlier cases.  Conversely, where the Court has declared a rule of criminal procedure to be ""a clear break with the past,"" it almost invariably has found the new principle nonretroactive.  Also, this Court has recognized full retroactivity as a necessary adjunct to a ruling that a trial court lacked authority to convict or punish the defendant in the first place.  Respondent's case does not fit any of these categories, as Payton did not apply settled precedent to a new set of facts, did not announce an entirely new and unanticipated principle of law, and did not hold either that the trial court lacked authority to convict Payton or that the Fourth Amendment immunized his conduct from punishment.

Argued March 24, 1982

457 U.S. 569

Syllabus 
Section 1903(f) of the Social Security Act provides that federal reimbursement to States electing to provide Medicaid benefits to the ""medically needy"" is available only if the income of those persons, after deduction of incurred medical expenses, is less than 133 1/3% of the state Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) payment level.  Section 1903(f) specifically excepts from this rule the ""categorically needy"" -- those receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) because of lack of income to meet their basic needs.  As applied in Massachusetts,  1903(f) results in a distribution of Medicaid benefits to recipients of SSI that is more generous than the distribution of such benefits to persons who are self-supporting.  Appellees, each of whom (or his spouse) receives Social Security benefits in an amount that renders him ineligible for either SSI benefits or state supplementary payments, filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that  1903(f), as applied in Massachusetts, violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  Appellees asserted that, since 133 1/3% of the Massachusetts AFDC payment level is for them lower than the SSI payment level, they are ineligible for Medicaid until their income, after deduction of incurred medical expenses, is less than that of SSI payment recipients, and that, because of the Social Security benefits which they receive, appellees thus have less income available for nonmedical expenses than individuals who -- possibly because they never worked and receive no Social Security benefits -- are dependent upon public assistance for support.  The District Court entered judgment for appellees.
Held:
1. There is no merit to appellees' contention that the Social Security Act itself compels the conclusion that, if Medicaid services are provided to the ""medically needy,"" those persons may not be forced to incur medical expenses that would reduce their remaining income below the applicable public assistance standard.  The legislative history of the Medicaid provisions of the Act does not justify a departure from the literal and clear language of  1903(f).  Nor does 1903(f)'s literal language conflict with any other provision of the Act.  Moreover, adherence to that section's 
Page 457 U. S. 570
 language is consistent with its interpretation by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  Thus, the discrimination challenged in this case is required by the Social Security Act.  Pp.  457 U. S. 584-588.
2. As applied in Massachusetts,  1903(f) does not violate constitutional principles of equal treatment.  While powerful equities support appellees' claim of unfair treatment insofar as they receive less medical assistance and have less income remaining for their nonmedical needs than do SSI recipients, a belief that an Act of Congress may be inequitable or unwise is an insufficient basis on which to conclude that it is unconstitutional.  The optional character of the congressional scheme -- whereby participating States must provide Medicaid benefits to the categorically needy but may elect not to provide any benefits at all to the medically needy -- does not itself violate constitutional principles of equality.  Since a State may deny all benefits to the medically needy -- while providing benefits to the categorically needy and rendering some persons who are on public assistance better off than others who are not -- it may narrow the gap between the two classes by providing partial benefits to the medically needy even though certain members of that class may remain in a position less fortunate than those on public assistance.  The fact that Massachusetts has provided Medicaid benefits to the medically needy does not force it to make immediate medical need the sole standard in its entire Medicaid program.  Pp.  457 U.

Syllabus 
Held:  The United States, not California, has title to oceanfront land created through accretion, resulting from construction of a jetty, to land owned by the United States on the coast of California.  Pp.  457 U. S. 278-288.
(a) A dispute over accretions to oceanfront land where title rests with or was derived from the Federal Government is to be determined by federal law.  Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S. 290; Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe, 442 U. S. 653.  Under federal law, accretion, whatever its cause, belongs to the upland owner.  Pp.  457 U. S. 278-283.
(b) This is not a case where, as a matter of choice of law, state law should be borrowed and applied as the federal rule for deciding the substantive legal issue.  Congress addressed the issue of accretions to federal land in the Submerged Lands Act, which vested title in the States to the lands underlying the territorial sea and confirmed the title of the States to the tidelands up to the line of mean high tide, but which, in  5, withheld from the grant to the States all ""accretions"" to coastal lands acquired or reserved by the United States.  In light of this latter provision, borrowing for federal law purposes a state rule that would divest federal ownership is foreclosed.  Moreover, this is not a case in which federal common law must be created, since it has long been settled under federal law that the right to future accretions is an inherent and essential attribute of the littoral or riparian owner.  Pp.  457 U. S. 283-285.
(c) Only land underneath inland waters was included in the initial grant to the States under the equal-footing doctrine, United States v. California, 332 U. S. 19, and hence California cannot properly claim that title to the land in question here was vested in the State by that doctrine and confirmed by the Submerged Lands Act.  The latter Act was a constitutional exercise of Congress' power to dispose of federal property and ""did not impair the validity"" of the United States v. California decision, United States v. Louisiana, 363 U. S. 1,  363 U. S. 7,  363 U. S. 20.  To accept California's argument would require rejecting not only Hughes, supra, but also the established federal rule that accretions belong to the upland owner.  Pp.  457 U. S. 285-286.
(d) Section 2(a)(3) of the Submerged Lands Act, defining ""lands beneath navigable waters"" that fall within the Act's general grant to the 
Page 457 U. S. 274
 States as including all ""made"" lands that formerly were lands beneath navigable water, does not apply to the gradual process by which sand accumulated along the shore, although caused by a jetty.  To the extent that accretions are to be considered ""made"" land, they would fall within the reservation by the United States in the Act of ""all lands filled in, built up, or otherwise reclaimed by the United States for its own use.""  In any event,  5(a) of the Act expressly withholds from the grant to the States all ""accretions"" to lands reserved by the United States.  Pp.  457 U. S. 286-288.
(e) Section 3(a) of the Submerged Lands Act, confirming the title of persons who, on June 5, 1950, were entitled to lands beneath navigable water ""under the law of the respective states in which the land is located,"" means nothing more than that state law determines the proper beneficiary of the grant of land under the Act.

No. 80-1417
Argued January 13, 1982
Decided June 18, 1982
457 U.S. 291

Syllabus 
Respondents, present or former mental patients at a Massachusetts state hospital, instituted a class action against petitioner officials and staff of the hospital in Federal District Court, alleging that forcible administration of antipsychotic drugs to patients violated rights protected by the Federal Constitution.  The court held that mental patients enjoy constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests in deciding for themselves whether to submit to drug therapy; that, under state law, an involuntary commitment provides no basis for an inference of legal ""incompetency"" to make such decision; and that, without consent either by the patient or the guardian of a patient who has been adjudicated incompetent, the patient's liberty interests may be overridden only in an emergency.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.  It agreed with the District Court's first two holdings above, but reached different conclusions as to the circumstances under which state interests might override the patient's liberty interests.  The Court of Appeals reserved to the District Court, on remand, the task of developing mechanisms to ensure adequate procedural protection of the patient's interests.  This Court granted certiorari to determine whether an involuntarily committed mental patient has a constitutional right to refuse treatment with antipsychotic drugs.  Shortly thereafter, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled on the rights -- under both Massachusetts common law and the Federal Constitution -- of a nonintitutionalized incompetent mental patient as to involuntary treatment with antipsychotic drugs.
Held:  The Court of Appeals' judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for that court's consideration, in the first instance, of whether the correct disposition of this case is affected by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's intervening decision.  Pp.  457 U. S. 298-306.
(a) Assuming (as the parties agree) that the Constitution recognizes a liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs, a substantive issue remains as to the definition of that protected constitutional interest, as well as identification of the conditions under which competing state interests might outweigh it.  There is also a procedural issue concerning the minimum procedures required by the Constitution

Syllabus 
Respondents, present or former mental patients at a Massachusetts state hospital, instituted a class action against petitioner officials and staff of the hospital in Federal District Court, alleging that forcible administration of antipsychotic drugs to patients violated rights protected by the Federal Constitution.  The court held that mental patients enjoy constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests in deciding for themselves whether to submit to drug therapy; that, under state law, an involuntary commitment provides no basis for an inference of legal ""incompetency"" to make such decision; and that, without consent either by the patient or the guardian of a patient who has been adjudicated incompetent, the patient's liberty interests may be overridden only in an emergency.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.  It agreed with the District Court's first two holdings above, but reached different conclusions as to the circumstances under which state interests might override the patient's liberty interests.  The Court of Appeals reserved to the District Court, on remand, the task of developing mechanisms to ensure adequate procedural protection of the patient's interests.  This Court granted certiorari to determine whether an involuntarily committed mental patient has a constitutional right to refuse treatment with antipsychotic drugs.  Shortly thereafter, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled on the rights -- under both Massachusetts common law and the Federal Constitution -- of a nonintitutionalized incompetent mental patient as to involuntary treatment with antipsychotic drugs.
Held:  The Court of Appeals' judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for that court's consideration, in the first instance, of whether the correct disposition of this case is affected by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's intervening decision.  Pp.  457 U. S. 298-306.
(a) Assuming (as the parties agree) that the Constitution recognizes a liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs, a substantive issue remains as to the definition of that protected constitutional interest, as well as identification of the conditions under which competing state interests might outweigh it.  There is also a procedural issue concerning the minimum procedures required by the Constitution

Syllabus 
Respondent, who is mentally retarded, was involuntarily committed to a Pennsylvania state institution.  Subsequently, after becoming concerned about injuries which respondent had suffered at the institution, his mother filed an action as his next friend in Federal District Court for damages under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioner institution officials.  She claimed that respondent had constitutional rights to safe conditions of confinement, freedom from bodily restraint, and training or ""habilitation"" and that petitioners knew, or should have known, about his injuries, but failed to take appropriate preventive procedures, thus violating his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  In the ensuing jury trial, the District Court instructed the jury on the assumption that the Eighth Amendment was the proper standard of liability, and a verdict was returned for petitioners, on which judgment was entered.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the Fourteenth, rather than the Eighth, Amendment provided the proper constitutional basis for the asserted rights.
Held:  Respondent has constitutionally protected liberty interests under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to reasonably safe conditions of confinement, freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints, and such minimally adequate training as reasonably may be required by these interests.  Whether respondent's constitutional rights have been violated must be determined by balancing these liberty interests against the relevant state interests.  The proper standard for determining whether the State has adequately protected such rights is whether professional judgment, in fact, was exercised.  And in determining what is ""reasonable,"" courts must show deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional, whose decision is presumptively valid.  Pp.  457 U. S. 314-325.

No. 80-419
Argued November 4, 1981
Decided June 18, 1982
457 U.S. 332

Syllabus 
Respondent foundations for medical care were organized by respondent Maricopa County Medical Society and another medical society to promote fee-for-service medicine and to provide the community with a competitive alternative to existing health insurance plans.  The foundations, by agreement of their member doctors, established the maximum fees the doctors may claim in full payment for health services provided to policyholders of specified insurance plans.  Petitioner State of Arizona filed a complaint against respondents in Federal District Court, alleging that they were engaged in an illegal price-fixing conspiracy in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  The District Court denied the State's motion for partial summary judgment, but certified for interlocutory appeal the question whether the maximum fee agreements were illegal per se under  1 of the Sherman Act.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of the motion for partial summary judgment and held that the certified question could not be answered without evaluating the purpose and effect of the agreements at a full trial.
Held:  The maximum fee agreements, as price-fixing agreements, are per se unlawful under  1 of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  457 U. S. 342-357.
(a) The agreements do not escape condemnation under the per se rule against price-fixing agreements because they are horizontal and fix maximum prices.  Horizontal agreements to fix maximum prices are on the same legal -- even if not economic -- footing as agreements to fix minimum or uniform prices.  Kiefer-Stwart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211; Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U. S. 145.  The per se rule is violated here by a price restraint that tends to provide the same economic rewards to all practitioners regardless of their skill, experience, training, or willingness to employ innovative and difficult procedures in individual cases.  Such a restraint may also discourage entry into the market, and may deter experimentation and new developments by individual entrepreneurs.  P.  457 U. S. 348.
(b) Nor does the fact that doctors, rather than nonprofessionals, are the parties to the price-fixing agreements preclude application of the per se rule.  Respondents do not claim that the quality of the professional services 
Page 457 U. S. 333
 their members provide is enhanced by the price restraint, Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, and National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679, distinguished, and their claim that the price restraint will make it easier for customers to pay does not distinguish the medical profession from any other provider of goods or services.  Pp.  457 U. S. 348-349.
(c) That the judiciary has had little antitrust experience in the health care industry is insufficient reason for not applying the per se rule here.  ""[T]he Sherman Act, so far as price-fixing agreements are concerned, establishes one uniform rule applicable to all industries alike.""  United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150,  310 U. S. 222.  Pp.  457 U. S. 349-351.
(d) The per se rule is not rendered inapplicable in this case for the alleged reason that the agreements in issue have procompetitive justification.  The anticompetitive potential in all price-fixing agreements justifies their facial invalidation even if procompetitive justifications are offered for some.  Even when respondents are given every benefit of doubt, the record in this case is not inconsistent with the presumption that respondents' agreements will not significantly enhance competition.  The most that can be said for having doctors fix the maximum prices is that doctors may be able to do it more efficiently than insurers, but there is no reason to believe any savings that might accrue from this arrangement would be sufficiently great to affect the competitiveness of these kinds of insurance plans.  Pp.  457 U. S. 351-354.
(e) Respondents' maximum fee schedules do not involve price-fixing in only a literal sense.  Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, distinguished.  As agreements among independent competing entrepreneurs, they fit squarely into the horizontal price-fixing mold.  Pp.  457 U. S. 355-357.

Syllabus 
After initially expressing an interest in plea bargaining on misdemeanor charges, respondent decided not to plead guilty and requested a trial by jury.  While the misdemeanor charges were still pending, he was indicted and convicted in Federal District Court on a felony charge arising out of the same incident as the misdemeanor charges.  Respondent moved to set aside the verdict on the ground of prosecutorial vindictiveness, contending that the felony indictment gave rise to an impermissible appearance of retaliation.  The District Court denied the motion.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although the prosecutor did not act with actual vindictiveness in seeking a felony indictment, the Due Process Clause prohibits the Government from bringing more serious charges against the defendant after he has invoked his right to a jury trial, unless the prosecutor comes forward with objective evidence that the increased charges could not have been brought before the defendant exercised his right.  Believing that the circumstances surrounding the felony indictment gave rise to a genuine risk of retaliation, the court adopted a legal presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness.
Held:  A presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness was not warranted in this case, and absent such a presumption, no due process violation was established.  Pp.  457 U. S. 372-384.
(a) In cases in which action detrimental to a defendant has been taken after the exercise of a legal right, the presumption of an improper vindictive motive has been applied only where a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness existed.  North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711; Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S. 21.  Cf. Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S. 357.  Pp.  457 U. S. 372-380.
(b) A change in the prosecutor's charging decision made after an initial trial is completed is much more likely to be improperly motivated than is a pretrial decision.  It is unrealistic to assume that a prosecutor's probable response to such pretrial motions as to be tried by a jury is to seek to penalize and to deter.  Here, the timing of the prosecutor's action suggests that a presumption of vindictiveness was not warranted.  A prosecutor should remain free before trial to exercise his discretion to determine the extent of the societal interest in the prosecution.  The initial 
Page 457 U. S. 369
 charges filed by a prosecutor may not reflect the extent to which an individual is legitimately subject to prosecution.  Bordenkircher, supra.  Pp.  457 U. S. 380-382.
(c) The nature of the right asserted by respondent confirms that a presumption of vindictiveness was not warranted in this case.  The mere fact that a defendant refuses to plead guilty and forces the government to prove its case is insufficient to warrant a presumption that subsequent changes in the charging decision are unwarranted.  Bordenkircher, supra.  Pp.  457 U. S. 382-383.
(d) The fact that respondent, as opposed to having a bench trial, requested a jury trial does not compel a special presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness whenever additional charges are thereafter brought.  While there may have been an opportunity for vindictiveness here, a mere opportunity for vindictiveness is insufficient to justify the imposition of a prophylactic rule.  The possibility that a prosecutor would respond to a defendant's pretrial demand for a jury trial by bringing charges not in the public interest that could be explained only as a penalty imposed on the defendant is so unlikely that a presumption of vindictiveness is certainly not warranted.

Syllabus 
The Federal Unemployment Tax Act established a cooperative federal-state scheme to provide benefits to unemployed workers.  The Act requires employers to pay an excise tax on wages paid to employees in ""covered"" employment, but entitles them to a credit on the federal tax for contributions paid into federally approved state unemployment compensation programs.  The Act, in 26 U.S.C.  3309(b), exempts from mandatory state coverage employees of, inter alia,
""an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes and which is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches.""
A number of California churches and religious schools, including religious schools unaffiliated with any church, brought suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the Secretary of Labor from conditioning his approval of the California unemployment insurance program on its coverage of plaintiffs' employees, and to enjoin the State from collecting both tax information and the state unemployment compensation tax.  The District Court conducted various proceedings and issued several opinions and orders extending over almost a year and a half, in one of which proceedings it rejected the Federal Government's argument that the court was barred from granting injunctive relief by the Tax Injunction Act, which provides that district courts ""shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain"" the assessment or collection of any state tax where ""a plain, speedy and efficient remedy"" may be had in the courts of such State.  Ultimately, as pertinent here, on the ground that the benefit entitlement decisions for employees of the religious schools unaffiliated with churches risked excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the court permanently enjoined the state defendants from collecting unemployment taxes from such schools, but did not issue an injunction against the federal defendants as to the schools, because it had no information as to 
Page 457 U. S. 394
 what response the Secretary of Labor would make to the court's conclusion that the state defendants could not constitutionally impose state unemployment taxes on the employees of such schools.  The court said that, if the Secretary instituted decertification proceedings against California for failing to collect the taxes on behalf of such employees, the parties could apply to the court for further relief.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction to hear these appeals under 28 U.S.C.  1252, which permits appeals to this Court from a federal court judgment holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional in any civil action to which the United States or any of its agencies, or any officer or employee thereof, is a party.  While the District Court did not expressly hold  3309(b) unconstitutional as applied to religious schools unaffiliated with churches, the effect of its several opinions and orders was to make ""the United States or its officers . . . bound by a holding of unconstitutionality.""  McLucas v. DeChamplain, 421 U. S. 21,  421 U. S. 31.  Pp.  457 U. S. 404-407.
2. The Tax Injunction Act deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief.  Pp.  457 U. S. 407-419.
(a) That Act prohibits declaratory as well as injunctive relief.  Because the declaratory judgment procedure ""may in every practical sense operate to suspend collection of the state taxes until the litigation is ended,"" Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U. S. 293,  319 U. S. 299, the very language of the Act -- ""suspend or restrain"" the assessment or collection of state taxes -- suggests that a district court is prohibited from issuing declaratory relief in state tax cases.  Moreover, because there is little practical difference between injunctive and declaratory relief, it is unlikely that Congress intended to prohibit taxpayers from seeking one form of relief, while permitting them to seek another, thereby defeating the principal purpose of the Tax Injunction Act ""to limit drastically"" federal court interference with the assessment and collection of state taxes.  Pp.  457 U. S. 407-411.

(c) Here, because the taxpayers in question could seek a refund of their state unemployment insurance taxes through state administrative and judicial procedures, and thereby obtain state judicial review of their constitutional claims, their remedy under state law was ""plain, speedy and efficient"" within the meaning of the Tax Injunction Act.  There is no merit to the taxpayers' argument that the California refund procedures 
Page 457 U. S. 395
 did not constitute a ""plain, speedy and efficient remedy"" because their First Amendment claims could be effectively remedied only by injunctive relief, and that such relief was unavailable in California.  First, under California procedures, the taxpayers should be able to challenge the constitutionality of the unemployment tax in state court before extensive entanglement occurs, and state tax collection agencies can be expected to abide by resulting state court rulings.  Second, to the extent that any entanglement occurs before state review of the constitutional questions, that entanglement would not be reduced by seeking relief instead in the federal courts.

			"|"California v. Grace Brethren Church
No. 81-31
Argued March 30, 1982
Decided June 18, 1982*
457 U.S. 393

Syllabus 
The Federal Unemployment Tax Act established a cooperative federal-state scheme to provide benefits to unemployed workers.  The Act requires employers to pay an excise tax on wages paid to employees in ""covered"" employment, but entitles them to a credit on the federal tax for contributions paid into federally approved state unemployment compensation programs.  The Act, in 26 U.S.C.  3309(b), exempts from mandatory state coverage employees of, inter alia,
""an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes and which is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches.""
A number of California churches and religious schools, including religious schools unaffiliated with any church, brought suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the Secretary of Labor from conditioning his approval of the California unemployment insurance program on its coverage of plaintiffs' employees, and to enjoin the State from collecting both tax information and the state unemployment compensation tax.  The District Court conducted various proceedings and issued several opinions and orders extending over almost a year and a half, in one of which proceedings it rejected the Federal Government's argument that the court was barred from granting injunctive relief by the Tax Injunction Act, which provides that district courts ""shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain"" the assessment or collection of any state tax where ""a plain, speedy and efficient remedy"" may be had in the courts of such State.  Ultimately, as pertinent here, on the ground that the benefit entitlement decisions for employees of the religious schools unaffiliated with churches risked excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the court permanently enjoined the state defendants from collecting unemployment taxes from such schools, but did not issue an injunction against the federal defendants as to the schools, because it had no information as to 
Page 457 U. S. 394
 what response the Secretary of Labor would make to the court's conclusion that the state defendants could not constitutionally impose state unemployment taxes on the employees of such schools.  The court said that, if the Secretary instituted decertification proceedings against California for failing to collect the taxes on behalf of such employees, the parties could apply to the court for further relief.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction to hear these appeals under 28 U.S.C.  1252, which permits appeals to this Court from a federal court judgment holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional in any civil action to which the United States or any of its agencies, or any officer or employee thereof, is a party.  While the District Court did not expressly hold  3309(b) unconstitutional as applied to religious schools unaffiliated with churches, the effect of its several opinions and orders was to make ""the United States or its officers . . . bound by a holding of unconstitutionality.""  McLucas v. DeChamplain, 421 U. S. 21,  421 U. S. 31.  Pp.  457 U. S. 404-407.
2. The Tax Injunction Act deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief.  Pp.  457 U. S. 407-419.

No. 80-2070
Argued April 26, 1982
Decided June 15, 1982*
457 U.S. 176

Syllabus 
Petitioner Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc., is a New York corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of a Japanese general trading company.  Past and present female secretarial employees of Sumitomo, who, with one exception, are United States citizens, brought a class action in Federal District Court against Sumitomo, claiming that its alleged practice of hiring only male Japanese citizens to fill executive, managerial, and sales positions violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Sumitomo moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that its practices were protected under Art. VIII(1) of the Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaty between the United States and Japan.  Article VIII(1) provides that the
""companies of either Party shall be permitted to engage, within the territories of the other Party, accountants and other technical experts, executive personnel, attorneys, agents and other specialists of their choice.""
Article XXII(3) of the Treaty defines ""companies"" as ""[c]ompanies constituted under the applicable laws and regulations within the territories of either Party.""  The District Court refused to dismiss, holding that, because Sumitomo was incorporated in the United States, it was not covered by Art. VIII(1), but the court then certified for interlocutory appeal to the Court of Appeals the question whether the terms of the Treaty exempted Sumitomo from Title VII's provisions.  The Court of Appeals reversed in part, holding that Art. VIII(1) was intended to cover locally incorporated subsidiaries of foreign companies, but that the Treaty language did not insulate Sumitomo's employment practices from Title VII scrutiny.
Held:  Sumitomo is not a company of Japan, and thus is not covered by Art. VIII(1) of the Treaty.  Pp.  457 U. S. 180-189.
(a) Under Art. XXII(3)'s literal language, Sumitomo is a company of the United States, since it was ""constituted under the applicable laws and regulations"" of New York.  As a company of the United States, it cannot invoke the rights provided in Art. VIII(1), which are available only to companies of Japan operating in the United States and to companies

 of the United States operating in Japan.  Where both parties to the Treaty agree with this meaning and such interpretation follows from the clear Treaty language, deference will be given to it, absent extraordinarily strong contrary evidence.  Pp.  457 U. S. 180-185.
(b) Adherence to the Treaty language does not overlook the Treaty's purpose, since the primary purpose of the corporation provisions was to give corporations of each signatory legal status in the territory of the other party and to allow them to conduct business in the other country on a comparable basis with domestic firms.  Pp.  457 U. S. 185-189.

Syllabus 
Held:  A Texas statute which withholds from local school districts any state funds for the education of children who were not ""legally admitted"" into the United States, and which authorizes local school districts to deny enrollment to such children, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Pp.  457 U. S. 210-230.
(a) The illegal aliens who are plaintiffs in these cases challenging the statute may claim the benefit of the Equal Protection Clause, which provides that no State shall ""deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""  Whatever his status under the immigration laws, an alien is a ""person"" in any ordinary sense of that term.  This Court's prior cases recognizing that illegal aliens are ""persons"" protected by the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which Clauses do not include the phrase ""within its jurisdiction,"" cannot be distinguished on the asserted ground that persons who have entered the country illegally are not ""within the jurisdiction"" of a State even if they are present within its boundaries and subject to its laws.  Nor do the logic and history of the Fourteenth Amendment support such a construction.  Instead, use of the phrase ""within its jurisdiction"" confirms the understanding that the Fourteenth Amendment's protection extends to anyone, citizen or stranger, who is subject to the laws of a State, and reaches into every corner of a State's territory.  Pp.  457 U. S. 210-216.
(b) The discrimination contained in the Texas statute cannot be considered rational unless it furthers some substantial goal of the State.  Although undocumented resident aliens cannot be treated as a ""suspect class,"" and although education is not a ""fundamental right,"" so as to require the State to justify the statutory classification by showing that it serves a compelling governmental interest, nevertheless the Texas statute imposes a lifetime hardship on a discrete class of children not accountable for their disabling status.  These children can neither affect their parents' conduct nor their own undocumented status.  The deprivation 
Page 457 U. S. 203
 of public education is not like the deprivation of some other governmental benefit.  Public education has a pivotal role in maintaining the fabric of our society and in sustaining our political and cultural heritage; the deprivation of education takes an inestimable toll on the social, economic, intellectual, and psychological wellbeing of the individual, and poses an obstacle to individual achievement.  In determining the rationality of the Texas statute, its costs to the Nation and to the innocent children may properly be considered.  Pp.  457 U. S. 216-224.
(c) The undocumented status of these children vel non does not establish a sufficient rational basis for denying them benefits that the State affords other residents.  It is true that, when faced with an equal protection challenge respecting a State's differential treatment of aliens, the courts must be attentive to congressional policy concerning aliens.  But in the area of special constitutional sensitivity presented by these cases, and in the absence of any contrary indication fairly discernible in the legislative record, no national policy is perceived that might justify the State in denying these children an elementary education.  Pp.  457 U. S. 224-226.
(d) Texas' statutory classification cannot be sustained as furthering its interest in the ""preservation of the state's limited resources for the education of its lawful residents.""  While the State might have an interest in mitigating potentially harsh economic effects from an influx of illegal immigrants, the Texas statute does not offer an effective method of dealing with the problem.  Even assuming that the net impact of illegal aliens on the economy is negative, charging tuition to undocumented children constitutes an ineffectual attempt to stem the tide of illegal immigration, at least when compared with the alternative of prohibiting employment of illegal aliens.  Nor is there any merit to the suggestion that undocumented children are appropriately singled out for exclusion because of the special burdens they impose on the State's ability to provide high-quality public education.  The record does not show that exclusion of undocumented children is likely to improve the overall quality of education in the State.  Neither is there any merit to the claim that undocumented children are appropriately singled out because their unlawful presence within the United States renders them less likely than other children to remain within the State's boundaries and to put their education to productive social or political use within the State.

Syllabus 
A 1964 Mississippi statute provides that boards of trustees of municipal separate school districts in the State shall consist of five members, and that in any county in which a district embraces the entire county ""in which Highways 14 and 15 intersect,"" one trustee shall be elected from each supervisors district.  The Louisville School District is coextensive with Winston County, Miss., which is the only county in which Highways 14 and 15 intersect.  Since 1960, the Louisville mayor and city aldermen appointed three of the five members of the District's Board of Trustees, and Winston County voters residing outside Louisville elected the other two members.  The county officials never implemented the 1964 statute.  Respondent Winston County voters filed an action against petitioner local officials in Mississippi Chancery Court seeking to enforce the 1964 statute.  The court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the statute violated the state constitutional bar against local legislation.  The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed and remanded, striking only the statute's reference to Highways 14 and 15 and upholding the remainder of the statute.  The Supreme Court, without comment, denied petitioners' petition for rehearing in which they argued for the first time that the Chancery Court could not implement the reformed statute until the change had been precleared under  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  On remand, the Chancery Court ordered an election pursuant to the redacted statute under procedures prescribed by the court, but directed petitioners to submit the election plan to the United States Attorney General for preclearance under  5 of the Voting Rights Act. The Attorney General subsequently objected to the plan, and the Chancery Court ultimately concluded that its order would remain in force subject to compliance with the Voting Rights Act.  Respondents once again appealed to the Supreme Court, which held that its prior decision was the law of the case and that the Chancery Court improperly conditioned the election on compliance with the Voting Rights Act.
Held:
1. The Mississippi Supreme Court's decision did not rest on independent and adequate state grounds so as to bar this Court's review of the federal issue.  Where the state court's first decision did not appear final when rendered, the court's subsequent reliance on the law of the case 
Page 457 U. S. 256
 does not prevent this Court from reviewing federal questions determined in the first appeal.  Nor does the fact that petitioners' reliance upon the Voting Rights Act issue for the first time in their petition for rehearing may have been untimely under a Mississippi procedural rule constitute an independent and adequate state ground barring this Court's review of the federal question, where it appears that, if Mississippi still follows such a rule, it does not do so ""strictly or regularly.""  Pp.  457 U. S. 261-265.
2. The Mississippi courts had the power to decide whether  5 of the Voting Rights Act applied to the change in election procedures sought by respondents, and must withhold further implementation of the disputed change until the parties demonstrate compliance with  5.  Both the language and purposes of the Act refute the notion that a state court asked to implement a change in the State's voting laws cannot inquire whether the change is subject to  5, but must ignore that circumstance and enter a decree violating federal law.  Section 14(b) of the Act, which provides that no court other than the District Court for the District of Columbia shall have jurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment pursuant to  5 governs only declaratory judgments approving proposed voting procedure changes.  And nothing in the provisions of  5, requiring an action under that section to be heard by a three-judge federal district court, or in the provisions of  12(f) of the Act, giving federal district courts jurisdiction of proceedings under that section, negates the presumption that, at least when the issue arises collaterally, state courts have the power to decide whether a proposed change in election procedures requires preclearance under  5.  Granting state courts such power helps to insure compliance with the preclearance scheme.  Pp.  457 U. S. 265-271.

Syllabus 
After Alaska amended its Constitution to establish a Permanent Fund into which the State must deposit at least 25% of its mineral income each year, the state legislature, in 1980, enacted a dividend program to distribute annually a portion of the Fund's earnings directly to the State's adult residents.  Under the plan, each adult resident receives one dividend unit for each year of residency subsequent to 1959, the first year of Alaska's statehood.  Appellants, residents of Alaska since 1978, brought an action in an Alaska state court challenging the statutory dividend distribution plan as violative of, inter alia, their right to equal protection guarantees.  The trial court granted summary judgment in appellants' favor, but the Alaska Supreme Court reversed and upheld the statute.
Held:  The Alaska dividend distribution plan violates the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  457 U. S. 58-65.
(a) Rather than imposing any threshold waiting period for entitlement to dividend benefits or establishing a test of bona fides of state residence, the dividend statute creates fixed, permanent distinctions between an ever-increasing number of classes of concededly bona fide residents based on how long they have lived in the State.  Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393; Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U. S. 250; Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330; and Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, distinguished.  When a state distributes benefits unequally, the distinctions it makes are subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, and generally a law will survive that scrutiny if the distinctions rationally further a legitimate state purpose.  Pp.  457 U. S. 58-61.
(b) Alaska has shown no valid state interests that are rationally served by the distinctions it makes between citizens who established residence before 1959 and those who have become residents since then.  Neither the State's claimed interest in creating a financial incentive for individuals to establish and maintain residence in Alaska nor its claimed interest in assuring prudent management of the Permanent Fund is rationally related to such distinctions.  And the State's interest in rewarding citizens for past contributions is not a legitimate state purpose.  Alaska's reasoning could open the door to state apportionment of other rights, benefits, and services according to length of residency, and would 
Page 457 U. S. 56
 permit the states to divide citizens into expanding numbers of permanent classes.  Such a result would be clearly impermissible.  Pp.  457 U. S. 61-64.

Both Texas and California assert the right to levy state death taxes on the estate of Howard Hughes, the taxing officials of each State claiming that Hughes was domiciled in their State at the time of his death.  The administrator of the estate filed an action in Federal District Court under the Federal Interpleader Act, alleging that the respective state officials were seeking to tax the estate on the basis of inconsistent claims.  The District Court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because of the failure to satisfy the Act's requirement that there be diversity of citizenship between at least two adverse parties.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the requisite diversity was present between the administrator and the County Treasurer of Los Angeles County.  The court rejected the State's claim that, although the suit was nominally against state officials, it was in effect a suit against two sovereign States barred by the Eleventh Amendment.
Held:  The Eleventh Amendment bars the statutory interpleader action.  Worcester County Trust Co. v. Riley, 302 U. S. 292.  Contrary to the Court of Appeals' view, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, did not overrule Worcester County Trust Co.  Pp.  457 U. S. 89-91.

Syllabus 
Petitioner union amended its constitution to include an ""outsider rule"" which prohibits candidates for union office from accepting campaign contributions from nonmembers and creates a committee to enforce the rule, the committee's decisions being final and binding.  Respondents, including a union member who had been an unsuccessful candidate for union office before adoption of the outsider rule and had received much of the financial support for his campaign from sources outside the union, filed suit against petitioner in Federal District Court, claiming that the rule prohibited nonmember contributions to finance campaign-related litigation, and thus violated  101(a)(4) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA), which provides that a union may not limit the rights of its members to institute an action in any court or administrative agency.  The District Court found for respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing that the outsider rule violated  101(a)(4).  It also accepted respondents' argument, first raised on appeal, that the rule violated the ""freedom of speech and assembly"" provision of  101(a)(2) of the LMRDA giving every union member the right to assemble freely with other members and to express at union meetings his views about candidates in union elections or any business properly before the meeting.  The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's argument that the outsider rule was protected by  101(a)(2)'s proviso, which gives a union authority to adopt ""reasonable"" rules regarding its members' responsibilities.
Held:
1. Petitioner's outsider rule does not violate  101(a)(2).  Although it may interfere with rights Congress intended to protect, it is rationally related to a legitimate and protected purpose, and thus is sheltered by  101(a)(2)'s proviso.  Pp.  457 U. S. 108-119.
(a) In light of the legislative history,  101(a)(2) cannot be read as incorporating the entire body of First Amendment law so as to require that the scope of protections afforded union members by the statute coincide with the protections afforded by the Constitution as to a political election candidate's freedom to receive campaign contributions.  Union 
Page 457 U. S. 103
 rules are valid under the statute so long as they are reasonable; they need not pass the stringent tests applied in the First Amendment context.  Pp.  457 U. S. 108-111.
(b) Congress adopted the freedom of speech and assembly provision of  101(a)(2) in order to promote union democracy, particularly through fostering vigorous debate during election campaigns.  Although petitioner's outsider rule does affect rights protected by the statute, and may limit somewhat the ability of insurgent union members to wage an effective campaign against incumbent officers, as a practical matter, the impact may not be substantial.  The record shows that challengers have been able to defeat incumbents or administration-backed candidates despite the absence of financial support from nonmembers.  Pp.  457 U. S. 111-115.
(c) Petitioner's purpose in adopting the outsider rule was to ensure that nonmembers would not unduly influence union affairs, and that the union leadership would remain responsive to the membership.  The policies underlying the LMRDA show that this is a legitimate purpose that Congress meant to protect.  Nor is the rule invalid on the asserted ground that it is not rationally related to that purpose because the union could have simply established contribution ceilings, or need not have limited contributions by relatives and friends, or could have simply required that candidates reveal the sources of their funds.  Petitioner had a reasonable basis for its decision to impose a broad ban seeking to eradicate the threat of outside influence.  Pp.  457 U. S. 115-119.
2. Petitioner's outsider rule does not violate  101(a)(4)'s right-to-sue provision.  The rule simply does not apply where a member uses funds from outsiders to finance litigation.  Neither the rule's language nor the debates leading up to its passage indicate that petitioner intended the rule to apply in such context.  Moreover, petitioner's rule-enforcement committee issued an opinion stating that the rule's limitations
""do not apply to the financing of lawsuits by nonmembers for the purpose of asserting the legal rights of candidates or other union members in connection with elections.""

Appellees, who had been denied EA under these state provisions, brought a class action in Federal District Court to enjoin enforcement of the provisions, alleging that they conflicted with the SSA and violated equal protection.  Ultimately, on remand after its decision invalidating the state provisions under the Supremacy Clause had been vacated by the Court of Appeals, the District Court invalidated the no-cash provision as a violation of equal protection, but upheld the loss-or-theft provision.  On a second appeal, the Court of Appeals held that both provisions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:  Because the New York provisions conflict with a valid federal regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (Secretary) which proscribes inequitable treatment of individuals or groups under an EA program, they are invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.  457 U. S. 137-146.
(a) Reliance on the SSA to find the New York provisions invalid is not foreclosed by Quern v. Mandley, 436 U. S. 725.  While Quern emphasized that a State retains considerable flexibility in determining which emergencies to cover under its EA plan, it was not suggested that the Secretary was stripped of all authority to review a plan that arbitrarily or inequitably excluded a class of recipients.  Pp.  457 U. S. 138-139.
(b) The Secretary's decision to apply the ""equitable treatment"" regulation so as to forbid a State to exclude AFDC recipients from its EA program is eminently reasonable, and deserves judicial deference, especially where the legislative history leaves no doubt that AFDC recipients were expected to be included in a state EA program.

Syllabus 
After being denied a promotion by petitioner employer, respondent Mexican-American filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging that he had been passed over for promotion because of his national origin and that petitioner's promotion policy operated against Mexican-Americans as a class.  Subsequently, respondent received a right-to-sue letter from the Commission, and he then brought a class action in Federal District Court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Without conducting an evidentiary hearing, the District Court certified a class consisting of Mexican-American employees of petitioner and Mexican-American applicants who had not been hired.  As to liability, the court held that petitioner had discriminated against respondent in its promotion practices, but not in its hiring practices, and, with respect to the class, found that petitioner had discriminated against Mexican-Americans in its hiring practices, but not in its promotion practices.  Both parties appealed, and the Court of Appeals, rejecting petitioner's argument that the class had been defined too broadly, held that the District Court's class certification was proper under the Fifth Circuit's rule permitting any victim of racial discrimination in employment to maintain an ""across-the-board"" attack on all unequal employment practices allegedly followed by the employer pursuant to a policy of racial discrimination.  On the merits, the Court of Appeals upheld respondent's promotion claim, but held that the District Court's findings were insufficient to support recovery on behalf of the class.  Subsequently, this Court vacated the Court of Appeals' judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248.  The Court of Appeals then vacated its judgment as to respondent's promotion claim, but reinstated its approval of the District Court's class certification.
Held:  The District Court erred in permitting respondent to maintain a class action on behalf of both employees who were denied promotion and applicants who were denied employment.  Pp.  457 U. S. 155-161.
(a) An individual litigant seeking to maintain a class action under Title VII must meet Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)'s specified ""prerequisites of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.""  General Telephone Co. v. EEOC, 446 U. S. 318,  446 U. S. 330.  
Page 457 U. S. 148
 These requirements effectively ""limit the class claims to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiff's claim.""  Ibid.  Pp.  457 U. S. 155-157.
(b) There can be no disagreement with the proposition underlying the Fifth Circuit's ""across-the-board"" rule -- that racial discrimination is, by definition, class discrimination.  But the allegation that such discrimination has occurred neither determines whether a class action may be maintained in accordance with Rule 23 nor determines the class that may be certified.  Here, to bridge the gap between respondent's promotion claim and the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as respondent -- so that respondent's claim and the class claims share common questions of law or fact and respondent's claim is typical of the class claims -- respondent must prove much more than the validity of his own claim.  Respondent's complaint provided an insufficient basis for concluding that the adjudication of his claim would require the decision of any common question concerning petitioner's failure to hire more Mexican-Americans.  Without any specific presentation identifying the questions of law or fact that were common to the claims of respondent and of the class members he sought to represent, it was error for the District Court to presume that respondent's claim was typical of other claims against petitioner by Mexican-American employees and applicants.  Pp.  457 U. S. 157-159.
(c) As the District Court's bifurcated findings on liability demonstrate, the individual and class claims might as well have been tried separately.  Thus, it is clear that the maintenance of the action as a class action did not advance ""the efficiency and economy of litigation which is a principal purpose of the procedure.""

No. 88, Orig.
Decided June 14, 1982
457 U.S. 164

Syllabus 
Held:  California's motion for leave to file a bill of complaint seeking determination of whether Howard Hughes was domiciled in California or Texas at the time of his death is granted.
(a) The bill of complaint states a ""controversy"" between two States within this Court's exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1251(a).  California and Texas are undeniably adversaries in this action, since each State's authority to impose a death tax on the intangibles owned by a decedent depends on the decedent's having been a domiciliary of that State, and it is the law of each State that an individual has but one domicile.  Thus, the outcome of this action will determine which State is entitled to levy death taxes on the Hughes estate.  Moreover, California's allegations, although not yet proved, indicating that the estate was insufficient to satisfy the total amount of potential death tax claims by both States, are sufficient under Texas v. Florida, 306 U. S. 398, to characterize this case as a ""controversy"" between two States for purposes of  1251(a).
(b) It is appropriate that this Court exercise its jurisdiction in this case.  When California's previous motion for leave to file its complaint was denied,  437 U. S. 437 U.S. 601, several Members of the Court suggested that the need to exercise original jurisdiction might be obviated by an action in a federal district court, under the Federal Interpleader Act, to determine Hughes' domicile.  However, this Court's decision in Cory v. White, ante p.  457 U. S. 85, holds that such a statutory interpleader action cannot be brought.  Thus, the precondition of nonavailability of another forum, necessary for this Court's exercise of original jurisdiction, is met.

No. 81-328
Argued March 22, 1982
Decided June 7, 1982
457 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
A member of appellee Popular Democratic Party (hereafter appellee) who was elected in a 1980 general election to the Puerto Rico House of Representatives from District 31, died in 1981.  The Governor of Puerto Rico subsequently called for a ""by-election"" -- open to all qualified voters in District 31 -- to fill the vacancy.  Appellee then filed suit in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, alleging that the Puerto Rico statutes under which the Governor purported to act authorized only candidates and electors affiliated with appellee to participate in the by-election.  Appellants, qualified electors in District 31 who are not affiliated with appellee, intervened as defendants.  The court entered judgment for appellee.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court modified the Superior Court's judgment, holding, inter alia, that the pertinent statute, as properly construed, requires a by-election only if the party of the legislator vacating the seat fails to designate a replacement within 60 days after the vacancy occurs, and that, if the party selects a single candidate within such period, that candidate is declared ""automatically elected to fill the vacancy.""  The court rejected appellants' contention that this procedure violated the Federal Constitution.  While the case was pending before the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, appellee held a primary election in which only its members were permitted to participate, and which resulted in the selection of a person who, pursuant to the Supreme Court's mandate, was sworn in as the new representative from District 31.
Held:  The Puerto Rico statute, as interpreted by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court to vest in a political party the initial authority to appoint an 
Page 457 U. S. 2
 interim replacement for one of its members who vacates a position as a district senator or representative, does not violate the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  457 U. S. 5-14.
(a) The voting rights of Puerto Rico citizens are constitutionally protected to the same extent as those of all other United States citizens.  At the same time, Puerto Rico, like a state, is an autonomous political entity, ""sovereign over matters not ruled by the Constitution,""  Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U. S. 663,  416 U. S. 673, and the methods by which its people and their representatives have chosen to structure the Commonwealth's electoral system are entitled to substantial deference.  Pp.  457 U. S. 7-8.
(b) The right to vote, per se, is not a constitutionally protected right, and the Constitution does not compel a fixed method of choosing state or local officers or representatives.  While a citizen has a constitutionally protected right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other citizens in the jurisdiction when a state or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has provided that its representatives be elected, the Puerto Rico statute at issue does not restrict access to the electoral process or afford unequal treatment to different classes of voters, candidates, or political parties.  All qualified voters have an equal opportunity to select a district representative in the general election; and the interim appointment provision applies uniformly to all legislative vacancies, whenever they arise.  Cf. Valenti v. Rockefeller, 393 U. S. 405.  Moreover, the interim appointment system serves the legitimate purpose of ensuring that vacancies are filled promptly, without the necessity of the expense and inconvenience of a special election.  Pp.  457 U. S. 8-12.
(c) Nor is Puerto Rico's appointment mechanism rendered constitutionally defective by virtue of the fact that the interim appointment power is given to the political party with which the previous incumbent was affiliated.  The Puerto Rico Legislature could reasonably conclude that appointment by the previous incumbent's political party would more fairly reflect the will of the voters than appointment by the Governor or some other elected official, particularly where such official is a member of a different party.  And in light of Puerto Rico's special interest in ensuring minority representation in its legislature, it was not unreasonable for the legislature, in establishing the appointment system for filling vacancies, to make provision for continuity of party representation.  Pp.  457 U. S. 12-13.
(d) Appellants' rights of association and equal protection of the laws were not violated by their exclusion, because of their party affiliation, from appellee's special election held to select the interim representative.

457 U.S. 15

Syllabus 
Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 requires a state or local government to make arrangements to preserve transit workers' existing collective bargaining rights before that government may receive federal financial assistance for the acquisition of a privately owned transit company.  Petitioner city entered into a "" 13(c) agreement"" with respondent transit union in order to obtain federal funds to acquire a failing private bus company and convert it into petitioner Jackson Transit Authority.  Thereafter, the Authority's unionized workers were covered by a series of collective bargaining agreements.  In 1975, however, the Authority notified the union that it no longer considered itself bound by the newest of the collective bargaining agreements.  The union subsequently filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking damages and injunctive relief and alleging that petitioners had breached the  13(c) and collective bargaining agreements.  The District Court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the complaint rested on contract rights that should be enforced only in a state court.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that there was subject matter jurisdiction because the claim arose under a federal law, specifically  13(c), and that  13(c) implicitly provided a federal private right of action.
Held:  Section 13(c) does not provide the union with federal causes of action for alleged breaches of the  13(c) and collective bargaining agreements.  While  13(c)'s language supplies no definitive answer, the legislative history is conclusive that Congress intended that such agreements be governed by state law applied in state courts.  Congress designed  13(c) as a means to accommodate state law to collective bargaining, not as a means to substitute a federal law of collective bargaining for state labor law.  Pp.  457 U. S. 20-29.

			"|"Jackson Transit Authority v. Local Division 1285,
Amalgamated Transit Union, AFL-CIO-CLC
No. 81 111
Argued April 21, 1982
Decided June 7, 1982
457 U.S. 15

Syllabus 
Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 requires a state or local government to make arrangements to preserve transit workers' existing collective bargaining rights before that government may receive federal financial assistance for the acquisition of a privately owned transit company.  Petitioner city entered into a "" 13(c) agreement"" with respondent transit union in order to obtain federal funds to acquire a failing private bus company and convert it into petitioner Jackson Transit Authority.  Thereafter, the Authority's unionized workers were covered by a series of collective bargaining agreements.  In 1975, however, the Authority notified the union that it no longer considered itself bound by the newest of the collective bargaining agreements.  The union subsequently filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking damages and injunctive relief and alleging that petitioners had breached the  13(c) and collective bargaining agreements.  The District Court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the complaint rested on contract rights that should be enforced only in a state court.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that there was subject matter jurisdiction because the claim arose under a federal law, specifically  13(c), and that  13(c) implicitly provided a federal private right of action.
Held:  Section 13(c) does not provide the union with federal causes of action for alleged breaches of the  13(c) and collective bargaining agreements.  While  13(c)'s language supplies no definitive answer, the legislative history is conclusive that Congress intended that such agreements be governed by state law applied in state courts.  Congress designed  13(c) as a means to accommodate state law to collective bargaining, not as a means to substitute a federal law of collective bargaining for state labor law.  Pp.  457 U. S. 20-29.

No. 81-5114
Argued March 2, 1982
Decided June 7, 1982
457 U.S. 31

Syllabus 
Held:  Where the Florida Supreme Court's reversal of petitioner's murder and rape convictions at a jury trial was based on the weight of the evidence, a retrial is not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  457 U. S. 39-47.
(a) A reversal of a conviction based on the weight of the evidence, unlike a reversal based on insufficient evidence where the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a retrial, Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1; Greene . Massey, 437 U. S. 19, does not mean that acquittal was the only proper verdict.  Instead, the appellate court sits as a ""thirteenth juror"" and disagrees with the jury's resolution of the conflicting testimony.  Just as a deadlocked jury does not result in an acquittal barring retrial under the Double Jeopardy Clause, an appellate court's disagreement with the jurors' weighing of the evidence does not require the special deference accorded verdicts of acquittal.  Moreover, a reversal based on the weight of the evidence can occur only after the State has presented sufficient evidence to support conviction and has persuaded the jury to convict.  The reversal simply affords the defendant a second opportunity to seek an acquittal.  Giving him this second chance does not amount to governmental oppression of the sort against which the Double Jeopardy Clause was intended to protect.  Pp.  457 U. S. 39-44.
(b) There is no merit to petitioner's arguments that a distinction between the weight and sufficiency of the evidence is unworkable, and will undermine the Burks rule by encouraging appellate judges to base reversals on the weight, rather than the sufficiency, of the evidence.  Pp.  457 U. S. 44-45.

Syllabus 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2)(A) provides that a district court, as a sanction for failure to comply with discovery orders, may enter
""[a]n order that the matters regarding which the [discovery] order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order.""
Asserting diversity jurisdiction, respondent, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in the Republic of Guinea, filed suit against various insurance companies in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania to recover on a business interruption policy.  When certain of the defendants (a group of foreign insurance companies, including petitioners) raised the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction, respondent attempted to use discovery in order to establish jurisdictional facts.  After petitioners repeatedly failed to comply with the court's orders for production of the requested information, the court warned them that, unless they complied by a specified date, it would assume, pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(A), that it had personal jurisdiction.  When petitioners again failed to comply, the court imposed the sanction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that imposition of the sanction fell within the trial court's discretion under Rule 37(b)(2)(A) and that the sanction did not violate petitioners' due process rights.
Held:
1. Rule 37(b)(2)(A) may be applied to support a finding of personal jurisdiction without violating due process.  Unlike subject matter jurisdiction, which is an Art. III as well as a statutory requirement, the requirement that a court have personal jurisdiction flows from the Due Process Clause and protects an individual liberty interest.  Because it protects an individual interest, it may be intentionally waived, or, for various reasons, a defendant may be estopped from raising the issue.  Due process is violated by a rule establishing legal consequences of a failure to produce evidence only if the defendant's behavior will not support the presumption that
""the refusal to produce evidence material to the administration of due process was but an admission of the want of merit in 
Page 456 U. S. 695
 the asserted defense.""

2. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in applying Rule 37(b)(2)(A) in this case.

Syllabus 
As the result of a labor dispute between petitioner employer and respondent union, petitioner filed an unfair labor practice charge against the union, alleging that it had violated the secondary boycott and jurisdictional picketing prohibitions of  8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  The National Labor Relations Board (Board) found against the union, and the Board's order was judicially enforced.  Petitioner filed this action in Federal District Court pursuant to  303 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), seeking damages resulting from the union's illegal activity in an amount that included both business losses and attorney's fees incurred during the Board proceedings.  Section 303(a) makes it unlawful for a union to engage in conduct defined as an unfair labor practice under  8(b)(4) of the NLRA, and  303(b) provides that whoever is injured in his business or property because of a violation of  303(a) may sue in a federal district court ""and shall recover the damages by him sustained and the cost of the suit.""  The District Court entered judgment for petitioner, awarding it an amount that represented its business losses, but concluded that petitioner was not entitled to recover attorney's fees as part of its damages.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Attorney's fees incurred during Board proceedings are not a proper element of damages under  303(b) of the LMRA.  Pp.  456 U. S. 721-727.
(a) Neither the language nor the legislative history of  303 supports petitioner's contention that  303 provides statutory authorization for such attorney's fees for purposes of the American Rule that attorney's fees are not ordinarily recoverable in the absence of a statute or enforceable contract providing therefor.  The legislative history instead shows that Congress did not intend to expand the ordinary meaning of the term ""damages"" in  303(b) to include attorney's fees.  Cf. Teamsters v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252.  Pp.  456 U. S. 721-724.
(b) Nor can allowance of attorney's fees incurred during Board proceedings be justified on the asserted ground that it would further Congress' intent to protect employers from the adverse effects of a union's illegal secondary activity.  This interest is adequately protected by the 
Page 456 U. S. 718
 award of compensatory damages for the business losses resulting from the union's prohibited conduct.  Even assuming that attorney's fees are necessary to ""fully"" compensate the victimized employer, this justification alone is not sufficient to create an exception to the American Rule in the absence of express congressional authority.  Cf. F. D. Rich Co. v. United States ex rel. Industrial Lumber Co., 417 U. S. 116,  417 U. S. 128-129.  To adopt petitioner's analysis would authorize the recovery of attorney's fees in every case where the plaintiff has prevailed against the defendant in prior litigation involving the same issues.  Such a result is clearly barred by this Court's prior decisions and by the American Rule.  Pp.  456 U. S. 724-726.

Syllabus 
Respondent, while employed in a data processing position with petitioner Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), was selected for participation in the AAFES Executive Management Program (EMP).  A regulation provided that EMP status could be withdrawn for conduct off the job reflecting discredit upon the AAFES.  Respondent was discharged from the AAFES after pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges of violating state drug laws off the base.  His administrative appeal was denied.  While that appeal was pending before the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force, respondent filed suit against the AAFES in Federal District Court, alleging that his rights to due process and to a free and impartial appeal pursuant to AAFES regulations were infringed, and seeking reinstatement and damages, including backpay.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the Tucker Act, which gives the federal courts jurisdiction over certain suits against the United States founded upon express or implied contracts, provided a basis for jurisdiction over respondent's claims for monetary relief.  The court held that, whether or not respondent's employment was initiated by appointment or contract, the AAFES regulations governing separation procedures created an implied-in-fact contract that the AAFES would adhere to those regulations while respondent continued in AAFES employment, and that respondent's allegation that his dismissal violated those regulations was equivalent to an allegation of breach of an implied-in-fact contract.
Held:  The Tucker Act did not confer jurisdiction over respondent's claim for money damages.  Pp.  456 U. S. 733-741.
(a) Nothing in the record or relevant regulations indicates that respondent was employed pursuant to an express contract.  Rather, the evidence shows that he was appointed to his positions.  With respect to employment in the data processing position, regulations prohibited the AAFES from negotiating a contract with him, and his selection to the EMP clearly was pursuant to an appointment.  There is no reason to remand for an evidentiary hearing on the nature of respondent's employment status.  Pp.  456 U. S. 735-738.

(b) The Court of Appeals erred in implying a contract based solely on the AAFES personnel regulations and in premising Tucker Act jurisdiction on those regulations, which do not specifically authorize awards of money damages.  United States v. Testan, 424 U. S. 392, is controlling.  Moreover, Congress' intent to prohibit Back Pay Act claims by AAFES employees, as opposed to federal employees generally, would be subverted if an AAFES employee could sue under the Tucker Act whenever he asserted a violation of the AAFES regulations governing termination.  In fact, the Court of Appeals' reasoning would extend Tucker Act jurisdiction to reach any complaint filed by a federal employee alleging the violation of a personnel statute or regulation.

Syllabus 
The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) was enacted as part of a legislative package designed to combat the nationwide energy crisis.  To further this effort, Titles I and III of PURPA direct state utility regulatory commissions and nonregulated utilities to ""consider"" the adoption and implementation of specific ""rate design"" and regulatory standards, and require state commissions to follow certain notice and comment procedures when acting on proposed federal standards.  Section 210 of PURPA's Title II seeks to encourage the development of cogeneration and small power facilities, and directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in consultation with state regulatory authorities, to promulgate rules to carry out this goal.  Section 210 then requires the state authorities, after notice and hearing, to implement such rules, and authorizes the FERC to exempt cogeneration and small power facilities from certain state and federal regulations.  The State of Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Service Commission (appellees) brought an action in Federal District Court against the FERC and the Secretary of Energy (appellants), seeking a declaratory judgment that Titles I and III and  210 are unconstitutional because they exceed congressional power under the Commerce Clause and constitute an invasion of state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  The District Court so held and pronounced the challenged provisions void.
Held:
1. The challenged provisions are within Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  456 U. S. 753-758.
(a) To assert that PURPA is facially unconstitutional because it does not regulate ""commerce,"" or because it does not have ""a substantial effect"" on such activity, disregards the specific congressional finding in  2 of PURPA that the regulated activities do have an immediate effect on interstate commerce.  Pp.  456 U. S. 754-755.
(b) The legislative history amply supports the congressional conclusion that limited federal regulation of retail sales of electricity and natural gas, and of the relationships between cogenerators and electric utilities, was essential to protect interstate commerce and the Nation's economy.  Pp.  456 U. S. 756-758. 
Page 456 U. S. 743

2. The challenged provisions do not trench on state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  Pp.  456 U. S. 758-771.
(a) Insofar as  210 authorizes the FERC to exempt qualified power facilities from state laws and regulations, it does nothing more than preempt conflicting state enactments in the traditional way.  Because of the substantial interstate effect of such activity, Congress may preempt the States completely in the regulation of retail sales by electric and gas utilities and of transactions between such utilities and cogenerators.  With respect to  210's requirement that state authorities implement FERC's rules, the statute and its implementing regulations simply require state commissions to settle disputes arising under the statute, the very type of adjudicatory activity customarily engaged in by the Mississippi Public Service Commission.  Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386.  Pp.  456 U. S. 759-761.
(b) The ""mandatory consideration"" provisions of Titles I and III do not involve the compelled exercise of Mississippi's sovereign powers or set a mandatory agenda to be considered in all events by state legislative or administrative decisionmakers, but simply establish requirements for continued state activity in an otherwise preemptible field.  Cf. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264.  Pp.  456 U. S. 761-770.
(c) Similarly, the procedural requirements of Titles I and III do not compel the exercise of a State's sovereign power or purport to set standards to be followed in all areas of the state commission's endeavors.  If Congress may require a state administrative body to consider proposed federal regulations as a condition to its continued involvement in a preemptible field, it may require the use of certain procedural minima during that body's deliberations on the subject.

Decided June 1, 1982
456 U.S. 742

Syllabus 
The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) was enacted as part of a legislative package designed to combat the nationwide energy crisis.  To further this effort, Titles I and III of PURPA direct state utility regulatory commissions and nonregulated utilities to ""consider"" the adoption and implementation of specific ""rate design"" and regulatory standards, and require state commissions to follow certain notice and comment procedures when acting on proposed federal standards.  Section 210 of PURPA's Title II seeks to encourage the development of cogeneration and small power facilities, and directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in consultation with state regulatory authorities, to promulgate rules to carry out this goal.

456 U.S. 798

Syllabus 
Acting on information from an informant that a described individual was selling narcotics kept in the trunk of a certain car parked at a specified location, District of Columbia police officers immediately drove to the location, found the car there, and, a short while later, stopped the car and arrested the driver (respondent), who matched the informant's description.  One of the officers opened the car's trunk, found a closed brown paper bag, and after opening the bag, discovered glassine bags containing white powder (later determined to be heroin).  The officer then drove the car to headquarters, where another warrantless search of the trunk revealed a zippered leather pouch containing cash.  Respondent was subsequently convicted of possession of heroin with intent to distribute -- the heroin and currency found in the searches having been introduced in evidence after respondent's pretrial motion to suppress the evidence had been denied.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, while the officers had probable cause to stop and search respondent's car -- including its trunk -- without a warrant, they should not have opened either the paper bag or the leather pouch found in the trunk without first obtaining a warrant.
Held:  Police officers who have legitimately stopped an automobile and who have probable cause to believe that contraband is concealed somewhere within it may conduct a warrantless search of the vehicle that is as thorough as a magistrate could authorize by warrant.  Pp.  456 U. S. 804-825.
(a) The ""automobile exception"" to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement established in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, applies to searches of vehicles that are supported by probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband.  In this class of cases, a search is not unreasonable if based on objective facts that would justify the issuance of a warrant, even though a warrant has not actually been obtained.  Pp.  456 U. S. 804-809.
(b) However, the rationale justifying the automobile exception does not apply so as to permit a warrantless search of any movable container that is believed to be carrying an illicit substance and that is found in a public place even when the container is placed in a vehicle (not otherwise believed to be carrying contraband).  United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1; Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753.  Pp.  456 U. S. 809-814. 
Page 456 U. S. 799

(c) Where police officers have probable cause to search an entire vehicle, they may conduct a warrantless search of every part of the vehicle and its contents, including all containers and packages, that may conceal the object of the search.  The scope of the search is not defined by the nature of the container in which the contraband is secreted.  Rather, it is defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.  For example, probable cause to believe that undocumented aliens are being transported in a van will not justify a warrantless search of a suitcase.  Pp.  456 U. S. 817-824.
(d) The doctrine of stare decisis does not preclude rejection here of the holding in Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420, and some of the reasoning in Arkansas v. Sanders, supra.  Pp.  456 U. S. 824-825.

Syllabus 
Respondent manufactured and marketed the patented prescription drug cyclandelate to wholesalers, retail pharmacists, and hospitals in colored capsules under the registered trademark CYCLOSPASMOL.  After respondent's patent expired, several generic drug manufacturers, including petitioner manufacturers, began marketing the drug, intentionally copying the appearance of the CYCLOSPASMOL capsules.  Respondent then brought an action against petitioner manufacturers and wholesalers in Federal District Court under, inter alia,  32 of the Trademark Act of 1946, alleging that some pharmacists had dispensed generic drugs mislabeled as CYCLOSPASMOL and that petitioners' use of look-alike capsules and catalog entries comparing prices and revealing the colors of generic capsules contributed to the pharmacists' mislabeling.  Respondent sought injunctive relief and damages.  The District Court entered judgment for petitioners, finding that, although the pharmacists had violated  32, respondent had not made the necessary factual showing that petitioners had intentionally induced the pharmacists to mislabel generic drugs or continued to supply cyclandelate to pharmacists who the petitioners knew or should have known were mislabeling generic drugs.  The Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the District Court's findings and holding that the District Court failed to give sufficient weight to the evidence respondent offered to show a pattern of illegal substitution and mislabeling.  After completing its own review of the evidence, the Court of Appeals further held that the evidence was ""clearly sufficient to establish a  32 violation.""
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in setting aside the District Court's findings of fact.  Pp.  456 U. S. 853-858.
(a) In reviewing such findings, the Court of Appeals was bound by the ""clearly erroneous"" standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a).  P.  456 U. S. 855.
(b) By rejecting the findings simply because it would have given more weight to evidence of mislabeling than did the trial court, the Court of

 Appeals clearly erred.  Determining the weight and credibility of the evidence is the special province of the trier of fact.  Because the District Court's findings concerning the significance of the instances of mislabeling were not clearly erroneous, they should not have been disturbed.  Pp.  456 U. S. 855-856.

Decided May 24, 1982
456 U.S. 605

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted in an Alabama state court of the capital offense of an intentional killing during a robbery, and was sentenced to death.  At the time of respondent's trial, an Alabama statute precluded jury instructions on lesser included offenses in capital cases.  The conviction and sentence were affirmed on automatic appeal.  Subsequently, habeas corpus proceedings were brought in Federal District Court seeking to have the conviction set aside on the ground, inter alia, that respondent had been convicted and sentenced under a statute that unconstitutionally precluded consideration of lesser included offenses.  The District Court denied relief.  Pending an appeal, the Alabama statute precluding lesser included offense instructions in capital cases was invalidated in Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625.  The Court of Appeals then reversed the District Court, concluding that Beck v. Alabama meant that the Alabama preclusion clause so ""infected"" respondent's trial that he must be retried so that he might have the opportunity to introduce evidence of some lesser included offense.
Held:  The Alabama preclusion clause did not prejudice respondent in any way, and he is not entitled to a new trial, where his own evidence negates the possibility that a lesser included offense instruction might have been warranted.  The Court of Appeals misread Beck v. Alabama, which held that due process requires that a lesser included offense instruction be given only when the evidence warrants such an instruction.  Here, the evidence not only supported the claim that respondent intended to kill the victim, but affirmatively negated any claim that he did not intend to kill the victim.  Accordingly, an instruction on the offense of unintentional killing was not warranted.  Pp.  456 U. S. 610-614.

Respondent journalist filed a request with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for documents relating to the FBI's transmittal to the White House of information concerning individuals who had criticized the Presidential administration.  The FBI denied the request under, inter alia, Exemption 7(C) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure ""investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes"" when the release of such records would ""constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.""  After unsuccessful administrative appeals, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the FBI from withholding the requested documents.  While the suit was pending, the FBI provided respondent with certain documents, and respondent then modified his request to seek only a certain cover letter from the FBI to the White House, along with the accompanying ""name check"" summaries containing information culled from FBI files on the individuals in question, and certain attached documents.  The District Court granted the FBI's motion for a summary judgment with respect to material withheld pursuant to Exemption 7(C).  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, except for those documents attached to the ""name check"" summaries that may have been duplicates of FBI files, the FBI had failed to show that the documents were compiled for law enforcement purposes, and that, accordingly, Exemption 7(C) was unavailable even though disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
Held:  Information contained in records originally compiled for law enforcement purposes does not lose its Exemption 7 exemption where such information is reproduced or summarized in a new document prepared for other than law enforcement purposes, but continues to meet Exemption 7's threshold requirement of being compiled for law enforcement purposes.  Pp.  456 U. S. 621-632.
(a) Although the Court of Appeals' construction of Exemption 7's threshold requirement as turning on the purpose for which the document sought to be withheld was prepared, not on the purpose for which the material included in the document was collected, is a plausible one on the face of the statute, it is not the only reasonable construction of the statutory language.  The statutory language is reasonably construable to 
Page 456 U. S. 616
 protect that part of an otherwise nonexempt compilation that essentially reproduces and is substantially the equivalent of all or part of an earlier record made for law enforcement uses.  This construction more accurately reflects Congress' intention, is more consistent with the Act's structure, and more fully serves its purposes.  Pp.  456 U. S. 623-629.
(b) The legitimate interests in protecting information from disclosure under Exemption 7 are not satisfied by other exemptions, such as Exemption 6, which protects against unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and Exemption 5, which protects from disclosure predecisional communications within an agency and other internal documents.  The reasons for an exemption under Exemption 7 remain intact even though information in a law enforcement record is recompiled in another document for other than law enforcement purposes.  Pp.  456 U. S. 629-630.
(c) The result in this case is consistent with the principle that FOIA exemptions are to be narrowly construed, since there is no request that Exemption 7 be expanded to agencies or material not envisioned by Congress.  Pp.  456 U. S. 630-631.
(d) Congress' concern with possible misuse of governmental information for partisan political activity is not the equivalent of a mandate to release any information that might document such activity.  Once it is established that information was compiled pursuant to a legitimate law enforcement investigation and that disclosure of such information would lead to one of the listed harms under Exemption 7, the information is exempt.  Congress thus created a scheme of categorical exclusion and did not invite a judicial weighing of the benefits and evils of disclosure on a case-by-case basis.  P.  456 U. S. 631.

No. 80-1798
Argued March 3, 1982
Decided May 24, 1982*
456 U.S. 645

Syllabus 
Section 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act) proscribes secondary agreements between unions and employers -- that is, agreements that require an employer to cease doing business with another party.  However,  8(e) contains a proviso which exempts from the proscription of  8(e) agreements between a union and an employer in the construction industry concerning the contracting or subcontracting of work to be performed at a construction jobsite.  In No. 80-1798, petitioner Woelke & Romero Framing, Inc. (Woelke), and respondent union, in negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement, reached an impasse over the union's demand for a clause that would prohibit Woelke from subcontracting work at any construction jobsite
""except to a person, firm or corporation, party to an appropriate, current labor agreement with the appropriate Union, or subordinate body signatory to this Agreement.""
When Woelke's construction sites were picketed in support of the union's demand for the subcontracting clause, Woelke filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board, asserting that subcontracting clauses are sheltered by  8(e)'s construction industry proviso only if they are limited in application to particular jobsites at which both union and nonunion workers are employed.  Woelke argued that, because the clause sought by the union violated  8(e), the picketing violated  8(b)(4)(A) of the Act, which prohibits coercing an employer ""to enter into any agreement which is prohibited by""  8(e).  The Board held that subcontracting clauses are lawful whenever they are sought or negotiated in the context of collective bargaining relationships, and that therefore picketing to obtain such a clause was permitted under  8(b)(4)(A).  In Nos. 80-1808 and 81-91, a labor dispute resulted in unfair labor practice charges' being filed against respondent union by a member (petitioner in No. 80-1808) of an association of construction industry 
Page 456 U. S. 646
 employers (petitioner in No. 81-91), challenging the validity under  8(e) of a subcontracting clause which was substantially similar to the clause involved in No. 80-1798, and which was included in a collective bargaining agreement between the union and the association.  The Board held that such clause was protected by the construction industry proviso.  The Court of Appeals consolidated the petitioners' requests for review of the Board's orders and ultimately decided to enforce the orders, holding that union signatory subcontracting clauses are protected so long as they are negotiated in the context of a collective bargaining relationship, and that picketing may be used to obtain such a clause.
Held:
1. The construction industry proviso to  8(e) ordinarily shelters union signatory subcontracting clauses that are sought or negotiated in the context of a collective bargaining relationship, even when not limited in application to particular jobsites at which both union and nonunion workers are employed.  The subcontracting clauses at issue here are protected by the proviso.  Pp.  456 U. S. 652-665.
(a) The plain language and the legislative history of  8(e) and the construction industry proviso clearly indicate that Congress intended to protect subcontracting clauses like those at issue here.  Pp.  456 U. S. 652-660.
(b) The legislative history does not support petitioners' argument that the proviso was intended primarily as a response to the decision in NLRB v. Denver Building & Construction Trades Council, 341 U. S. 675 -- which held that picketing a general contractor's entire project in order to protest the presence of a nonunion subcontractor is an illegal secondary boycott -- and thus should be interpreted as permitting only those subcontracting agreements that are designed to reduce friction at jobsites where union workers are forced to work alongside nonunion workers.  The proviso serves a variety of purposes unrelated to that case's holding, and, even as a response to that case, is only partly concerned with jobsite friction.  Pp.  456 U. S. 661-662.
(c) While subcontracting clauses like those at issue here create ""top-down"" pressure for unionization -- requiring subcontractors, in order to obtain work, to force their employees to become union members -- such pressure is implicit in the construction industry proviso, and Congress thus decided to accept whatever top-down pressure such clauses might entail.  Moreover, the top-down organizing effect of such clauses is limited by other provisions of the Act.  Pp.  456 U. S. 662-665.
2. The Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction to decide that unions do not violate  8(b)(4)(A) when they picket to obtain a subcontracting clause sheltered by the construction industry proviso.  Neither Woelke nor the Board's General Counsel raised that issue during the proceedings before the Board in No. 80-1798, and thus judicial review is barred by  10(e) of the Act, which provides that ""[n]o objection that has not been 
Page 456 U. S. 647
 urged before the Board . . . shall be considered by the court.""  The  10(e) bar applies even though the Board held that the picketing was not banned by  8(b)(4)(A).  Woelke's failure to object to the Board's decision in a petition for reconsideration or rehearing prevents consideration of the question by the courts.  Pp.  456 U. S. 665-666.

Syllabus 
During respondent's trial for theft in an Oregon state court, the State's expert witness testified as to the value and identity of the property involved.  On cross-examination, he acknowledged that he had once filed an unrelated criminal complaint against respondent, but explained that no action had been taken on his complaint.  On redirect examination, the court sustained a series of objections to the prosecutor's questions seeking to establish the reasons why the witness had filed a complaint against respondent.  After eliciting from the witness that he had never done business with respondent, the prosecutor asked:  ""Is that, because he is a crook?""  The trial court then granted respondent's motion for a mistrial.  On retrial, the court rejected respondent's contention that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, barred further prosecution, finding that ""it was not the intention of the prosecutor in this case to cause a mistrial.""  Respondent was convicted, but the Oregon Court of Appeals reversed, sustaining the double jeopardy claim because the prosecutorial misconduct that had occasioned the mistrial, even if not intended to cause a mistrial, amounted to ""overreaching.""
Held:
1. There is no merit to respondent's contentions that the Court of Appeals' decision was based upon an adequate and independent state ground, or that in the alternative the case should be remanded in order that the court may clarify the grounds upon which its judgment rested.  A fair reading of the opinion below shows that the court rested its decision solely on federal law.  Pp.  456 U. S. 670-671.
2. Where a defendant in a criminal trial successfully moves for a mistrial, he may invoke the bar of double jeopardy in a second effort to try him only if the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was prosecutorial or judicial conduct intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.  A more general test of ""overreaching"" is rejected because it offers virtually no standards for its application and because such a rule may not aid defendants as a class.  By contrast, a standard that examines the prosecutor's intent is a manageable standard to apply.  Since the courts below both agreed that the prosecutor did not intend her conduct to provoke respondent into moving for a mistrial,

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 24, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting. 
 This action was brought by respondents as a challenge to the validity of a regulation defining the term ""cemetery"" as used in 522(e)(5) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. (Supp. III) 1272(e)(5). The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, holding that 526( a)(1) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. (Supp. III) 1276(a)(1), permits challenges to such regulations to be brought only in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. 
 The United States Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for consideration of the merits. Holmes Limestone Co. v. Andrus, 655 F.2d 732 ( CA6 1981). It held that 526(a)(1) 1 permits review of challenges to national 
Page 456 U.S. 995 , 996
 regulations in courts other than the United States District Court for the District of Columbia because while the statute provides that certain actions may be brought only in the district court where the mining operation is located, in the final version of the bill the word ""only"" was deleted from the phrase providing for judicial review of national regulations in the District of Columbia. 655 F.2d 737. The court also concluded that there are ""serious questions about the propriety"" of the 60- day limitation on the filing of petitions for judicial review of rulemaking actions contained in 526(a)(1). 655 F.2d, at 738. 
 The decision below is troubling for several reasons. First, 526(a)( 1) provides that regulations with a national impact be reviewed in the District of Columbia, those with a statewide impact in the district court for the district of the capital of the state involved, and all other regulations only in the district where the surface mining operation at issue is located. By allowing a national regulation to be challenged in federal courts other than those in the District of Columbia, the Court of Appeals here arguably frustrated Congress' carefully devised plan for judicial review. Second, the court below based its holding on the fact that both the House 2 and Senate 3 versions of the bill provided that national regulations were to be reviewed only in the District Court for the District of Columbia, while the word ""only"" was omitted from the final version of the bill reported out of the Conference Committee. However, the Conference Committee's discussion of the changes made in the bill does not even mention this deletion, and it may well have been inadvertent. H. R.Rep.No.95-493, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 111 (1977), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin. News, p. 593. Finally, the only other [456 U.S. 995 , 997]

(Supp. III) 1272(e)(5). The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, holding that 526( a)(1) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. (Supp. III) 1276(a)(1), permits challenges to such regulations to be brought only in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. 
 The United States Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for consideration of the merits. Holmes Limestone Co. v. Andrus, 655 F.2d 732 ( CA6 1981). It held that 526(a)(1) 1 permits review of challenges to national 
Page 456 U.S. 995 , 996
 regulations in courts other than the United States District Court for the District of Columbia because while the statute provides that certain actions may be brought only in the district court where the mining operation is located, in the final version of the bill the word ""only"" was deleted from the phrase providing for judicial review of national regulations in the District of Columbia. 655 F.2d 737. The court also concluded that there are ""serious questions about the propriety"" of the 60- day limitation on the filing of petitions for judicial review of rulemaking actions contained in 526(a)(1). 655 F.2d, at 738. 
 The decision below is troubling for several reasons. First, 526(a)( 1) provides that regulations with a national impact be reviewed in the District of Columbia, those with a statewide impact in the district court for the district of the capital of the state involved, and all other regulations only in the district where the surface mining operation at issue is located. By allowing a national regulation to be challenged in federal courts other than those in the District of Columbia, the Court of Appeals here arguably frustrated Congress' carefully devised plan for judicial review. Second, the court below based its holding on the fact that both the House 2 and Senate 3 versions of the bill provided that national regulations were to be reviewed only in the District Court for the District of Columbia, while the word ""only"" was omitted from the final version of the bill reported out of the Conference Committee. However, the Conference Committee's discussion of the changes made in the bill does not even mention this deletion, and it may well have been inadvertent. H. R.Rep.No.95-493, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 111 (1977), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin. News, p. 593. Finally, the only other [456 U.S. 995 , 997]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 24, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 During the evening of August 2, 1974, petitioner Alfred Brooks and a male companion abducted two women at gunpoint. After robbing the women, the men took the victims into a field and shot them, wounding one and killing the other. Petitioner was thereafter charged, tried, and convicted in District Court, Oklahoma County, for the offense of murder in the first degree. He was sentenced to death. On appeal, the conviction was affirmed, but the sentence was modified to life imprisonment. Brooks v. State, 566 P.2d 147 (Okl.Cr.App.1977). The State later prosecuted petitioner for two additional offenses related to the events of August 2, 1974; assault and battery with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, and robbery with firearms. Petitioner pled guilty to both charges, and was sentenced to two concurrent twenty-year terms of imprisonment. Seeking post-conviction relief in the Oklahoma court, petitioner challenged the later convictions on double jeopardy grounds, inter alia. Following the denial of relief, which was affirmed on appeal, Brooks filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. That court dismissed the petition, and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. 
 Although all the charges leveled against petitioner arose out of the same criminal transaction or episode, they were prosecuted by the State in two separate proceedings. Accordingly, I would grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand for fur-

Sections 101(a)(1) and (2) of Title I of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (Act) guarantee equal voting rights and rights of free speech and assembly to ""[e]very member of a labor organization,"" and  609 of Title VI makes it unlawful for a union ""to fine, suspend, expel, or otherwise discipline any of its members for exercising any right to which he is entitled"" under the Act.  Section 102 provides that any person whose rights under Title I have been infringed by any violation thereof may bring an action in federal district court for appropriate relief.  Petitioners were discharged from their appointed positions as business agents for respondent local union by respondent union president following his election over a candidate supported by petitioners.  Petitioners were also members of the union, and their discharges did not render them ineligible to continue union membership.  Petitioners filed suit against respondents in Federal District Court, alleging that their discharges violated  101(a)(1) and (2).  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, holding that the Act does not protect a union employee from discharge by the union president if the employee's rights as a union member are not affected.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Petitioners have failed to establish a violation of the Act.  Pp.  456 U. S. 435-442.
(a) It is apparent both from the language of  101(a)(1), (2), and 609, and from Title I's legislative history, that Congress sought to protect rank-and-file union members, not the job security or tenure of union officers or employees as such.  Pp.  456 U. S. 435-437.
(b) The term ""discipline,"" as used in  609, refers only to retaliatory actions that affect a union member's rights or status as a member of the union.  The disciplinary sanctions of fine, suspension, and expulsion enumerated in  609 are all punitive actions taken against union members as members.  In contrast, discharge from union employment does not impinge upon the incidents of union membership, and affects union members only to the extent that they also happen to be union employees.  Moreover, Congress used essentially the same language elsewhere in the Act with the specific intent not to protect a member's status as a union employee or officer.  Accordingly, removal from appointive union employment

 is not within the scope of the union sanctions explicitly prohibited by  609.  Pp.  456 U. S. 437-439.
(c) Petitioners were not prevented from exercising their rights under  101(a)(1) and (2) as union members to campaign for respondent union president's opponent and to vote in the union election, and they allege only an indirect interference with those rights.  Whatever limits Title I places on a union's authority to utilize dismissal from union office as part of an attempt to suppress dissent within the union, it does not restrict the freedom of an elected union leader to choose staff members whose views are compatible with his own.  Neither the language nor legislative history of the Act suggests that it was intended to address the issue of union patronage, its overriding objective being rather to ensure that unions would be democratically governed and responsive to the union membership's will as expressed in open elections.

Syllabus 
A Kentucky statute permits service of process in forcible entry or detainer actions to be made by posting a summons ""in a conspicuous place on the premises,"" if the defendant or a member of the defendant's family over 16 years of age cannot be found on the premises.  Service of process under this statute was made on appellee tenants in a public housing project by posting a summons on the door of each of their apartments.  Appellees claim that they never saw the summonses and did not know of the eviction proceedings until they were served with writs of possession, executed after default judgments had been entered against them and their opportunity for appeal had lapsed.  They then filed a class action in Federal District Court against appellant public officials, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and alleging that the notice procedures employed violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment for appellants, holding that such notice procedures did not deny due process.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  In failing to afford appellees adequate notice of the proceedings against them before issuing final orders of eviction, the State deprived them of property without due process of law required by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  456 U. S. 449-456.
(a) ""An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.""  Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306,3 339 U. S. 14.  Pp.  456 U. S. 449-450.
(b) In light of the fact that appellees were deprived of a significant interest in property and, indeed, of the right to continued residence in their homes, it does not suffice to recite that, because the action was in rem, it was only necessary to serve notice ""upon the thing itself.""  The sufficiency of the notice must be tested with reference to its ability to inform people of the pendency of proceedings that affect their interests.  Pp.  456 U. S. 450-451.
(c) Notices posted on the doors of tenants' apartments were ""not infrequently"" removed before they could be seen by the tenants.  Whatever 
Page 456 U. S. 445
 the efficacy of posting notice on a door of a person's home in many cases, it is clear that, in the circumstances of this case, merely posting notice on the apartment door did not satisfy minimum standards of due process.  Pp.  456 U. S. 453-454.
(d) Neither the statute nor the practice of process servers provides for even a second attempt at personal service.  The failure to effect personal service on the first visit hardly suggests that the tenant has abandoned his interest in the apartment such that mere pro forma notice might be constitutionally adequate.  P.  456 U. S. 454.
(e) Notice by mail in the circumstances of this case would go a long way toward providing the constitutionally required assurance that the State has not allowed its power to be invoked against a person who has had no opportunity to present a defense.  Pp.  456 U. S. 455-456.

Appellees claim that they never saw the summonses and did not know of the eviction proceedings until they were served with writs of possession, executed after default judgments had been entered against them and their opportunity for appeal had lapsed.  They then filed a class action in Federal District Court against appellant public officials, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and alleging that the notice procedures employed violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment for appellants, holding that such notice procedures did not deny due process.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  In failing to afford appellees adequate notice of the proceedings against them before issuing final orders of eviction, the State deprived them of property without due process of law required by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  456 U. S. 449-456.
(a) ""An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.""  Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306,3 339 U. S. 14.  Pp.  456 U. S. 449-450.
(b) In light of the fact that appellees were deprived of a significant interest in property and, indeed, of the right to continued residence in their homes, it does not suffice to recite that, because the action was in rem, it was only necessary to serve notice ""upon the thing itself.""  The sufficiency of the notice must be tested with reference to its ability to inform people of the pendency of proceedings that affect their interests.  Pp.  456 U. S. 450-451.
(c) Notices posted on the doors of tenants' apartments were ""not infrequently"" removed before they could be seen by the tenants.  Whatever 
Page 456 U. S. 445
 the efficacy of posting notice on a door of a person's home in many cases, it is clear that, in the circumstances of this case, merely posting notice on the apartment door did not satisfy minimum standards of due process.  Pp.  456 U. S. 453-454.
(d) Neither the statute nor the practice of process servers provides for even a second attempt at personal service.  The failure to effect personal service on the first visit hardly suggests that the tenant has abandoned his interest in the apartment such that mere pro forma notice might be constitutionally adequate.  P.  456 U. S. 454.
(e) Notice by mail in the circumstances of this case would go a long way toward providing the constitutionally required assurance that the State has not allowed its power to be invoked against a person who has had no opportunity to present a defense.  Pp.  456 U. S. 455-456.

Syllabus 
Title 28 U.S.C.  1738 (as did its predecessors dating back to 1790) requires federal courts to afford the same full faith and credit to state court judgments that would apply in the State's own courts.  Petitioner filed an employment discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the EEOC, as required by the Act, referred the charge to the New York State Division of Human Rights (NYHRD), the agency charged with enforcing the New York law prohibiting employment discrimination.  The NYHRD rejected the claim as meritless, and was upheld on administrative appeal.  The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court affirmed.  Subsequently, a District Director of the EEOC ruled that there was no reasonable cause to believe that the discrimination charge was true, and issued a right-to-sue letter.  Petitioner then brought a Title VII action in Federal District Court.  Ultimately, the District Court dismissed the complaint on res judicata grounds, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court was required under 28 U.S.C.  1738 to give preclusive effect to the state court decision upholding the state administrative agency's rejection of the employment discrimination claim.  Pp.  456 U. S. 466-485.
(a) Where, under New York law, the New York court's determination precludes petitioner from bringing any other action based on the same grievance in the New York courts,  1738, by its terms, precludes him from relitigating the same question in federal courts.  Pp.  456 U. S. 466-467.
(b) There is no ""affirmative showing"" of a ""clear and manifest"" legislative purpose in Title VII to deny res judicata or collateral estoppel effect to a state court judgment affirming that an employment discrimination claim is unproved.  An exception to  1738 will not be recognized unless a later statute contains an express or implied partial repeal.  Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90.  Here, there is no claim that Title VII expressly repealed  1738, and no implied repeal is evident from the language, operation, or legislative history of Title VII, there being no manifest incompatibility between Title VII and  1738.  Pp.  456 U. S. 468-476.
(c) While initial resort to state administrative remedies does not deprive an individual of a right to a federal trial de novo on a Title VII claim, this does not mean that a prior state court judgment can be disregarded.  Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36, distinguished.  
Page 456 U. S. 462
 The comity and federalism interests embodied in  1738 are not compromised by the application of res judicata and collateral estoppel in Title VII cases.  Rather, to deprive state judgments of finality not only would violate basic tenets of comity and federalism, but also would reduce the incentive for States to work toward effective and meaningful systems prohibiting employment discrimination.  Pp.  456 U. S. 476-478.
(d) The procedures provided in New York for the determination of employment discrimination claims, complemented by administrative as well as judicial review, offer a full and fair opportunity to litigate the merits, and thus are sufficient under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  State proceedings need do no more than satisfy the minimum procedural requirements of the Due Process Clause in order to qualify for the full faith and credit guaranteed by federal law.  Section 1738 does not allow federal courts to employ their own rules of res judicata in determining the effect of state judgments, but rather goes beyond the common law and commands a federal court to accept the rules chosen by the State from which the judgment is taken.  Here, petitioner received all the process that was constitutionally required in rejecting his employment discrimination claim.  Pp.  456 U. S. 479-485.

Syllabus 
Section 901(a) of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides that ""no person,"" on the basis of sex, shall
""be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.""
Section 902 authorizes each agency awarding federal financial assistance to any education program to promulgate regulations ensuring that aid recipients adhere to  901(a), and as a sanction for noncompliance provides for termination of federal funds limited to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been found.  Pursuant to  902, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), interpreting ""person"" in  901(a) to encompass employees as well as students, issued regulations (Subpart E) prohibiting federally funded education programs from discriminating on the basis of sex with respect to employment.  Petitioners, federally funded public school boards, when threatened with enforcement proceedings for alleged violations of  901(a) with respect to board employees, brought separate suits challenging HEW's authority to issue the Subpart E regulations on the alleged ground that  901(a) was not intended to apply to employment practices, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court in each case granted the school board's motion for summary judgment.  In a consolidated appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  901(a) was intended to prohibit employment discrimination and that the Subpart E regulations were consistent with  902.
Held:
1. Employment discrimination comes within Title IX's prohibition.  Pp.  456 U. S. 520-535.
(a) While  901(a) does not expressly include employees within its scope or expressly exclude them, its broad directive that ""no person"" may be discriminated against on the basis of gender, on its face, includes employees as well as students.  Pp.  456 U. S. 520-522.
(b) Title IX's legislative history corroborates the conclusion that employment discrimination was intended to come within its prohibition.  Pp.  456 U. S. 523-530. 
Page 456 U. S. 513

(c) Title IX's postenactment history provides additional evidence of Congress' desire to ban employment discrimination in federally financed education programs.  Pp.  456 U. S. 530-535.
2. The Subpart E regulations are valid. Pp. 535 540.
(a) An agency's authority under Title IX both to promulgate regulations and to terminate funds is subject to the program-specific limitation of  901(a) and 902.  The Subpart E regulations are not inconsistent with this restriction.  Pp.  456 U. S. 535-539.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a nonprofit membership corporation with over 90,000 members drawn from all fields of mechanical engineering, promulgates codes for areas of engineering and industry.  Much of its work is done through volunteers from industry and government.  The codes, while only advisory, have a powerful economic influence, many of them being incorporated by reference in federal regulations and state and local laws.  Respondent marketed a safety device for use in water boilers and secured a customer that previously had purchased the competing product of McDonnell & Miller, Inc. (M&M).  One of M&M's officials, a vice-president (James), was vice-chairman of petitioner's subcommittee that drafted, revised, and interpreted the segment of petitioner's code governing the safety device in question.  Subsequently, he and other M&M officials met with the subcommittee's chairman (Hardin).  As a result, M&M sent a letter to petitioner asking whether a safety device with a feature such as one contained in respondent's device satisfied the pertinent code requirements.  The letter was referred to Hardin, as chairman of the subcommittee, and ultimately an ""unofficial response"" was issued, prepared by Hardin but mailed on petitioner's stationery over the signature of one of petitioner's full-time employees.  The response, in effect, declared respondent's product unsafe.  Thereafter, M&M's salesmen used the subcommittee's response to discourage customers from buying respondent's product.  Respondent subsequently sought a correction from petitioner of the unofficial response; respondent continued to suffer market resistance after the pertinent committee replied.  After James' part in the drafting of the original letter of inquiry became public, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court against petitioner (and others who settled), alleging violation of the Sherman Act.  The trial court rejected respondent's request for jury instructions that petitioner could be held liable for its agents' conduct if they acted within the scope of their apparent authority.  Instead, the jury was instructed that petitioner could be held liable only if it had ratified its agents' actions or if the agents had acted in pursuit of petitioner's interests.  The jury nonetheless returned a verdict for respondent.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that petitioner could be held liable if its agents had 
Page 456 U. S. 557
 acted within the scope of their apparent authority, and that thus the charge was more favorable to petitioner than the law required.
Held:  Petitioner is civilly liable under the antitrust laws for the antitrust violations of its agents committed with apparent authority.  Pp.  456 U. S. 565-576.
(a) Under general rules of agency law, principals are liable when their agents act with apparent authority and commit torts analogous to the antitrust violation presented here.  An agent who appears to have authority to make statements for his principal gives to his statements the weight of the principal's reputation -- in this case, the weight of petitioner's acknowledged expertise in boiler safety.  Pp.  456 U. S. 565-570.
(b) Petitioner's liability under a theory of apparent authority is consistent with the congressional intent behind the antitrust laws to encourage competition.  Petitioner wields great power in the Nation's economy, and when it cloaks its subcommittee officials with the authority of its reputation, it permits those agents to affect the destinies of businesses, and thus gives them the power -- as illustrated by the facts of this case -- to frustrate competition in the marketplace.  A rule that imposes liability on the standard-setting organization -- which is best situated to prevent antitrust violations through the abuse of its reputation -- is most faithful to the congressional intent that the private right of action deter antitrust violations.  On the other hand, a ratification rule would have anticompetitive effects, encouraging petitioner to do as little as possible to oversee its agents, since it could avoid liability by ensuring that it remained ignorant of its agents' conduct.  And a rule whereby petitioner would not be liable unless its agents acted with an intent to benefit petitioner would be irrelevant to the antitrust laws' purposes.  The anticompetitive practices of petitioner's agents are repugnant to the antitrust laws even if the agents act without any intent to aid petitioner, and petitioner should be encouraged to eliminate the anticompetitive practices of all its agents acting with apparent authority, especially those who use their positions in petitioner solely for their own benefit or the benefit of their employers.  Pp.  456 U. S. 570-574.
(c) Application of the theory of apparent authority is not improper on the asserted ground that treble damages for antitrust violations are punitive, and that, under traditional agency law, the courts do not employ apparent authority to impose punitive damages upon a principal for the acts of its agents.  Since treble damages also serve as a means of deterring antitrust violations and of compensating victims, it is in accord with both the purposes of the antitrust laws and principles of agency law to hold petitioner liable for the acts of agents committed with apparent authority.  Nor does the fact that petitioner is a nonprofit organization

Respondent filed a request with petitioner United States Department of State under the Freedom of Information Act for documents indicating whether certain Iranian nationals held valid United States passports.  The State Department denied the request on the ground that the requested information was exempt from disclosure under Exemption 6 of the Act, which provides that the Act's disclosure requirements do not apply to ""personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.""  Pending an ultimately unsuccessful administrative appeal, respondent brought an action in Federal District Court to enjoin petitioners from withholding the requested documents, and the court granted summary judgment for respondent.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, because the citizenship status of the individuals in question was less intimate than information normally contained in personnel and medical files, it was not contained in ""similar files"" within the meaning of Exemption 6, and that therefore there was no need to consider whether disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
Held:  The citizenship information sought by respondent satisfies the ""similar files"" requirement of Exemption 6, and hence the State Department's denial of the request should have been sustained upon a showing that release of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  Although Exemption 6's language sheds little light on what Congress meant by ""similar files,"" the legislative history indicates that Congress did not mean to limit Exemption 6 to a narrow class of files containing only a discrete kind of personal information, but that ""similar files"" was to have a broad, rather than a narrow, meaning.  Exemption 6's protection is not determined merely by the nature of the file containing the requested information, and its protection is not lost merely because an agency stores information about an individual in records other than ""personnel"" or ""medical"" files.

Syllabus 
The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), which regulates commodity futures trading, was substantially amended by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974.  Among other things, the Commodity Futures Exchange Commission was created to assume the regulatory and enforcement powers previously exercised by the Secretary of Agriculture and certain additional powers, and that Commission was authorized to grant reparations to any person complaining of a violation of the CEA or its implementing regulations committed by any futures commission merchant, floor broker, commodity trading adviser, or commodity pool operator.  But the 1974 Act, like the original legislation and other amendatory enactments, was silent on the subject of private judicial remedies for persons injured by a violation of the CEA.  These cases involve an action by an investor in commodity futures contracts against his futures commission merchant or broker for violation of an antifraud provision of the CEA, and three actions by speculators in futures contracts against the New York Mercantile Exchange and its officials and against futures commission merchants, claiming damages resulting from unlawful price manipulation that allegedly could have been prevented by the Exchange's enforcement of its own rules.  In each action, after the respective District Courts had ruled adversely to the plaintiffs, the respective Courts of Appeals held that the plaintiffs had implied rights of action under the CEA.
Held:  A private party may maintain an action for damages caused by a violation of the CEA.  Pp.  456 U. S. 374-395.
(a) Where it is clear that an implied cause of action under the CEA was a part of the ""contemporary legal context"" in which Congress undertook a comprehensive reexamination and amendment of the CEA in 1974, the fact that the amendments left intact the provisions under which 
Page 456 U. S. 354
 the federal courts had implied a cause of action is itself evidence that Congress affirmatively intended to preserve that remedy.  Pp.  456 U. S. 374-382.
(b) Moreover, a review of the legislative history of the 1974 enactment indicates that preservation of the remedy was indeed what Congress intended.  Pp.  456 U. S. 382-388.
(c) Purchasers and sellers of futures contracts have standing to assert both types of claims involved here -- violation of the statutory prohibition against fraudulent and deceptive conduct and of the provisions designed to prevent price manipulation.  The legislative history clearly indicates that Congress intended to protect all futures traders from price manipulation and other fraudulent conduct violative of the statute.  Since actions by investors against exchanges were part of the contemporary legal context that Congress intended to preserve, exchanges can be held accountable for breaching their statutory duties to enforce their own rules prohibiting price manipulation.  It follows that those persons who are participants in a conspiracy to manipulate the market in violation of those rules are also subject to suit by futures traders who can prove injury from such violations.

No. 81-89
Argued February 24, 1982
Decided May 3, 1982
456 U.S. 410

Syllabus 
After respondent was convicted of murder in a Georgia trial court, his sentencing jury found the existence of three aggravating circumstances specified in the Georgia death penalty statute and imposed the death penalty.  Although the Georgia Supreme Court set aside one of the aggravating circumstances found by the jury, it upheld the death sentence, concluding that the evidence supported the jury's findings of the other aggravating circumstances, and that therefore the sentence was not impaired.  After exhausting state postconviction remedies, respondent filed for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, which denied relief.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded insofar as the District Court had left standing respondent's death sentence.  This Court granted the petition for certiorari to consider the question whether a reviewing court constitutionally may sustain a death sentence as long as at least one of a plurality of statutory aggravating circumstances found by the jury is valid and supported by the evidence.  The Georgia Supreme Court consistently has asserted that authority, but there is considerable uncertainty about the state law premises of Georgia's rule.
Held:  Such state law premises are relevant to the constitutional issue at hand.  Thus, pursuant to a Georgia statute providing that, under certain circumstances, the Georgia Supreme Court will decide questions of state law upon certification from this Court, the following question is certified:  What are the premises of state law that support the conclusion that the death sentence in this case is not impaired by the invalidity of one of the statutory aggravating circumstances found by the jury?

 Jack BERGMAN, Warden, v. Arthur Jackson BURTONNo. 81-310 Supreme Court of the United States May 3, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for further consideration in light of Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509 (1982). 

 Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice MARSHALL and Justice BLACKMUN join, dissenting. In Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, the Court wrote: ""There is no basis to believe that today's holdings will 'complicate and delay' the resolution of habeas petitions (STEVENS, J., post, at 550 [] ), or will serve to 'trap the unwary pro se prisoner.' (BLACKMUN, J., post, at 530 [] )."" Id., at 520. Today, however, the Court interprets Rose as requiring further proceedings that can serve no purpose other than to ""complicate and delay"" the ultimate termination of this litigation. In 1975 the respondent was convicted in a Michigan state court of assault with intent to commit murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction was affirmed by the Michigan Court of Appeals in 1977 and the Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal. In 1980 the respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on two grounds : (1) that the trial court's instructions to the jury deprived him of due process of law; and (2) that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. The District Court found no merit to the first claim and refused to consider the second because the respondent had not exhausted his state remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. 2254(b). The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the instructions were improper under Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 
Page 456 U.S. 953 , 954
 510, and that even though trial counsel had not objected to the erroneous instruction, Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, did not foreclose relief because the Michigan Court of Appeals had reviewed the asserted errors in the trial court's jury charge and rejected the respondent's claims on the merits. The Sixth Circuit did not address the respondent's unexhausted claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. 
 The warden's petition for certiorari in this Court raises the Wainwright v. Sykes issue and three questions concerning Sandstrom v. Montana. [Footnote 1] The petition makes no reference to the unexhausted claim. Ignoring the four questions presented by the warden, the Court grants his petition, vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remands for reconsideration in the light of Rose v. Lundy. 
 Under Rose v. Lundy -if I read the Court's opinion correctly-after the case gets back to the District Court, that court must dismiss the habeas corpus petition that is now a part of the record. [Footnote 2] Thereafter, the respondent immediately will be entitled to resubmit a petition eliminating the unexhausted claim and confining his claim to relief to the issue [456 U.S. 953 , 955]

Argued January 19, 1982
Decided April 27, 1982*
456 U.S. 273

Syllabus 
Respondent black employees brought suit in Federal District Court against petitioners, their employer and certain unions, alleging that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was violated by a seniority system maintained by petitioners.  The District Court found that the differences in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment resulting from the seniority system ""are not the result of an intention to discriminate' because of race or color"" and held, therefore, that the system satisfied the requirements of  703(h) of the Act.  That section provides that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different compensation standards or different terms, conditions, or privileges of employment
""pursuant to a bona fide seniority . . . system . . . provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of race.""
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the differences in treatment of employees under the seniority system resulted from an intent to discriminate, and thus violated  703(h).  Although recognizing that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) requires that a District Court's findings of fact not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, the Court of Appeals concluded that a finding of discrimination or nondiscrimination under  703(h) was a finding of ""ultimate fact"" that the court would review by making
""an independent determination of [the] allegations of discrimination, though bound by findings of subsidiary fact which are themselves not clearly erroneous.""
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in the course of its review of the District Court's judgment.  Pp.  456 U. S. 276-293.
(a) Under  703(h), a showing of a disparate impact alone is insufficient to invalidate a seniority system, even though the result may be to perpetuate pre-Act discrimination.  Absent a discriminatory purpose, the operation of a seniority system is not an unlawful employment practice even if the system has some discriminatory consequences.  Pp.  456 U. S. 276-277.
(b) Rule 52(a) does not divide findings of fact into those that deal with ""ultimate"" and those that deal with ""subsidiary"" facts.  While the Rule 
Page 456 U. S. 274
 does not apply to conclusions of law, here the District Court was not faulted for applying an erroneous definition of intentional discrimination.  Rather, it was reversed for arriving at what the Court of Appeals thought was an erroneous finding as to whether the differential impact of the seniority system reflected an intent to discriminate on account of race for purposes of  703(h).  That question is a pure question of fact, subject to Rule 52(a)'s clearly erroneous standard.  Discriminatory intent here means actual motive; it is not a legal presumption to be drawn from a factual showing of something less than actual motive.  Thus, a court of appeals may only reverse a district court's finding on discriminatory intent if it concludes that the finding is clearly erroneous under Rule 52(a).  Pp.  456 U. S. 285-290.
(c) While the Court of Appeals correctly stated the controlling clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a), its conclusion that the challenged seniority system was unprotected by  703(h) was the product of the court's improper independent consideration of the totality of the circumstances it found in the record.

Syllabus 
Respondent black employees brought suit in Federal District Court against petitioners, their employer and certain unions, alleging that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was violated by a seniority system maintained by petitioners.  The District Court found that the differences in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment resulting from the seniority system ""are not the result of an intention to discriminate' because of race or color"" and held, therefore, that the system satisfied the requirements of  703(h) of the Act.  That section provides that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different compensation standards or different terms, conditions, or privileges of employment
""pursuant to a bona fide seniority . . . system . . . provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of race.""
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the differences in treatment of employees under the seniority system resulted from an intent to discriminate, and thus violated  703(h).  Although recognizing that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) requires that a District Court's findings of fact not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, the Court of Appeals concluded that a finding of discrimination or nondiscrimination under  703(h) was a finding of ""ultimate fact"" that the court would review by making
""an independent determination of [the] allegations of discrimination, though bound by findings of subsidiary fact which are themselves not clearly erroneous.""
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in the course of its review of the District Court's judgment.  Pp.  456 U. S. 276-293.
(a) Under  703(h), a showing of a disparate impact alone is insufficient to invalidate a seniority system, even though the result may be to perpetuate pre-Act discrimination.  Absent a discriminatory purpose, the operation of a seniority system is not an unlawful employment practice even if the system has some discriminatory consequences.  Pp.  456 U. S. 276-277.
(b) Rule 52(a) does not divide findings of fact into those that deal with ""ultimate"" and those that deal with ""subsidiary"" facts.  While the Rule 
Page 456 U. S. 274
 does not apply to conclusions of law, here the District Court was not faulted for applying an erroneous definition of intentional discrimination.  Rather, it was reversed for arriving at what the Court of Appeals thought was an erroneous finding as to whether the differential impact of the seniority system reflected an intent to discriminate on account of race for purposes of  703(h).  That question is a pure question of fact, subject to Rule 52(a)'s clearly erroneous standard.  Discriminatory intent here means actual motive; it is not a legal presumption to be drawn from a factual showing of something less than actual motive.  Thus, a court of appeals may only reverse a district court's finding on discriminatory intent if it concludes that the finding is clearly erroneous under Rule 52(a).  Pp.  456 U. S. 285-290.
(c) While the Court of Appeals correctly stated the controlling clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a), its conclusion that the challenged seniority system was unprotected by  703(h) was the product of the court's improper independent consideration of the totality of the circumstances it found in the record.  When the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court had erred in failing to consider certain relevant evidence, it improperly made its own determination based on such evidence.  When a district court's finding as to discriminatory intent under  703(h) is set aside for an error of law, the court of appeals is not relieved of the usual requirement of remanding for further proceedings to the tribunal charged with the task of factfinding in the first instance.

Syllabus 
The Navy, in the course of using an island off the Puerto Rico coast for air-to-ground weapons training, has discharged ordnance into the waters surrounding the island, when pilots missed land targets and accidentally bombed the waters or intentionally bombed water targets.  Respondents sued in Federal District Court to enjoin the Navy's operations, alleging violation of, inter alia, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA).  The District Court, while finding that the discharges have not harmed the quality of the water, held that the Navy had violated the FWPCA by discharging ordnance into the waters without first obtaining a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency, and ordered the Navy to apply for a permit, but refused to enjoin the operations pending consideration of the permit application.  The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded with instructions to order the Navy to cease the violation until it obtained a permit, holding that the FWPCA withdrew the District Court's equitable discretion to order relief other than an immediate prohibitory injunction.
Held:  The FWPCA does not foreclose completely the exercise of a district court's discretion, but, rather than requiring the court to issue an injunction for any and all statutory violations, permits the court to order relief it considers necessary to secure prompt compliance with the Act, which relief can include, but is not limited to, an order of immediate cessation.  Pp.  456 U. S. 311-320.
(a) The grant of jurisdiction to a court to ensure compliance with a statute does not suggest an absolute duty to grant injunctive relief under any and all circumstances, and a federal judge sitting as chancellor is not mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law.  Pp.  456 U. S. 311-313.
(b) Here, an injunction is not the only means of ensuring compliance, TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, distinguished, since the FWPCA provides, for example, for fines and criminal penalties.  While the FWPCA's purpose in preserving the integrity of the Nation's waters is to be achieved by compliance with the Act, including compliance with the permit requirements, in this case, the discharge of the ordnance has not polluted 
Page 456 U. S. 306
 the waters, and, although the District Court refuse to enjoin the discharge, it neither ignored the statutory violation nor undercut the purpose and function of the permit system.  The FWPCA's prohibition against discharge of pollutants can be overcome by the very permit the Navy as ordered to seek.  Pp.  456 U. S. 313-316.
(c) The statutory scheme as a whole contemplates the exercise of discretion and balancing of equities, and suggests that Congress did not intend to deny courts the discretion to rely on remedies other than an immediate prohibitory injunction.  Pp.  456 U. S. 316-318.
(d) The provision of the FWPCA permitting the President to exempt federal facilities from compliance with the permit requirements does not indicate congressional intent to limit the court's discretion.  The Act permits the exercise of a court's equitable discretion, whether the source of pollution is a private party or a federal agency, to order relief that will achieve compliance with the Act, whereas the exemption permits noncompliance by federal agencies in extraordinary circumstances.

Syllabus 
Respondent, as consignor, shipped goods by rail to a third party under uniform straight bills of lading prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).  Each bill provided that the consignor was liable for freight charges unless it signed a statement in the bill that ""[t]he carrier shall not make delivery of this shipment without payment of freight and all other lawful charges.""  Respondent failed to execute this ""nonrecourse"" clause in the bills of lading.  Petitioner, a common carrier by rail, delivered the first shipment to the consignee without collecting the freight charges in advance and without investigating the consignee's credit standing.  Petitioner delivered the other shipments only after receiving checks from the consignee, but the checks were dishonored by the consignee's bank for insufficient funds.  After unsuccessfully attempting to collect the unpaid freight charges from the consignee, petitioner requested that respondent pay the charges and, when payment was not made, filed suit against respondent in Federal District Court.  The court ruled that, although petitioner had established a prima facie case for the recovery of the freight charges, respondent had established a valid equitable defense by showing that petitioner had failed to comply with the ICC's credit regulations.  These regulations, promulgated pursuant to  3(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, did not allow for delivery of freight on credit for more than five days.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Petitioner's violation of the credit regulations does not bar its collection of lawful freight charges from respondent.  Pp.  456 U. S. 342-352.
(a) Petitioner established a prima facie case of respondent's liability for the freight charges by proving that respondent failed to sign the nonrecourse clause in the bills of lading.  The bill of lading is the basic transportation contract between the shipper-consignor and the carrier, and, unless the bill provides to the contrary, the consignor remains primarily liable for the freight charges.  Thus, by failing to execute the nonrecourse provision, respondent continued to be primarily liable.  Pp.  456 U. S. 342-344.
(b) Petitioner's violation of the credit regulations did not provide respondent with an equitable affirmative defense to petitioner's prima facie 
Page 456 U. S. 337
 case.  Neither  3(2) of the Act nor the regulations themselves intimate that a carrier's violation of the credit rules automatically precludes it from collecting the lawful freight charge.  Nor does either contain any words of affirmative defense to a freight charge action.  The history of the regulations further indicates that this silence was not inadvertent -- the intent of the rules was to protect carriers, not to penalize them.  And public policy concerns disfavor judicial implication of affirmative defenses based on carrier violations of the credit regulations.  The ICC has ample authority to police the credit practices of carriers, and thereby to deter improper practices, without the judicially created remedy of forfeiture of freight charges.  Pp.  456 U. S. 344-362.

Syllabus 
A section ( 309.515, subd. 1(b)) of Minnesota's charitable solicitations Act provides that only those religious organizations that receive more than half of their total contributions from members or affiliated organizations are exempt from the registration and reporting requirements of the Act.  The individual appellees, claiming to be followers of the tenets of appellee Unification Church (later joined as a plaintiff) brought suit in Federal District Court seeking a declaration that the statute, on its face and as applied to them, violated, inter alia, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and also seeking injunctive relief.  After obtaining a preliminary injunction, appellees moved for summary judgment.  Upon finding that the ""overbreadth"" doctrine gave appellees standing to challenge the statute, the Magistrate to whom the action had been transferred held that the application of the statute to religious organizations violated the Establishment Clause, and therefore recommended declaratory and permanent injunctive relief.  The District Court, accepting this recommendation, entered summary judgment for appellees.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on both the standing issue and on the merits.  But the court, disagreeing with the District Court's conclusion that appellees and others should enjoy the religious organization exemption from the Act merely by claiming to be such organizations, held that proof of religious organization status was required in order to gain the exemption, and left the question of appellees' status ""open . . . for further development.""  Accordingly, the court vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded for entry of a modified injunction and further proceedings.
Held:
1. Appellees have Art. III standing to raise their Establishment Clause claims.  The State attempted to use  309.515, subd. 1(b)'s fifty percent rule to compel the Unification Church to register and report under the Act.  The fact that the fifty percent rule only applies to religious organizations compels the conclusion that, at least for purposes of this suit challenging that application, appellee Unification Church is a religious organization within the meaning of the Act.  The controversy between 
Page 456 U. S. 229
 the parties is not rendered any less concrete by the fact that appellants, in the course of this litigation, have changed their position to contend that the Unification Church is not a religious organization within the meaning of the Act, and that therefore it would not be entitled to an exemption under  309.515, subd. 1(b) even if the fifty percent rule were declared unconstitutional.  This is so because the threatened application of  309.515, subd. 1(b), and its fifty percent rule to appellees amounts to a distinct and palpable injury to them, in that it disables them from soliciting contributions in Minnesota unless they comply with the registration and reporting requirements of the Act.  Moreover, there is a causal connection between the claimed injury and the challenged conduct.  The fact that appellees have not yet shown an entitlement to a permanent injunction barring the State from subjecting them to the Act's registration and reporting requirements does not detract from the palpability of the particular and discrete injury caused to appellees.  Pp.  456 U. S. 238-244.
2. Section 309.515, subd. 1(b), in setting up precisely the sort of official denominational preference forbidden by the First Amendment, violates the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  456 U. S. 244-255.
(a) Since the challenged statute grants denominational preferences, it must be treated as suspect, and strict scrutiny must be applied in adjudging its constitutionality.  Pp.  456 U. S. 244-246.
(b) Assuming, arguendo, that appellants' asserted interest in preventing fraudulent solicitations is a ""compelling"" interest, appellants have nevertheless failed to demonstrate that  309.515, subd. 1(b)'s fifty percent rule is ""closely fitted"" to that interest.  Appellants' argument to the contrary is based on three premises:  (1) that members of a religious organization can and will exercise supervision and control over the solicitation activities of the organization when membership contributions exceed fifty percent; (2) that membership control, assuming its existence, is an adequate safeguard against abusive solicitations of the public; and (3) that the need for public disclosure rises in proportion with the percentage of nonmember contributions.  There is no substantial support in the record for any of these premises.  Pp.  456 U. S. 246-251.
(c) Where the principal effect of  309.515, subd. 1(b)'s fifty percent rule is to impose the Act's registration and reporting requirements on some religious organizations but not on others, the ""risk of politicizing religion"" inhering in the statute is obvious.  Pp.  456 U. S. 251-255.

Part B of the Medicare program under the Social Security Act provides federally subsidized insurance against the cost of certain physician services, outpatient physical therapy, X-rays, laboratory tests, and certain other medical and health care.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to contract with private insurance carriers to administer the payment of Part B claims.  If the carrier refuses on the Secretary's behalf to pay a portion of a claim, the claimant is entitled to a ""review determination,"" based on the submission of written evidence and arguments, and, if the amount in dispute is $100 or more, a still-dissatisfied claimant then has a right to an oral hearing, at which an officer chosen by the carrier presides.  The statute and regulations make no further provision for review of the hearing officer's decision.  After decisions by hearing officers were rendered against them, appellee claimants sued in Federal District Court to challenge the constitutional adequacy of the hearings afforded to them.  The court held that the hearing procedures violated appellees' rights to due process insofar as the final, unappealable decision regarding their claims was made by carrier appointees, that due process required additional safeguards to reduce the risk of erroneous deprivation of Part B benefits, and that appellees were entitled to a de novo hearing conducted by an administrative law judge of the Social Security Administration.
Held:  The hearing procedures in question do not violate due process requirements.  Pp.  456 U. S. 195-200.
(a) While due process demands impartiality on the part of those who function in a quasi-judicial capacity, such as the hearing officers involved in this case, there is a presumption that these officers are unbiased.  This presumption can be rebutted by a showing of conflict of interest or some other specific reason for disqualification.  But the factual findings here disclose no disqualifying interest.  The officers' connection with the private insurance carriers would be relevant only if the carriers themselves are biased or interested, and there is no basis in the record for such a conclusion.  The carriers pay Part B claims from federal, not their own, funds, the hearing officers' salaries are paid by the Federal Government, and the carriers operate under contracts requiring compliance with standards prescribed by the statute and the Secretary.

Syllabus 
Part B of the Medicare program, the federally subsidized, voluntary health insurance system for persons 65 or older or who are disabled, supplements Part A, which covers institutional health costs such as hospital expenses, by insuring against a portion of medical expenses excluded from Part A.  Under the statute, private insurance carriers are assigned the task of paying Part B claims.  If the carrier determines that a claim meets Part B coverage criteria, the claim is paid out of federal funds.  Disputed determinations are subject to review in a hearing by the carrier if the disputed amount is $100 or more.  The statute also provides for a review by the Secretary of Health and Human Services of determinations of whether an individual is entitled to benefits under Part A or Part B, and of the determination of the amount of benefits under Part A.  Persons dissatisfied with the Secretary's decision are granted the right to additional administrative review, together with the option of judicial review when the dispute relates to their eligibility to participate in either Part A or Part B or concerns the amount of Part A benefits.  When respondent distributor of kidney dialysis supplies made sales covered by Part B, the purchasers assigned their Part B claims to respondent.  Respondent in turn billed the private insurance carrier, who was required by contract to reimburse 80% of what it determined were ""reasonable charges"" for the supplies.  The carrier interpreted the relevant statute and regulations to define ""reasonable charges"" to be the catalog price of the supplies as of July 1 of the preceding calendar year.  When the carrier refused respondent's request to make adjustments in this method of reimbursement in order to reflect interim price increases, respondent sought review before one of the carrier's hearing officers, who upheld the carrier's decision.  Respondent then brought an action against the United States in the Court of Claims, seeking reimbursement on the basis of its current charges.  After ruling that the suit was within its jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, the Court of Claims held that the carrier's calculation of respondent's allowable charges erred in several respects, and remanded for redetermination of the charges.
Held:  The Court of Claims has no jurisdiction to review determinations by private insurance carriers of the amount of benefits payable under Part B of the Medicare program.  Pp.  456 U. S. 206-211.

Syllabus 
Respondent is an American importer of Russian wood products, and had contracts with an American shipper for shipment of the products from the Soviet Union to American ports.  The shipper, in turn, employed a stevedoring company to unload its ships.  The stevedore's employees were members of petitioner longshoremen's union (hereafter petitioner).  Petitioner, as a protest against the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, refused to handle cargoes arriving from or destined for the Soviet Union.  As a result, respondent's shipments and business were disrupted completely.  Respondent then brought an action in Federal District Court for damages under  303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, claiming that petitioner's refusal to unload respondent's shipments constituted an illegal secondary boycott under  8(b)(4)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act.  Section 8(b)(4)(B) prohibits a labor union from engaging in activities designed to influence individuals employed by ""any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce,"" and from inducing such employees to refuse to handle goods with the object of forcing any person ""to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing"" in the products of, or ""to cease doing business"" with, another person.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that petitioner's boycott was a purely political, primary boycott of Russian goods, and thus not within the scope of  8(b)(4)(B).  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Petitioner's boycott was an illegal secondary boycott under  8(b) (4)(B).  Pp.  456 U. S. 218-227.
(a) Petitioner's activity was ""in commerce"" and within the scope of the National Labor Relations Act.  Its refusal to unload respondent's shipments in no way affected the maritime operations of foreign ships, was not aimed at altering the terms of employment of foreign crews, and did not seek to extend the bill of rights of American workers and employers to foreign seamen or shipowners.  Accordingly, the longstanding tradition of restraint in applying United States laws to foreign ships is irrelevant.

(b) By its terms,  8(b)(4)(B)'s prohibition against secondary boycotts applies to the facts of this case.  Petitioner's sole complaint was with the Soviet Union's foreign and military policy, and however commendable its objectives might have been, the effect of its action was to impose a heavy burden on neutral employers.  It is just such a burden that the secondary boycott provisions were designed to prevent.  Pp.  456 U. S. 222-224.
(c) That the specific purpose of petitioner's action was not to halt business between respondent, its shipper, and the stevedore, but to free union members from handling goods from an objectionable source, does not place the action outside the prohibition of secondary boycotts.  When a purely secondary boycott reasonably can be expected to threaten neutral parties with ruin or substantial loss, the pressure on those parties must be viewed as at least one of the objects of the boycott, or the statutory prohibition would be rendered meaningless.  P.  456 U. S. 224.
(d) Neither is it a defense to the application of  8(b)(4)(B) that the reason for petitioner's boycott was not a labor dispute with a primary employer, but a political dispute with a foreign nation.  Section 8(b)(4)(B) contains no exception for ""political"" secondary boycotts, and its legislative history does not indicate that political disputes should be excluded from its scope.  Pp.  456 U.

(e) That respondent has alleged a violation of  8(b)(4)(B) does not infringe the First Amendment rights of petitioner or its members.  Conduct designed not to communicate, but to coerce, merits little consideration under that Amendment.  Pp.  456 U. S. 226-227.

Decided April 5, 1982
456 U.S. 45

Syllabus 
Petitioner, the challenger, in a general election, for respondent's office as a Commissioner of Jefferson County, Ky., committed himself, at a televised press conference, to lowering Commissioners' salaries if elected.  Upon learning that such commitment arguably violated a provision of the Kentucky Corrupt Practices Act ( 121.055), petitioner retracted his pledge.  On its face,  121.055 prohibits a candidate from offering material benefits to voters in consideration for their votes.  After petitioner won the election, respondent filed suit in a Kentucky state court, alleging that petitioner had violated  121.055 and seeking to have the election declared void.  Although finding that, under the reasoning of an earlier decision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals construing  121.055, petitioner had violated the statute by promising to reduce his salary to less than that ""fixed by law,"" the trial court concluded that petitioner had been ""fairly elected,"" and refused to order a new election.  The Kentucky Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Section 121.055 was applied in this case to limit speech in violation of the First Amendment.  Pp.  456 U. S. 522.
(a) Although the States have a legitimate interest in preserving the integrity of their electoral processes, when a State seeks to restrict directly a candidate's offer of ideas to the voters, the First Amendment requires that the restriction be demonstrably supported by not only a legitimate state interest, but a compelling one, and that the restriction operate without unnecessarily circumscribing protected expression.  Pp.  456 U. S. 52-54.
(b) The application of  121.055 in this case cannot be justified as a prohibition on buying votes.  Petitioner's statements, which were made openly and were subject to the criticism of his political opponent and to the scrutiny of the voters, were very different in character from corrupting private agreements and solicitations historically recognized as unprotected by the First Amendment.  There is no constitutional basis upon which his pledge to reduce his salary may be equated with a candidate's promise to pay voters privately for their support from his own pocketbook.  A candidate's promise to confer some ultimate benefit on the voter, qua taxpayer, citizen, or member of the general public, does not lie beyond the pale of First Amendment protection.  Pp.  456 U. S. 559. 
Page 456 U. S. 46

(c) If  121.055 was designed to further the State's interest in ensuring that the willingness of some persons to serve in public office without remuneration does not make gratuitous service the sine qua non of plausible candidacy -- resulting in persons of independent wealth but less ability being chosen over those who, though better qualified, cannot afford to serve at a reduced salary -- it chose a means unacceptable under the First Amendment.  The State's fear that voters might make an ill-advised choice does not provide the State with a compelling justification for limiting speech.  It is not the government's function to select which issues are worth discussing in the course of a political campaign.  Pp.  456 U. S. 59-60.
(d) Nor can application of  121.055 here be justified on the basis of the State's interests and prerogatives with respect to factual misstatements, on the asserted ground that the statute bars promises to serve at a reduced salary only when the salary of the official has been ""fixed by law"" and the promise cannot, therefore, be delivered.  Erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate, and it must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the ""breathing space"" that they need to survive.  Nullifying petitioner's election victory would be inconsistent with the atmosphere of robust political debate required by the First Amendment.  There was no showing that he made the disputed statement other than in good faith and without knowledge of its falsity, or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.  Moreover, he retracted the statement promptly after determining that it might have been false.  Pp.  456 U. S. 60-62.

Section 703(h) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that

Actions were brought in Federal District Court by black employees of petitioner employer and by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, charging that certain lines of progression for job advancement established by the employer in agreement with petitioner labor union after the effective date of the Act constituted a racially discriminatory seniority system in violation of Title VII of the Act.  The actions were consolidated for trial and injunctive relief was initially granted, but ultimately the Court of Appeals, without deciding whether the lines of progression were part of a seniority system, held that even if they were,  703(h) does not apply to seniority systems adopted after the effective date of the Act.
Held:  Section 703(h) is not limited to seniority systems adopted before the effective date of the Act.  To construe it as so limited is contrary to  703(h)'s plain language, inconsistent with this Court's prior cases, and counter to the national labor policy.

Syllabus 
A Texas statute ( 13.01) provides that a paternity suit to identify the natural father of an illegitimate child for purposes of obtaining support must be brought before the child is one year old, or the suit is barred.  Appellant mother of an illegitimate child and the Texas Department of Human Resources brought suit in a Texas court on behalf of the child to establish that appellee was his natural father.  The trial court dismissed the suit under  13.01 because the child was one year and seven months old when the suit was filed.  The Texas Court of Civil Appeals affirmed, holding that the one-year limitation was not tolled during minority, and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:  The one-year period for establishing paternity denies illegitimate children in Texas the equal protection of law.  Pp.  456 U. S. 97-101.
(a) A State that grants an opportunity for legitimate children to obtain paternal support must also grant that opportunity to illegitimate children, Gomez v. Perez, 409 U. S. 535, and this latter opportunity must be more than illusory, although it need not be coterminous with the procedures accorded legitimate children.  Pp.  456 U. S. 97-98.
(b) The period for obtaining support granted by Texas to illegitimate children must be of sufficient duration to present a reasonable opportunity for those with an interest in such children to assert claims on their behalf.  And the time limitation on that opportunity must be substantially related to the State's interest in avoiding the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims.

No. 80-1430

Decided April 5, 1982*
456 U.S. 107

Syllabus 
These cases present the question whether respondents, who were convicted after separate trials on unrelated charges in Ohio state courts, and who failed to comply with Ohio Rule of Criminal Procedure 30 mandating contemporaneous objections to jury instructions, may challenge the constitutionality of those instructions in federal habeas corpus proceedings under 28 U.S.C.  2254.  A provision of Ohio's Criminal Code ( 2901.05(A)), effective January 1, 1974, placed the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt upon the prosecution and provided that ""[t]he burden of going forward with the evidence of an affirmative defense is upon the accused.""  Until 1976, most Ohio courts assumed that the statute did not change Ohio's traditional rule requiring defendants to carry the burden of proving the affirmative defense of self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence.  In 1976, however, the Ohio Supreme Court, in State v. Robinson, 47 Ohio St.2d 103, 351 N.E.2d 88, held that the statute placed only the burden of production, not persuasion, on the defendant, and that, once the defendant produced some evidence of self-defense, the prosecutor had to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.  Respondents' trials occurred after  2901.05(A)'s effective date, but before the decision in Robinson, and none of the respondents objected to the trial court's jury instruction that the respondent bore the burden of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence.  The appropriate Ohio Courts of Appeal affirmed the homicide convictions of respondents Hughes and Bell before the decision in Robinson, and the Ohio Supreme Court declined to review their convictions.  Neither of these respondents challenged the self-defense instruction in their appeals.  On respondent Isaac's appeal of his assault conviction to the intermediate appellate court, he relied upon the intervening decision in Robinson to challenge the self-defense instruction given at his trial.  The court rejected the challenge as having been waived by Isaac's failure to comply with Ohio Rule of Criminal Procedure 30, and the Ohio Supreme 
Page 456 U. S. 108
 Court dismissed his appeal.  Each respondent unsuccessfully sought a writ of habeas corpus from a Federal District Court, but the Court of Appeals reversed all three District Court orders.
Held:
1. Insofar as respondents simply challenged the correctness of the self-defense instructions under Ohio law, they alleged no deprivation of federal rights, and were entitled to no federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C.  2254.  Respondents' habeas petitions raised only one colorable constitutional claim.  Pp.  456 U. S. 119-123.
(a) There is no merit to respondents' claim that  2901.05(A) implicitly designated absence of self-defense an element of the crimes charged against them, and thus due process required the prosecution to prove such element beyond a reasonable doubt.  Merely because a State requires the prosecution to prove a particular circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean that it has defined that circumstance as an element of the crime.  A State may want to assume the burden of disproving an affirmative defense without also designating absence of the defense an element of the crime.  The Due Process Clause does not mandate that, when a State treats absence of an affirmative defense as an ""element"" of the crime for one purpose, it must do so for all purposes.  Pp.  456 U. S. 119-121.
(b) A colorable constitutional claim is stated by respondents' argument that, since self-defense negates the elements of the crimes charged against them of voluntary, unlawful, and purposeful or knowing behavior, once the defendant raises the possibility of self-defense, the Due Process Clause requires that the State disprove that defense as part of its task of establishing voluntariness, unlawfulness, and guilty mens rea.  The controversy among lower courts as to the viability of this type of claim suggests that respondents' argument states at least a plausible constitutional claim.  Pp.  456 U. S. 121-123.
2. Respondents are barred from asserting, in federal habeas corpus proceedings, their constitutional claim, which was forfeited before the state courts because of respondents' failure to comply with Ohio Rule of Criminal Procedure 30.  Pp.  456 U. S. 124-135.
(a) While the writ of habeas corpus is a bulwark against convictions that violate ""fundamental fairness,"" it undermines the usual principles of finality of litigation.  Liberal allowance of the writ also degrades the prominence of the trial, and costs society the right to punish admitted offenders.  Moreover, the writ imposes special costs on the federal system, frustrating both the States' sovereign power to punish offenders and their good faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.  These costs are particularly high when a trial default has barred a prisoner from obtaining adjudication of his constitutional claim in the state courts, and thus, as held in Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, a state prisoner, 
Page 456 U. S. 109
 barred by procedural default from raising a constitutional claim on direct appeal, may not litigate that claim in a  2254 habeas corpus proceeding without showing cause for and actual prejudice from the default.  The principles of Sykes are not limited to cases in which the constitutional error did not affect the truthfinding function of the trial.  Pp.  456 U. S. 126-129.
(b) Cause for respondents' defaults cannot be based on the asserted ground that any objection to Ohio's self-defense instruction would have been futile, since Ohio had long required criminal defendants to bear the burden of proving such affirmative defense.  If a defendant perceives a viable constitutional claim and believes it may find favor in the federal courts, he may not bypass the state courts simply because he thinks they will be unsympathetic to the claim.  Nor can cause for respondents' defaults be based on the asserted ground that they could not have known at the time of their trials that the Due Process Clause addresses the burden of proving affirmative defenses.  In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, decided four and one-half years before the first of respondents' trials, laid the basis for their constitutional claim.  During the five years following that decision, numerous defendants relied upon Winship to argue that the Due Process Clause requires the prosecution to bear the burden of disproving certain affirmative defenses, and several lower courts sustained this claim.  In light of this activity, it cannot be said that respondents lacked the tools to construct their constitutional claim.  Pp.  456 U. S. 130-134.
(c) There is no merit to respondents' contention that the cause-and-prejudice standard of Sykes should be replaced by a plain error inquiry.  While federal courts apply a plain error rule for direct review of federal convictions, federal habeas challenges to state convictions entail greater finality problems and special comity concerns.  Moreover, a plain error standard is unnecessary to correct miscarriages of justice.  Victims of a fundamental miscarriage of justice will meet the cause-and-prejudice standard.  Pp.  456 U. S. 134-135.
646 F.2d 1129, 635 F.2d 575, and 642 F.2d 451, reversed and remanded.

No. 80-1595
Argued December 8, 1981
Decided April 5, 1982
456 U.S. 152

Syllabus 
In 1963, respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death by a jury in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, which at that time had exclusive jurisdiction over local felonies committed in the District.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which then acted as the local appellate court, upheld the conviction but set aside the death sentence, and respondent was then resentenced to a life term.  Respondent filed the present motion in the District Court under 28 U.S.C.  2255 (the latest in a long series of collateral attacks on his sentence), seeking to vacate the sentence on the ground that he was convicted by a jury erroneously instructed on the meaning of malice, thus allegedly eliminating any possibility of a manslaughter verdict.  The District Court denied the motion because respondent failed to challenge the instructions on direct appeal or in prior motions.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the proper standard to apply to respondent's claim was the ""plain error"" standard of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) governing relief on direct appeal from errors not objected to at trial, and, finding the challenged instruction plainly erroneous, vacated respondent's sentence and remanded the case for a new trial or entry of a manslaughter judgment.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the decision below and is not required to refrain from doing so on the alleged ground that the decision of the Court of Appeals was based on an adequate and independent local ground of decision.  There is no basis for concluding that the ruling below was or should have been grounded on local District of Columbia law, rather than on the general federal law applied to all  2255 motions.  Equal protection principles do not require that a  2255 motion by a prisoner convicted in 1963 be treated as though it were a motion under the District of Columbia Code after 1970.  Pp.  456 U. S. 159-162.
2. The Court of Appeals' use of Rule 52(b)'s ""plain error"" standard to review respondent's  2255 motion was contrary to long-established law.  Because it was intended for use on direct appeal, such standard is out of place when a prisoner launches a collateral attack against a conviction after society's legitimate interest in the finality of the judgment has been 
Page 456 U. S. 153
 perfected by the expiration of time allowed for direct review or by the affirmance of the conviction on appeal.  To obtain collateral relief, a prisoner must clear a significantly higher hurdle than would exist on direct appeal.  Pp.  456 U. S. 162-166.
3. The proper standard for review of respondent's conviction is the ""cause and actual prejudice"" standard, under which, to obtain collateral relief based on trial errors to which no contemporaneous objection was made, a convicted defendant must show both ""cause"" excusing his double procedural default and ""actual prejudice"" resulting from the errors of which he complains.  Pp.  456 U. S. 167-169.
4. Respondent has fallen far short of meeting his burden of showing not merely that the errors at his trial created a possibility of prejudice, but that they worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.  The strong uncontradicted evidence of malice in the record, coupled with respondent's utter failure to come forward with a colorable claim that he acted without malice, disposes of his contention that he suffered such actual prejudice that reversal of his conviction 19 years later could be justified.  Moreover, an examination of the jury instructions shows no substantial likelihood that the same jury that found respondent guilty of first-degree murder would have concluded, if only the malice instructions had been better framed, that his crime was only manslaughter.  Pp.  456 U. S. 169-175.

There is no basis for concluding that the ruling below was or should have been grounded on local District of Columbia law, rather than on the general federal law applied to all  2255 motions.  Equal protection principles do not require that a  2255 motion by a prisoner convicted in 1963 be treated as though it were a motion under the District of Columbia Code after 1970.  Pp.  456 U. S. 159-162.
2. The Court of Appeals' use of Rule 52(b)'s ""plain error"" standard to review respondent's  2255 motion was contrary to long-established law.  Because it was intended for use on direct appeal, such standard is out of place when a prisoner launches a collateral attack against a conviction after society's legitimate interest in the finality of the judgment has been 
Page 456 U. S. 153
 perfected by the expiration of time allowed for direct review or by the affirmance of the conviction on appeal.  To obtain collateral relief, a prisoner must clear a significantly higher hurdle than would exist on direct appeal.  Pp.  456 U. S. 162-166.
3. The proper standard for review of respondent's conviction is the ""cause and actual prejudice"" standard, under which, to obtain collateral relief based on trial errors to which no contemporaneous objection was made, a convicted defendant must show both ""cause"" excusing his double procedural default and ""actual prejudice"" resulting from the errors of which he complains.  Pp.  456 U. S. 167-169.
4. Respondent has fallen far short of meeting his burden of showing not merely that the errors at his trial created a possibility of prejudice, but that they worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.  The strong uncontradicted evidence of malice in the record, coupled with respondent's utter failure to come forward with a colorable claim that he acted without malice, disposes of his contention that he suffered such actual prejudice that reversal of his conviction 19 years later could be justified.  Moreover, an examination of the jury instructions shows no substantial likelihood that the same jury that found respondent guilty of first-degree murder would have concluded, if only the malice instructions had been better framed, that his crime was only manslaughter.  Pp.  456 U. S. 169-175.

Syllabus 
After the increase in Texas' congressional delegation resulting from the 1980 census, the Texas Legislature enacted a reapportionment plan (SB1) that was submitted to the Attorney General for preclearance under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Suit was then filed in Federal District Court challenging SB1's constitutionality and its validity under the Act.  The three-judge court delayed the proceedings pending action by the Attorney General, who ultimately objected to the lines drawn for two contiguous districts in south Texas (Districts 15 and 27) but concluded that the State had otherwise satisfied its burden of demonstrating that SB1 was nondiscriminatory in purpose and effect.  The court then formulated a plan which resolved the Attorney General's objection to Districts 15 and 27 and retained all other districts from SB1 except for those in Dallas County, for which the court devised its own districts.  One judge concluded that the SB1 plan for Dallas County was unconstitutional, while another concluded that, since SB1 was a nullity because of the Attorney General's action, the entire plan had to be a court-ordered plan that was subject to stricter standards than a legislative plan, and thus required the different districts for Dallas County.  Only that part of the District Court's judgment relating to Dallas County was appealed.
Held:
1. In the absence of any objection to the Dallas County districts by the Attorney General, and in the absence of any finding of a constitutional or statutory violation with respect to those districts, the District Court -- in effecting an interim apportionment plan -- must defer to the Texas Legislature's judgment reflected in SB1's districts for Dallas County.  Cf. White v. Weiser, 412 U. S. 783; Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124.
2. The District Court, in the first instance, should determine whether to modify its judgment and reschedule forthcoming congressional primary elections for Dallas County or, in spite of its erroneous refusal to adopt the SB1 districts for Dallas County, to allow the elections to proceed under its interim plan and present schedule.
536 F.Supp. 931, vacated and remanded.

Syllabus 
In May, 1970, the Army formally charged respondent, a captain in the Army Medical Corps, with the murders earlier that year of his pregnant wife and two children on a military reservation.  Later that year, the military charges were dismissed and the respondent was honorably discharged on the basis of hardship, but, at the Justice Department's request, the Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) continued its investigation of the homicides.  In June, 1972, the CID forwarded a report recommending further investigation, and the Justice Department, in 1974, ultimately presented the matter to a grand jury, which returned an indictment in January, 1975, charging respondent with the three murders.  On an interlocutory appeal from the District Court's denial of respondent's motion to dismiss the indictment, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the delay between the June, 1972, submission of the CID report to the Justice Department and the 1974 convening of the grand jury violated respondent's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.  After this Court's decision that respondent could not appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds until after completion of the trial, 435 U. S. 850, respondent was tried and convicted.  The Court of Appeals again held that the indictment violated respondent's right to a speedy trial, and dismissed the indictment.
Held:  The time between dismissal of the military charges and the subsequent indictment on civilian charges may not be considered in determining whether the delay in bringing respondent to trial violated his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment.  Pp.  456 U. S. 10. 
Page 456 U. S. 2

(a) The Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the period before a defendant is indicted, arrested, or otherwise officially accused.  Although delay prior to arrest or indictment may give rise to a due process claim under the Fifth Amendment or to a claim under any applicable statute of limitations, no Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial arises until charges are pending.  Similarly, any undue delay after the Government, acting in good faith, formally dismisses charges must be scrutinized under the Due Process Clause, not the Speedy Trial Clause.  Once charges are dismissed, the speedy trial guarantee -- which is designed primarily to minimize the possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but nevertheless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges -- is no longer applicable.  Following dismissal of charges, any restraint on liberty, disruption of employment, strain on financial resources, and exposure to public obloquy, stress and anxiety is no greater than it is upon anyone openly subject to a criminal investigation.  Pp.  456 U. S. 9.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in holding, in essence, that criminal charges were pending against respondent during the entire period between his military arrest and his later indictment on civilian charges.  Although respondent was subjected to stress and other adverse consequences flowing from the initial military charges and the continuing investigation after they were dismissed, he was not under arrest, not in custody, and not subject to any ""criminal prosecution"" until the civilian indictment was returned.  He was legally and constitutionally in the same posture as though no charges had been made; he was free to go about his affairs, to practice his profession, and to continue with his life.

456 U.S. 25

Syllabus 
In 1968, the President entered into an agreement with the Republic of the Philippines providing for the preferential employment of Filipino citizens at United States military bases in the Philippines.  In 1971, Congress enacted  106 of Pub.L. 92-129, which prohibits employment discrimination against United States citizens on military bases overseas unless permitted by ""treaty.""  Thereafter, respondent United States citizens residing in the Philippines were notified that their jobs at a naval base there were being converted into local national positions in accordance with the 1968 agreement.  After unsuccessfully pursuing an administrative remedy, respondents then filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the preferential employment provisions of the agreement violated  106.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The word ""treaty"" as used in  106 includes executive agreements, such as the one involved here, and is not limited to those international agreements concluded by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate pursuant to Art. II,  2, cl. 2, of the Constitution.  Pp.  456 U. S. 28-36.
(a) In view of the fact that Congress has not been consistent in various other Acts in distinguishing between Art. II treaties and other forms of international agreements, it is not dispositive that Congress in 106 used the term ""treaty"" without specifically including international agreements that are not Art. II treaties.  But in the case of a statute, such as  106, that touches upon the United States' foreign policy, there is a particularly justifiable reason to construe Congress' use of ""treaty"" to include international agreements as well as Art. II treaties.  Cf. B. Altman & Co. v. United States, 224 U. S. 583.  To construe  106 otherwise would mean that Congress intended to repudiate 13 existing executive agreements, including the one in this case, providing for preferential hiring of local nationals.  Pp.  456 U. S. 28-32.
(b) The legislative history of  106 provides no support for attributing such an intent to Congress, but rather discloses that Congress was primarily concerned with the financial hardship to American servicemen

 that resulted from employment discrimination against American citizens at overseas bases.  Pp.  456 U. S. 32 36.

Syllabus 
Respondent Railroad, formerly under private ownership, was acquired by New York State in 1966 and is engaged in interstate commerce.  Some 13 years later, petitioner Union, representing the Railroad's employees, and the Railroad failed to reach an agreement after conducting collective bargaining negotiations pursuant to the Railway Labor Act, and mediation efforts also failed to produce agreement.  This triggered a 30-day cooling-off period under that Act, at the expiration of which the Act permits a union to resort to a strike.  Anticipating that New York would challenge the Railway Labor Act's applicability to the Railroad, the Union sued in Federal District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the labor dispute was covered by that Act and not the Taylor Law, the New York law prohibiting strikes by public employees.  The Railroad then filed suit in a New York state court, seeking to enjoin an impending strike by the Union under the Taylor Law.  Before the state court acted, the Federal District Court held that the Railroad was subject to the Railway Labor Act, and that that Act, rather than the Taylor Law, was applicable.  The District Court rejected the Railroad's argument that application of the Railway Labor Act to a state-owned railroad was inconsistent with National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833, wherein it was held that Congress could not impose the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act on state and local governments.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the operation of the Railroad was an integral state governmental function, that the Railway Labor Act displaced ""essential governmental decisions"" involving that function, and that the State's interest in controlling the operation of the Railroad outweighed the federal interest in having the federal Act apply.

Life & Accident & Health Insurance Guaranty Assn.
No. 80-1496
Argued November 9, 1981
Decided March 24, 1982
455 U.S. 691

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an Indiana stock insurance corporation, as required by law to do business in North Carolina, was a member of respondent North Carolina Life and Accident and Health Insurance Guaranty Association (North Carolina Association), which, under a North Carolina statute, is ultimately responsible for fulfilling the policy obligations of members that become insolvent or otherwise fail to meet their policy obligations.  Because of its questionable financial condition, petitioner was required by respondent North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance to post a $100,000 deposit for the benefit of its North Carolina policyholders.  Subsequently, rehabilitation proceedings were brought against petitioner in an Indiana state court (Rehabilitation Court), in which the North Carolina Association intervened and in which the court certified a class consisting of all past and present policyholders.  The Rehabilitation Court ultimately ruled in 1978 that all pre-rehabilitation claims to the deposit were compromised, settled, and dismissed by the court's 1976 order which adopted a rehabilitation plan and which ruled that the court had jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the parties.  In the meantime, when a dispute arose between petitioner and the North Carolina Association as to the rehabilitation plan's effect on use of the North Carolina deposit, the North Carolina Association filed suit in a North Carolina state court, seeking a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to use the deposit to fulfill the pre-rehabilitation contractual obligations to North Carolina policyowners that had been compromised in the rehabilitation proceeding.  Holding that the North Carolina statutes governing the North Carolina Association and the $100,000 deposit deprived the Rehabilitation Court of subject matter jurisdiction to determine rights in the deposit, the North Carolina court refused to honor the Rehabilitation Court's prior ruling as to claims to the deposit.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, a judgment of a court in one State is conclusive upon the merits in another State only if the court in the first State had power to pass on the merits -- that is, had jurisdiction

(a) Regardless of the validity, under North Carolina law, of the North Carolina courts' holding that the Rehabilitation Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to determine the rights in the deposit, it is not an appropriate ground for refusing to accord the Indiana judgments full faith and credit.  The principles of res judicata apply to questions of jurisdiction, and
""a judgment is entitled to full faith and credit -- even as to questions of jurisdiction -- when the second court's inquiry discloses that those questions have been fully and fairly litigated and finally decided in the court which rendered the original judgment.""
Durfee v. Duke, supra, at  375 U. S. 111.  The record here establishes that the Rehabilitation Court fully and fairly considered whether it had subject matter jurisdiction to settle the pre-rehabilitation claims of the parties before it to the North Carolina deposit.  As an intervening party, the North Carolina Association was obliged to advance its argument that the court did not have authority to settle pre-rehabilitation claims to the deposit when it was given the opportunity to do so.  Pp.  455 U. S. 705-710.
(b) The North Carolina courts' refusal to give the Indiana judgments full faith and credit cannot be supported on the asserted ground that the Rehabilitation Court lacked in personam jurisdiction over North Carolina policyowners, because no policyowner actually appeared in the rehabilitation proceedings and because the class representatives could not adequately represent the policyowners in both deposit and nondeposit States.  Respondents have not identified any current interest in the North Carolina deposit that a policyowner might have, independent of the interests asserted by the North Carolina Association.  North Carolina law requires the Association to provide North Carolina policyowners with pre-rehabilitation coverage even if it cannot use the deposit to finance this obligation.  Therefore, these policyowners have no current interest in whether the Association is allowed to liquidate the deposit.  Pp.  455 U. S. 711-713.
(c) Nor can refusal to give full faith and credit to the Rehabilitation Court's judgments be supported on the asserted ground that the court lacked in personam jurisdiction over North Carolina officials.  Although the Rehabilitation Court did not attempt to exercise jurisdiction over the North Carolina trustees of the deposit, it did purport to exercise jurisdiction over the trust corpus; its 1978 order specified that the 1976 rehabilitation plan determined that the deposit was an asset of petitioner, subject to the court's jurisdiction.  Regardless of whether this conclusion 
Page 455 U. S. 693
 might have been erroneous as a matter of North Carolina law, the jurisdictional issue was fully and fairly litigated and finally determined by the Rehabilitation Court, and the North Carolina courts were required to honor the Rehabilitation Court's determination.  A court of competent jurisdiction can settle the claims of two competing parties to specific property even though a third party may claim an interest in the same res.  Pp.  455 U. S. 713-715.
(d) There may be merit, as a matter of insurance law, in respondent's arguments that honoring the Rehabilitation Court's determination that the deposit was an asset of petitioner would negate North Carolina' comprehensive statutory scheme to ensure protection of North Carolina policyowners, and that a State has a right to segregate assets of a foreign insurance company to be used for the sole benefit of that State's policyowners.  However, the only forums in which respondents may challenge the Rehabilitation Court's assertion of jurisdiction on such grounds are in Indiana, not North Carolina.  Pp.  455 U. S. 715-716.

Life & Accident & Health Insurance Guaranty Assn.
No. 80-1496
Argued November 9, 1981
Decided March 24, 1982
455 U.S. 691

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an Indiana stock insurance corporation, as required by law to do business in North Carolina, was a member of respondent North Carolina Life and Accident and Health Insurance Guaranty Association (North Carolina Association), which, under a North Carolina statute, is ultimately responsible for fulfilling the policy obligations of members that become insolvent or otherwise fail to meet their policy obligations.  Because of its questionable financial condition, petitioner was required by respondent North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance to post a $100,000 deposit for the benefit of its North Carolina policyholders.  Subsequently, rehabilitation proceedings were brought against petitioner in an Indiana state court (Rehabilitation Court), in which the North Carolina Association intervened and in which the court certified a class consisting of all past and present policyholders.  The Rehabilitation Court ultimately ruled in 1978 that all pre-rehabilitation claims to the deposit were compromised, settled, and dismissed by the court's 1976 order which adopted a rehabilitation plan and which ruled that the court had jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the parties.  In the meantime, when a dispute arose between petitioner and the North Carolina Association as to the rehabilitation plan's effect on use of the North Carolina deposit, the North Carolina Association filed suit in a North Carolina state court, seeking a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to use the deposit to fulfill the pre-rehabilitation contractual obligations to North Carolina policyowners that had been compromised in the rehabilitation proceeding.  Holding that the North Carolina statutes governing the North Carolina Association and the $100,000 deposit deprived the Rehabilitation Court of subject matter jurisdiction to determine rights in the deposit, the North Carolina court refused to honor the Rehabilitation Court's prior ruling as to claims to the deposit.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, a judgment of a court in one State is conclusive upon the merits in another State only if the court in the first State had power to pass on the merits -- that is, had jurisdiction 
Page 455 U. S. 692
 over the subject matter and the relevant parties.  Cf. Durfee v. Duke, 375 U. S. 106.  In this case, the North Carolina courts violated the Full Faith and Credit Clause by refusing to treat the Rehabilitation Court's prior judgments as res judicata.  Pp.  455 U. S. 703-716.

Syllabus 
Sandia Corporation and Zia Company have contracts with the Federal Government to manage certain Government-owned atomic laboratories located in New Mexico.  Los Alamos Constructors, Inc., has a Government contract for construction and repair work at one of the laboratories.  The contracts use an ""advanced funding"" procedure to meet contractor costs whereby the contractor is allowed to pay creditors and employees with drafts drawn on a special bank account in which United States Treasury funds are deposited, so that only federal funds are expended when the contractor meets its obligations.  New Mexico imposes a gross receipts tax and a compensating use tax on those doing business within the State.  The gross receipts tax in effect operates as a tax on the sale of goods and services.  The use tax is imposed on property acquired out-of-state in a transaction that would have been subject to the gross receipts tax if it had occurred within the State.  The Government brought suit in Federal District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that advanced funds are not taxable gross receipts to the contractors; that the receipts of vendors selling property to the Government through the contractors cannot be taxed by the State; and that the use of Government-owned property by the contractors is not subject to the- use tax.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the Government.  The Court of Appeals reversed, taking the view that the Government-contractor relationships in question did not so incorporate the contractors into the Government structure as to make them ""instrumentalities of the United States"" immune from the New Mexico taxes.
Held:  The contractors, as independent taxable entities, are not protected by the Constitution's guarantee of federal supremacy, and hence are subject to the state taxes in question.   Pp.  455 U. S. 730-744.
(a) Federal immunity from state taxation cannot be conferred simply because the tax has an effect on the United States, or because the Federal Government shoulders the entire economic burden of the levy, or because the tax falls on the earnings of a contractor providing services to the Government.  And where a use tax is involved, immunity cannot be conferred simply because the State levies the tax on the use of federal property in private hands, or, indeed, simply because the tax is paid with 
Page 455 U. S. 721
 Government funds.  Tax immunity is appropriate only when the state levy falls on the United States itself, or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities, at least insofar as the activity being taxed is concerned.  A finding of constitutional tax immunity therefore requires something more than the invocation of traditional agency notions.  Pp.  455 U. S. 730-738.
(b) With respect to the New Mexico use tax, the contractors cannot be termed ""constituent parts"" of the Federal Government.  The congruence of professional interests between the contractors and the Government is not complete, the contractors' relationship with the Government having been created for limited and carefully defined purposes.  Allowing a State to apply use taxes to such entities does not offend the notion of federal supremacy.  United Sates v. Boyd, 378 U. S. 39.  For similar reasons, the New Mexico gross receipts tax must be upheld as applied to funds received by the contractors to meet salaries and internal costs.  As to the tax on sales to the contractors, the facts that Sandia and Zia make purchases in their own names and presumably are themselves liable to the vendors, that the vendors are not informed that the Government is the only party with an independent interest in the purchase, and that the contractors need not obtain Government approval for each purchase, all demonstrate that the contractors have a substantial independent role in making purchases, and that the identity of interests between the Government and the contractors is far from complete.  As a result, sales to Sandia and Zia are in neither a real nor a symbolic sense sales to the ""United States itself.""  Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, 347 U. S. 110, distinguished.

Syllabus 
Under New York law, the State may terminate, over parental objection, the rights of parents in their natural child upon a finding that the child is ""permanently neglected.""  The New York Family Court Act ( 622) requires that only a ""fair preponderance of the evidence"" support that finding.  Neglect proceedings were brought in Family Court to terminate petitioners' rights as natural parents in their three children.  Rejecting petitioners' challenge to the constitutionality of  622's ""fair preponderance of the evidence"" standard, the Family Court weighed the evidence under that standard and found permanent neglect.  After a subsequent dispositional hearing, the Family Court ruled that the best interests of the children required permanent termination of petitioners' custody.  The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court affirmed, and the New York Court of Appeals dismissed petitioners' appeal to that court.
Held:
1. Process is constitutionally due a natural parent at a state-initiated parental rights termination proceeding.  Pp.  455 U. S. 752-757.
(a) The fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care custody, and management of their child is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, and does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State.  A parental rights termination proceeding interferes with that fundamental liberty interest.  When the State moves to destroy weakened familial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.  Pp.  455 U. S. 752-754.
(b) The nature of the process due in parental rights termination proceedings turns on a balancing of three factors:  the private interests affected by the proceedings; the risk of error created by the State's chosen procedure; and the countervailing governmental interest supporting use of the challenged procedure.  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319,  424 U. S. 335.  In any given proceeding, the minimum standard of proof tolerated by the due process requirement reflects not only the weight of the public and 
Page 455 U. S. 746
 private interests affected, but also a societal judgment about how the risk of error should be distributed between the litigants.  The minimum standard is a question of federal law which this Court may resolve.  Retrospective case-by-case review cannot preserve fundamental fairness when a class of proceedings is governed by a constitutionally defective evidentiary standard.  Pp.  455 U. S. 754-757.
2. The ""fair preponderance of the evidence"" standard prescribed by  622 violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  455 U. S. 758-768.
(a) The balance of private interests affected weighs heavily against use of such a standard in parental rights termination proceedings, since the private interest affected is commanding, and the threatened loss is permanent.  Once affirmed on appeal, a New York decision terminating parental rights is final and irrevocable.  Pp.  455 U. S. 758-761.
(b) A preponderance standard does not fairly allocate the risk of an erroneous factfinding between the State and the natural parents.  In parental rights termination proceedings, which bear many of the indicia of a criminal trial, numerous factors combine to magnify the risk of erroneous factfinding.  Coupled with the preponderance standard, these factors create a significant prospect of erroneous termination of parental rights.  A standard of proof that allocates the risk of error nearly equally between an erroneous failure to terminate, which leaves the child in an uneasy status quo, and an erroneous termination, which unnecessarily destroys the natural family, does not reflect properly the relative severity of these two outcomes.  Pp.  455 U. S. 761-766.
(c) A standard of proof more strict than preponderance of the evidence is consistent with the two state interests at stake in parental rights termination proceedings -- a parens patriae interest in preserving and promoting the child's welfare and a fiscal and administrative interest in reducing the cost and burden of such proceedings.  Pp.  455 U. S. 766-768.
3. Before a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.  A ""clear and convincing evidence"" standard adequately conveys to the factfinder the level of subjective certainty about his factual conclusions necessary to satisfy due process.  Determination of the precise burden equal to or greater than that standard is a matter of state law properly left to state legislatures and state courts.  Pp.  455 U. S. 768-770.

Syllabus 
Respondent Riley (hereafter respondent) awoke on the morning of November 20, 1975, with severe pains in his neck, shoulders, and arms.  Subsequently, he filed a claim for disability benefits under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (Act), alleging that he suffered an accidental injury in the course of his employment on November 19, 1975, when he was lifting duct work and felt a sharp pain in his neck.  The Administrative Law Judge found that the accident never occurred, and denied the claim, and the Benefits Review Board affirmed.  The Court of Appeals vacated the Board's decision, holding that respondent suffered an ""injury"" when he awakened in pain on November 20, and that, under  20(a) of the Act -- which provides that, in any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under the Act, ""it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary . . . [t]hat the claim comes within the provisions of [the Act]"" -- respondent was entitled to a presumption that the injury was ""employment-bred.""
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in invoking the  20(a) presumption in support of a claim that respondent did not make, he having claimed that he was injured at work, and not that the ""injury"" occurred at home and that it was somehow ""employment-bred.""  In this case, there is no reason to depart from the specific statutory direction that a claim be made, and that the presumption, however construed, attach to the claim.  Pp.  455 U. S. 612-615.

			"|"U.S. Industries/Federal Sheet Metal, Inc. v. Director,
Office of Workers' Compensation Programs
No. 80-518
Argued October 6, 1981
Decided March 23, 1982
455 U.S. 608

Syllabus 
Respondent Riley (hereafter respondent) awoke on the morning of November 20, 1975, with severe pains in his neck, shoulders, and arms.  Subsequently, he filed a claim for disability benefits under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (Act), alleging that he suffered an accidental injury in the course of his employment on November 19, 1975, when he was lifting duct work and felt a sharp pain in his neck.  The Administrative Law Judge found that the accident never occurred, and denied the claim, and the Benefits Review Board affirmed.  The Court of Appeals vacated the Board's decision, holding that respondent suffered an ""injury"" when he awakened in pain on November 20, and that, under  20(a) of the Act -- which provides that, in any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under the Act, ""it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary . . . [t]hat the claim comes within the provisions of [the Act]"" -- respondent was entitled to a presumption that the injury was ""employment-bred.""
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in invoking the  20(a) presumption in support of a claim that respondent did not make, he having claimed that he was injured at work, and not that the ""injury"" occurred at home and that it was somehow ""employment-bred.""  In this case, there is no reason to depart from the specific statutory direction that a claim be made, and that the presumption, however construed, attach to the claim.  Pp.  455 U. S. 612-615.
2. The Court of Appeals also erred in its use of the term ""injury"" as including respondent's attack of pain occurring on the morning of November 20.  The Act defines ""injury"" as an ""accidental injury . . . arising out of and in the course of employment,"" so that a prima facie ""claim for compensation,"" to which the  20(a) presumption refers, must at least allege an injury that arose in the course of employment, as well as out of employment.

No. 80-1240
Argued December 1, 1981
Decided March 23, 1982
455 U.S. 624

Syllabus 
In 1975, both respondents pleaded guilty in unrelated Illinois state court prosecutions for burglary, an offense punishable at that time by imprisonment for an indeterminate term of years and a mandatory 3-year parole term.  Neither respondent, during his plea acceptance hearing, was informed that his negotiated sentence included the mandatory parole term.  Each respondent completed his prison sentence, was released on parole, and was then reincarcerated for parole violation.  While in custody, each filed petitions for federal habeas corpus, which were consolidated in the District Court, alleging that the failure of the trial courts to advise them of the mandatory parole requirement before accepting their guilty pleas deprived them of due process of law.  The District Court found for respondents and, in accordance with the relief requested by them, merely ordered their release through ""specific performance"" of the plea bargains, rather than nullifying the guilty pleas and allowing them to plead anew.  After a remand from the Court of Appeals based on a question as to exhaustion of state remedies, the District Court ultimately again entered judgment for respondents.  Since they had already been discharged from custody, the court simply entered an order ""declaring void the mandatory parole term[s].""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Respondents' claims for relief are moot.  Assuming that the failure to advise respondents of the mandatory parole requirement rendered their guilty pleas void, they could have sought to have their convictions set aside and to plead anew, and this case would not then be moot.  Such relief would free them from all consequences flowing from their convictions, as well as subject them to reconviction with a possibly greater sentence, thus preserving a live controversy to determine whether a constitutional violation had occurred and whether respondents were entitled to the relief sought.  However, by seeking ""specific enforcement"" of the plea agreement by elimination of the mandatory parole term from their sentences, respondents instead elected to attack only their sentences, and to remedy the alleged constitutional violation by removing the consequence that gave rise to the constitutional harm.  Since their parole terms have now expired, they are no longer subject to any direct restraint

 as a result of the parole terms, and the case is moot.  Neither the doctrine that an attack on a criminal conviction is not rendered moot by the fact that the underlying sentence has expired nor the doctrine that a case is not moot where it is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review,"" is applicable here.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted in Federal District Court of two counts of violating 18 U.S.C.  2314, which prohibits the transportation ""in interstate or foreign commerce [of] any . . . forged . . . securities . . knowing the same to have been . . . forged.""  The proof at trial showed that blank checks had been stolen in Ohio, and that, several months later, petitioner used two of the checks, on which signatures had been forged, to pay for a car and for a boat and trailer purchased in separate transactions in Pennsylvania.  The trial court instructed the jury that, in order to find petitioner guilty, it must find that he transported the checks in a forged condition in ""interstate commerce,"" and that such transportation could take place entirely within Pennsylvania if it was a ""continuation of the movement that began out of state.""  The court rejected petitioner's objection to the instruction on the asserted ground that, under  2314, the Government had the burden of proving that the checks had been forged in Ohio before being transported across state lines to Pennsylvania.  The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's convictions.
Held:  Section 2314 does not require proof that the securities were forged before being taken across state lines, and thus the trial court's jury instructions were correct.  Pp.  455 U. S. 647-659.
(a) Use of the past tense ""forged"" in  2314 does not establish Congress' intent to prohibit only the transportation of securities that were forged before crossing state lines.  Congress' use of the phrase ""interstate commerce,"" rather than ""state borders,"" as well as the legislative history of the phrase, shows that Congress intended it to be as broad in scope as this Court's decisions holding that interstate commerce begins well before state lines are crossed and ends only when movement of the item in question has ceased in the destination State.  Moreover,  2314's purpose of aiding the States in detection and punishment of criminals who evade state authorities by using channels of interstate commerce supports the conclusion that Congress could not have intended to require federal prosecutors to prove that the securities had been forged before crossing state lines.  Pp.  455 U. S. 648-656.
(b) The language of  2314 does not raise significant questions of ambiguity sufficient to warrant application of the principle of lenity and construction

Held:  The Federal District Court properly dismissed respondent state prisoner's habeas corpus petition asserting that he had been denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel because an application for certiorari -- filed by his retained counsel in the Florida Supreme Court to review the Florida District Court of Appeal's affirmance of respondent's state conviction -- had been dismissed as not having been timely filed.  Respondent did not contest the District Court's finding that review by the Florida Supreme Court was discretionary.  Since a criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to counsel to pursue discretionary state appeals, Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.

455 U.S. 591

Syllabus 
Title 28 U.S.C.  2254(d) requires federal courts in habeas corpus proceedings to accord a presumption of correctness to state court findings of fact unless specified factors are present.  In earlier proceedings in this case, this Court held that the Court of Appeals had not followed  2254(d) in concluding -- contrary to the California Court of Appeal's decision on respondent's appeal from his state murder conviction -- that pretrial photographic lineup procedures used by the state police were so impermissibly suggestive as to deprive respondent of due process.  The case was remanded so that the federal court could review its determination and either apply the statutory presumption of correctness of the state court findings or explain why the presumption did not apply in light of the factors listed in  2254(d).  The Court of Appeals then concluded that  2254(d) was irrelevant in this case because its findings of fact did not differ from those of the state court, the disagreement being over the constitutional significance of certain facts.  It reinstated its conclusion that the pretrial procedures were impermissibly suggestive and that respondent therefore was entitled to release or a new trial.
Held:  The case must be remanded again.  The ultimate question as to the constitutionality of the pretrial identification procedures is a mixed question of law and fact that is not governed by  2254(d).  In deciding this question, the federal courts may give different weight to the facts as found by the state court, and may reach a different conclusion in light of the legal standard.  However, the questions of fact that underlie this ultimate conclusion are governed by the statutory presumption.  Thus, the circumstances of the pretrial identification procedures in this case present questions of fact as to which the statutory presumption applies.  The Court of Appeals should either apply the presumption or explain why it is not applicable in view of the factors listed in the statute.

No. 81-1049
Decided March 22, 1982
455 U.S. 603

Syllabus 
Held:  Respondent was not denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment by the prosecutor's use, at respondent's state court trial which resulted in a conviction for first-degree manslaughter, of his post-arrest silence for impeachment purposes -- the record not indicating that respondent had been given the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, during the period in which he remained silent immediately after his arrest.  In testifying in his own defense, respondent stated for the first time that he acted in self-defense in stabbing the victim, and that the stabbing was accidental.  The prosecutor then cross-examined him as to why he had failed to advance his exculpatory explanation to the arresting officers.  Absent the sort of affirmative assurances embodied in the Miranda warnings -- which at least implicitly assure the defendant that his silence will not be used against him -- a State does not violate due process by permitting cross-examination as to post-arrest silence when a defendant chooses to take the stand.  Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610 (where Miranda warnings were given), distinguished.

Held:  Respondent was not denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment by the prosecutor's use, at respondent's state court trial which resulted in a conviction for first-degree manslaughter, of his post-arrest silence for impeachment purposes -- the record not indicating that respondent had been given the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, during the period in which he remained silent immediately after his arrest.  In testifying in his own defense, respondent stated for the first time that he acted in self-defense in stabbing the victim, and that the stabbing was accidental.  The prosecutor then cross-examined him as to why he had failed to advance his exculpatory explanation to the arresting officers.  Absent the sort of affirmative assurances embodied in the Miranda warnings -- which at least implicitly assure the defendant that his silence will not be used against him -- a State does not violate due process by permitting cross-examination as to post-arrest silence when a defendant chooses to take the stand.  Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610 (where Miranda warnings were given), distinguished.
Certiorari granted; 658 F.2d 1126, reversed and remanded."|

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 22, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Opinion of Justice STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
 Although I believe that Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, was decided incorrectly, it is not at all clear to me that the Court of Appeals in this case misapplied the dicta in the Court's opinion in Jackson. The Court of Appeals did not purport to resolve any conflict in the evidence. Quite properly it attached no weight to the fact that the defendant did not testify, or to the fact that his mother may have testified falsely in support of an alibi defense. Neither of those facts is affirmative evidence of guilt. 
 Based on their duty to ""review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,"" 662 F.2d 420, 423 (CA6 1981), a majority of the judges of the Court of Appeals concluded-as had the District Court and two of five justices of the Michigan Supreme Court-that there was insufficient evidence in the record that the respondent had intended to commit a crime.

 post, at 1031, or to imply that these conscientious federal judges chose "" to sit as a jury and set aside the lawful jury's findings of fact."" Post, at 1033. What the Court of Appeals did conclude was that evidence that the respondent, like several other boys, was present at the scene of the crime was legally insufficient to permit any rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent was a participant in that crime. See 662 F.2d, at 423. The essence of the Court of Appeals decision is explained in the following few paragraphs: 
 ""The district court correctly concluded that the evidence introduced at petitioner's trial only showed that on the morning of May 18 Fuller was present at the Turner residence along with Zerious Meadows and the other boys. The evidence showed that Fuller looked around while Meadows started the fires. But as Judge Feikens pointed out: 
 "" 'This suggests, as Jeffrey Coleman surmised, that the petitioner may have been acting as a lookout for Meadows. It is reasonable speculation. But could a rational jury find it to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt? No evidence was presented that the petitioner intended to burn the Turner home. The evidence that he knew that Zerious Meadows planned to do [sic] is simply too meager to support conviction.' (emphasis in original) 
 ""We note that there was no evidence at trial that the 'Molotov cocktail' which started the fire was prepared in advance, or, if it was, whether any of the boys other than Zerious Meadows knew that the 'Molotov cocktail' existed. There was of course no evidence that any of the boys, except Fuller [sic], participated in the manufacture of the 'Molotov cocktail'.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 231, 2971, 2973 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 Petitioner seeks review of the State Supreme Court's decision upholding his murder conviction and death sentence. He argues that his conviction and death sentence should be set aside because they were based in part on evidence obtained in flagrant violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. He objects to the State Supreme Court's holding that, by calling the Chief of Police for assistance, he consented to a broad-ranging 12 day search of his furniture store.

Decided March 8, 1982
455 U.S. 551

Syllabus 
After respondents purchased a $50,000 certificate of deposit, with a 6-year maturity, from petitioner federally regulated bank, they pledged it to petitioner to guarantee a $65,000 loan made to a company that owed petitioner $33,000 for prior loans and was also overdrawn on its checking account.  In consideration for guaranteeing the new loan, the company's owners entered into an agreement with respondents whereby respondents were to receive a share of the company's profits and other compensation.  The new loan, rather than being used as working capital by the company as petitioner's officers allegedly told respondents it would, was applied to pay the company's overdue obligations to petitioner.  Subsequently, the company became bankrupt, and petitioner disclosed its intention to claim the pledged certificate of deposit.  Respondents then brought suit in Federal District Court, claiming that petitioner violated, inter alia, the antifraud provisions of  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Act) by soliciting the loan guarantee while knowing, but not disclosing, the borrowing company's financial plight or petitioner's plans to repay itself from the guaranteed loan.  The District Court granted summary judgment in petitioner's favor, holding that, if a wrong occurred, it did not occur ""in connection with the purchase or sale of any security"" as required for liability under  10(b).  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that it could reasonably be found that either the certificate of deposit or the agreement between respondents and the company's owners was a security.
Held:  Neither the certificate of deposit nor the agreement in question is a security within the meaning of  10(b).  Pp.  455 U. S. 555-561.
(a) While the definition of ""security"" in the Act is quite broad, Congress, in enacting the securities laws, did not intend to provide a broad federal remedy for all fraud.  Pp.  455 U. S. 555-556.
(b) A certificate of deposit is not the functional equivalent of the withdrawable capital shares of a savings and loan association held to be securities in Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332, nor is it similar to any other long-term debt obligation commonly found to be a security.

No. 8141
Argued January 13, 1982
Decided March 8, 1982
455 U.S. 562

Syllabus 
A 1974 collective bargaining agreement between the United Mine Workers of America and the Bituminous Coal Operators' Association increased health benefits, payable out of a trust fund financed by contributions from the operators, for widows of coal miners who died prior to the effective date of the agreement and who were receiving pensions when they died, but did not increase such benefits for widows of miners who died prior to the effective date and were still working at the time of death, even though they were eligible for pensions.  Respondents, widows of miners who died in 1967 and 1971, respectively, and were eligible for pensions but were still working at the time of their deaths, brought a class action in Federal District Court against the trustees of the fund, alleging that the requirement that a miner be receiving a pension at the time of his death in order to make his widow eligible for the increased health benefits had no rational relationship to the purposes of the trust fund, and therefore was illegal under  302 of the Labor Management Relations Act.  The District Court denied relief.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  302(c)(5), which requires jointly administered pension trusts to be maintained ""for the sole and exclusive benefit of employees . . . and their families and dependents,"" means that eligibility rules fixed by a collective bargaining agreement must meet a reasonableness standard, and that, in this case, the trustees were unable to produce an acceptable explanation for the discrimination between widows of pensioners and widows of pension-eligible miners.
Held:  Section 302(c)(5) does not authorize federal courts to review for reasonableness the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, such as the provisions in question, allocating health benefits among potential beneficiaries of an employee benefit trust fund.  Pp.  455 U. S. 570-576.
(a) Section 302(c)(5)'s language embodies no reasonableness requirement.  Its plain meaning is simply that employer contributions to employee benefit trust funds must accrue to the benefit of employees and their families and dependents, to the exclusion of all others.  P.  455 U. S. 570.
(b) This reading is amply supported by the legislative history, which indicates that  302(c)(5) was meant to protect employees from the risk 
Page 455 U. S. 563
 that funds contributed by their employers for the benefit of the employees and their families might be diverted to other union purposes, or even to union leaders' private benefit.  Pp.  455 U. S. 570-572.
(c) Such interpretation is also supported by  302(c)(5)'s other requirements prescribing the conditions that must be satisfied to exempt employer contributions to pension funds from a criminal sanction.  P.  455 U. S. 572.
(d) Absent conflict with federal law, the trustees here breached no fiduciary duties in administering the trust fund in question in accordance with the 1974 collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  455 U. S. 573-574.
(e) When neither the collective bargaining process nor its end product violates any command of Congress, a federal court has no authority to modify the substantive terms of a collective bargaining contract.  Pp.  455 U. S. 574-576.

(b) This reading is amply supported by the legislative history, which indicates that  302(c)(5) was meant to protect employees from the risk 
Page 455 U. S. 563
 that funds contributed by their employers for the benefit of the employees and their families might be diverted to other union purposes, or even to union leaders' private benefit.  Pp.  455 U. S. 570-572.
(c) Such interpretation is also supported by  302(c)(5)'s other requirements prescribing the conditions that must be satisfied to exempt employer contributions to pension funds from a criminal sanction.  P.  455 U. S. 572.
(d) Absent conflict with federal law, the trustees here breached no fiduciary duties in administering the trust fund in question in accordance with the 1974 collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  455 U. S. 573-574.
(e) When neither the collective bargaining process nor its end product violates any command of Congress, a federal court has no authority to modify the substantive terms of a collective bargaining contract.  Pp.  455 U. S. 574-576.

Syllabus 
Section 310(a) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 lists three categories of plaintiffs who may challenge the constitutionality of any provision of the Act in a federal district court action in which the district court must certify all questions of constitutionality to the court of appeals sitting en banc:  (1) the Federal Election Commission, (2) ""the national committee of any political party,"" and (3) ""any individual eligible to vote in any election for the office of President.""  Appellants, two trade associations and three political action committees (PAC's), filed an action in Federal District Court, challenging the validity of the provisions of the Act limiting the extent to which such associations and their PAC's may solicit funds for political purposes, and sought expedited consideration of the action under  310(a).  The District Court denied such consideration on the ground that appellants were not within any of the three categories listed as eligible to invoke  310(a)'s expedited procedures.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that  310(a) is available for use by plaintiffs whether they belong to an enumerated category or not, and, on subsequent certification from the District Court, upheld the challenged solicitation provisions.
Held:  Only parties belonging to one of the three categories listed in  310(a) may invoke its expedited procedures, and since appellants are not within any of those categories, they may not invoke such procedures.  The text of  310(a) states plainly enough which plaintiffs may invoke its special procedures.  This plain language controls the construction of  310(a), absent ""clear evidence"" of a ""clearly expressed"" contrary congressional intent, and appellants have not met the burden of showing such ""clear evidence"" of a contrary intent.  The fact that Congress wanted a broad class of questions to be speedily resolved does not imply that it intended the courts to augment the enumeration of qualified plaintiffs.  Nor is there any merit to appellants' contention that Congress specified the three enumerated classes of plaintiffs simply to remove any doubts about their standing, but not to exclude others by implication.

Syllabus 
An ordinance of appellant village requires a business to obtain a license if it sells any items that are ""designed or marketed for use with illegal cannabis or drugs.""  Guidelines define the items (such as ""roach clips,"" which are used to smoke cannabis, ""pipes,"" and ""paraphernalia""), the sale of which is required to be licensed.  Appellee, which sold a variety of merchandise in its store, including ""roach clips"" and specially designed pipes used to smoke marihuana, upon being notified that it was in possible violation of the ordinance, brought suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and requesting injunctive and declaratory relief and damages.  The District Court upheld the ordinance and awarded judgment to the village defendants.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague on its face.
Held:  The ordinance is not facially overbroad or vague, but is reasonably clear in its application to appellee.  Pp.  455 U. S. 494-505.
(a) In a facial challenge to the overbreadth and vagueness of an enactment, a court must first determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.  If it does not, the overbreadth challenge must fail.  The court should then examine the facial vagueness challenge and should uphold such challenge only if the enactment is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.  Pp.  455 U. S. 494-495.
(b) The ordinance here does not violate appellee's First Amendment rights, nor is it overbroad because it inhibits such rights of other parties.  The ordinance does not restrict speech as such, but simply regulates the commercial marketing of items that the labels reveal may be used for an illicit purpose, and thus does not embrace noncommercial speech.  With respect to any commercial speech interest implicated, the ordinance's restriction on the manner of marketing does not appreciably limit appellee's communication of information, except to the extent it is directed at commercial activity promoting or encouraging illegal drug use, an activity which, if deemed ""speech,"" is speech proposing an illegal transaction, and thus subject to government regulation or ban.  It is irrelevant whether the ordinance has an overbroad scope encompassing other persons' commercial speech, since the overbreadth doctrine does not apply to commercial speech.  Pp.  455 U. S. 495-497. 
Page 455 U. S. 490

(c) With respect to the facial vagueness challenge, appellee has not shown that the ordinance is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.  The ordinance's language ""designed . . . for use"" is not unconstitutionally vague on its face, since it is clear that such standard encompasses at least an item that is principally used with illegal drugs by virtue of its objective features, i.e., features designed by the manufacturer.  Thus, the ""designed for use"" standard is sufficiently clear to cover at least some of the items that appellee sold, such as ""roach clips"" and the specially designed pipes.  As to the ""marketed for use"" standard, the guidelines refer to the display of paraphernalia and to the proximity of covered items to otherwise uncovered items, and thus such standard requires scienter on the part of the retailer.  Under this test, appellee had ample warning that its marketing activities required a license, and by displaying a certain magazine and certain books dealing with illegal drugs physically close to pipes and colored rolling paper, it was in clear violation of the guidelines, as it was in selling ""roach clips.""  Pp.  455 U. S. 499-503.
(d) The ordinance's language is sufficiently clear that the speculative danger of arbitrary enforcement does not render it void for vagueness in a pre-enforcement facial challenge.  Pp.  455 U. S. 503-504.

Syllabus 
Title 28 U.S.C.  2254(b) and (c) provide that a state prisoner's application for a writ of habeas corpus in a federal district court based on an alleged federal constitutional violation will not be granted unless the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the state courts.  After respondent was convicted of certain charges in a Tennessee state court and his convictions were affirmed, he unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief in a state court.  He then filed a petition in Federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus under  2254, alleging four specified grounds of relief.  The District Court granted the writ, notwithstanding the petition included both claims that had not been exhausted in the state courts and those that had been.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.
624 F.2d 1100, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-A, III-B, and IV, concluding that a district court must dismiss habeas petitions containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims.  A rule requiring exhaustion of all claims in state courts promotes comity and furthers the purposes underlying the exhaustion doctrine, as codified in  2254(b) and (c), of protecting the state courts' role in the enforcement of federal law and preventing disruption of state judicial proceedings.  Pp.  455 U. S. 513-520.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded in Part III-C that the total exhaustion rule will not impair the state prisoner's interest in obtaining speedy federal relief on his claims, since, rather than returning to state court to exhaust all of his claims, he can always amend the petition to delete the unexhausted claims, although, by doing so, he would risk dismissal of subsequent federal petitions.

Syllabus 
Petitioner filed an action in Federal District Court alleging that respondent New Hampshire Department of Employment Security failed to make timely determinations of certain entitlements to unemployment compensation, thereby violating a provision of the Social Security Act, the Due Process Clause, and 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Ultimately, the District Court approved the parties' consent decree and entered judgment accordingly.  Approximately four and one-half months after the entry of the judgment, petitioner filed a motion requesting an award of attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.  1988, which authorizes the award, in the court's discretion, of attorney's fees to the prevailing party ""as part of the costs"" in constitutional and civil rights litigation of various kinds.  The District Court granted attorney's fees and denied respondents' subsequent motion to vacate the consent decree.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's decision to award attorney's fees under  1988.  It held that petitioner's motion for attorney's fees constituted a ""motion to alter or amend the judgment"" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) and was governed by the Rule's requirement that such a motion be served not later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.
Held:  Rule 59(e) is not applicable to postjudgment request for attorney's fees under  1988.  Pp.  455 U. S. 450-454.
(a) The Rule has generally been invoked only to support reconsideration of matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits.  Since  1988 provides for awards of attorney's fees only to a ""prevailing party,"" the decision of entitlement to fees requires an inquiry separate from the decision on the merits -- an inquiry that cannot even commence until one party has ""prevailed.""  Nor can attorney's fees fairly be characterized as an element of ""relief"" indistinguishable from other elements.  Pp.  455 U. S. 451-452.
(b) Application of Rule 59(e) to  1988 fee requests is neither necessary nor desirable to promote finality, judicial economy, or fairness.  Many orders may issue in the course of a civil rights action, but it may be

 unclear which orders are and which are not ""final judgments.""  If Rule 59(e) were applicable, lawyers predictably would respond by entering fee motions in conjunction with nearly every interim ruling.  No useful purpose would be served by encouragement of this practice, or by litigation over the ""finality"" of interim orders in connection with which fee requests were not filed within the 10-day period.  The Rule's 10-day limit could also deprive counsel of the time necessary to negotiate private settlements of fee questions, thus generating increased litigation of fee questions.  The discretion conferred on the court by  1988 with regard to the award of attorney's fees will support a denial of fees in cases in which a postjudgment motion unfairly surprises or prejudices the affected party.

Syllabus 
In 1975, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Co. (Rock Island) petitioned the District Court for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, and thereafter continued operation under the protection of that Act until September, 1979, when it ceased operation as a result of a labor strike.  The District Court concluded that reorganization was not possible, and directed appellee Trustee of Rock Island's estate (hereafter appellee) to liquidate the estate's assets.  On June 2, 1980, the reorganization court ordered abandonment of the Rock Island system and concluded that no claim or arrangement ""for employee labor protection payable out of the assets of the Debtor's estate is allowed or required by this Court.""  However, three days before the court's order, the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act (RITA) was signed into law.  Under  106 and 110 of the statute, appellee must pay benefits of up to $75 million to those Rock Island employees who are not hired by other carriers, and the United States guarantees Rock Island's employee protection obligations.  The statute also requires that such obligations must be considered administrative expenses of the Rock Island estate for purposes of determining the priority of the employees' claims to the estate's assets.  On June 5, 1980, a complaint was filed in the reorganization court challenging the constitutionality of RITA and seeking injunctive relief.  On June 9, the court issued a preliminary injunction against enforcement of  106 and 110, holding that those provisions constituted an uncompensated taking of private property (Rock Island's creditors' interests in the estate's assets) for a public purpose in violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1252, the District Court's order was appealed to this Court (No. 8015).  Congress responded to the District Court's injunction by enacting  701 of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which reenacted  106 and 110 of RITA and added a provision seeking to avoid any implication that appellee and creditors had been deprived of any Tucker Act remedy otherwise available to pursue their takings claim against the United 
Page 455 U. S. 458
 States.  Thereafter, the reorganization court denied a motion of appellant and the United States to vacate its June 9 injunction on the asserted ground that it was rendered moot by the passage of the Staggers Act, and issued a new order enjoining implementation of the labor protection provisions of RITA, as amended and reenacted by the Staggers Act.  This order was appealed to the Court of Appeals pursuant to  124(a)(1) of RITA, as added by the Staggers Act.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, and an appeal was then taken to this Court (No. 80-1239).
Held:
1. The June 9 injunction was rendered moot by the enactment of the Staggers Act, and accordingly the judgment of the District Court is vacated and it is ordered to vacate the injunction.  P.  455 U. S. 465.
2. The Court of Appeals' judgment is affirmed in No. 80-1239 because RITA, as amended by the Staggers Act, is repugnant to Art. I,  8, cl. 4, of the Constitution, which empowers Congress to enact ""uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.""  Pp.  455 U. S. 465-473.
(a) The labor protection provisions of RITA are an exercise of Congress' power under the Bankruptcy Clause, rather than under the Commerce Clause.  Although the subject of bankruptcies is incapable of final definition, ""bankruptcy"" has been defined as the ""subject of the relations between an insolvent or nonpaying or fraudulent debtor and his creditors, extending to his and their relief.""  Wright v. Union Central Ins. Co., 304 U. S. 502,  304 U. S. 513-514.  By its terms, the subject matter of RITA is the relationship between a bankrupt railroad and its creditors; Congress did nothing less than to prescribe the manner in which Rock Island's property is to be distributed among its creditors.  The events surrounding RITA's passage, as well as its legislative history, also indicate that Congress was exercising its powers under the Bankruptcy Clause.  Pp.  455 U. S. 465-468.
(b) The Bankruptcy Clause's uniformity requirement does not prohibit Congress from distinguishing among classes of debtors, or from treating railroad bankruptcies as a distinctive problem.  Nor does it deny Congress power to fashion legislation to resolve geographically isolated problems.  However, RITA is not a response either to the particular problems of major railroad bankruptcies or to any geographically isolated problem.  By its terms, RITA applies to only one regional bankrupt railroad; only Rock Island's creditors are affected by RITA's employee protection provisions, and only Rock Island employees may take benefit of the arrangement.  The language of the Bankruptcy Clause itself compels the conclusion that such a bankruptcy law is not within Congress' power to enact.  Although meager, the debate in the Constitutional Convention regarding the Clause also supports the conclusion that the uniformity requirement prohibits Congress from enacting 
Page 455 U. S. 459
 bankruptcy laws that specifically apply to the affair of only one named regional debtor.  Pp.  455 U. S. 468-473.

Syllabus 
In 1975, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Co. (Rock Island) petitioned the District Court for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, and thereafter continued operation under the protection of that Act until September, 1979, when it ceased operation as a result of a labor strike.  The District Court concluded that reorganization was not possible, and directed appellee Trustee of Rock Island's estate (hereafter appellee) to liquidate the estate's assets.  On June 2, 1980, the reorganization court ordered abandonment of the Rock Island system and concluded that no claim or arrangement ""for employee labor protection payable out of the assets of the Debtor's estate is allowed or required by this Court.""  However, three days before the court's order, the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act (RITA) was signed into law.  Under  106 and 110 of the statute, appellee must pay benefits of up to $75 million to those Rock Island employees who are not hired by other carriers, and the United States guarantees Rock Island's employee protection obligations.  The statute also requires that such obligations must be considered administrative expenses of the Rock Island estate for purposes of determining the priority of the employees' claims to the estate's assets.  On June 5, 1980, a complaint was filed in the reorganization court challenging the constitutionality of RITA and seeking injunctive relief.  On June 9, the court issued a preliminary injunction against enforcement of  106 and 110, holding that those provisions constituted an uncompensated taking of private property (Rock Island's creditors' interests in the estate's assets) for a public purpose in violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

Syllabus 
Appellee was charged with first-degree sexual offenses under Nebraska law.  His pretrial requests for bail were denied by state courts pursuant to a provision of the Nebraska Constitution prohibiting bail in cases of first-degree sexual offenses ""where the proof is evident or the presumption is great"" (which appellee conceded).  Pending trial, appellee filed suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S. C  1983 (1976 ed., Supp. V), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the Nebraska constitutional provision violated his federal constitutional rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.  On October 17, 1980, the District Court dismissed appellee's civil rights complaint.  In the meantime, however, appellee had been convicted of two of the three charges against him in state court prosecutions, and on November 13, 1980, he was convicted of the remaining charge.  Appellee appealed these convictions to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the appeals are pending before that court.  On May 13, 1981, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the exclusion of violent sexual offenses from bail before trial violates the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment.
Held:  Appellee's constitutional claim became moot following his state court convictions.  A favorable decision on his claim to pretrial bail would not have entitled him to bail once he was convicted.  And he did not pray for damages or seek to represent a class of pretrial detainees in his federal court action.  Nor does this case fall within the ""capable of repetition, yet evading review"" exception to the general rule of mootness when the issues are no longer ""live"" or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the case.  Application of this exception depends upon a ""reasonable expectation"" or ""demonstrated probability"" that the same controversy will recur involving the same complaining party.  There is no reasonable expectation that all of appellee's convictions will be overturned on appeal and that he will again be in the position to seek pretrial bail.

455 U.S. 331

Syllabus 
Appellant New England Power Co., a public utility generating and transmitting electricity at wholesale, sells most of its power in Massachusetts and Rhode Island; its wholesale customers service less than 6% of New Hampshire's population.  New England Power owns and operates hydroelectric units, some of which are located in New Hampshire.  The units are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) pursuant to the Federal Power Act.  A New Hampshire statute, enacted in 1913, prohibits a corporation engaged in the generation of electrical energy by water power from transmitting such energy out of the State unless approval is first obtained from the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission.  The statute empowers that Commission to prohibit the exportation of such energy when it determines that the energy ""is reasonably required for use within this state and that the public good requires that it be delivered for such use.""  Since 1926, New England Power or its predecessor periodically obtained the Commission's approval to transmit electricity produced in New Hampshire to points outside the State.  However, in 1980, after an investigation and hearings, the Commission withdrew such approval and ordered New England Power to arrange to sell the previously exported hydroelectric energy within New Hampshire.  New England Power, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the Attorney General of Rhode Island appealed the Commission's order to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, contending that the order was preempted by the Federal Power Act and imposed impermissible burdens on interstate commerce.  The court rejected those arguments, holding, inter alia, that the ""saving clause"" of  201(b) of the Federal Power Act granted New Hampshire authority to restrict the interstate transportation of hydroelectric power generated within the State.  Section 201(b), which was enacted in 1936, provides that the Act's provisions delegating exclusive authority to the FERC to regulate the transmission and sale at wholesale of electric energy in interstate

 commerce
""shall not . . . deprive a State or State commission of its lawful authority now exercised over the exportation of hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across a State line.""
Held:  New Hampshire has sought to restrict the flow of privately owned and produced electricity in interstate commerce in a manner inconsistent with the Commerce Clause.  Section 201(b) of the Federal Power Act does not provide an affirmative grant of authority to the State to do so.  Pp.  455 U. S. 338-344.
(a) Absent authorizing federal legislation, the Commerce Clause precludes a state from mandating that its residents be given a preferred right of access over out-of-state consumers to natural resources located within its borders or to the products derived therefrom.  The New Hampshire Commission's order is precisely the sort of protectionist regulation that the Commerce Clause declares off limits to the states.  Moreover, the Commission's ""exportation ban"" places direct and substantial burdens on transactions in interstate commerce that cannot be squared with the Commerce Clause when they serve only to advance simple economic protectionism.

(b) In  201(b), Congress did no more than leave standing whatever valid state laws then existed relating to the exportation of hydroelectric energy.

Syllabus 
These cases present the question whether lists of addresses collected and utilized by the Bureau of the Census are exempt from disclosure, either by way of civil discovery or the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), under the confidentiality provisions of the Census Act, 13 U.S.C.  8 and 9.  Section 8(b) allows the Secretary of Commerce to reveal statistical materials ""which do not disclose the information reported by, or on behalf of, any particular respondent.""  Section 9(a) prohibits the Secretary from using the information furnished except for statistical purposes, and from making any publication ""whereby the data furnished by any particular establishment or individual . . . can be identified""; it also prohibits examination of individual reports by ""anyone other than the sworn officers and employees of the Department or bureau or agency thereof.""  The 1980 census indicated that the areas of Essex County, N.J., and Denver, Colo., among others, had lost population during the 1970's.  Both localities challenged the census count under the Census Bureau's local review procedures, asserting that the Bureau had erroneously classified occupied dwellings as vacant and seeking unsuccessfully to obtain access to a portion of the address lists used by the Bureau in conducting its count in their respective jurisdictions.  In No. 80-1436, the Essex County Executive filed suit in Federal District Court to compel disclosure under the FOIA of the Bureau's master address list, compiled initially from commercial mailing address lists and census postal checks, and updated through direct responses to census questionnaires, canvassing by Bureau personnel, and in some instances a cross-check with the 1970 census data.  The District Court held that the FOIA required disclosure of the requested information.  The court rejected the contention that the confidentiality provisions of the Census Act constitute a statutory exception to disclosure within the meaning of Exemption 3 of the FOIA, which provides that disclosure need not be made as to information ""specifically exempted from disclosure by statute"" if the statute affords the agency no discretion on disclosure, or establishes particular criteria 
Page 455 U. S. 346
 for withholding the data, or refers to the particular types of material to be withheld.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  In No. 80-1781, Denver officials filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a preliminary injunction to require the Bureau's cooperation with the city in verifying its vacancy data.  The District Court granted the city's discovery request for vacancy information contained in the Bureau's updated master address registers.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed, relying on the language of the Census Act and Congress' intent to protect census information.
Held:
1. The requested information in No. 80-1436 is not subject to disclosure under the FOIA.  Pp.  455 U. S. 352-359.
(a) To stimulate public cooperation necessary for an accurate census -- providing a basis for apportioning Representatives among the states in Congress, serving an important function in the allocation of federal grants to states based on population, and also providing important data for Congress and ultimately for the private sector -- Congress has provided assurances that information furnished by individuals is to be treated as confidential.  Title 13 U.S.C.  8(b) and 9(a) explicitly provide for nondisclosure of certain census data, and no discretion is provided to the Census Bureau on whether or not to disclose such data.  Thus,  8(b) and 9(a) qualify as withholding statutes under Exemption 3 of the FOIA.  Pp.  455 U. S. 353-355.
(b) The unambiguous language of the confidentiality provisions of the Census Act -- focusing on the ""information"" or ""data"" that constitutes the statistical computation -- as well as the Act's legislative history, indicates that Congress contemplated that raw data reported by or on behalf of individuals, not just the identity of the individuals, was to be held confidential, and not available for disclosure.  The master address list sought by Essex County is part of the raw census data intended by Congress to be protected under the Act.  And under the Act's clear language, it is not relevant that municipalities seeking data will use it only for statistical purposes.  Pp.  455 U. S. 355-359.
2. Nor is the requested information in No. 80-1781 subject to disclosure under the discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Under Rule 26(b)(1), if requested information is privileged, it may be withheld even if relevant to the lawsuit and essential to the establishment of plaintiff's claim.  A privilege may be created by statute, and the strong policy of nondisclosure under the confidentiality provisions of the Census Act indicates that Congress intended such provisions to constitute a ""privilege"" within the meaning of the Federal Rules.  Pp.  455 U. S. 360-362.

Title 13 U.S.C.  8(b) and 9(a) explicitly provide for nondisclosure of certain census data, and no discretion is provided to the Census Bureau on whether or not to disclose such data.  Thus,  8(b) and 9(a) qualify as withholding statutes under Exemption 3 of the FOIA.  Pp.  455 U. S. 353-355.
(b) The unambiguous language of the confidentiality provisions of the Census Act -- focusing on the ""information"" or ""data"" that constitutes the statistical computation -- as well as the Act's legislative history, indicates that Congress contemplated that raw data reported by or on behalf of individuals, not just the identity of the individuals, was to be held confidential, and not available for disclosure.  The master address list sought by Essex County is part of the raw census data intended by Congress to be protected under the Act.  And under the Act's clear language, it is not relevant that municipalities seeking data will use it only for statistical purposes.  Pp.  455 U. S. 355-359.
2. Nor is the requested information in No. 80-1781 subject to disclosure under the discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Under Rule 26(b)(1), if requested information is privileged, it may be withheld even if relevant to the lawsuit and essential to the establishment of plaintiff's claim.  A privilege may be created by statute, and the strong policy of nondisclosure under the confidentiality provisions of the Census Act indicates that Congress intended such provisions to constitute a ""privilege"" within the meaning of the Federal Rules.

No. 80-988
Argued December 1, 1981
Decided February 24, 1982
455 U.S. 363

Syllabus 
Section 804 of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (Act) makes unlawful various forms of discriminatory housing practices.  Section 812(a) authorizes civil actions to enforce  804 and requires that suit be brought within 180 days after the alleged occurrence of a discriminatory practice.  A class action for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief was brought in Federal District Court against petitioners -- Havens Realty Corp. (Havens), an apartment complex owner in a suburb of Richmond, Va., and one of its employees -- on the basis of their alleged ""racial steering"" in violation of  804.  The suit was brought by a black person (Coles) who, attempting to rent an apartment from Havens, allegedly was falsely told less than 180 days before suit was instituted that no apartments were available, and by respondents -- Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME), a nonprofit corporation whose purpose was ""to make equal opportunity in housing a reality in the Richmond Metropolitan Area,"" and two individuals (one black and one white) who were employed by HOME as ""testers"" to determine whether Havens practiced racial steering.  The complaint alleged that, on specified dates more than 180 days before suit was instituted, the black tester was told by Havens that no apartments were available, but the white tester was told that there were vacancies.  It was also alleged that Havens' practices had deprived the individual plaintiffs (who were residents of Richmond or the adjacent county) of the ""important social, professional, business and economic, political and aesthetic benefits of interracial associations that arise from living in integrated communities free from discriminatory housing practices""; that Havens' steering practices had frustrated HOME's activities as to housing counseling and referral services, with a consequent drain on resources; and that its members had been deprived of the benefits of interracial association arising from living in an integrated community free of housing discrimination.  On petitioners' pretrial motion, the District Court dismissed respondents' claims, holding that they lacked standing and that their claims were barred by the Act's 180-day statute of limitations.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.  It held that the allegations of injury to the respondents were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss, and that their claims were not time-barred because petitioners' conduct constituted a ""continuing violation"" lasting through the time of the alleged Coles incident, which was within the 180-day period of  812(a). 
Page 455 U. S. 364

Held:
1. Respondents' claims were not rendered moot by either (1) the District Court's entry of a consent order with respect to Coles' claims granting him and the class he represented monetary and injunctive relief, the order having been entered after a trial in which Havens was found to have engaged in unlawful racial steering, or (2) a letter agreement between petitioners and respondents -- reached prior to this Court's grant of certiorari -- whereby, upon approval by the District Court, respondents would each be entitled to $400 in damages and no further relief if this Court were either to deny certiorari or to grant it and affirm, but to no relief if this Court were to grant certiorari and reverse.  Irrespective of the issue of injunctive relief, respondents continue to seek damages to redress alleged violations of the Act.  The letter agreement would merely liquidate those damages.  Pp.  455 U. S. 370-371.
2. The determination of whether each of the respondents has standing to sue is guided by the decision in Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U. S. 91, that Congress intended standing under g 812 of the Act to extend to the full limits of Art. III, and that the courts accordingly lack authority to create prudential barriers to standing in suits brought under that section.  Thus, the sole requirement for standing to sue under  812 is the Art. III minima of injury in fact -- that the plaintiff allege that, as a result of the defendant's actions, he has suffered ""a distinct and palpable injury.""  Pp.  455 U. S. 372-379.
(a) The black individual respondent (Coleman) has standing to sue in her capacity as a ""tester.""  Section 804(d) establishes an enforceable right of ""any person"" to truthful information concerning the availability of housing.  A tester who has been the object of a misrepresentation made unlawful under  804(d) has suffered injury in precisely the form the statute was intended to guard against, and therefore has standing to maintain a damages claim under the Act.  That the tester may have approached the real estate agent fully expecting that he would receive false information, and without any intention of buying or renting a home, does not negate the fact of injury within the meaning of  804(d).  If, as alleged, Coleman was told that apartments were not available, while white testers were informed that apartments were available, she has suffered ""specific injury"" from petitioners' challenged acts, and the Art. III requirement of injury in fact is satisfied.  However, since the white individual respondent (Willis) alleged that he was informed that apartments were available, rather than that petitioners misrepresented to him that apartments were unavailable, thus alleging no injury to his statutory right to accurate information, he hag no standing to sue in his capacity as a tester and, more to the point, has not pleaded a cause of action under  804(d).  Pp.  455 U. S. 373-375. 
Page 455 U. S. 365

(b) Insofar as Coleman and Willis have alleged that the steering practices of petitioners have deprived the two respondents of the benefits of interracial association, the Court of Appeals properly held that dismissal was inappropriate at this juncture in the proceedings.  It is implausible to argue that petitioners' alleged acts of discrimination could have palpable effects throughout the entire Richmond metropolitan area.  But respondents have not identified the particular neighborhoods in which they lived, nor established the proximity of their homes to the site of petitioners' alleged steering practices.  In the absence of further factual development, it cannot be said as a matter of law that no injury could be proved.  Further pleading and proof might establish that the respondents lived in areas where petitioners' practices had an appreciable effect.  Pp.  455 U. S. 375-378.
(c) Although HOME apparently has abandoned its claim of standing to sue for injunctive relief as a representative of its members, it has standing to sue for damages in its own right under the Act.  If, as broadly alleged, petitioners' steering practices have perceptibly impaired HOME's ability to provide housing counseling and referral services -- with a consequent drain on the organization's resources -- there can be no question that the organization has suffered the requisite injury in fact.  Pp.  455 U. S. 378-379.
3. The 180-day limitations period of  812(a) of the Act is no bar to the ""neighborhood"" claims of the individual respondents or to HOME's claim for injury to its counseling and referral services, even though the alleged incidents of racial steering involving Coleman and Willis occurred more than 180 days before suit was filed.  Where a plaintiff, pursuant to the Act, challenges not just one incident of conduct violative of the Act, but an unlawful practice that continues into the limitations period, the complaint is timely when it is filed within 180 days of the last asserted occurrence of that practice.  Here, the individual respondents' ""neighborhood"" claims and HOME's claim are based not solely on isolated incidents involving the two individual respondents, but on a continuing violation manifested in a number of incidents -- including at least one (involving Coles) that is asserted to have occurred within the 180-day period.  However, insofar as Coleman has standing to assert a claim as a ""tester,"" she may not take advantage of the ""continuing violation"" theory, and such claim is time-barred.  It is not alleged, nor could it be, that the incident of steering involving Coles deprived Coleman of her  804(d) right to truthful housing information.  Pp.  455 U. S. 380-381.

Syllabus 
In 1970, the union then representing flight attendants employed by respondent Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA), brought a federal court class action alleging that TWA practiced unlawful sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by its policy of grounding all female flight attendants who became mothers while their male counterparts who became fathers were permitted to continue flying.  Subsequently, individual members of the class (petitioners in No. 78-1545) were appointed as class representatives to replace the union, which was found to be an inadequate representative.  The District Court later denied TWA's motion to exclude class members who had not filed charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within the time limit specified in Title VII, holding that, while such filing requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite not subject to waiver, any violation by TWA continued against all the class members until TWA changed its challenged policy.  The court also granted the plaintiff class' motion for summary judgment on the issue of TWA's liability for violating Title VII.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment and held that timely filing of EEOC charges was a jurisdictional prerequisite, but declined to extend the ""continuing violation"" theory so as to include in the plaintiff class those terminated employees who failed to file timely EEOC charges.  However, the court stayed its mandate pending the filing of petitions in this Court, which, in turn, deferred consideration of the petitions pending completion of settlement proceedings in the District Court.  In such proceedings, the District Court designated two subclasses:  Subclass A, consisting of women who were terminated on or after March 20, 1970, and those who were discharged earlier but who had accepted reinstatement in ground positions, and Subclass B, consisting of all other members of the class, whose claims the Court of Appeals had found to be jurisdictionally barred for failure to satisfy the timely filing requirement.  The flight attendants' 
Page 455 U. S. 386
 current union (petitioner in No. 80-951) was permitted to intervene and object to the proposed settlement.  On the basis of the Court of Appeals' stay of its mandate in its jurisdictional decision, the District Court rejected the union's challenge to its jurisdiction over Subclass B.  It also approved the settlement and awarded restoration of retroactive seniority.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the union's contention that, because of the Court of Appeals' earlier opinion, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to approve the settlement or to order retroactive seniority with respect to Subclass B.
Held:
1. Filing a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.  The structure of Title VII, the congressional policy underlying it, and the reasoning of this Court's prior cases all lead to this conclusion.  Pp.  455 U. S. 392-398.
2. The District Court had authority to award retroactive seniority to the members of Subclass B as well as Subclass A.  Pp.  455 U. S. 398-401.
(a) The union's contention in No. 80-951 that there was no finding of discrimination with respect to Subclass B, and thus no predicate for relief under  706(g) of Title VII is without merit.  The District Court found unlawful discrimination against the plaintiff class as a whole, at a time when the class had not yet been divided into the two subclasses, and the court's summary judgment ran in favor of the entire class.  Since the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the District Court had no jurisdiction over claims by those who had not met the filing requirement, and that those individuals should have been excluded from the class prior to the grant of summary judgment, there was no jurisdictional barrier to the District Court's finding of discrimination with respect to the entire class.  Pp.  455 U. S. 398-399.
(b) Equally meritless is the union's contention that retroactive seniority contrary to the collective bargaining agreement should not be awarded over the objection of a union that has not itself been found guilty of discrimination.  Class-based seniority relief for identifiable victims of illegal discrimination is a form of relief generally appropriate under  706(g).  And, as made clear in Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, once there has been a finding of discrimination by the employer, an award of retroactive seniority is appropriate even if there is no finding that the union has also illegally discriminated.

Syllabus 
A New Jersey statute tolls the limitation period for an action against a foreign corporation that ""is not represented"" in New Jersey by any person or officer upon whom process may be served.  In respondents' action against petitioner foreign corporation, originally brought in a New Jersey state court and removed to Federal District Court, petitioner moved for summary judgment based upon the applicable New Jersey statute of limitation, and respondents countered with the tolling provision.  Although ruling that petitioner was not represented in New Jersey for purposes of the tolling provision, the District Court nevertheless held that the suit was barred.  Reasoning that the tolling provision operated to preserve only causes of action against corporate defendants that were not subject to in personam jurisdiction in New Jersey, and that, with the enactment of New Jersey's long-arm rule, the rationale for the preexisting tolling provision ceased to exist, the District Court found the tolling provision invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  That court's decision was based upon an intervening decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court holding that, as a matter of New Jersey law, the tolling provision continued in force despite the advent of long-arm jurisdiction, and that such provision did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, because the increased difficulty of out-of-state service provided a rational basis for tolling the statute of limitation in a suit against an unrepresented foreign corporation.
Held:
1. The tolling provision does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Rational reasons support the provision despite the institution of long-arm jurisdiction in New Jersey.  The unrepresented foreign corporation remains potentially difficult to locate, and the institution of long-arm jurisdiction has not made service upon such a corporation the equivalent of service upon a corporation with a New Jersey representative, but requires additional conditions for effective service.  Because of these burdens connected with suing unrepresented foreign corporations, as opposed to suing a domestic corporation or a represented foreign corporation, the tolling provision does not deprive an unrepresented foreign corporation of the equal protection of the laws.

Syllabus 
A New Jersey statute tolls the limitation period for an action against a foreign corporation that ""is not represented"" in New Jersey by any person or officer upon whom process may be served.  In respondents' action against petitioner foreign corporation, originally brought in a New Jersey state court and removed to Federal District Court, petitioner moved for summary judgment based upon the applicable New Jersey statute of limitation, and respondents countered with the tolling provision.  Although ruling that petitioner was not represented in New Jersey for purposes of the tolling provision, the District Court nevertheless held that the suit was barred.  Reasoning that the tolling provision operated to preserve only causes of action against corporate defendants that were not subject to in personam jurisdiction in New Jersey, and that, with the enactment of New Jersey's long-arm rule, the rationale for the preexisting tolling provision ceased to exist, the District Court found the tolling provision invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  That court's decision was based upon an intervening decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court holding that, as a matter of New Jersey law, the tolling provision continued in force despite the advent of long-arm jurisdiction, and that such provision did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, because the increased difficulty of out-of-state service provided a rational basis for tolling the statute of limitation in a suit against an unrepresented foreign corporation.
Held:
1. The tolling provision does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Rational reasons support the provision despite the institution of long-arm jurisdiction in New Jersey.  The unrepresented foreign corporation remains potentially difficult to locate, and the institution of long-arm jurisdiction has not made service upon such a corporation the equivalent of service upon a corporation with a New Jersey representative, but requires additional conditions for effective service.  Because of these burdens connected with suing unrepresented foreign corporations, as opposed to suing a domestic corporation or a represented foreign corporation, the tolling provision does not deprive an unrepresented foreign corporation of the equal protection of the laws.  Pp.  455 U. S. 408-412.
2. But since neither lower court addressed directly the question

Syllabus 
The Illinois Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA) barred employment discrimination on the basis of physical handicap unrelated to ability.  To obtain relief, a complainant had to bring a charge of unlawful conduct before the Illinois Fair Employment Practices Commission (Commission) within 180 days of the occurrence of such alleged conduct.  The statute then gave the Commission 120 days within which to convene a factfinding conference to obtain evidence, ascertain the parties' positions, and explore the possibility of a settlement.  Appellant, an employee of appellee, was discharged purportedly because his short left leg made it impossible for him to perform his duties as a shipping clerk.  Appellant filed a timely charge alleging unlawful termination of his employment, but, apparently through inadvertence, the Commission scheduled the factfinding conference for a date 5 days after expiration of the 120-day statutory period.  The Commission denied appellee's motion that the charge be dismissed for failure to hold a timely conference.  On appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the failure to comply with the 120-day convening requirement deprived the Commission of jurisdiction to consider appellant's charge, and rejected appellant's argument that his federal due process and equal protection rights would be violated were the Commission's error allowed to extinguish his cause of action.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
82 Ill.2d 99, 411 N.E.2d 277, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court, concluding that appellant was deprived of a protected property interest in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  455 U. S. 428-437.
(a) Appellant's right to use the FEPA's adjudicatory procedures is a species of property protected by the Due Process Clause.  Cf. Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306.  The hallmark of property is an individual entitlement grounded in state law, which cannot be removed except ""for cause,"" and appellant's right shares this characteristic.  The 120-day limitation is a procedural limitation on the claimant's ability to assert his rights, not a substantive element of the FEPA claim.  Pp.  455 U. S. 428-433.
(b) A consideration of the competing interests involved -- the importance of the private interest and the length or finality of the deprivation, 
Page 455 U. S. 423
 the likelihood of governmental error, and the magnitude of the governmental interests -- leads to the conclusion that appellant is entitled to have the Commission consider the merits of his charge, based upon the substantiality of the available evidence, before deciding whether to terminate his claim.  The State's interest in refusing appellant's procedural request is, on the record, insubstantial.  Pp.  455 U. S. 433-435.
(c) The availability of a post-termination tort action does not provide appellant due process.  It is the state system itself that destroys a complainant's property interest, by operation of law, whenever the Commission fails to convene a timely conference; appellant is challenging not the Commission's error, but the ""established state procedure"" that destroys his entitlement without according him proper procedural safeguards.  Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U. S. 527, distinguished.  The Fourteenth Amendment requires ""an opportunity . . . granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner' . . . `for [a] hearing appropriate to the nature of the case,'"" Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371,  401 U. S. 378, and here appellant was denied such an opportunity.  Pp.  455 U. S. 435-437.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, in a separate opinion, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded that, under the ""rational basis"" standard, the Illinois statute, as interpreted and applied by the Illinois Supreme Court to establish two categories -- those processed within the prescribed 120 days and thus entitled to full consideration on the merits, and otherwise identical claims not processed within the prescribed time, and thus terminated without a hearing -- deprived appellant of his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws.  Pp.  455 U. S. 438-442.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by JUSTICE REHNQUIST, while not joining all the broad pronouncements on the law of equal protection in JUSTICE BLACKMUN's separate opinion, also concluded that the challenged classification, as construed and applied in this case, failed to be rationally related to a state interest that would justify it, and thus violated appellant's right to equal protection of the laws.

Syllabus 
Appellee, a farmer and carpenter, is a member of the Old Order Amish, who believe that there is a religiously based obligation to provide for their fellow members the kind of assistance contemplated by the social security system.  During certain years when he employed other Amish to work on his farm and in his carpentry shop, appellee failed to withhold social security taxes from his employees or to pay the employer's share of such taxes because he believed that payment of the taxes and receipt of benefits would violate the Amish faith.  After the Internal Revenue Service assessed him for the unpaid taxes, appellee paid a certain amount and then sued in Federal District Court for a refund, claiming that imposition of the taxes violated his First Amendment free exercise of religion rights and those of his employees.  The District Court held the statutes requiring appellee to pay social security taxes unconstitutional as applied, basing its holding on both 26 U.S.C.  1402(g), which exempts from social security taxes, on religious grounds, self-employed Amish and others, and the First Amendment.
Held:
1. The exemption provided by  1402(g), being available only to self-employed individuals, does not apply to employers or employees, and hence appellee and his employees are not within its provisions.  P.  455 U. S. 256.
2. The imposition of social security taxes is not unconstitutional as applied to such persons as appellee who object on religious grounds to receipt of public insurance benefits and to payment of taxes to support public insurance funds.  Pp.  455 U. S. 256-261.
(a) While there is a conflict between the Amish faith and the obligations imposed by the social security system, not all burdens on religion are unconstitutional.  The state may justify a limitation on religious liberty by showing that it is essential to accomplish an overriding governmental interest.  Pp.  455 U. S. 256-258.
(b) Widespread individual voluntary coverage under social security would undermine the soundness of the social security system, and would make such system almost a contradiction in terms, and difficult, if not impossible, to administer.  Pp.  455 U. S. 258-259. 
Page 455 U. S. 253

(c) It would be difficult to accommodate the social security system with myriad exceptions flowing from a wide variety of religious beliefs such as the Amish.  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205, distinguished.  There is no principled way, for purposes of this case, to distinguish between general taxes and those imposed under the Social Security Act.  The tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to challenge it because tax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief.  Because the broad public interest in maintaining a sound tax system is of such a high order, religious belief in conflict with the payment of taxes affords no basis for resisting the tax.  Pp.  455 U. S. 259-260.
(d) Congress, in  1402(g), has accommodated, to the extent compatible with a comprehensive national program, the practices of those who believe it a violation of their faith to participate in the social security system.  When followers of a particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes that are binding on others in that activity.  Granting an exemption from social security taxes to an employer operates to impose the employer's religious faith on the employees.  The tax imposed on employers to support the social security system must be uniformly applicable to all, except as Congress explicitly provides otherwise.  Pp.  455 U. S. 260-261.

Syllabus 
Section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Social Security Act (Act) provides that, in calculating benefits, state Medicaid plans must not
""take into account the financial responsibility of any individual for any applicant or recipient under the plan unless such applicant or recipient is such individual's spouse.""
Section 1902(a)(17)(B) provides that participating States must grant benefits to eligible individuals
""taking into account only such income and resources as are, as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary [of Health and Human Services (HHS)], available to the applicant or recipient.""
Section 1902(a)(10)(A) requires States that have not exercised the so-called  209(b) option to provide Medicaid assistance to all recipients of benefits under the Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (SSI) program.  A federal regulation governing the ""optional categorically needy"" provides that, if only one spouse is eligible for Medicaid, the States must ""deem"" income of the other spouse, i.e., consider the latter's income as ""available"" to the Medicaid applicant, for one month after the spouses cease to live together, following which period only the income actually contributed may be considered.  After petitioner wife, as a result of cerebral hemorrhages, was placed in a long-term care facility in Iowa, which has not exercised the  209(b) option, her petitioner husband applied for Medicaid assistance on her behalf.  She is part of the optional categorically needy, since she is eligible for, but does not receive, SSI benefits.  Iowa, in calculating the wife's Medicaid benefits, ""deemed"" or attributed income earned by the husband to the wife in a manner inconsistent with the federal regulation.  Petitioners then filed suit in Federal District Court, challenging Iowa's ""deeming"" of the husband's income.  After certifying a class of plaintiffs which included SSI recipients as well as the optional categorically needy, the District Court held that  1902(a)(17) required Iowa's procedures to
""provide for a factual determination in each instance of the amount of the spouse's income which is in fact reasonably available for the support of the institutionalized spouse,""
and that the federal time limitation regulation was inconsistent with  1902(a)(17), because it disabled the States in certain instances from considering the spouse's income as available to the applicant.  In response to this order, Iowa adopted a procedure for making individualized factual determinations of the amount of income available to an institutionalized 
Page 455 U. S. 266
 spouse, and the District Court approved the plan.  On petitioners' appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. With regard to SSI recipients, the District Court's order conflicts with  1902(a)(10)(A) of the Act, because it permits Iowa to deny Medicaid benefits to SSI recipients.  To the extent that the order forbids ""deeming"" under any circumstances, it conflicts with the holding in Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U. S. 34, that Congress intended to permit a state Medicaid plan to deem the income from the applicant's spouse as part of the available income that the state plan may consider in determining eligibility.  Pp.  455 U. S. 272-273.
2. Section 1902(a)(17)(D) does not preclude the Secretary of HHS from promulgating regulations that impose time limitations upon the States' ability to ""deem"" income between spouses who do not share the same household.  In imposing such time limitations, the Secretary has done nothing more than define what income is ""available,"" pursuant to  1902(a)(17)(B).  There is nothing in  1902(a)(17)(D) that precludes the Secretary from imposing these limitations, or that either disables him from defining the term ""available"" in circumstances where the applicant and spouse no longer live together or gives the States authority to ""deem"" income unimpeded by the Secretary's broad authority under  1902(a)(17)(B) to determine what income should be considered available to the Medicaid applicant.  The Secretary has not exceeded his authority in promulgating the time limitation regulation applicable in this case, and such regulation is neither arbitrary nor capricious.  Pp.  455 U. S. 273-278.

1. With regard to SSI recipients, the District Court's order conflicts with  1902(a)(10)(A) of the Act, because it permits Iowa to deny Medicaid benefits to SSI recipients.  To the extent that the order forbids ""deeming"" under any circumstances, it conflicts with the holding in Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U. S. 34, that Congress intended to permit a state Medicaid plan to deem the income from the applicant's spouse as part of the available income that the state plan may consider in determining eligibility.  Pp.  455 U. S. 272-273.
2. Section 1902(a)(17)(D) does not preclude the Secretary of HHS from promulgating regulations that impose time limitations upon the States' ability to ""deem"" income between spouses who do not share the same household.  In imposing such time limitations, the Secretary has done nothing more than define what income is ""available,"" pursuant to  1902(a)(17)(B).  There is nothing in  1902(a)(17)(D) that precludes the Secretary from imposing these limitations, or that either disables him from defining the term ""available"" in circumstances where the applicant and spouse no longer live together or gives the States authority to ""deem"" income unimpeded by the Secretary's broad authority under  1902(a)(17)(B) to determine what income should be considered available to the Medicaid applicant.  The Secretary has not exceeded his authority in promulgating the time limitation regulation applicable in this case, and such regulation is neither arbitrary nor capricious.  Pp.  455 U. S. 273-278.

Syllabus 
Section 6 of appellant Texas city's licensing ordinance governing coin-operated amusement establishments directs the Chief of Police to consider whether a license applicant has any ""connections with criminal elements.""  After receiving recommendations from the Chief of Police, the Chief Building Inspector, and the City Planner, the City Manager decides whether to grant a license.  If he denies the license, the applicant may appeal to the City Council.  If the City Manager denied the application because of the Chief of Police's adverse recommendation as to the applicant's character, the applicant must show to the City Council that he or it is of good character.  Section 5 of the ordinance prohibits a licensee from allowing children under 17 years of age to operate amusement devices unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.  After appellant had been ordered in Texas state court proceedings to issue appellee amusement center operator a license (its license application having been initially denied under the predecessor to  6), and after appellant had repealed appellee's exemption from the predecessor to  5, appellee brought suit in Federal District Court, praying for an injunction against enforcement of the ordinance.  The District Court held that  6 was unconstitutionally vague, but upheld  5.  The Court of Appeals affirmed as to  6, basing its holding solely on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but reversed as to  5, basing its holding on the Texas Constitution, as well as on the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:
1. The fact that the phrase ""connections with criminal elements"" was eliminated from the ordinance while the case was pending in the Court of Appeals does not render the case moot.  A defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.  Here, appellant's repeal of the objectionable language would not preclude it from reenacting the same provision if the District Court's judgment were vacated.  Pp.  455 U. S. 288-289.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that  6 is unconstitutionally vague.  It is clear, from the procedure to be followed when an application for a license is denied by the City Manager based on the Chief of Police's recommendation, that the phrase ""connections with criminal elements"" is 
Page 455 U. S. 284
 not the standard for approval or disapproval of the application.  Rather, the applicant's possible connection with criminal elements is merely a subject that  6 directs the Chief of Police to investigate before he makes a recommendation to the City Manager.  The Federal Constitution does not preclude a city from giving vague or ambiguous directions to officials who are authorized to make investigations and recommendations.  Pp.  455 U. S. 289-291.
3. Because Congress has limited this Court's jurisdiction to review questions of state law, and because there is ambiguity in the Court of Appeals' holding as to  5, a remand for clarification of that holding is necessary.  This Court will not decide the federal constitutional question connected with  5 where (a) the relevant language of the Texas constitutional provisions is different from, and arguably significantly broader than, the language of the corresponding federal provisions; (b) it is unclear whether this Court would apply, as a matter of federal law, the same standard applied as a matter of state law by the Court of Appeals in reviewing  5; and (c) it is this Court's policy to avoid unnecessary adjudication of federal constitutional questions, there being no need for decision of the federal issue here if Texas law provides independent support for the Court of Appeals' judgment.

455 U.S. 245

Syllabus 
Appellees, oil companies that are subject to New York State's gross receipts tax on their revenues derived from activities within the State, filed suit in Federal District Court challenging the provision of the tax statute that prohibits oil companies from passing on the cost of the tax in the prices of their products sold in the State.  The statute also provides that the tax shall self-destruct if the antipassthrough provision is adjudged to be invalid or if its enforcement is enjoined.  The court held that the antipassthrough provision was preempted by federal price control authority under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act, and enjoined its enforcement.  The Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals affirmed, but noted that the federal statute would expire by its own terms on September 30, 1981, and that expiration of the Act would signal the end of federal concern in the area.
Held:  The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for reconsideration in light of the expiration of federal price control authority.  Since the District Court's injunction did not terminate with the expiration of the federal statute, in its present form, the declaration of the invalidity of the antipassthrough provision and the injunction against its enforcement have no current validity, and must be set aside.  The Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals should decide in the first instance what effect, if any, the expiration of federal price authority has on collateral matters raised by the parties concerning appellees' authority to pass through to consumers taxes that were paid or accrued prior to October 1, 1981, and the validity of the tax itself in view of the statute's ""self-destruct"" provisions.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 22, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 On September 4, 1980, two women, Vicki Rash Norvell and Bobby Folks Rash, while walking together, were killed by the driver of a hit-and-run automobile. Petitioner Spradling later identified himself as the driver and two indictments were presented against him on October 1, 1980. The first charged Spradling with failing to stop and render aidd to Vicki Rash Norvell, a felony under Texas law. The second indictment, in identical language, charged Spradling with failing to stop and render aid to Bobby Folks Rash. Spradling was 
Page 455 U.S. 971 , 972
 convicted by a jury under the first indictment. The jury assessed as punishment a 5-year prison sentence and a fine of $5,000, and recommended that, in light of the fact that petitioner had never before been convicted of a felony, his prison sentence be suspended. Now the State seeks to prosecute Spradling under the second indictment. 
 Petitioner moved to dismiss this second indictment claiming former jeopardy. The trial court denied the motion and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied leave to file an application for a writ of prohibition. 
 Petitioner presents two questions for review. First, he argues that the failure of the State of Texas to afford him review of the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss for reason of former jeopardy violates the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, petitioner argues the ""merits"" of his double jeopardy claim were improperly rejected by the trial court. In my view both questions are substantial and merit review by this Court. 
 I  
 Texas procedure provides no mechanism for interlocutory review in criminal cases; 1 petitioner was therefore unable to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy. It is clear that in most applications the Texas procedural rule barring interlocutory review raises no federal constitutional issue. But as applied to claims of former jeopardy, this procedural rule, in combination with a denial by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals of leave to file an application for a writ of prohibition, denies criminal defendants the opportunity to protect, through the state appellate system, their constitutional rights. I believe this raises an issue worthy of our consideration. 
 We held in Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 52 L. Ed.2d 651 (1977), that a double jeopardy claim is by its very nature collateral [455 U.S. 971 , 973]

 Hubert Richard SPRADLING, petitioner,v. TEXAS and Ronald Dale DUNN, petitioner,v. TEXASNo. 81-353 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 22, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 On September 4, 1980, two women, Vicki Rash Norvell and Bobby Folks Rash, while walking together, were killed by the driver of a hit-and-run automobile. Petitioner Spradling later identified himself as the driver and two indictments were presented against him on October 1, 1980. The first charged Spradling with failing to stop and render aidd to Vicki Rash Norvell, a felony under Texas law. The second indictment, in identical language, charged Spradling with failing to stop and render aid to Bobby Folks Rash. Spradling was 
Page 455 U.S. 971 , 972
 convicted by a jury under the first indictment. The jury assessed as punishment a 5-year prison sentence and a fine of $5,000, and recommended that, in light of the fact that petitioner had never before been convicted of a felony, his prison sentence be suspended. Now the State seeks to prosecute Spradling under the second indictment. 
 Petitioner moved to dismiss this second indictment claiming former jeopardy. The trial court denied the motion and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied leave to file an application for a writ of prohibition. 
 Petitioner presents two questions for review. First, he argues that the failure of the State of Texas to afford him review of the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss for reason of former jeopardy violates the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, petitioner argues the ""merits"" of his double jeopardy claim were improperly rejected by the trial court. In my view both questions are substantial and merit review by this Court. 
 I  
 Texas procedure provides no mechanism for interlocutory review in criminal cases; 1 petitioner was therefore unable to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy. It is clear that in most applications the Texas procedural rule barring interlocutory review raises no federal constitutional issue. But as applied to claims of former jeopardy, this procedural rule, in combination with a denial by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals of leave to file an application for a writ of prohibition, denies criminal defendants the opportunity to protect, through the state appellate system, their constitutional rights. I believe this raises an issue worthy of our consideration. 
 We held in Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 52 L. Ed.2d 651 (1977), that a double jeopardy claim is by its very nature collateral [455 U.S. 971 , 973]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Ohio, Butler County. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN and Justice POWELL, join, dissenting. 
 Because there is no jurisdictional bar to considering this case, and because the decision below fails to give due regard to our cases, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 I  
 Petitioner, an attorney, was indicted in 1978 on two counts of grand theft. The first count charged him with obtaining or exerting control over a bank account by deception in that he led the executrix of an estate to believe that the account was a probate asset of the estate rather than a survivorship account. The second count of the indictment charged petitioner with obtaining or exerting control over the account be-

 yond the scope of the owner's consent by writing $9,000 in checks payable to himself on the account. The trial court sustained petitioner's pretrial motion to dismiss the first count of the indictment on the ground that it failed to state an offense under the Ohio statute. He was acquitted following a bench trial on the second count, the trial judge finding that the State had ""failed to establish all of [the] elements"" of the crime charged in the second count. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a. The State appealed the pretrial dismissal of the first count and on January 30, 1980, the Court of Appeals for the First Appellate District of Ohio reversed the dismissal of the first count and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. Petitioner then filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that a trial on the first count would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Citing Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436 (1970), petitioner argued that the principle of collateral estoppel is part of the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardies and that his acquittal on the second count prevented the State from again attempting to prove one or more of the elements of the crime charged in the first count. The trial court denied the motion and petitioner appealed. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Twelfth Appellate District of Ohio affirmed the denial of the motion. Relying principally on Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), the court said that the test for determining whether the trial on the second count bars a subsequent trial on the first count is whether each count requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not. The court observed that in order to obtain a conviction on the second count, the State was required to prove that petitioner knowingly obtained or exerted control over the property of another, with purpose to deprive the owner of that property, and that he acted beyond the scope of the owner's express or implied consent.

No. 80-11
Argued March 30, 1981
Reargued November 4, 1981
Decided January 25, 1982*
455 U.S. 130

Syllabus 
Respondent Indian Tribe, pursuant to its Revised Constitution (which had been approved by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) as required by the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934), enacted an ordinance (also approved by the Secretary) imposing a severance tax on oil and gas production on the tribal reservation land.  Oil and gas received by the Tribe as in-kind royalty payments from lessees of mineral leases on the reservation are exempted from the tax.  Petitioners, lessees under Secretary-approved long-term leases with the Tribe to extract oil and natural gas deposits on reservation land, brought separate actions in Federal District Court to enjoin enforcement of the tax.  The District Court, consolidating the actions, entered a permanent injunction, ruling that the Tribe had no authority to impose the tax, that only state and local authorities had the power to tax oil and gas production on Indian reservations, and that the tax violated the Commerce Clause.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the taxing power is an inherent attribute of tribal sovereignty that has not been divested by any treaty or Act of Congress, and that there was no Commerce Clause violation.
Held:
1. The Tribe has the inherent power to impose the severance tax on petitioners' mining activities as part of its power to govern and to pay for the costs of self-government.  Pp.  455 U. S. 136-152.
(a) The power to tax is an essential attribute of Indian sovereignty because it is a necessary instrument of self-government and territorial management.  This power enables a tribal government to receive revenues for its essential services.  The power does not derive solely from the Tribe's power to exclude non-Indians from tribal lands, but from the Tribe's general authority, as sovereign, to control economic activities within its jurisdiction, and to defray the cost of providing governmental services by requiring contributions from persons or enterprises engaged in such activities.  Here, petitioners, who have availed themselves of 
Page 455 U. S. 131
 the privilege of carrying on business on the reservation, benefit from police protection and other governmental services, as well as from the advantages of a civilized society assured by tribal government.  Under these circumstances, there is nothing exceptional in requiring petitioners to contribute through taxes to the general cost of such government.  The mere fact that the Tribe enjoys rents and royalties as the lessor of the mineral lands does not undermine its authority to impose the tax.  Pp.  455 U. S. 137-144.
(b) Even if the Tribe's power to tax were derived solely from its power to exclude non-Indians from the reservation, the Tribe has the authority to impose the severance tax.  Non-Indians who lawfully enter tribal lands remain subject to a tribe's power to exclude them, which power includes the lesser power to tax or place other conditions on the non-Indian's conduct or continued presence on the reservation.  The Tribe's role as commercial partner with petitioners should not be confused with its role as sovereign.  It is one thing to find that the Tribe has agreed to sell the right to use the land and take valuable minerals from it, and quite another to find that the Tribe has abandoned its sovereign powers simply because it has not expressly reserved them through a contract.  To presume that a sovereign forever waives the right to exercise one of its powers unless it expressly reserves the right to exercise that power in a commercial agreement turns the concept of sovereignty on its head.  Pp.  455 U. S. 144-148.
(c) The Federal Government did not deprive the Tribe of its authority to impose the severance tax by Congress' enactment of the 1938 Act establishing the procedures for leasing oil and gas interests on tribal lands.  Such Act does not prohibit the Tribe from imposing the tax when both the tribal Constitution and the ordinance authoring the tax were approved by the Secretary.  Nor did the 1927 Act permitting state taxation of mineral leases on Indian reservations divest the Tribe of its taxing power.  The mere existence of state authority to tax does not deprive an Indian tribe of its power to tax.  Moreover, the severance tax does not conflict with national energy policies.  To the contrary, the fact that the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 includes taxes imposed by an Indian tribe in its definition of costs that may be recovered under federal energy pricing regulations indicates that such taxes would not contravene such policies, and that the tribal authority to do so is not implicitly divested by that Act.  Pp.  455 U. S. 149-152.
2. The severance tax does not violate the ""negative implications"" of the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  455 U. S. 152-158.
(a) Courts are final arbiters under the Commerce Clause only when Congress has not acted.  Here, Congress has affirmatively acted by providing a series of federal checkpoints that must be cleared before a tribal 
Page 455 U. S. 132
 tax can take effect, and, in this case, the severance tax was enacted in accordance with this congressional scheme.  Pp.  455 U. S. 154-156.
(b) Even if judicial scrutiny under the Commerce Clause were necessary, the challenged tax would survive such scrutiny.  The tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce, since it is imposed on minerals either sold on the reservation or transported off the reservation before sale.  And the exemption for minerals received by the Tribe as in-kind payments on the leases and used for tribal purposes merely avoids the administrative make-work that would ensue if the Tribe taxed the minerals that it, as a commercial partner, received in royalty payments, and thus cannot be deemed a discriminatory preference for local commerce.  Pp. 156-158.

Rule 4 of the Missouri Supreme Court, regulating advertising by lawyers, states that a lawyer may include 10 categories of information in a published advertisement:  name, address and telephone number; areas of practice; date and place of birth; schools attended; foreign language ability; office hours; fee for an initial consultation; availability of a schedule of fees; credit arrangements; and the fixed fee to be charged for certain ""routine"" legal services.  Although the Rule does not state explicitly that these 10 categories of information are the only information that will be permitted, that is the interpretation given the Rule by the State Supreme Court and appellee Advisory Committee, which is charged with its enforcement.  An addendum to the Rule specifies two ways in which areas of practice may be listed in an advertisement, under one of which the lawyer may use one or more of a list of 23 areas of practice, but may not deviate from the precise wording stated in the Rule to describe these areas.  In addition, the Rule permits a lawyer to send professional announcement cards announcing a change of address or firm name, or similar matters, but only to ""lawyers, clients, former clients, personal friends, and relatives.""  An information was filed in the Missouri Supreme Court by appellee Advisory Committee, charging appellant, a practicing lawyer in St. Louis, Mo., with violations of Rule 4.  The information charged that appellant published advertisements which listed areas of practice in language other than that specified in the Rule and which listed the courts in which appellant was admitted to practice although this information was not included among the 10 categories of information authorized by the Rule.  In addition, the information charged that appellant had mailed announcement cards to persons other than those permitted by the Rule.  Appellant claimed that each of the restrictions upon advertising was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, but the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Rule 4 and issued a private reprimand.
Held:  None of the restrictions in question upon appellant's First Amendment rights can be sustained in the circumstances of this case.  Pp.  455 U. S. 199-207.
(a) Although the States retain the ability to regulate commercial speech, such as lawyer advertising that is inherently misleading or that has proved to be misleading in practice, the First and Fourteenth 
Page 455 U. S. 192
 Amendments require that they do so with care and in a manner no more extensive than reasonably necessary to further substantial interests.  Pp.  455 U. S. 199-204.
(b) Because the listing published by appellant -- e.g., ""real estate"" instead of ""property law"" as specified by Rule 4, and ""contracts"" and ""securities,"" which were not included in the Rule's listing -- has not been shown to be misleading, and appellee suggests no substantial interest promoted by the restriction, the portion of Rule 4 specifying the areas of practice that may be listed is an invalid restriction upon speech as applied to appellant's advertisements.  P.  455 U. S. 205.
(c) Nor has appellee identified any substantial interest in prohibiting a lawyer from identifying the jurisdictions in which he is licensed to practice.  Such information is not misleading on its face.  That appellant was licensed to practice in both Illinois and Missouri is factual and highly relevant information, particularly in light of the geography of the region in which he practices.  While listing the relatively uninformative fact that he is a member of the United States Supreme Court Bar could be misleading, there was no finding to this effect by the Missouri Supreme Court, there is nothing in the record to indicate it was misleading, and the Rule does not specifically identify it as potentially misleading.  Pp.  455 U. S. 205-206.
(d) With respect to the restriction on announcement cards, while mailings may be more difficult to supervise, there is no indication in the record that an inability to supervise is the reason the State restricts the potential audience of the cards.  Nor is it clear that an absolute prohibition is the only solution, and there is no indication of a failed effort to proceed along a less restrictive path.  P.  455 U. S. 206.

(d) With respect to the restriction on announcement cards, while mailings may be more difficult to supervise, there is no indication in the record that an inability to supervise is the reason the State restricts the potential audience of the cards.

Syllabus 
After being convicted of murder at a jury trial in a New York court, respondent moved to vacate his conviction on the ground that a juror in his case submitted during the trial an application for employment as an investigator in the District Attorney's Office, and that the prosecuting attorneys, upon being informed of the juror's application, withheld the information from the trial court and respondent's defense counsel until after the trial.  At a hearing on the motion before the same judge who had presided at the trial, the motion was denied, the judge finding ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that the events giving rise to the motion did not influence the verdict.  The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, and the New York Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal.  Subsequently, respondent sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, alleging that he had been denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment by the conduct of the juror in question.  While finding insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the juror was actually biased, the District Court nevertheless imputed bias to him and, accordingly, ordered respondent released unless the State granted him a new trial.  The United States Court of Appeals, without considering whether the juror was actually or impliedly biased, affirmed on the ground that the prosecutors' failure to disclose their knowledge about the juror denied respondent due process.
Held:  Respondent was not denied due process of law either by the juror's conduct or by the prosecutors' failure to disclose the juror's job application.  Pp.  455 U. S. 215-221.
(a) Due process does not require a new trial every time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising situation.  Due process means a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it, and a trial judge ever watchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine the effect of such occurrences when they happen.  Such determinations may properly be made at a hearing like that held in this case.  Remmer v. United States, 347 U. S. 227.  Moreover, this being a federal habeas action, the state trial judge's findings are presumptively correct under 28 U.S.C.  2254(d).  Federal courts in such proceedings must not disturb the state courts' findings unless the federal habeas 
Page 455 U. S. 210
 court articulates some basis for disarming such findings of the statutory presumption that they are correct and may be overcome only by Convincing evidence.  Here, neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals took issue with the state trial judge's findings.  Pp.  455 U. S. 215-218.
(b) The touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.  Here, the prosecutors' failure to disclose the juror's job application, although requiring a post-trial hearing on juror bias, did not deprive respondent of the fair trial guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  455 U. S. 218-221.
(c) Absent a violation of some right guaranteed respondent by the Fourteenth Amendment, it was error for the lower courts to order a new trial.  Federal courts hold no supervisory authority over state judicial proceedings, and may intervene only to correct wrongs of constitutional dimension.  P.  455 U. S. 221.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted in an Oklahoma trial court of first-degree murder for killing a police officer and was sentenced to death.  At the time of the offense, petitioner was 16 years old, but he was tried as an adult.  The Oklahoma death penalty statute provides that, in a sentencing proceeding, evidence may be presented as to ""any mitigating circumstances"" or as to any of certain enumerated aggravating circumstances.  At the sentencing hearing, the State alleged certain of the enumerated aggravating circumstances, and petitioner, in mitigation, presented substantial evidence of a turbulent family history, of beatings by a harsh father, and of serious emotional disturbance.  In imposing the death sentence, the trial judge found that the State had proved each of the alleged aggravating circumstances.  But he refused, as a matter of law, to consider in mitigation the circumstances of petitioner's unhappy upbringing and emotional disturbance, and found that the only mitigating circumstance was petitioner's youth, which circumstance was held to be insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The death sentence must be vacated, as it was imposed without ""the type of individualized consideration of mitigating factors . . . required by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments in capital cases,"" Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586,  438 U. S. 606.  Pp.  455 U. S. 110-116.
(a) ""[T]he Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer . . . not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.""  Lockett v. Ohio, supra at  438 U. S. 604.  This rule follows from the requirement that capital punishment be imposed fairly and with reasonable consistency, or not at all, and recognizes that a consistency produced by ignoring individual differences is a false consistency.  Pp.  455 U. S. 110-112.
(b) The limitation placed by the courts below upon the mitigating evidence they would consider violated the above rule.  Just as the State may not by statute preclude the sentencer from considering any mitigating factor, neither may the sentencer refuse to consider, as a matter of law, any relevant mitigating evidence.  The sentencer and the reviewing

 court may determine the weight to be given relevant mitigating evidence, but may not give it no weight by excluding it from their consideration.

No. 81-1349
Argued November 3, 1981
Decided January 13, 1982
455 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
An officer of the Washington State University police department observed a student (Overdahl) leave a dormitory carrying a bottle of gin; because Overdahl appeared to be under 21 (the minimum age allowable under Washington law for possession of alcoholic beverages), the officer stopped him and asked for identification.  After Overdahl requested to retrieve his identification from his dormitory room, the officer accompanied him there and, while remaining in the open doorway watching Overdahl and his roommate (respondent), noticed what he believed to be marihuana seeds and a pipe lying on a desk in the room.  The officer then entered the room, confirmed that the seeds were marihuana, and determined that the pipe smelled of marihuana, and informed Overdahl and resspondent of their rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  The students indicated their willingness to waive such rights, and after the officer asked if there were any other drugs in the room, respondent gave him a box which contained more marihuana and cash.  After a second officer arrived, the students voluntarily consented, orally and in writing, to a search of the room, which yielded more marihuana and another controlled substance.  Respondent was later charged with two counts of possessing the controlled substances and, after denial of his pretrial motion to suppress the evidence seized in the room, was convicted.  The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed, but the Washington Supreme Court reversed.  It held that, although Overdahl had been placed under lawful arrest, the officer had no right to enter the room and 
Page 455 U. S. 2
 seize contraband without a warrant, and that, because the students' consent to the subsequent search of the room was the fruit of the officer's initial entry, the contraband found during that search should also have been suppressed.
Held:
1. It is not ""unreasonable"" under the Fourth Amendment for a police officer, as a matter of foutine, to monitor the movements of an arrested person, as his judgment dictates, following the arrest.  The officer's need to ensure his own safety -- as well as the integrity of the arrest -- is compelling.  Such surveillance is not an impermissible invasion of the privacy or personal liberty of an individual who has been arrested.  Once the officer had placed Overdahl under lawful arrest, he was authorized to accompany him to his room for the purpose of obtaining identification.  The officer had a right to remain literally at Overdahl's elbow at all times, and thus a showing of ""exigent circumstances"" was not necessary to warrant the officer's accompanying Overdahl from the public corridor of the dormitory into his room.  Pp.  455 U. S. 5-7.
2. The Fourth Amendment did not prohibit the seizure of the contraband discovered in plain view in the room.  Regardless of where the officer was positioned with respect to the room's threshold when he observed the contraband, and regardless of whether he may have hesitated briefly at the doorway before entering the room, he did not abandon his right to be in the room with Overdahl whenever he considered it essential.  Accordingly, he had the right to act as soon as he observed the seeds and pipe.  Pp.  455 U. S. 8-9.
The seizure of other contraband taken from respondent's room pursuant to his valid consent did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  He voluntarily produced marihuana after being informed of his Miranda rights, and he then consented to the search of the room.  Thus, all of the seized contraband was properly admitted at his trial.

|455 u.s. 16|"United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co.
No. 80-1251
Argued November 3, 1981
Decided January 13, 1982
455 U.S. 16

Syllabus 
Section 1561(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 limits a ""controlled group of corporations"" to a single surtax exemption.  Section 1563(a)(2) provides that a ""controlled group of corporations"" includes a ""brother-sister controlled group,"" defined as
""[t]wo or more corporations if 5 or fewer persons . . . own . . . stock possessing (A) at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power . . . or at least 80 percent of the total value . . . of each corporation, and (B) more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power . . . or more than 50 percent of the total value . . . of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership of each such person only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation.""
An implementing Treasury Regulation interprets the statutory term ""brother-sister controlled group"" to mean two or more corporations if the same five or fewer persons own ""singly or in combination"" the two prescribed percentages of voting power or total value.  One shareholder, Vogel, owned 77.49 percent of the outstanding stock of respondent Vogel Fertilizer Co.  Another shareholder, Crain, owned the remaining 22.51 percent.  Vogel also owned 87.5 percent of the voting power in Vogel Popcorn Co. and 90.66-93.42 percent of the value of its stock.  Crain owned no stock in Vogel Popcorn.  Respondent claimed refunds for taxes paid in certain tax years for which it did not claim a full surtax exemption, asserting that respondent and Vogel Popcorn were not members of a controlled group and respondent was therefore entitled to a full surtax exemption for each taxable year.  When the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the refund claims, respondent filed suit for a refund in the Court of Claims, which held that respondent was entitled to a refund.
Held:  The implementing Treasury Regulation is invalid as not being a reasonable interpretation of the statute, which, as indicated by its language, structure, and legislative history, was intended to apply only where each person whose stock is taken into account for purposes of the 80-percent requirement owns stock in each corporation of the group.  Pp.  455 U. S. 22-35.
(a) Since the Regulation was promulgated only under the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's general authority to prescribe all needful rules and regulations, it is owed less deference than a regulation issued under a specific grant of authority to define a statutory term.  Moreover, the Regulation purports to do no more than add a clarifying gloss on a term already specifically defined by Congress.  Pp.  455 U. S. 24-25. 
Page 455 U. S. 17

(b) The statutory language is in closer harmony with respondent's interpretation than with the Regulation in question.  The term the statute defines -- ""brother-sister controlled group"" -- connotes a close horizontal relationship between two or more corporations, suggesting that the same indivisible group of five or fewer persons must represent 80 percent of the ownership of each corporation.  This interpretation is strengthened by the structure of the statute, which suggests that precisely the same shareholders must satisfy both the 80-percent and 50-percent requirements.  Since, under Part (B)'s 50-percent requirement, stock ownership is taken into account only to the extent it is ""identical,"" that part of the statutory test clearly includes a common ownership requirement.

			"|"United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co.
No. 80-1251
Argued November 3, 1981
Decided January 13, 1982
455 U.S. 16

Syllabus 
Section 1561(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 limits a ""controlled group of corporations"" to a single surtax exemption.  Section 1563(a)(2) provides that a ""controlled group of corporations"" includes a ""brother-sister controlled group,"" defined as
""[t]wo or more corporations if 5 or fewer persons . . . own . . . stock possessing (A) at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power . . . or at least 80 percent of the total value . . . of each corporation, and (B) more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power . . . or more than 50 percent of the total value . . . of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership of each such person only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation.""
An implementing Treasury Regulation interprets the statutory term ""brother-sister controlled group"" to mean two or more corporations if the same five or fewer persons own ""singly or in combination"" the two prescribed percentages of voting power or total value.  One shareholder, Vogel, owned 77.49 percent of the outstanding stock of respondent Vogel Fertilizer Co.  Another shareholder, Crain, owned the remaining 22.51 percent.  Vogel also owned 87.5 percent of the voting power in Vogel Popcorn Co. and 90.66-93.42 percent of the value of its stock.  Crain owned no stock in Vogel Popcorn.  Respondent claimed refunds for taxes paid in certain tax years for which it did not claim a full surtax exemption, asserting that respondent and Vogel Popcorn were not members of a controlled group and respondent was therefore entitled to a full surtax exemption for each taxable year.  When the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the refund claims, respondent filed suit for a refund in the Court of Claims, which held that respondent was entitled to a refund.
Held:  The implementing Treasury Regulation is invalid as not being a reasonable interpretation of the statute, which, as indicated by its language, structure, and legislative history, was intended to apply only where each person whose stock is taken into account for purposes of the 80-percent requirement owns stock in each corporation of the group.  Pp.  455 U. S. 22-35.
(a) Since the Regulation was promulgated only under the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's general authority to prescribe all needful rules and regulations, it is owed less deference than a regulation issued under a specific grant of authority to define a statutory term.  Moreover, the Regulation purports to do no more than add a clarifying gloss on a term already specifically defined by Congress.  Pp.  455 U. S. 24-25. 
Page 455 U. S. 17

(b) The statutory language is in closer harmony with respondent's interpretation than with the Regulation in question.  The term the statute defines -- ""brother-sister controlled group"" -- connotes a close horizontal relationship between two or more corporations, suggesting that the same indivisible group of five or fewer persons must represent 80 percent of the ownership of each corporation.  This interpretation is strengthened by the structure of the statute, which suggests that precisely the same shareholders must satisfy both the 80-percent and 50-percent requirements.  Since, under Part (B)'s 50-percent requirement, stock ownership is taken into account only to the extent it is ""identical,"" that part of the statutory test clearly includes a common ownership requirement.  And the mere fact that there are no words in Part (A) explicitly requiring each shareholder to own stock in each corporation does not mean that the Regulation's interpretation, ""singly or in combination,"" must be accepted as reasonable.

No. 81350
Argued October 13, 1981
Decided January 13, 1982
455 U.S. 40

Syllabus 
Respondent city of Boulder is a ""home rule"" municipality, granted by the Colorado Constitution extensive powers of self-government in local and municipal matters.  Petitioner is the assignee of a permit granted by a city ordinance to conduct a cable television business within the city limits.  Originally, only limited service within a certain area of the city could be provided by petitioner, but improved technology offered petitioner an opportunity to expand its business into other areas, and also offered opportunities to potential competitors, one of whom expressed interest in obtaining a permit to provide competing service.  The City Council then enacted an ""emergency"" ordinance prohibiting petitioner from expanding its business for three months, during which time the Council was to draft a model cable television ordinance and to invite new businesses to enter the market under the terms of that ordinance.  Petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that such a restriction would violate 1 of the Sherman Act, and seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the city from restricting petitioner's proposed expansion.  The city responded that its moratorium ordinance could not be violative of the antitrust laws because, inter alia, the city enjoyed antitrust immunity under the ""state action"" doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341.  The District Court held that the Parker exemption was inapplicable and that the city was therefore subject to antitrust liability.  Accordingly, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the city's action satisfied the criteria for a Parker exemption.
Held:  Boulder's moratorium ordinance is not exempt from antitrust scrutiny under the Parker doctrine.  Pp.  455 U. S. 48-57.
(a) The ordinance cannot be exempt from such scrutiny unless it constitutes either the action of the State itself in its sovereign capacity or municipal action in furtherance or implementation of clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy.  Pp.  455 U. S. 48-51.
(b) The Parker ""state action"" exemption reflects Congress' intention to embody in the Sherman Act the federalism principle that the States possess a significant measure of sovereignty under the Federal Constitution.  But this principle is inherently limited:  ours is a ""dual system of

 government,"" Parker, supra, at  317 U. S. 351, which has no place for sovereign cities.  Here, the direct delegation of powers to the city through the Home Rule Amendment to the Colorado Constitution does not render the cable television moratorium ordinance an ""act of government"" performed by the city acting as the State in local matters, so as to meet Parker's ""state action"" criterion.  Pp.  455 U. S. 52-54.
(c) Nor is the requirement of ""clear articulation and affirmative expression"" of a state policy fulfilled here by the Home Rule Amendment's ""guarantee of local autonomy,"" since the State's position is one of mere neutrality respecting the challenged moratorium ordinance.  This case involves city action in the absence of any regulation by the State, and such action cannot be said to further or implement any clearly articulated or affirmatively expressed state policy.  Pp.  455 U. S. 54-56.
(d) Respondents' argument that denial of the Parker exemption in this case will have serious adverse consequences for cities, and will unduly burden the federal courts, is simply an attack upon the wisdom of the longstanding congressional commitment to the policy of free markets and open competition embodied in the antitrust laws, which laws apply to municipalities not acting in furtherance of clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy.

Syllabus 
Petitioner coal producer, as a party to a collective bargaining agreement between the United Mine Workers of America and hundreds of coal producers, agreed to contribute to specified employee health and retirement funds on the basis of each ton of coal it produced and each hour worked by its covered employees.  The agreement also required an employer to report its purchases of coal from producers not under contract with the union and to make contributions to the union welfare funds on the basis of such purchases.  After petitioner failed to report and make contributions as required by the ""purchased coal"" clause, respondents, the trustees of the union trust funds, filed suit in Federal District Court to enforce the collective bargaining agreement.  Petitioner admitted its failure to comply with the purchased coal clause, but contended that the clause was void and unenforceable as violative of  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and  8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which forbids collective bargaining agreements whereby the employer agrees to cease doing business with, or to cease handling the products of, another employer (hot cargo provision).  The District Court entered summary judgment for respondents, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Both courts rejected petitioner's defense without passing on the legality of the purchased coal clause under either the Sherman Act or the NLRA.
Held:  Petitioner was entitled to plead and have adjudicated its defense based on the alleged illegality of the purchased coal clause.  Pp.  455 U. S. 77-88.
(a) Illegal promises will not be enforced in cases controlled by federal law.  This rule is not rendered inapplicable here on the asserted grounds that employers' contributions to union funds are not, in themselves and standing alone, illegal acts and that ordering petitioner to pay would therefore not command conduct that is inherently contrary to public policy.  Petitioner's obligation to pay money to the union funds arose from and was measured by its purchases from other producers who did not contribute to the union funds, and if this obligation is illegal under the antitrust or labor laws, to order petitioner to pay would command unlawful conduct.  Pp.  455 U. S. 77-83. 
Page 455 U. S. 73

(b) Although as a general rule federal courts do not have jurisdiction over activity that is arguably subject to  8 of the NLRA and must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board to determine what is and is not an unfair labor practice, a federal court has a duty to determine whether a contract violates federal law before enforcing it.  Section 8(e) renders hot cargo clauses void at their inception and at all times unenforceable by federal courts.  Thus, where a  8(e) defense is raised by a party which  8(e) was designed to protect, and where the defense is not directed to a collateral matter, but to the portion of the contract for which enforcement is sought, a court must entertain the defense.  Pp.  455 U. S. 83-86.
(c) Assuming, arguendo, that  306(a) of the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 -- which requires employers to make contributions to a multiemployer pension plan in accordance with the employer's obligation under the terms of the plan or a collective bargaining agreement -- is applicable to this case, it does not alter the result.  Section 306(a) does not abolish all illegality defenses, but explicitly requires employers to contribute to pension funds only where doing so would not be ""inconsistent with law,"" and it was intended to simplify collection actions by precluding only defenses that are ""unrelated"" or ""extraneous"" to the employer's promise to make contributions.  Nor does the statute's language or history indicate that Congress intended to implicitly repeal the antitrust laws, the labor laws, or any other statute which might be raised as a defense to a provision in a collective bargaining agreement requiring an employer to contribute to a pension fund.  Pp. 86-88.

Syllabus 
Appellee, who was not a student at Princeton University, was arrested for criminal trespass while distributing political materials on the University's campus without having first received permission from University officials, as required by a University regulation. Appellee was convicted in state court, but the New Jersey Supreme Court reversed, holding that his rights of speech and assembly under the State Constitution had been violated.  The University, which had intervened in the State Supreme Court proceedings, filed a notice of appeal and a jurisdictional statement (joined by the State) in this Court, claiming that the judgment below deprived it of its rights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution.
Held:  The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
(a) The State, in its brief, asked that the issues be decided, but declined to take a position on the merits.  Thus, if the State were the sole appellant, the appeal would be dismissed for want of a case or controversy.  Accordingly, the State's presence in the case does not provide a sound jurisdictional basis for undertaking to decide the constitutional issues.
(b) Nor does this Court have jurisdiction with respect to the University.  While the case was pending on appeal, the University substantially amended its pertinent regulations, and the New Jersey Supreme Court did not pass on the validity of the revised regulations.  The issue of the old regulation's validity is thus moot.  Since the University is not prevented by the judgment below from having the validity of its new regulation ruled upon in another enforcement action, it is without standing to invoke this Court's jurisdiction.

Argued October 13, 1981
Decided January 12, 1982
454 U.S. 404

Syllabus 
Petitioner linen supply company was a member of an association formed to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with respondent truckdrivers' union as a multiemployer unit.  When the association and union reached an impasse in bargaining for a proposed agreement, the union initiated a selective strike against petitioner, most of the other members of the association locked out their drivers, and petitioner hired permanent replacements for its striking drivers.  Thereafter, petitioner notified the association and the union that it was withdrawing from the association, and refused to sign a collective bargaining agreement later executed by the union and the association.  Meanwhile, the union filed the present action, alleging that petitioner's purported withdrawal from the bargaining unit constituted an unfair labor practice.  The National Labor Relations Board (Board) affirmed the Administrative Law Judge's finding that no unusual circumstances excused such withdrawal, and ordered petitioner to sign and implement retroactively the agreement concluded between the union and the employers' association, the refusal to sign such agreement constituting an unfair labor practice in violation of  8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  The Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order.
Held:  The bargaining impasse did not justify petitioner's unilateral withdrawal from the multiemployer bargaining unit.  Pp.  454 U. S. 408-419.
(a) An impasse is not sufficiently destructive of group bargaining to justify such a withdrawal, but is only a temporary deadlock or hiatus in negotiations.  Permitting a withdrawal at impasse would as a practical matter undermine the utility of multiemployer bargaining.  While no interim or separate agreements were executed in this case, the impasse did not initiate any right to execute an agreement inconsistent with the duty to abide by the results of group bargaining.  The balance the Board has struck is not inconsistent with the terms or purposes of the NLRA.  Pp.  454 U. S. 412-417.
(b) Here, the Board has developed a rule which, although it may deny an employer a particular economic weapon, does so in the interest of the proper and preeminent goal of maintaining the stability of the multiemployer bargaining unit.  Pp.  454 U. S. 417-419.

Petitioner linen supply company was a member of an association formed to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with respondent truckdrivers' union as a multiemployer unit.  When the association and union reached an impasse in bargaining for a proposed agreement, the union initiated a selective strike against petitioner, most of the other members of the association locked out their drivers, and petitioner hired permanent replacements for its striking drivers.  Thereafter, petitioner notified the association and the union that it was withdrawing from the association, and refused to sign a collective bargaining agreement later executed by the union and the association.  Meanwhile, the union filed the present action, alleging that petitioner's purported withdrawal from the bargaining unit constituted an unfair labor practice.  The National Labor Relations Board (Board) affirmed the Administrative Law Judge's finding that no unusual circumstances excused such withdrawal, and ordered petitioner to sign and implement retroactively the agreement concluded between the union and the employers' association, the refusal to sign such agreement constituting an unfair labor practice in violation of  8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  The Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order.
Held:  The bargaining impasse did not justify petitioner's unilateral withdrawal from the multiemployer bargaining unit.  Pp.  454 U. S. 408-419.
(a) An impasse is not sufficiently destructive of group bargaining to justify such a withdrawal, but is only a temporary deadlock or hiatus in negotiations.  Permitting a withdrawal at impasse would as a practical matter undermine the utility of multiemployer bargaining.  While no interim or separate agreements were executed in this case, the impasse did not initiate any right to execute an agreement inconsistent with the duty to abide by the results of group bargaining.  The balance the Board has struck is not inconsistent with the terms or purposes of the NLRA.  Pp.  454 U. S. 412-417.
(b) Here, the Board has developed a rule which, although it may deny an employer a particular economic weapon, does so in the interest of the proper and preeminent goal of maintaining the stability of the multiemployer bargaining unit.  Pp.  454 U. S. 417-419.
630 F.2d 25, affirmed.

Held:  The statutory citizenship requirement is valid.  Pp.  454 U. S. 436-447.
(a) While a restriction on lawfully resident aliens that primarily affects economic interests is subject to strict judicial scrutiny, such scrutiny is out of place when the restriction primarily serves a political function.  A claim that a particular restriction on legally resident aliens serves political, and not economic, goals is to be evaluated in a two-step process.  Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U. S. 634.  First, the specificity of the classification will be examined:  a classification that is substantially overinclusive or underinclusive tends to undercut the governmental claim that the classification serves legitimate political ends.  Second, even if the classification is sufficiently tailored, it may be applied in the particular case only to ""persons holding state elective or important nonelective executive, legislative, and judicial positions.""

(b) The statutes in question are an attempt to limit the exercise of the sovereign's coercive police powers over the community to citizens.

Syllabus 
Pursuant to its authority under the Property Clause, Congress enacted the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to provide an economical and efficient system for the disposal of surplus Federal Government property.  Under the statute, property that has outlived its usefulness to the Government is declared ""surplus"" and may be transferred to private or other public entities.  The Act authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) (now the Secretary of Education) to assume responsibility for disposing of surplus real property for educational use, and he may sell such property to nonprofit, tax-exempt educational institutions for consideration that takes into account any benefit which has accrued or may accrue to the United States from the transferee's use of the property.  Property formerly used as a military hospital was declared to be ""surplus property"" under the Act and was conveyed by the Department of HEW to petitioner church-related college.  The appraised value of the property, $577,500, was discounted by the Secretary of HEW's computation of a 100% public benefit allowance, thus permitting petitioner to acquire the property without making any financial payment.  Respondents, an organization dedicated to the separation of church and State and several of its employees, brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging the conveyance on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and alleging that each member of respondent organization ""would be deprived of the fair and constitutional use of his (her) tax dollars.""  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that respondents lacked standing to sue as taxpayers under Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, and failed to allege any actual injury beyond a generalized grievance common to all taxpayers.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although respondents lacked standing as taxpayers to challenge the conveyance, they had standing merely as ""citizens,"" claiming ""injury in fact' to their shared individuated right to a government that `shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion,'"" which standing was sufficient to satisfy the ""case or controversy"" requirement of Art. III. 
Page 454 U. S. 465
 
Held:  Respondents do not have standing, either in their capacity as taxpayers or as citizens, to challenge the conveyance in question.  Pp.  454 U. S. 471-490.
(a) The exercise of judicial power under Art. III is restricted to litigants who can show ""injury in fact"" resulting from the action that they seek to have the court adjudicate.  Pp.  454 U. S. 471-476.
(b) Respondents are without standing to sue as taxpayers, because the source of their complaint is not a congressional action but a decision by HEW to transfer a parcel of federal property, and because the conveyance in question was not an exercise of Congress' authority conferred by the Taxing and Spending Clause, but by the Property Clause.  Cf. Flast v. Cohen, supra.  Pp.  454 U. S. 476-482.
(c) Nor have respondents sufficiently alleged any other basis for standing to bring suit.  Although they claim that the Constitution has been violated, they claim nothing else.  They fail to identify any personal injury suffered as a consequence of the alleged constitutional error, other than the psychological consequence presumably produced by observation of conduct with which one disagrees.  That is not injury sufficient to confer standing under Art. III.  While respondents are firmly committed to the constitutional principle of separation of church and State, standing is not measured by the intensity of the litigant's interest or the fervor of his advocacy.  Pp.  454 U. S. 482-487.
(d) Enforcement of the Establishment Clause does not justify special exceptions from the standing requirements of Art. III.  There is no place in our constitutional scheme for the philosophy that the business of the federal courts is correcting constitutional errors, and that ""cases and controversies"" are at best merely convenient vehicles for doing so, and, at worst, nuisances that may be dispensed with when they become obstacles to that transcendent endeavor.  And such philosophy does not become more palatable when the underlying merits concern the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  454 U. S. 488-490.

Syllabus 
The Indiana Dormant Mineral Interests Act, more commonly known as the Mineral Lapse Act, provides that a severed mineral interest that is not used for a period of 20 years automatically lapses and reverts to the current surface owner of the property, unless the mineral owner prior to the end of the 20-year period or within a 2-year grace period after the effective date of the Act (September 2, 1971) files a statement of claim in the local county recorder's office.  The ""use"" of a mineral interest sufficient to preclude its extinction includes actual or attempted production of the minerals, payment of rents or royalties, and payment of taxes.  The statute contains one exception to the general rule:  if an owner of 10 or more mineral interests in the same county files a statement of claim that inadvertently omits some of those interests, the omitted interests may be preserved by a supplemental filing made within 60 days of receiving notice of the lapse.  Appellants, whose unused mineral interests had lapsed upon expiration of the grace period under the Act, challenged the constitutionality of the Act in actions brought in Indiana state court.  They claimed that, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the lack of prior notice of the lapse deprived them of property without due process of law, the statute effected a taking of property for public use without just compensation, and the exception for owners of 10 or more mineral interests denied them the equal protection of the law.  They also contended that the statute constitutes an impairment of contracts in violation of the Contract Clause.  The trial court declared the statute unconstitutional, but the Indiana Supreme Court reversed.
Held:
1. The State has the power to enact the kind of statute in issue, and, in this instance, has not exercised this power in an arbitrary manner.  Each of the actions required to avoid an abandonment of a mineral interest furthers the legitimate state goals of encouraging mineral interest owners to develop such interests and of collecting property taxes.  Pp.  454 U. S. 525-530.
2. The Act does not take property without just compensation in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Since the State may treat as abandoned a mineral interest that has not been used for 20 years and for which no statement of claim has been filed, it follows that, after abandonment, 
Page 454 U. S. 517
 the former owner retains no interest for which he may claim compensation.  It is the owner's failure to make any use of the property -- and not the State's action -- that causes the lapse of the property right; there is no ""taking"" that requires compensation.  P.  454 U. S. 530.
3. Nor does the Act unconstitutionally impair the obligation of contracts.  Since appellant mineral owners did not execute any coal and oil leases until after the statutory lapse of their mineral rights, the statute cannot be said to impair a contract that did not exist at the time of its enactment.  While appellants' right to enter such an agreement has been impaired, this right is a property, not a contract, right.  P.  454 U. S. 531.
4. The Act did not extinguish appellants' property without adequate notice in violation of their due process rights.  Pp.  454 U. S. 531-538.
(a) The 2-year grace period provided by the statute forecloses any argument that the statute is invalid because mineral owners may not have had an opportunity to become familiar with its terms.  Property owners are charged with knowledge of relevant statutory provisions affecting the control or disposition of their property.  Moreover, the greatest deference must be accorded to the judgment of state legislatures as to whether a statutory grace period provides an adequate opportunity for citizens to become familiar with a new law.  Here, both the Indiana Legislature and the Indiana Supreme Court have concluded that the 2-year grace period was sufficient to allow property owners to familiarize themselves with the statute and to take appropriate action to protect existing interests.  Pp.  454 U. S. 531-533.
(b) Given appellants' presumed knowledge that their unused mineral interests would lapse unless they filed a statement of claim, appellants had no constitutional right to be advised that the 20-year period of nonuse was about to expire.  Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, distinguished.  Since the State may impose on a mineral interest owner the burden of using that interest or filing a statement of claim, it follows that the State may impose on him the lesser burden of keeping informed of the use or nonuse of his own property.  Pp.  454 U. S. 533-538.
5. Since the statutory exception for owners of 10 or more mineral interests furthers the legitimate statutory purpose of encouraging multiple ownership as being more conducive to the actual production of mineral resources, and has no adverse impact on persons like appellants who own fewer mineral interests, the exception does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Syllabus 
There are two principal pay systems for federal employees:  (1) The General Schedule (GS), which applies to ""white-collar"" employees and which is divided into numbered pay grades and subdivided into rates of pay or ""steps"" within each grade, with the salary for each ""step"" uniform nationwide; and (2) the prevailing wage system (WS), which primarily applies to ""blue-collar"" employees specifically excluded from GS, and which is also divided into grades and subdivided into ""steps,"" with the rates of pay for each ""step"" based upon prevailing wage rates for comparable work in local areas.  Salary treatment for employees shifted or hired into the GS system is governed by 5 U.S.C.  5334 and implementing regulations.  An employee's salary after promotion is determined by reference either to the ""highest previous rate"" rule under  5334(a) and the governing regulation or to the ""two-step increase"" rule under  5334(b), which provides for such an increase when an employee is promoted to a position in a higher ""grade.""

No. 80-1121
Argued November 3, 1981
Decided January 12, 1982
454 U.S. 555

Syllabus 
There are two principal pay systems for federal employees:  (1) The General Schedule (GS), which applies to ""white-collar"" employees and which is divided into numbered pay grades and subdivided into rates of pay or ""steps"" within each grade, with the salary for each ""step"" uniform nationwide; and (2) the prevailing wage system (WS), which primarily applies to ""blue-collar"" employees specifically excluded from GS, and which is also divided into grades and subdivided into ""steps,"" with the rates of pay for each ""step"" based upon prevailing wage rates for comparable work in local areas.  Salary treatment for employees shifted or hired into the GS system is governed by 5 U.S.C.  5334 and implementing regulations.  An employee's salary after promotion is determined by reference either to the ""highest previous rate"" rule under  5334(a) and the governing regulation or to the ""two-step increase"" rule under  5334(b), which provides for such an increase when an employee is promoted to a position in a higher ""grade.""  Title 5 U.S.C.  5331 assigns the word ""grade"" the meaning given by  5102(a)(5), which in turn defines the word as those positions sufficiently similar to warrant their inclusion within one range of rates of basic pay ""in the General Schedule.""  Respondents, after being promoted from WS to GS positions, were administratively held to be entitled to a salary increase determined by the ""highest previous rate"" rule, which gave them a smaller increase than they would have received under the ""two-step increase"" rule.

The Court of Claims upheld their claim, and accordingly invalidated a regulation which construed  5334(b) as limited to transfers or promotions within the GS.

of Geiger Enterprises, Inc.
No. 80-1565
Decided January 11, 1982
454 U.S. 354

Syllabus 
Geiger Enterprises, Inc. (Geiger), filed a petition in Federal District Court seeking relief under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act.  Geiger continued operating its business as a debtor-in-possession, and numerous creditors filed claims.  Thereafter, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (New Code) became effective, and several of Geiger's wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliate corporations filed petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the New Code.  Geiger then moved in the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss its Chapter XI petition so that it could file a petition under Chapter 11 of the New Code.  Petitioner secured creditor and the United States, which had a claim for unpaid taxes, opposed the motion on the ground that a dismissal was prohibited by  403(a) of the New Code, which provides that a case commenced under the Bankruptcy Act ""shall be conducted and determined under such Act as if [the New Code] had not been enacted"" and ""shall continue to be governed"" by the Bankruptcy Act.  The Bankruptcy Court, however, granted the motion, relying primarily on Bankruptcy Rule 11-42(a), which provides that a debtor may file a motion to dismiss a petition under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act or to convert it to bankruptcy.  The District Court reversed, but was in turn reversed by the Court of Appeals, which held that Rule 42(a) must be read in conjunction with  403(a) to permit dismissal and refiling in certain cases, and that the operative test was whether the estate's interest would be served by such a procedure.
Held:  The Court of Appeals' decision conflicts with  403(a)'s plain meaning as well as its legislative history.  Section 403(a) makes no exception for petitions to be refiled under the New Code.  Nor does Rule 11-42(a) provide authority for the procedure.  That Rule's language clearly contemplates a voluntary dismissal which results in an adjudication of bankruptcy or revests title of all property in the debtor and removes from it the protection of the bankruptcy laws.  It does not contemplate a dismissal, such as the one here, which neither declares the debtor bankrupt nor restores the creditors' rights against the debtor's property, but simply holds matter in abeyance while the debtor files a petition under the New Code.
Certiorari granted; 635 F.2d 106, reversed.

Respondent was convicted in a Virginia state court of possessing with intent to distribute and distribution of nine ounces of marihuana, and was sentenced to 40 years in prison as authorized by Virginia law.  After exhausting direct appeal, respondent brought an action in Federal District Court seeking a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the 40-year sentence was so grossly disproportionate to the crime that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court issued the writ, and, ultimately, the Court of Appeals affirmed, after its prior affirmance had been vacated by this Court and the case had been remanded for reconsideration in light of Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263.
Held:  By affirming the District Court's decision after this Court's decision in Rummel, supra -- which stands for the proposition that federal courts should be reluctant to review legislatively mandated prison terms, and successful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences should be exceedingly rare -- the Court of Appeals sanctioned an intrusion into the basic line-drawing process that is properly within the province of legislatures, not courts.

454 U.S. 393

Syllabus 
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires a political subdivision that enacts a voting procedure different from that in effect on November 1, 1964, either to seek a declaratory judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia approving the procedure or to submit the procedure to the Attorney General for preclearance.  In 1976, the County Council of Sumter County, S.C. adopted a council-administrator form of government with at-large elections.  When this governmental structure was submitted to the Attorney General for preclearance, he made a timely objection to the at-large method of election, and subsequently, when the county asked him to reconsider, refused to withdraw his objection.  Private parties and the United States then brought separate suits in Federal District Court to prevent at-large elections, and, after the suits were consolidated, the District Court permanently enjoined County Council elections until the Voting Rights Act's requirements were fulfilled.  In 1978, a county referendum approved at-large elections.  In 1979, the county wrote a letter to the Attorney General advising him of the referendum results, but, referring to the letter as a ""request for reconsideration,"" he still refused to withdraw his objection to at-large elections.  Thereafter, defendant-appellees moved the District Court for summary judgment, contending that the 1979 letter was a preclearance submission, not a request for reconsideration, and that the Attorney General had not interposed an objection to the preclearance submission within the required time period.  The District Court agreed.
Held:  The 1979 letter was a reconsideration request, not a preclearance submission.  Because the 1978 referendum did no more than endorse an election method that previously had been submitted to the Attorney General and that was the subject of an outstanding objection, the letter did not amount to a new preclearance submission.  It was nothing more than a request that the Attorney General reconsider his earlier objection in light of the referendum results.

 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting. 
 Appellant instituted this action to challenge the constitutionality of Senate Bill 40, 1981 S.D.Laws, ch. 102, pp. 243-245, an Act of the South Dakota Legislature which, inter alia, retroactively increased the sales tax on utility services. Beginning in 1967, South Dakota imposed a 3-percent tax on utility services. S.D.Comp.Laws Ann. 10-45-6 (1967). Retail occupational sales and use taxes were increased to 4 percent in 1969, 1969 S.D.Laws, ch. 267, 1, pp. 366-367, and the State then began to collect sales taxes from utility companies at a rate of 4 percent. Utilities from which the tax was collected sought refunds from the State, and the Supreme Court of South Dakota held that the sales tax on utility services was not changed by the 1969 legislation and that the utilities were entitled to a credit or refund. In re Sales Tax Refund Applications, 298 N.W.2d 799 (S.D.1980). Meanwhile, appellant brought a class action against the State and the utility companies on behalf of all South Dakota residents who paid sales taxes in excess of the legal rate on their utility 
Page 454 U.S. 1131 , 1132
 bills. The Supreme Court ruled that the action against the State was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but that appellant was entitled to seek derivative relief from the utility companies. Van Emmerik v. State, 298 N.W.2d 804 (S.D.1980). The legislature then enacted and the Governor approved Senate Bill 40, effective January 30, 1981, which imposed a 4-percent tax on utility services retroactive to 1969. Appellant immediately filed this suit challenging the constitutionality of the statute on due process and Contract Clause grounds and seeking an order to prevent its enforcement and to require the State to refund excess taxes. Relying principally on United States v. Heinszen & Co., 206 U.S. 370 (1907), andForbes Pioneer Boat Line v. Board of Comm'rs, 258 U.S. 338 (1922), the Supreme Court held, among other things, that the statute does not violate due process because it is a ""curative act."" 304 N.W.2d 700, 703 (S.D.1981). 
 The difficulty in discerning the difference between permissible curative legislation and unconstitutionally retroactive legislation is apparent from an examination of our cases. A leading example of curative legislation is found in United States v. Heinszen, supra. There a tariff was imposed on goods coming into the Philippines beginning in 1898 when the islands came under the military control of the United States. The treaty ending the Spanish-American War was ratified in 1899, and the Government continued to collect the same tariff. Congress approved and continued the tariff in 1902. After this Court held that there was no authority to collect the tariff from 1899 to 1902, Lincoln v. United States, 202 U.S. 484 (1906), Congress enacted legislation legalizing and ratifying the collection of duties from 1899 to 1902.

 YAZOO COUNTY INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, et al.,v. Jonez P. SUTHOFF, et alNo. 80-1975 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 11, 1982
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 Respondents in this case sought to invoke the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1331 and 1343(3). They sought compensatory and punitive damages and attorney's fees or, in the alternative, the rescission of instruments by which they conveyed certain real property to petitioners. App. to Pet. for Cert. A2. Petitioners filed the customary Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 motions requesting dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The District Judge, a practicing Mississippi lawyer for many years before he took the bench, granted the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction: 
Page 454 U.S. 1157 , 1158
 ""The complaint contains conclusory allegations, but when reduced to the essentials, plaintiffs allege that while they received $100,830. 00 this was not enough; that the land was in fact worth several times this amount; that they were induced to sell by the fraud and deceit of their own attorneys and appraiser; and that the remaining defendants were in a conspiracy to acquire the land for a fraction of its true worth. 
 ""The plaintiffs thus are asserting a classic common law action for the common law tort of fraud and deceit. If the plaintiffs indeed have such a claim it is properly redressable only in the state court. The allegations do not reach Federal Constitutional proportions."" Id., at A3. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 637 F.2d 337, reversed the judgment of dismissal: 
 ""The issue before us is narrow: Was the federal court without jurisdiction conferred by Congress to decide the case, on the face of the complaint, under the stringent test enunciated by Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 681-682 [, 775-76], . . . .

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 I continue to adhere to my view that the death penalty is unconstitutional in all circumstances. I would therefore grant certiorari and vacate the death sentences on this basis alone. However, even if I believed that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances, I would grant certiorari in these cases to resolve a substantial question left open by this Court's decision in Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U.S. 430 (1981): whether, on resentencing, the prosecution may be given a second chance to prove a statutory aggravating circumstance that it failed to prove in the prior capital sentencing proceeding. 
 We held in Bullington that the Double Jeopardy Clause is fully applicable to capital sentencing proceedings that are patterned after trials on the question of guilt or innocence. 
Page 459 U.S. 891 , 892
 The state law considered in Bullington, like the state law in each of these cases, provides that the death penalty may be imposed only after a trier of fact finds at least one statutory aggravating circumstance. The determination by the trier of fact is made at a separate sentencing hearing at which evidence is presented in aggravation and mitigation of punishment. To obtain a death sentence the prosecution must prove the existence of one or more aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The trier of fact is instructed to identify the aggravating circumstance or circumstances it finds applicable. We concluded in Bullington that ""(b)ecause the sentencing proceeding at (Bullington's) first trial was like the trial on the question of guilt or innocence, the protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause to one acquitted by a jury is also available to him, with respect to the death penalty, at his retrial."" 451 U.S., at 446 (footnote omitted). Like an acquittal, a decision not to impose the death penalty is absolutely final. "" Having received 'one fair opportunity to offer whatever proof it could assemble,' the State is not entitled to another."" Ibid., quoting Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 16, 2150 (1978). 
 In the instant cases, petitioners were convicted of capital murder and were then sentenced to death following separate sentencing hearings authorized by state statutes similar to the one involved in Bullington.

 On petition for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice O'CONNOR joins, dissenting. 
 By enacting the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 (Act), Congress created a statutory basis for courts, in the exercise of their sound discretion, to award attorney's fees to private litigants who prevail in litigation under various civil rights laws. The Courts of Appeals responsible for interpreting the Act have differed as to the correct construction of more than one of its provisions. Because the two cases from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit which the Court today declines to review present examples of this difference on the important issue of how to determine when a party ""prevails"" within the meaning of the Act, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 The Act, codified as the last sentence of 42 U.S.C. 1988, provides for the discretionary award of attorney's fees to the ""prevailing party"" in a lawsuit brought under one or more of eight specified statutes. [Footnote 1] The Senate Report accompanying the Act, S.Rep.No.94-1011 (1976), U.S.Code Cong . & Admin.News 1976, p. 5908, provides that ""[i]t is intended that the standards for awarding fees be generally the same as under the fee provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights 
Page 455 U.S. 961 , 962
 Act."" 2 Id., at 4. Two principal cases from this Court deal with the question of when a party shall recover attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400 (1968), held that ""one who succeeds in obtaining an injunction under . . . Title [II] should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust."" Id., at 402. Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978), held that a defendant who successfully defended a charge of employment discrimination under Title VII could recover attorney's fees where the District Court found that the plaintiff's action ""was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith."" Id., at 421. 
 In each of these cases, this Court found it unnecessary to decide any question respecting the definition of ""prevailing party,"" because in each case the suit had gone to judgment in favor of the party seeking attorney's fees. Nor has this Court had occasion to define ""prevailing party"" as used in the Act. As more and more litigation has ensued in which claims for attorney's fees are made under the Act, however, more troublesome questions as to when a party has ""prevailed"" have confronted the Courts of Appeals. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in one of the judgments which the Court today declines to review, has established a test for determining when a party ""prevails"" within the meaning of 1988. That test requires the trial court to determine

 Supreme Court of the United States November 1, 1982
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice WHITE joins, dissenting. 
 In deciding this case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that (1) the historic Flathead Reservation was not terminated by an Act of Congress in 1904; (2) by virtue of the Treaty of Hell Gate the title to the bed and banks of the south half of Flathead Lake, a large inland lake in northwestern Montana, was retained by the United States as trustee for respondent Tribe, rather than passing to the State of Montana at the time the latter was admitted to the Union; and (3) respondent Tribe has the authority to regulate the riparian rights of non-Indian owners of land abutting Flathead Lake. In my opinion, the decision of the Court of Appeals with respect to the ""termination"" issue was based on principles derived from cases such as Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, 430 U.S. 584 (1977), DeCoteau v. District County Court, 420 U.S. 425 (1975), and Mattz v. Arnett, 412 U.S. 481 (1973), and does not warrant review here. With respect to the ""ownership"" issue and the ""regulatory"" issue, as they were described by the Court of Appeals, however, I believe there is reason to think that the Court of Appeals incorrectly applied our decisions in Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544, 67 L. Ed.2d 493 (1981), Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191, 98 S. Ct. 1011 (1978), and United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313 (1978), and I would grant certiorari to review these determinations. 
Page 459 U.S. 977 , 978
 The ""ownership"" issue. This requires deciding who owns the southern half of the bed and banks of Flathead Lake. The Court of Appeals relied on its own decision 40 years ago in Montana Power Company v. Rochester, 127 F.2d 189 (CA9 1942). Petitioners contended in the Court of Appeals that Rochester had been significantly undercut by our decision in Montana v. United States, supra, where we held that the treaty establishing the Crow Indian Reservation had not conveyed to the Indians beneficial ownership of the bed of the Big Horn River flowing through the Reservation. The Court of Appeals advanced several factual distinctions between the execution of the treaty in Montana and the execution of the Treaty of Hell Gate involved in this case. But the Court of Appeals apparently also disagreed with a portion of this Court's reasoning in Montana. In its opinion, the Court of Appeals stated: 
 ""The Montana Court emphasized that 'Congress was, of course, aware of this presumption once it was established by this Court.' ( Citation omitted). There is no evidence, however, that the presumption against pre-statehood federal grants of land under navigable waters had been established at the time of the Hell Gate Treaty was negotiated and ratified. The earliest statement of the presumption appeared seven decades later...."" 665 F.2d 951, 961, n. 27 (CA9 1982). 
 While this may be a proper statement of the chronology, it would surely be as applicable to the Crow treaty involved in Montana as to the Treaty of Hell Gate involved in this case. 
 It would appear that the Court of Appeals decision in Rochester, supra, was a dispute between a licensee under the Federal Power Commission which had built a dam at the outlet of Flathead Lake and a non-Indian owner of patented land. But the Rochester court did not even purport to discuss the principle laid down in United States v.
