 The application for stay 
Page 464 U.S. 1027 , 1028
 of execution of the sentence of death set for Wednesday, December 14, 1983, presented to Justice POWELL and by him referred to the Court, is granted pending decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Spencer v. Zant, 715 F.2d 1562 (1983), rehearing en banc granted or until further order of this Court. 

 Justice POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice REHNQUIST, and Justice O'CONNOR join, dissenting. 
 This is another capital case in the now familiar process in which an application for a stay is filed here within the shadow of the date and time set for execution. 
 As summarized by the Court of Appeals the relevant facts are: 
 A jury convicted petitioner of murder and sentenced him to death in early 1975. In the nearly nine years that since have transpired, Stephens has repetitively moved between state and federal courts in pursuing post- conviction remedies. His direct and collateral attacks have taken his case through the state court system three times and through the federal system twice. This Court has considered Stephens' case four times excluding his present proceedings. See ___ U.S. ___ (1983); 454 U.S. 1035 (1981); 439 U.S. 991 (1978); 429 U.S. 986 (1976). 
 The case before us today commenced with the filing of a federal habeas petition on November 15, 1983, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. The State answered the petition and pleaded that Stephens' petition for a writ of habeas corpus was an abuse of the writ. On November 16, 1983, the District Court held a hearing on the abuse question and six days later, on November 21, 1983, the District Court denied relief. It filed a full opinion in which it concluded that "" the claims raised by petitioner in his successive petition under 28 U.S.C . 2254 constitute an abuse of the writ under [464 U.S. 1027 , 1029]

|464 u.s. 114|"Rushen v. Spain
No. 82-2083
Decided December 12, 1983
464 U.S. 114

Syllabus 
During voir dire prior to the trial in a California court of respondent and others on various charges, including murder and conspiracy allegedly involving the Black Panther Party, a prospective juror (who became a juror) stated that she had no personal knowledge of violent crimes, and that she did not associate the Black Panther Party with any form of violence.  However, evidence was introduced at the trial concerning an unrelated murder by a Black Panther, triggering the juror's recollection that the victim of the unrelated murder had been the juror's childhood friend and causing her to go twice to the judge's chambers to tell him of her personal acquaintance with the victim.  On each occasion, she assured the judge -- who made no record of the conversations and did not inform the defendants or their counsel about them -- that her disposition of the case would not be affected.  After respondent was convicted, his counsel learned of the ex parte communications between the judge and the juror and moved for a new trial.  After a hearing at which the juror testified that her recollection of her friend's death did not affect her impartiality, the judge denied the motion, concluding that the communications lacked significance, and that respondent suffered no prejudice therefrom.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that, although the communications constituted federal constitutional error, they were harmless ""beyond a reasonable doubt.""  However, respondent subsequently obtained habeas corpus relief in the Federal District Court, which held, inter alia, that the ex parte communications violated respondent's constitutional rights to be present during critical stages of the proceedings and to be represented by counsel, and that automatic reversal was necessary because the absence of a contemporaneous record made intelligent application of the harmless error standard impossible.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis that an unrecorded ex parte communication between trial judge and juror could never be harmless error.
Held:  The lower federal courts' conclusion that unrecorded ex parte communications between trial judge and juror can never be harmless error ignores the day-to-day realities of courtroom life and undermines society's interest in the administration of criminal justice.  When an ex 
Page 464 U. S. 115
 parte communication relates to some aspect of the trial, the trial judge generally should disclose the communication to counsel for all parties, but the prejudicial effect of a failure to do so can normally be determined by a post-trial hearing.  The substance of the communication and its effect on juror impartiality are questions of historical fact, and, under 28 U.S.C.  2254(d), the state courts' findings thereon are entitled to a presumption of correctness, and must be deferred to by the federal courts in the absence of ""convincing evidence"" to the contrary.  The post-trial hearing in this case created more than adequate support for the finding that the juror's presence on the jury did not prejudice respondent.  The lower federal courts should have deferred to this presumptively correct state court finding, and therefore should have found the alleged constitutional error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
Certiorari granted; 701 F.2d 186, vacated and remanded.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 12, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of South Carolina. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed constitutionally under certain circumstances, I nevertheless would grant certiorari because this petition presents an important issue of federal con- 
Page 464 U.S. 1023 , 1024
 stitutional law, upon which State supreme courts and a federal court of appeals are divided. 
 At petitioner's trial, the judge made the following comments on the reasonable doubt standard: 
 "". . . . 
 "". . . I would tell you that the two phrases reasonable doubt and proof to a moral certainty are synonymous and the legal equivalent of each other. These phrases connote, however, a degree of proof distinguished from an absolute certainty. The reasonable doubt that the law gives the accused is not a weak or a slight doubt, but a strong and well-founded doubt as to the truth of the charge."" 
 These instructions guided the jury when it found petitioner guilty of murder and again at the sentencing hearing when it found beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of two statutory aggravating circumstances. 
 Petitioner objected to the reasonable-doubt instruction at trial and sought to challenge its constitutionality on appeal to the South Carolina Supreme Court. [Footnote 1] Having recently upheld similar [464 U.S. 1023 , 1025]

Federal Labor Relations Authority
No. 82-799
Argued October 11, 1983
Decided November 29, 1983
464 U.S. 89

Syllabus 
The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (Act) in 5 U.S.C.  7131(a) (1982 ed.) requires federal agencies to grant to employees representing their union in collective bargaining with the agencies ""official time . . . during the time the employee otherwise would be in a duty status.""  This allows the employee negotiators to be paid as if they were at work, whenever they bargain during hours when they would otherwise be on duty.  The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), in an ""Interpretation and Guidance"" of general applicability, construed  7131(a)'s grant of official time as also entitling employee negotiators to a per diem allowance and reimbursement for travel expenses incurred in connection with collective bargaining.  In this case, the Court of Appeals enforced an FLRA order requiring petitioner federal agency to pay an employee union representative per diem and travel expenses in addition to his salary, finding the FLRA's interpretation of the statute ""reasonably defensible.""
Held:  The FLRA's interpretation of  7131(a) constitutes an ""unauthorized assumption by [the] agency of [a] major policy decisio[n] properly made by Congress,"" American Ship Building Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300,  380 U. S. 318.  Pp.  464 U. S. 96-108.
(a) While reviewing courts should uphold an agency's reasonable and defensible constructions of its enabling statute, they must not
""rubberstamp . . . administrative decisions that they deem inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute,""
NLRB v. Brown, 380 U. S. 278,  380 U. S. 291-292.  Pp.  464 U. S. 96-98.
(b) Here, there are no indications in the Act or its legislative history that Congress intended employee negotiators to be allowed per diem and travel expenses on the theory that they are engaged in Government business.  The Act's declaration that collective bargaining contributes to efficient government and therefore serves the public interest does not reflect a dramatic departure from the principles which applied prior to passage of the Act pursuant to a program established by an Executive Order and under which employee negotiators had not been regarded as working for the Government.  Nor do the specific provisions of the Act aimed at equalizing the positions of management and labor suggest that 
Page 464 U. S. 90
 Congress intended employee negotiators to be treated as though they were ""on the job"" for all purposes. T he qualifying language of  7131(a) under which the right to a salary is conferred only when ""the employee otherwise would be in a duty status"" strongly suggests that the employee negotiator is not considered in a duty status while engaged in collective bargaining, and thereby entitled to all of the normal forms of compensation.  Pp.  464 U. S. 102-106.
(c) The FLRA's interpretation of  7131(a) is not supported by the Travel Expense Act, 5 U.S.C.  5702(a) (1982 ed.), which authorizes a per diem allowance for a federal employee ""traveling on official business away from his designated post of duty.""  Neither Congress' declaration that collective bargaining is in the public interest nor its use of the term ""official time"" warrants the conclusion that employee negotiators are on ""official business"" of the Government.

Syllabus 
In 1973, applicant was convicted of murder in a Florida state court and sentenced to death.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed, and this Court denied certiorari.  After exhausting state postconviction remedies, applicant filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, which denied the writ.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, and this Court denied certiorari.  After another petition for postconviction relief in state court was denied in 1983 and affirmed on appeal, applicant filed a second habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, which again declined to issue the writ, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Applicant then filed the instant application for a stay of execution with the Circuit Justice, who referred it to the Court.  Applicant raises five claims:  (1) denial of the right to counsel; (2) denial of the effective assistance of counsel; (3) the jury that convicted him was biased in the prosecution's favor; (4) denial of proportionality review; and (5) the Florida death penalty statute has been applied discriminatorily against blacks.
Held:  The application for a stay of execution is denied.  The first three claims raised by applicant were presented several times previously in both the state and federal courts, and have been found to be meritless.  The fourth claim was found meritless by the Florida Supreme Court, and that ruling will not be disturbed.  The fifth claim, first raised in applicant's most recent state habeas corpus petition, was based on data that were available long before that time and that the Florida Supreme Court and both federal courts below have determined to be insufficient to show that the Florida system is unconstitutionally discriminatory.

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of murder in a Florida state court, and the trial judge sentenced him to death.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed.  Thereafter, respondent filed a motion in state court to vacate the conviction and sentence, contending that the sentencing judge considered an aggravating circumstance -- future dangerousness -- that is impermissible under Florida law.  The motion was denied, and the denial was affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court.  Respondent then filed a habeas corpus petition in the Florida Supreme Court, which, in denying the petition, held that the record failed to show that the sentencing judge had relied upon the claimed impermissible factor.  Respondent then filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, which, in dismissing the petition, similarly held that the claim that the trial judge improperly considered a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance in imposing sentence was not supported by the record.  But the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding from the record that the Florida Supreme Court's finding that the sentencing judge had not relied on respondent's future dangerousness, although entitled to a presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(8), was ""not fairly supported by the record as a whole,"" and that the execution of respondent would be a ""unique, freakish instance"" in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
Held:
1. Assuming that the issue of whether the sentencing judge had relied on a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance was one of law, it is an issue of state law that was resolved by the Florida Supreme Court.  That resolution should have been accepted by the Court of Appeals, since the views of a State's highest court with respect to state law are binding on the federal courts.
2. If, on the other hand, such issue was one of fact, the Court of Appeals failed to give proper weight to the state court's resolution of the issue.  The rule under 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(8) that a federal court, in ruling on a habeas corpus petition, may not overturn a state court's factual conclusion unless such conclusion is not ""fairly supported by the record,"" applies equally to findings of trial courts and appellate courts.  Here, because the Florida Supreme Court's conclusions find fair support 
Page 464 U. S. 79
 in the record, the Court of Appeals erred in substituting its view of the facts for that of the Florida Supreme Court.
3. Even if the Court of Appeals were correct in concluding that the sentencing judge had relied on a factor unavailable to him under state law, it erred in reversing the District Court's dismissal of respondent's habeas corpus petition.  It does not appear that, if the sentencing judge did consider such a factor, the balancing process of comparing aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as prescribed by the Florida statute, was so infected as to render the death sentence constitutionally impermissible.  Whatever may have been true of the sentencing judge, there is no claim that, in conducting its independent reweighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the Florida Supreme Court considered respondent's future dangerousness.  Thus, there is no basis for concluding that the procedures followed by the State produced an arbitrary or freakish sentence forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.

No. 83-131
Decided November 28, 1983
464 U.S. 78

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of murder in a Florida state court, and the trial judge sentenced him to death.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed.  Thereafter, respondent filed a motion in state court to vacate the conviction and sentence, contending that the sentencing judge considered an aggravating circumstance -- future dangerousness -- that is impermissible under Florida law.  The motion was denied, and the denial was affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court.  Respondent then filed a habeas corpus petition in the Florida Supreme Court, which, in denying the petition, held that the record failed to show that the sentencing judge had relied upon the claimed impermissible factor.  Respondent then filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, which, in dismissing the petition, similarly held that the claim that the trial judge improperly considered a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance in imposing sentence was not supported by the record.

|464 u.s. 67|"Iron Arrow Honor Society v. Heckler
No. 83-118
Decided November 14, 1983
464 U.S. 67

Syllabus 
Petitioner Iron Arrow Honor Society (hereafter petitioner), an all-male honorary organization at the University of Miami, has traditionally conducted its initiation ""tapping"" ceremony on the University's campus.  In 1976, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) notified the University that the HEW had determined that the University was violating an HEW regulation implementing  901(a) of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and prohibiting a university that receives federal funds from giving ""significant assistance"" to any organization that discriminates on the basis of sex in providing any aid, benefit, or service to students.  The University thereafter prohibited the ""tapping"" ceremony.  Petitioner then brought an action in Federal District Court, seeking to prevent the Secretary from interpreting the regulation so as to require the University to ban petitioner's activities from campus.  Before the Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed a summary judgment for the Secretary, the president of the University wrote a letter to petitioner stating that it could not return to or conduct its activities on campus until it discontinued its discriminatory membership policy, and that this was the University's position regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit.  The Court of Appeals held that the letter did not moot the case, because it could still grant some relief to petitioner.
Held:  The president's letter renders the case moot, and the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to decide it.
(a) To satisfy the Art. III case-or-controversy requirement, a litigant must have suffered some actual injury that can be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.  Here, no resolution of the dispute can redress petitioner's grievance.  Whatever the correctness of the Secretary's interpretation of the regulation in question, the University has stated unequivocally that it will not allow petitioner to conduct its activities on campus as long as it refuses to admit women.  It is the University's action, not that of the Secretary, that excludes petitioner.
(b) Whether or not the Court of Appeals could grant relief to petitioner against an enforcement action other than one seeking to ban petitioner from campus need not be decided, as the Secretary is not requesting 
Page 464 U. S. 68
 the University to take such additional steps, and petitioner has not sought in this lawsuit to prevent the University from doing so.
(c) Since this case concerns the effect of the voluntary acts of a third-party nondefendant, it is not controlled by the line of cases in which it has been held that the voluntary discontinuance of challenged activities by a defendant does not moot the lawsuit absent proof that ""there is no reasonable likelihood that the wrong will be repeated.""  But even assuming that such line of cases applies, it does not appear on the basis of the letter in question that there is any ""reasonable likelihood"" that the University will change its mind and decide to invite petitioner to return to campus.
Certiorari granted; 702 F.2d 549, vacated and remanded.

Respondent's state court murder conviction and death sentence were affirmed by the Louisiana Supreme Court, and this Court denied his petition for certiorari and request for rehearing.  After he unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus relief in the state courts, respondent filed his first federal court petition for habeas corpus presenting the same issues that had proved unavailing in the state courts.  The District Court denied the petition, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and this Court again denied certiorari and a request for a rehearing.  Respondent unsuccessfully renewed his attempt to win relief in the state courts, and then filed a second petition for habeas corpus in the District Court, raising two claims that had previously been rejected and two additional claims.  The court refused to grant the writ or to stay respondent's execution.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment -- finding respondent's claims to be without merit -- but issued a stay of execution pending either this Court's anticipated review of the law concerning state court procedures for review of the ""proportionality"" of death sentences, or this Court's ""further directions.""
Held:  The stay was improvidently entered by the Court of Appeals.  The standard for determining whether a court of appeals' stay pending disposition of a petition for certiorari should continue in effect is whether there exists a reasonable probability that four Members of this Court will consider the underlying issue sufficiently meritorious for the grant of certiorari.

No. 82-585
Argued October 4, 1983
Decided November 1, 1983*
464 U.S. 7

Syllabus 
A Hawaii statute imposes a tax on the annual gross income of airlines operating within the State, and declares that such tax is a means of taxing an airline's personal property.  Section 7(a) of the Airport Development Acceleration Act of 1973 (ADAA) prohibits a State from levying a tax,
""directly or indirectly, on persons traveling in air commerce or on the carriage of persons traveling in air commerce or on the sale of air transportation or on the gross receipts derived therefrom,""
but provides that property taxes are not included in this prohibition.  Appellant airlines each brought an action for refund of taxes assessed under the Hawaii statute, claiming that the statute was preempted by  7(a).  The Hawaii Tax Appeal Court rejected this preemption argument, and the Hawaii Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  Section 7(a) preempts the Hawaii statute.  Pp.  464 U. S. 11-15.
(a) When a federal statute unambiguously forbids a State to impose a particular kind of tax on an industry affecting interstate commerce, as  7(a) does here by its plain language, courts need not look beyond the federal statute's plain language to determine whether a state statute that imposes such a tax is preempted.  P.  464 U. S. 12.
(b) Moreover, nothing in the ADAA's legislative history suggests that Congress intended to limit  7(a)'s preemptive effect to taxes on airline passengers or to save gross receipts taxes such as the one Hawaii imposes.  Although  7(a) was enacted to deal primarily with local head taxes on airline passengers, the legislative history contains many references to the fact that  7(a) preempts state taxes on gross receipts of airlines.  Pp.  464 U. S. 12-13.
(c) The fact that the Hawaii tax is styled as a property tax measured by gross receipts rather than as a straightforward gross receipts tax does not entitle the tax to escape preemption under  7(a)'s property tax exemption.  Such styling of the tax does not mask the fact that the purpose and effect of the tax are to impose a levy upon the gross receipts

 of airlines, thus making it at least an ""indirect"" tax on such receipts.  Pp.  464 U. S. 13-14.

No. 82-472
Argued October 5, 1983
Decided November 1, 1983
464 U.S. 16

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted in Federal District Court, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) chapter of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970,  of violating 18 U.S.C.  1962(c) and (d) by being involved in an arson ring that resulted in his fraudulently receiving insurance proceeds in payment for the fire loss of a building he owned.  The District Court also entered a judgment of forfeiture against petitioner for the amount of the insurance proceeds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  1963(a)(1), which provides that a person convicted under  1962 shall forfeit to the United States ""any interest he has acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The insurance proceeds petitioner received as a result of his arson activities constitute an ""interest "" within the meaning of  1963(a)(1), and are therefore subject to forfeiture.  Pp.  464 U. S. 20-29.
(a) Section 1963(a)(1) does not reach only ""interests in an enterprise.""  Where the term ""interest"" is not specifically defined in the RICO statute, it is assumed that the legislative purpose is expressed by the term's ordinary meaning, which comprehends all forms of real and personal property, including profits and proceeds.  Congress apparently selected the broad term ""interest"" because it did not wish the forfeiture provision to be limited by rigid and technical definitions drawn from other areas of law and because the term was fully consistent with the RICO statute's pattern in utilizing broad terms and concepts.  Every property interest, including a right to profits or proceeds, may be described as an interest in something.  Before profits of an illegal enterprise are divided, each participant may be said to own an ""interest"" in the ill-gotten gains, and after distribution, each has a possessory interest in currency or other items so distributed.  P.  464 U. S. 20-22.
(b) Had Congress intended to restrict  1963(a)(1) to an interest in an enterprise, it presumably would have done so expressly, as it did in  1963(a)(2).  To construe  1963(a)(1) to reach only interests in an enterprise would blunt the section's effectiveness in combating illegitimate enterprises, and would mean that whole areas of organized crime activity would be placed beyond the reach of the RICO statute.  Pp.  464 U. S. 22-24.
(c) The fact that the Controlled Substances Act specifically authorizes the forfeiture of ""profits"" obtained in illegal drug enterprises cannot be read as imposing a limitation upon  1963(a)(1)'s broader language, particularly

			"|"Russello v. United States
No. 82-472
Argued October 5, 1983
Decided November 1, 1983
464 U.S. 16

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted in Federal District Court, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) chapter of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970,  of violating 18 U.S.C.  1962(c) and (d) by being involved in an arson ring that resulted in his fraudulently receiving insurance proceeds in payment for the fire loss of a building he owned.  The District Court also entered a judgment of forfeiture against petitioner for the amount of the insurance proceeds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  1963(a)(1), which provides that a person convicted under  1962 shall forfeit to the United States ""any interest he has acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The insurance proceeds petitioner received as a result of his arson activities constitute an ""interest "" within the meaning of  1963(a)(1), and are therefore subject to forfeiture.  Pp.  464 U. S. 20-29.
(a) Section 1963(a)(1) does not reach only ""interests in an enterprise.""  Where the term ""interest"" is not specifically defined in the RICO statute, it is assumed that the legislative purpose is expressed by the term's ordinary meaning, which comprehends all forms of real and personal property, including profits and proceeds.  Congress apparently selected the broad term ""interest"" because it did not wish the forfeiture provision to be limited by rigid and technical definitions drawn from other areas of law and because the term was fully consistent with the RICO statute's pattern in utilizing broad terms and concepts.  Every property interest, including a right to profits or proceeds, may be described as an interest in something.  Before profits of an illegal enterprise are divided, each participant may be said to own an ""interest"" in the ill-gotten gains, and after distribution, each has a possessory interest in currency or other items so distributed.  P.  464 U. S. 20-22.
(b) Had Congress intended to restrict  1963(a)(1) to an interest in an enterprise, it presumably would have done so expressly, as it did in  1963(a)(2).  To construe  1963(a)(1) to reach only interests in an enterprise would blunt the section's effectiveness in combating illegitimate enterprises, and would mean that whole areas of organized crime activity would be placed beyond the reach of the RICO statute.  Pp.  464 U. S. 22-24.
(c) The fact that the Controlled Substances Act specifically authorizes the forfeiture of ""profits"" obtained in illegal drug enterprises cannot be read as imposing a limitation upon  1963(a)(1)'s broader language, particularly 
Page 464 U. S. 17
 where the RICO statute was aimed at organized crime's economic power in all its forms, whereas the narcotics activity proscribed by the Controlled Substances Act usually generates only monetary profits.  Pp.  464 U. S. 24-25.
(d) Nor is a limiting construction of  1963(a)(1) supported by the fact that certain state racketeering statutes expressly provide for the forfeiture of ""profits,"" ""money,"" ""interest or property,"" or ""all property, real or personal,"" acquired from racketeering, since those States presumably used such language so as to avoid narrow interpretations of their laws such as was given the federal statute in certain Federal District Court opinions.

Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Virginia
No. 81-2332
Argued October 3, 1983
Decided November 1, 1983
464 U.S. 30

Syllabus 
Respondent Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. of Virginia (C&P) was required to relocate some of its transmission facilities by reason of a street realignment resulting from federally funded urban renewal projects carried out in Norfolk, Va., by petitioner Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority (NRHA), a political subdivision of the State.  C&P sought reimbursement from NRHA for the expenses incurred in this relocation, claiming that it was a ""displaced person"" within the meaning of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (Act), which provides in 42 U.S.C.  4622(a)(1) that any person displaced from his home or place of business by a federal or federally funded project is entitled to relocation benefits, including reimbursement for the ""actual reasonable expenses in moving himself, his family, business, farm operation, or other personal property.""  After receiving administrative rejections, C&P sued NRHA in Federal District Court, which denied relief.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  C&P is not a ""displaced person"" within the meaning of the Act.  The Act did not change the long-established common law principle that a utility forced to relocate from a public right-of-way must do so at its own expense.  An analysis of the Act -- the purposes of which were to ensure that persons displaced by federal and federally funded programs would receive uniform treatment and would not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of programs designed for the benefit of the public as a whole -- and of its legislative history, particularly as it relates to the relocation provisions of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 as a model for the provisions at issue here, shows that, in passing the Act, Congress addressed the needs of residential and business tenants and owners, and did not deal with the separate problem posed by the relocation of utility service lines.

 Larry Dean SMITH v. OKLAHOMA No. 82-6830 Supreme Court of the United States October 31, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma. The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment is vacated insofar as it leaves undisturbed the death penalty imposed and the case is remanded to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma for further consideration in light of the position presently asserted by the Attorney General of Oklahoma in his memorandum filed September 14, 1983. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, concurring in part and dissenting in part. 
 I concur in the remand of this case to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma, but I am neither comfortable nor content with this Court's vacation of only the death penalty. I would vacate petitioner's conviction as well as his sentence and thereby permit the Court of Criminal Appeals to review the case afresh. That court is free, of course, after appropriate consideration and if the circumstances warrant, to reinstate the conviction. I, however, would have the Oklahoma tribunal make that move affirmatively, rather than be tempted (it would be error, in my view) not to act at all because it misperceives an implication in this Court's vacation limited to the death penalty. 
 I reach this conclusion because the Attorney General of Oklahoma, in his response to the petition for a writ of certiorari, says only: 
 ""The transcript reveals that the sole evidence which linked the Petitioner to the death of the victim is contained in a statement given by the Petitioner to Sheriff Ingram. The crucial part of this statement appears on pages 137-140 of the trial transcript. According to Sheriff Ingram, the Petitioner advised him that, when he started walking away from the victim's pickup, he observed his co- defendant Goforth, place 'some paper or something' under the front seat of the pickup (Tr. 139). Nowhere is it stated that the Petitioner observed his co-defendant set fire to the pickup. 
Page 464 U.S. 924 , 925
 ""In view of the foregoing, the State concedes that it cannot be said that the Petitioner 'contemplated that life would be taken.' Enmund v. Florida, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 3379 (1982)."" 
 As I read that concession by the State, it means that there was no intent on petitioner's part to kill and, hence, that he could not be guilty of murder, let alone incur the death penalty. 
 But if the State's concession is indecisive and its language less than clear-as, evidently, a majority of the Members of this Court feels it to be-it seems to me that we should vacate the judgment entirely anyway, and let the Attorney General then clarify his concession to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in language that is plainly understood so that that court may act and proceed accordingly. Surely, it is not for this Court to interpret, in the first instance, the extent of the State's concession and measure its reach so begrudgingly as it does today.

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL and Justice BLACKMUN join, dissenting. 
 In each of these cases, the Court has denied petitioner's or appellant's motion to proceed in forma pauperis without initially addressing the issue whether the questions presented in the petition for certiorari or jurisdictional statement merit our plenary review-and the Court is apparently announcing today that this will

 Ordinarily, a $200 filing fee must be paid before a petition for certiorari or a jurisdictional statement, properly conforming to the requirements of Supreme Court Rule 33, may be filed.

However, 28 U.S.C. 1915 provides that ""[a]ny court of the United States may authorize the commencement, prosecution or defense of any suit, action or proceeding, civil or criminal, or appeal therein, without payment of fees and costs or security therefor, by a person who makes affidavit that he is unable to pay such costs or give security therefor."" Supreme Court Rule 46, which implements this statute, provides that ""[a] party desiring to proceed in this Court in forma pauperis shall file a motion for leave to so proceed, together with his affidavit in the form prescribed in Fed.Rules App.Proc., Form 4 . . . setting forth with particularity facts showing that he comes within the statutory requirements."" 2 If the motion is granted, no filing fee is charged and a single typewritten petition or jurisdictional statement may be filed. 
 Each year, roughly 1,000 motions supported by affidavit are made for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. [Footnote 3] These motions usually accompany a petition for a writ of certiorari or a jurisdictional statement, and our practice heretofore has almost always been not to pass on the in forma pauperis motion but to proceed directly to grant or deny the petition based on the merits of the questions presented in the petition or statement. Yet in the instant cases, each of which presents questions so lacking in merit as to have virtually no chance of receiving a plenary hearing, the Court has chosen instead to focus initially on the affidavits supporting the in forma pauperis motions and to deny the motions.

 Michael M. SCHAEFER v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARDNo. 82-1971 Supreme Court of the United States October 31, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice O'CONNOR, with whom Justice POWELL and Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 I would grant certiorari in this case to clarify the application of the National Labor Relations Board's (Board) policy of deferral to private resolutions of labor disputes. The Board applies this formal policy to both arbitral and nonarbitral settlements of labor disputes, including settlements of unfair labor practice charges. See Central Cartage Co., 206 N.L.R.B. 337, 338 (1973). In this case, petitioner made apparent concessions in collective bargaining negotiations to get the employees' Union to withdraw its unfair labor practice charges. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a, 35a-36a. Petitioner also paid cash settlements to four employees in exchange for waivers of any back pay they might be entitled to receive. Id., at 6b-7b. The Board refused, however, to defer to the Union's waiver because the parties had not resolved the legal merits of the charges and because petitioner had not provided substantial remedies for its unfair labor practice. Id., at 36a. The Board also determined that the four employees could not settle their back pay claims without Board approval and ordered petitioner to make full restitution. Id., at 6b-7b. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. 
 I  
 The Board's application of its deferral policy in this case is inexplicable. For example, the Board asserts that the settlement negotiations did not address and resolve the unfair labor practice claims. Brief in Opposition 7-8. The record clearly indicates, however, and, ironically, the Board's General Counsel found objectionable, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a-36a, that petitioner and Union engaged in extensive discussions concerning withdrawal of 
Page 464 U.S. 945 , 946
 the charges. Id., at 25a-26a. The Board has regularly held that its decision to defer does not depend on whether it agrees with the parties' actual resolution of the dispute. See, e.g., Howard Electric Co., 166 N.L. R.B. 338, 341 (1967) (deference to arbitral settlement); Terminal Transport Company, Inc., 185 N.L.R.B. 672, 673 (1970) (same). Rather, it requires the parties to discuss the charges to assure that the employees have made a clear and knowing waiver of their statutory right to process complaints before the Board. See Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 243 N.L.R.B. 501, 502 (1979) (deference to nonarbitral settlement). It is beyond peradventure that the Union and the four employees who accepted cash settlements made such a waiver here. 
 Similarly, the record contradicts the Board's contention that petitioner did not remedy the unfair labor practice. Brief in Opposition 8-9. Surely at least some of petitioner's bargaining concessions were attributable to the Union's agreement to withdraw the unfair labor practice charges. Any concessions the Union made, including waiver of the charges, would be binding upon the employees, absent evidence that the Union acted in bad faith. See Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., 424 U.S. 554, 564-567, 1056-57 (1976). Even if the Union's waiver was not determinative, the cash settlements the four employees accepted would be. No one who understands the economic logic of the old hunter's adage that ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" could dispute the substantiality of the remedy provided. Certainly the Board cannot do so, as it has approved settlements which contained no back pay awards. See, e.g., Krause Honda, Ltd., 8 NLRB Advice Memo.Rep. 18, 221 (1981) (nonarbitral settlement); Beloit Corp., Jones Division, 6 NLRB Advice Memo. Rep. 14,177 (1979) (same). 
 Moreover, the Board's assertion that settlements reached after its decisions have issued are not substantial remedies is contrary to its previous rulings. See, e.g., Krause Honda, Ltd., supra (ruling that the timing of settlements does not affect Board's deferral policy). Issuance of an adverse Board decision should make employers more willing to settle on more generous terms. Thus, settlements reached after Board decisions should be more, not less, likely to afford substantial redress for violations of the Act than are settlements reached before that time. The Board has not articulated a substantial reason for treating such a settlement less deferentially in this case. [464 U.S. 945 , 947]

 Paul ARNOTTv. UNITED STATESNo. 82-2028 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 31, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 The petition for certiorari raises several issues, all but one of which do not warrant this Court's review. 
 Petitioner Paul Arnott was convicted of a variety of drug-related offenses following a jury trial in which a number of hearsay statements made by his alleged co-conspirators were admitted. Before the trial commenced, the District Court ruled that such statements would be admitted conditionally subject to a later demonstration of their admissibility by a preponderance of the evidence under the procedure approved by the Sixth Circuit in United States v. Vinson, 606 F.2d 149, 153 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1074 and 445 U.S. 904 (1980). [ Arnott v. U.S. 464 U.S. 948 (1983) ][948-Continued.] 
At the close of the Government's case, petitioner moved to strike the co- conspirators' statements that had been admitted over his continuing objection. In his view, the Government had failed to demonstrate that (1) a conspiracy existed, (2) petitioner was a member of the conspiracy, and ( 3) the hearsay statements were made in the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. See id., at 152. The District Court denied petitioner's motion. 
 On appeal, petitioner contended that the District Court had abused its discretion in considering the statements themselves in determining whether the Government had satisfied the prerequisites to admission of those statements. Without commenting on the sufficiency of the Government's independent evidence, the Court of Appeals simply reaffirmed its previous holdings that Fed.Rule Evid. 104(a) had modified prior law to the contrary so as to authorize the consideration of challenged hearsay statements in deciding the preliminary question of admissibility, see, e.g ., United States v. Cassity, 631 F.2d 461, 464 (1980); United States v. Vinson, supra, at 153, and rejected petitioner's contention. 704 F.2d 322, 325. 
 The rule adopted by the Sixth Circuit and applied in this case conflicts with the one enunciated by every other Court of Appeals that has addressed the issue. Those courts have, almost without 
Page 464 U.S. 948 , 949
 exception, admitted statements of co-conspirators only upon a showing by a preponderance of independent evidence that a conspiracy existed in which the declarant and the defendant were both members and that the challenged statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. See United States v. Nardi, 633 F.2d 972, 974 (CA1 1980); United States v. Alvarez-Porras, 643 F.2d 54, 56-57 (CA2), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 839, 70 L. Ed.2d 121 (1981); Government of the Virgin Islands v. Dowling, 633 F.2d 660, 665 (CA3), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 960 ( 1980); United States v. Gresko, 632 F.2d 1128, 1131-1132 (CA4 1980); United States v. James, 590 F.2d 575, 580-581 (CA5) (en banc), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 917 (1979); United States v. Regilio, 669 F.2d 1169, 1174 (CA7 1981), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1133 (1982); United States v. Bell, 573 F.2d 1040, 1043-1044 (CA8 1978); United States v. Andrews, 585 F.2d 961, 964- 967 (CA10 1978); United States v. Monaco, 702 F.2d 860, 876-880 (CA11 1983) (stating standard in terms of both substantial evidence and preponderance of the evidence); United States v. Jackson, 201 U.S.App.D.C. 212, 227-234, 627 F.2d 1198, 1213-1220 (CADC 1980). The Ninth Circuit requires independent evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case that a conspiracy existed and that the defendant was part of it. See United States v. Miranda-Uriarte, 649 F.2d 1345, 1349-1350 (1981). See also United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 701, and n. 14, 3104, and n. 14 (1974) (dicta). 
 In opposing the petition, respondent argues that the Government introduced sufficient independent evidence of the existence of a conspiracy and of the membership of petitioner and the declarants to render the hearsay statements admissible under the test adopted by most Courts of Appeals. Although a close examination of the record might support this claim, the Court of Appeals made no finding concerning the weight of the independent evidence and did not purport to hold that the prerequisites to admission of co-conspirator statements established by Fed. Rule Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) would have been satisfied had the District Court not considered the statements themselves. Similarly, the Court of Appeals' conclusion that one co-conspirator's statements ""were few and cumulative to the overwhelming evidence against Arnott,"" 704 F.2d, at 325, does not establish that all of the admitted statements, considered together, did not prejudice petitioner. This Court need not scour the record to find alternative justifications-not relied on below-for a decision resting on [464 U.S. 948 , 950]

 INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL UNION NO. 323, AFL-CIOv. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARDNo. 83-63 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 31, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice BLACKMUN join, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 After determining that one of its members was working in a supervisory capacity for a nonunion employer, Local No. 323 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) charged the employee with violating the IBEW constitution. That document provides that a member may be penalized for ""[w]orking in the interest of any organization or cause which is detrimental to, or opposed to, the IBEW."" The employee was fined and ultimately expelled from the union. 
 The National Labor Relations Board charged the Local with an unfair labor practice for violating 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 158(b)(1)(B), which provides in pertinent part that ""[i]t shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents-( 1) to restrain or coerce . . . (B) an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances."" After a hearing, the administrative law judge found that the discipline was imposed for ""working for a nonunion contractor,"" which in his view constituted unlawful coercion. On review, the Board adopted the administrative law judge's findings and conclusions. It issued a cease-and-desist order and ordered various affirmative relief. 
Page 464 U.S. 950 , 951
 The Board then successfully petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for enforcement of its order. The court noted that in NLRB v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 73 ( Chewelah Contractor's, Inc.), 621 F.2d 1035 (1980), the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had held that a union does not violate 8(b)(1)(B) by disciplining a member-supervisor for his employment with a nonunion company if the union neither represents the company's employees nor displays a representational interest in them. The Eleventh Circuit declined to adopt the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the statute, stating that it found the Chewelah limitation inconsistent with the statute's central aim. It held that regardless of whether the union displays a representational interest in the company's employees, an attempt to force a member-supervisor to cease working for a nonunion company infringes the employer's right to select that person as its representative. 
 The conflict between the Ninth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit is clear. Identical action by a union will constitute an unfair labor practice in the Eleventh Circuit but not in the Ninth. Implementation of the national labor policy is hampered by such conflicting rules. Accordingly, I would grant the petition to settle the conflict.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice O'CONNOR join, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Respondent Walker was indicted in Stark County, Ohio, for murdering an off-duty policeman during a grocery store robbery in July, 1972. Two accomplices, the wife of the victim, and a disinterested eyewitness identified respondent as the perpetrator of the murder. Respondent's defense was alibi; the records of the jail in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, showed on their face that Walker was incarcerated there between April 14 and August 1, 1972. If these records were accurate, Walker could not have been in the grocery store on July 22, 1972, when the murder took place. The accuracy of these records was hotly contested at trial. 
 After a jury trial respondent was convicted of first-degree murder. His conviction was affirmed by the Ohio Court of Appeals and by the Supreme Court of Ohio, State v. Walker, 55 Ohio St-

 .2d 208, 378 N.E.2d 1049 (1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 924 (1979). Respondent then sought federal habeas relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, which granted the writ on the ground that six evidentiary rulings of the Ohio trial court concerning the scope of prosecutorial cross-examination and rebuttal testimony denied respondent a fair trial as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the judgment on the same grounds. Walker v. Engle, 703 F.2d 959 (CA6 1983). I would grant certiorari to review this novel holding that trial rulings on the scope of prosecutorial cross-examination and rebuttal testimony are cognizable on federal habeas. No case from this Court has ever held that they are, and several of our cases strongly suggest that they are not. See Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 317, 1111 (1974); Liscenba v. California, 314 U.S. 219, 227, 285 (1941); see also Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637 (1974) (prosecutorial misconduct); Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141 (1973) ( erroneous jury instruction). 
 Respondent has contended throughout that irrelevant and prejudicial evidence was allowed before the jury. The Supreme Court of Ohio rejected his contention with this language: 
 ""Upon a review of the contested testimony, we find that it was relevant, in that it tended to disprove the accuracy of the jail records, which was a question in dispute in the instant cause. The contested evidence went to the credibility of the various jail records by demonstrating the overall inefficiency of the persons and the system in which they were maintained and the general lack of inmate supervision. 
 Moreover, upon an examination of the record, we find the admission of certain of the testimony occurred without an objection and that a great proportion of this testimony occurred during cross- examination. The trial judge is posited with broad discretion in controlling cross-examination, and the appellant has the burden to show a patent abuse of discretion. We find, in the instant cause, that the admission of this testimony was relevant to the credibility of the jail records which support appellant's alibi and was neither an abuse of discretion nor a resultant prejudicial harm to appellant .""

 RANDALL BOOK CORPORATIONv. MARYLANDNo. 82-1718 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 17, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was charged with violating Article 27, 416D of the Maryland Code Annotated, which makes a person or firm guilty of a misdemeanor ""if it knowingly displays for advertising purposes any picture, photograph, drawing, sculpture or other visual representation or image of a person or portion of the human body that depicts sadomasochistic abuse, sexual conduct or sexual excitement, or any verbal description or narrative account of these activities or items."" The Circuit Court for Baltimore County dismissed the charges, concluding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. [ Randall Book Corporation v. Maryland 464 U.S. 919 (1983) ][919-Continued.] 
 On the State's appeal, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed . The court, relying on Smiley v. State, 294 Md. 461, 450 A.2d 909 (1982), concluded that the statute is constitutional and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. In Smiley, the Maryland Court of Appeals construed the statute to prohibit only ""obscene material,"" which this Court has held is unprotected by the First Amendment. See Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 23, 2614 (1973). 
 In my view, the statute is unconstitutional on its face, notwithstanding the state court's limiting construction. I continue to believe that ""at least in the absence of distribution to juveniles or obtrusive exposure to unconsenting adults, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State and Federal Governments from attempting wholly to suppress sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly 'obscene' contents."" Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 73, 113, 2662, 2665 (1973) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). See also New York v. Ferber, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 3364 (1982) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in judgment). 
 Since a criminal trial of petitioner under this statute will in my view violate the Constitution of the United States, it is clear that "" identifiable . . . constitutional polic[y]"" will be ""undermined by the continuation of the litigation in the state courts."" See Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U.S. 619, 623, 1961 (1981) (Stewart, J ., dissenting); id., at 623-624, 101 S.Ct. at 1961 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Accordingly, the decision below is final within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 1257 and we

 have jurisdiction to review it. Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, 483, 1040 (1975). 
 I would therefore grant certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, and reinstate the dismissal of the indictment.

 Supreme Court of the United States October 17, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 ( 1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed constitutionally under certain circumstances, I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence imposed here. 
 Given the wording of the Illinois death penalty statute and the trial court's instructions in this case, I am not convinced that petitioner's sentencing jury balanced mitigating factors and aggravating circumstances in the manner required by this Court in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978), and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104 (1982). Under Illinois statute, once a sentencing jury finds a statutorily-defined aggravating factor to exist, the jury proceeds to consider aggravating and mitigating factors. ""If the jury determines unanimously that there are no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude the imposition of the death sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to death."" Ill.Rev.Stat., 
Page 464 U.S. 920 , 921
 ch. 38, 9-1(g) (West Supp.1982). At the sentencing trial in this case, the trial judge instructed the jury on how to evaluate mitigating evidence : ""[Y]ou go out and determine whether or not this evidence has taken away the [aggravating] factors, mitigated the factors so that you might say no, we don't want to vote for the death penalty."" See People v. Jones, 94 Ill. 2d 275, 302, 68 Ill.Dec. 903, 916, 447 N.E.2d 161, 174 (1982) (Simon, J., dissenting). Notwithstanding other portions of the trial court's instructions, this instruction coupled with the Illinois statute's ambiguous reference to ""preclud[ing] the imposition of the death sentence"" may well have led the sentencing jury to conduct its deliberation under the assumption that petitioner had the burden of proving that the death penalty was inappropriate in his particular case. Since I do not understand this Court's precedents to permit the placing of such a burden on a defendant, I would grant the petition.

 FRESH POND SHOPPING CENTER, INC.v. Acheson CALLAHAN et alNo. 82-2151 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 11, 1983
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 Appellant, Fresh Pond Shopping Center, Inc., signed a purchase agreement in June, 1979 whereby it would acquire a six-unit apartment building located adjacent to some property it already owned. Appellant planned to demolish the building and pave over the lot to provide parking to a commercial tenant of the shopping center. Because the apartment units were rent-controlled rental housing, under the terms of Cambridge City Ordinance 926 appellant first had to obtain permission from the Cambridge Rent Control Board to remove the property from the rental housing market. Although at the time the removal permit was sought only one of the six units was occupied, the Board denied the permit. 
 The Superior Court for Middlesex County held that under the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in Flynn v. City of Cambridge, 383 Mass. 152, 418 N.E.2d 335 (1981), the restrictions on removing the apartments from the rental market in Cambridge imposed by Ordinance 926 were constitutional. The 
Page 464 U.S. 875 , 876
 decision of the Superior Court was affirmed by an equally divided Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Fresh Pond Shopping Center, Inc. v. Rent Control Board of Cambridge, --- Mass. ---, 446 N.E.2d 1060 (1983). I would note probable jurisdiction in this case because I believe the case presents important and difficult questions concerning the application of the Takings Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, which have not been decided before by this Court. They might be postponed or avoided if the case were here on certiorari, but the case is an appeal; we act on the merits whatever we do. 
 The primary feature of the Cambridge rent control statute, 1976 Mass. Acts, ch. 36, is to place virtually all residential rental property in Cambridge under control of the Cambridge Rent Control Board, whose members are appellees here. Owners of rent-controlled property are also prohibited from evicting tenants without first obtaining a certificate of eviction from the Rent Control Board. The statute limits issuance of eviction certificates to circumstances where tenants have committed certain improper acts. It preserves the landlord's right to obtain a certificate of eviction to recover possession of the property only for occupancy by the owner or certain of his family members, or if the property is to be removed from the housing market through demolition or otherwise. 
 Although the state enabling statute preserves in limited fashion a landlord's traditional right to evict a tenant in order to occupy a rental unit personally, Cambridge City Ordinance 926 eliminated the landlord's right to evict a tenant save when the Rent Control Board first issues a "" removal"" permit. Ordinance 926 delegates virtually unfettered discretion to the Board to determine whether to grant a removal permit. The Board may consider the benefits of denying removal to the tenants protected by rent control, the hardship upon existing tenants of the units sought to be removed, and the effect of removal on the proclaimed housing shortage in Cambridge. Nowhere does the ordinance suggest that these considerations be balanced against the landlord's right to put his property to other uses . In short, Ordinance 926 permits denying a ""removal"" permit in any situation. 
 The combined effect of the limitations imposed by the state enabling statute and Ordinance 926 is to deny appellant use of his property. Appellant, as a corporate entity, simply cannot occupy the remaining apartment for personal use. In effect, then, the [464 U.S. 875 , 877]

 Margaret M. HECKLER, Secretary of Health and Human Servicesv. Mario LOPEZ et alNo. A-145 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 11, 1983
 On Emergency Application for Stay. 
 The emergency application to vacate the stay entered by Justice REHNQUIST is denied. 

 Justice STEVENS with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting in part. 
 The Secretary of Health and Human Services (""the Secretary"") has taken the position that she may, at any time, terminate the payment of disability benefits to persons who have previously been found to be disabled and entitled to benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act notwithstanding the complete absence of evidence that the recipient's medical condition has improved. In maintaining this position, the Secretary refused to follow the settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which requires her to adduce some evidence of medical improvement before terminating disability benefits. See Patti v. Schweiker, 669 F.2d 582 ( CA9 1982); Finnegan v. Mathews, 641 F.2d 1340 (CA9 1981). Nevertheless, for 
Page 464 U.S. 879 , 880
 the purposes of the stay application under review, the Secretary assumes that the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the law is correct. Her stay application was predicated entirely on procedural grounds. A review of the procedural history of the case is therefore necessary. 
 Respondents filed a class action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California challenging the Secretary's policy. On June 16, 1983, the District Court entered an injunction requiring the Secretary to comply with the law of the Ninth Circuit with respect to recipients of disability benefits who reside in that circuit. The only portion of the District Court's injunction presently at issue in this Court is 4(c), which applies to all persons whose disability benefits have been terminated since August 30, 1981 (or August 25, 1980 in the case of recipients who were ""grandfathered"" into the federal program from state disability programs). Paragraph 4(c) enjoins the Secretary to notify all such persons that they may reapply for benefits, and upon reapplication, to reinstate their benefits pending a termination hearing at which the Secretary must produce some evidence of medical improvement. [Footnote 1] It is this portion of the District Court's injunction which Justice REHNQUIST, acting as Circuit Justice, stayed pending the Secretary's appeal to the Ninth Circuit. 
 Today the Court declines to vacate the stay entered by Justice REHNQUIST. Of course, in considering an application of this kind, substantial deference must be paid the judgment of the Circuit Justice. See Rosenberg v. United States, 346 U.S. 273, 286-287, 1159 (1953). The Circuit Justice's decision should not be disturbed simply because the other members of the Court would have declined to grant the stay as an original matter. Nonetheless, there are cases in which reexamination is proper, see id., at 287-288-1160; I am persuaded that this is such a case. 
 In Justice REHNQUIST's view, the District Court's injunction extended to persons over whom the District Court had no jurisdiction. That conclusion does not, however, justify a stay of the injunction to the extent that it granted relief to persons over whom the District Court does have jurisdiction. Moreover, the extent of the overbreadth is less than Justice REHNQUIST assumed when he was persuaded to enter his stay. [464 U.S. 879 , 881]

 Margaret M. HECKLER, Secretary of Health and Human Servicesv. Mario LOPEZ et alNo. A-145 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 11, 1983
 On Emergency Application for Stay. 
 The emergency application to vacate the stay entered by Justice REHNQUIST is denied. 

 Justice STEVENS with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting in part. 
 The Secretary of Health and Human Services (""the Secretary"") has taken the position that she may, at any time, terminate the payment of disability benefits to persons who have previously been found to be disabled and entitled to benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act notwithstanding the complete absence of evidence that the recipient's medical condition has improved. In maintaining this position, the Secretary refused to follow the settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which requires her to adduce some evidence of medical improvement before terminating disability benefits. See Patti v. Schweiker, 669 F.2d 582 ( CA9 1982); Finnegan v. Mathews, 641 F.2d 1340 (CA9 1981). Nevertheless, for 
Page 464 U.S. 879 , 880
 the purposes of the stay application under review, the Secretary assumes that the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the law is correct. Her stay application was predicated entirely on procedural grounds. A review of the procedural history of the case is therefore necessary. 
 Respondents filed a class action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California challenging the Secretary's policy. On June 16, 1983, the District Court entered an injunction requiring the Secretary to comply with the law of the Ninth Circuit with respect to recipients of disability benefits who reside in that circuit. The only portion of the District Court's injunction presently at issue in this Court is 4(c), which applies to all persons whose disability benefits have been terminated since August 30, 1981 (or August 25, 1980 in the case of recipients who were ""grandfathered"" into the federal program from state disability programs). Paragraph 4(c) enjoins the Secretary to notify all such persons that they may reapply for benefits, and upon reapplication, to reinstate their benefits pending a termination hearing at which the Secretary must produce some evidence of medical improvement. [Footnote 1] It is this portion of the District Court's injunction which Justice REHNQUIST, acting as Circuit Justice, stayed pending the Secretary's appeal to the Ninth Circuit.

Of course, in considering an application of this kind, substantial deference must be paid the judgment of the Circuit Justice. See Rosenberg v. United States, 346 U.S. 273, 286-287, 1159 (1953).

 Ronald N. ASHLEY et al. v. CITY OF JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI, et al No. 82-1390 Supreme Court of the United States October 11, 1983
 Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. This case presents the question whether a victim of alleged discrimination may have his right to sue totally extinguished by a prior suit to which he was not a party and in which a consent decree was entered before his cause of action even accrued. Because I think the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that a district court cannot entertain a suit challenging practices allegedly mandated or permitted by a prior consent decree, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. In United States v. City of Jackson, Civil Action No. J-74-66(N) (SD Miss.); Corley v. Jackson Police Dept., Civil Action No. 73J-4(C) (SD Miss.). As described by the district court in this case: 
 ""The consent decree entered in United States of America v. City of Jackson required, inter alia, that the City of Jackson adopt and seek to achieve a goal for hiring blacks for one-half of all vacancies in all job classifications, subject to the availability of qualified applicants, until such time as the proportion of blacks to whites in each classification equalled the proportion of blacks to whites in the working age population of the City of Jackson. The Corley v. Jackson Police Department consent decree incorporated by reference the United States of America v. City of Jackson decree and further provided that the Jackson Police Department establish separate promotion eligibility lists for white and black employees and that it make future promotions, subject to the availability of qualified black candidates, alternately from each such list in a one- to-one ratio until the proportion of black persons in supervisory positions and in the ranks above patrolman substantially equalled the proportion of blacks to whites in the working age population of the City of Jackson."" Pet. App., at 13A. 
 In 1976 and 1978, petitioners, who are white, filed two suits against the City of Jackson alleging that the City had discrimi- 
Page 464 U.S. 900 , 901
 nated against them in the police department by hiring or promoting less qualified blacks solely on the basis of their race. In substance, the complaints alleged that the ""goals"" established in the prior consent decrees were being treated as strict quotas by the City, and that blacks were being hired and promoted over whites without regard to relative qualifications. See First Amended and Supplemental Complaint at 36-38, Ashley v. City of Jackson, Civil Action No. J76-70(R)(SD Miss. July 11, 1978); Complaint at 20-22, Thaggard v. City of Jackson, Civil Action No. J78-0218(C) (SD Miss. May 22, 1978). Petitioners contended that the challenged practices were not required by the consent decrees or, in the alternative, that the consent decrees were themselves illegal. As a third option, assuming respondent's practices under the consent decrees were necessary to remedy the effects of the City's past racial discrimination, petitioners claimed that they themselves were now victims of that prior discrimination and, as such, were entitled to compensation. 
 Both suits were brought only after timely charges of discrimination had been filed with the Economic Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and statutory notices of the right to sue received. Jurisdiction of the district court was invoked under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5, and under various other provisions of federal law. The court consolidated the two actions. 
 Petitioners also filed motions for leave to intervene in the consent decree suits in order to challenge those decrees on their face. The United States opposed the motions on the grounds, among others, that they were untimely and asserted interests already adequately represented by the defendant City. The motions to intervene were denied. No appeal was taken. 
 Following a hearing, the district court dismissed the consolidated suits for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court determined that ""[ t]he practices complained of are the result of consent decrees which were entered"" in the prior cases, Pet. App., at 12a, and, thus, that the suits constitute an impermissible collateral attack on the consent decrees over which a different court has continuing jurisdiction. The dismissal was affirmed on the same grounds by the Fifth Circuit, and this petition followed. 
 I find myself at a loss to understand the origins of the doctrine of "" collateral attack"" employed by the lower courts in this case to preclude a suit brought by parties who had no connection with the [464 U.S. 900 , 902]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 11, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied.

 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth

 and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950 (1976), I would vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed under certain circumstances, I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence imposed here because the holding below is inconsistent with this Court's decision in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968). 
 In Witherspoon v. Illinois, this Court held that in a case in which the state seeks the death penalty, members of the venire cannot be excluded for cause simply because they voice general objections to the death penalty or express moral or religious scruples against its infliction. The only members of the venire who can properly be excluded for cause based upon their attitude toward the death penalty are those who make ""unmistakably clear (1) that they would automatically vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them, or (2) that their attitude toward the death penalty would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to the defendant's guilt."" Id., at 522, n. 21, 88 S. Ct., at 1777 n. 21 (emphasis in original). This Court has noted that the logic of Witherspoon would invalidate the exclusion for cause of members of a venire who indicate that there are some kinds of cases in which they would refuse to recommend capital punishment. Ibid. This Court has also noted that the logic of Witherspoon would invalidate the exclusion for cause of prospective jurors in the penalty phase of a capital trial simply because such jurors aver frankly that while they will honestly find facts and answer interrogatories based on their findings, the prospect of the death penalty may affect their honest judgment of the facts or what they may deem to be a reasonable doubt. Adams v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38, 50, 100 S. Ct. 2521, 2529 (1979).

An application to stay applicant's execution under a sentence imposed by the courts of Texas is granted pending the final disposition by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit of applicant's appeal from the District Court's denial of a writ of habeas corpus, or until a further order by this Court or by the Circuit Justice.  One of the grounds on which applicant sought relief, not raised in his earlier habeas corpus petition, was the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals' failure to determine whether his death sentence is disproportionate to the punishment imposed on others.  The issue of whether the Federal Court of Appeals properly concluded that the Texas death penalty system, as a whole, satisfies any constitutional requirement with respect to proportionality cannot be said to lack substance, since this Court has granted certiorari in another case to review a holding of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that a California death sentence cannot be carried out until the State Supreme Court conducts a comparative proportionality review.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances, I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence imposed here. 
 For the third time this year, this Court has refused to review a case in which an all-white jury has sentenced a Negro defendant to death after the prosecution used peremptory challenges to remove all Negroes from the jury. See Miller v. Illinois and Perry 
Page 464 U.S. 867 , 868
 v. Louisiana decided together with McCray v. New York, 461 U.S. ___ (1983) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). The facts of each case follow a now familiar pattern: For-cause challenges by both defense counsel and the prosecution leave an integrated jury panel. The prosecution then resorts to peremptory challenges to remove Negro members of the panel. Despite defense counsel efforts to show that the prosecution has excluded jurors on the basis of race, the trial court rules that defendant has failed to establish systematic exclusion in the manner required by this Court in Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202 (1965). The all-white jury proceeds to hear the case and sentence the Negro defendant to death. 
 The present case does not deviate from this pattern in any material respect. Petitioner, who is a Negro, pleaded guilty to killing Grady Chance during an armed robbery of Mr. Chance's store. In accordance with Miss.Code Ann. 99-19-101 (Supp.1982), a sentencing trial was then held. After for-cause challenges, the prosecution was presented a jury panel including seven Negroes. The prosecution peremptorily challenged the seven Negroes. After defense counsel exercised its peremptory challenges, the panel contained one Negro. The prosecution then used an additional peremptory challenge to remove the Negro. During a hearing held to consider petitioner's motion to quash the jury, the prosecutor took the stand, and offered reasons for three of his peremptory challenges but could not remember why he exercised the other five. Although the prosecutor had used peremptory challenges to remove all the Negro jurors and only the Negro jurors,1 the trial court nevertheless denied petitioner's motion, and the Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed, relying on Swain v. Alabama, supra, and two of its own precedents that, in turn, had relied on Swain: Gaines v. State, 404 So.2d 557, 560 (Miss.1981); Coleman v. State, 378 So.2d 640, 645 (Miss.1979). An all-white jury then heard the evidence and sentenced petitioner to death.

 Robert C. GILLIARD, Jr.v. MISSISSIPPINo. 82-6775 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 3, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances, I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence imposed here. 
 For the third time this year, this Court has refused to review a case in which an all-white jury has sentenced a Negro defendant to death after the prosecution used peremptory challenges to remove all Negroes from the jury. See Miller v. Illinois and Perry 
Page 464 U.S. 867 , 868
 v. Louisiana decided together with McCray v. New York, 461 U.S. ___ (1983) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). The facts of each case follow a now familiar pattern: For-cause challenges by both defense counsel and the prosecution leave an integrated jury panel. The prosecution then resorts to peremptory challenges to remove Negro members of the panel. Despite defense counsel efforts to show that the prosecution has excluded jurors on the basis of race, the trial court rules that defendant has failed to establish systematic exclusion in the manner required by this Court in Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202 (1965). The all-white jury proceeds to hear the case and sentence the Negro defendant to death. 
 The present case does not deviate from this pattern in any material respect. Petitioner, who is a Negro, pleaded guilty to killing Grady Chance during an armed robbery of Mr. Chance's store. In accordance with Miss.Code Ann. 99-19-101 (Supp.1982), a sentencing trial was then held. After for-cause challenges, the prosecution was presented a jury panel including seven Negroes. The prosecution peremptorily challenged the seven Negroes. After defense counsel exercised its peremptory challenges, the panel contained one Negro. The prosecution then used an additional peremptory challenge to remove the Negro. During a hearing held to consider petitioner's motion to quash the jury, the prosecutor took the stand, and offered reasons for three of his peremptory challenges but could not remember why he exercised the other five. Although the prosecutor had used peremptory challenges to remove all the Negro jurors and only the Negro jurors,1 the trial court nevertheless denied petitioner's motion, and the Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed, relying on Swain v. Alabama, supra, and two of its own precedents that, in turn, had relied on Swain: Gaines v. State, 404 So.2d 557, 560 (Miss.1981); Coleman v. State, 378 So.2d 640, 645 (Miss.1979). An all-white jury then heard the evidence and sentenced petitioner to death. 
 Last Term, when the Court denied petitions for certiorari in the two cases mentioned above, I outlined my objections to the [464 U.S. 867 , 869]

|463 u.s. 880|"Barefoot v. Estelle
No. 82-6080
Argued April 26, 1983
Decided July 6, 1983
463 U.S. 880

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of capital murder in a Texas state court after a jury trial.  A separate sentencing hearing was then held before the same jury to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed.  One of the questions submitted to the jury, as required by a Texas statute, was whether there was a probability that the petitioner would commit further criminal acts of violence and would constitute a continuing threat to society.  In addition to introducing other evidence, the State called two psychiatrists, who, in response to hypothetical questions, testified that there was such a probability.  The jury answered the question, as well as another question as to whether the killing had been deliberate, in the affirmative, thus requiring imposition of the death penalty.  On appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected petitioner's contention that such use of psychiatric testimony at the sentencing hearing was unconstitutional, and affirmed the conviction and sentence.  Ultimately, after this Court had denied certiorari and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had denied a habeas corpus application, petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus in Federal District Court raising the same claims with respect to the use of psychiatric testimony.  The District Court rejected these claims and denied the writ, but issued a certificate of probable cause pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2263, which provides that an appeal may not be taken to a court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding where the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court ""unless the justice or judge who rendered the order or a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of probable cause.""  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals again denied a habeas corpus application, as well as denying a stay of execution.  Shortly thereafter, the Court of Appeals also denied a stay of execution pending appeal of the District Court's judgment.  This Court, treating an application for stay of execution as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, granted certiorari.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals did not err in refusing to stay petitioner's death sentence.  Pp.  463 U. S. 887-896. 
Page 463 U. S. 881

(a) Although it did not formally affirm the District Court's judgment, there is no question that the Court of Appeals ruled on the merits of the appeal in the course of denying a stay, and that petitioner had ample opportunity to address the merits, and such practice was within the bounds of this Court's prior decisions, such as Garrison v. Patterson, 391 U. S. 464.  The parties, as directed, filed briefs and presented oral arguments, thus making it clear that whether a stay would be granted depended on the probability of success on the merits.  While it would have been advisable for the Court of Appeals to affirm expressly the District Court's judgment, as well as to deny the stay, the court's failure to do so does not conflict with Garrison and related cases.  Although the Court of Appeals moved swiftly to deny the stay, this does not mean that its treatment of the merits was cursory or inadequate.  On the contrary, the court's resolution of the primary issue on appeal, the admission of psychiatric testimony on dangerousness, reflects careful consideration.  To remand to the Court of Appeals for verification that the District Court's judgment was affirmed, as petitioner urges, would be an unwarranted exaltation of form over substance.  Pp.  463 U.

(b) The following procedural guidelines for handling applications for stays of execution on habeas corpus appeals pursuant to a certificate of probable cause are suggested:  (1) A certificate of probable cause requires more than a showing of the absence of frivolity of the appeal.  The petitioner must make a substantial showing of the denial of a federal right, the severity of the penalty in itself not sufficing to warrant automatic issuance of a certificate.  (2) When a certificate of probable cause is issued, the petitioner must be afforded an opportunity to address the merits, and the court of appeals must decide the merits.  (3) A court of appeals may adopt expedited procedures for resolving the merits of habeas corpus appeals, notwithstanding the issuance of a certificate of probable cause, but local rules should be promulgated stating the manner in which such cases will be handled and informing counsel that the merits of the appeal may be decided on the motion for a stay.  (4) Where there are second or successive federal habeas corpus petitions, it is proper for the district court to expedite consideration of the petition, even where it cannot be concluded that the petition should be dismissed under 28 U.S.C.  2254 Rule 9(b) because it fails to allege new or different grounds for relief.  (6) Stays of execution are not automatic pending the filing and consideration of a petition for certiorari from this Court to a court of appeals which has denied a writ of habeas corpus.  Applications for stays must contain the information and materials necessary to make a careful assessment of the merits, and so reliably to determine

2. The District Court did not err on the merits in denying petitioner's habeas corpus petition.  Pp.  463 U. S. 896-905.
(a) There is no merit to petitioner's argument that psychiatrists, individually and as a group, are incompetent to predict with an acceptable degree of reliability that a particular criminal will commit other crimes in the future, and so represent a danger to the community.  To accept such an argument would call into question predictions of future behavior that are constantly made in other contexts.  Moreover, under the generally applicable rules of evidence covering the admission and weight of unprivileged evidence, psychiatric testimony predicting dangerousness may be countered not only as erroneous in a particular case but also as generally so unreliable that it should be ignored.  Nor, despite the view of the American Psychiatric Association supporting petitioner's view, is there any convincing evidence that such testimony is almost entirely unreliable, and that the factfinder and the adversary system will not be competent to uncover, recognize, and take due account of its shortcomings.  Pp.  463 U. S. 896-903.
(b) Psychiatric testimony need not be based on personal examination of the defendant, but may properly be given in response to hypothetical questions.  Expert testimony, whether in the form of an opinion based on hypothetical questions or otherwise, is commonly admitted as evidence where it might help the factfinder do its job.  Although this case involves the death penalty, there is no constitutional barrier to applying the ordinary rules of evidence governing the use of expert testimony.  Pp.  463 U. S. 903-904.
(c) The Texas courts, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals properly rejected petitioner's argument that, even if the use of hypothetical questions in predicting dangerousness is acceptable as a general rule, the use made of them in his case violated his right to due process of law.

No. 82-6080
Argued April 26, 1983
Decided July 6, 1983
463 U.S. 880

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of capital murder in a Texas state court after a jury trial.  A separate sentencing hearing was then held before the same jury to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed.  One of the questions submitted to the jury, as required by a Texas statute, was whether there was a probability that the petitioner would commit further criminal acts of violence and would constitute a continuing threat to society.  In addition to introducing other evidence, the State called two psychiatrists, who, in response to hypothetical questions, testified that there was such a probability.  The jury answered the question, as well as another question as to whether the killing had been deliberate, in the affirmative, thus requiring imposition of the death penalty.  On appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected petitioner's contention that such use of psychiatric testimony at the sentencing hearing was unconstitutional, and affirmed the conviction and sentence.  Ultimately, after this Court had denied certiorari and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had denied a habeas corpus application, petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus in Federal District Court raising the same claims with respect to the use of psychiatric testimony.  The District Court rejected these claims and denied the writ, but issued a certificate of probable cause pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2263, which provides that an appeal may not be taken to a court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding where the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court ""unless the justice or judge who rendered the order or a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of probable cause.""  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals again denied a habeas corpus application, as well as denying a stay of execution.  Shortly thereafter, the Court of Appeals also denied a stay of execution pending appeal of the District Court's judgment.  This Court, treating an application for stay of execution as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment, granted certiorari.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals did not err in refusing to stay petitioner's death sentence.  Pp.  463 U. S. 887-896. 
Page 463 U. S. 881

(a) Although it did not formally affirm the District Court's judgment, there is no question that the Court of Appeals ruled on the merits of the appeal in the course of denying a stay, and that petitioner had ample opportunity to address the merits, and such practice was within the bounds of this Court's prior decisions, such as Garrison v. Patterson, 391 U. S. 464.  The parties, as directed, filed briefs and presented oral arguments, thus making it clear that whether a stay would be granted depended on the probability of success on the merits.  While it would have been advisable for the Court of Appeals to affirm expressly the District Court's judgment, as well as to deny the stay, the court's failure to do so does not conflict with Garrison and related cases.  Although the Court of Appeals moved swiftly to deny the stay, this does not mean that its treatment of the merits was cursory or inadequate.  On the contrary, the court's resolution of the primary issue on appeal, the admission of psychiatric testimony on dangerousness, reflects careful consideration.  To remand to the Court of Appeals for verification that the District Court's judgment was affirmed, as petitioner urges, would be an unwarranted exaltation of form over substance.  Pp.  463 U. S. 888-892.
(b) The following procedural guidelines for handling applications for stays of execution on habeas corpus appeals pursuant to a certificate of probable cause are suggested:  (1) A certificate of probable cause requires more than a showing of the absence of frivolity of the appeal.  The petitioner must make a substantial showing of the denial of a federal right, the severity of the penalty in itself not sufficing to warrant automatic issuance of a certificate.

Decided July 6, 1983
463 U.S. 939

Syllabus 
Petitioner and other men, whose apparent purpose was to indiscriminately kill white persons and to start a racial war, killed a white hitchhiker in Florida.  Petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder by a jury in a Florida state court, and as required by the Florida death penalty statute a separate sentencing hearing was held before the same jury, which rendered an advisory sentence recommending life imprisonment.  However, the trial judge, after receiving a presentence report, sentenced petitioner to death.  As required by the Florida statute, the judge made written findings of fact, including findings of the statutory aggravating circumstances that petitioner had knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons, had committed the murder while engaged in a kidnaping, had endeavored to disrupt governmental functions and law enforcement, and had been especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel.  The judge also found that, in addition to the statutory aggravating circumstances, the petitioner's record constituted an aggravating circumstance, and ultimately concluded that there were sufficient aggravating circumstances to justify the death sentence.  The judge did not find any mitigating circumstances, noting particularly that petitioner had an extensive criminal record, and thus did not qualify for the statutory mitigating circumstance of having no significant history of prior criminal activity.  On automatic appeal, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed, approving the trial judge's findings and concluding that the trial judge properly rejected the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment.  However, the Florida Supreme Court later vacated its judgment and remanded to the trial court to give petitioner a full opportunity to rebut the information in the presentence report.  After a resentencing hearing, the trial court reaffirmed the death sentence on the basis of findings that were essentially identical to its original findings, and the Florida Supreme Court again affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
411 So.2d 1310, affirmed.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded:
1. Although the State concedes that, under Florida law, the trial judge improperly found that petitioner's criminal record was an ""aggravating circumstance"" because that factor was not among those established as 
Page 463 U. S. 940
 ""aggravating circumstances"" by the Florida statute, there is no merit to petitioner's challenge concerning the findings on other aggravating circumstances.  Pp.  463 U. S. 946-951.
(a) The findings as to the presence of the statutory aggravating circumstances were made by the trial court and approved by the Florida Supreme Court under Florida law, and thus this Court's review is limited to the question whether the findings were so unprincipled or arbitrary as to violate the Federal Constitution.  It was not irrational or arbitrary to apply the statutory aggravating circumstances to the facts of this case.  Pp.  463 U. S. 946-947.
(b) Nor must the sentence be vacated on the ground that the trial judge, in explaining his sentencing decision, discussed the racial motive for the murder and compared it with his own Army experiences in World War II, when he saw Nazi concentration camps and their victims.  The Constitution does not require that the sentencing process be transformed into a rigid and mechanical parsing of statutory aggravating factors.  It is entirely fitting for the moral, factual, and legal judgment of judges and juries to play a meaningful role in sentencing.  Pp.  463 U. S. 948-951.
2. Although, under Florida law, the trial court improperly considered the petitioner's criminal record as an ""aggravating circumstance,"" imposition of the death penalty on petitioner does not violate the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  463 U. S. 951-958.
(a) The Florida statute requires the sentencer to find at least one valid statutory aggravating circumstance before the death penalty may even be considered, and permits the trial court to admit any evidence that may be relevant to the proper sentence.  Florida law requires the sentencer to balance statutory aggravating circumstances against all mitigating circumstances, and does not permit nonstatutory aggravating circumstances to enter into the weighing process.  However, when the trial court erroneously considers improper aggravating factors, the Florida Supreme Court applies a harmless error analysis if the trial court properly found that there were no mitigating circumstances.  Pp.  463 U. S. 952-956.
(b) Nothing in the Federal Constitution prohibited the trial court from considering petitioner's criminal record.  And under Florida law, the evidence was properly introduced to prove that the mitigating circumstance of absence of a criminal record did not exist.  P.  463 U. S. 956.
(c) There is no constitutional defect in a death sentence based on both statutory and nonstatutory aggravating circumstances, and mere errors of state law are not the concern of this Court unless they rise to the level of a denial of constitutional rights.  There is no reason why the Florida Supreme Court, in applying its harmless error analysis, cannot examine the balance struck by the trial judge and decide that the elimination of improperly considered aggravating circumstances could not 
Page 463 U. S. 941
 possibly affect the balance.  What is important is an individualized determination on the basis of the character of the individual and the circumstances of the crime.  Pp.  463 U. S. 956-958.
JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE POWELL, stressed the importance of procedural protections that are intended to insure that the death penalty will be imposed in a consistent, rational manner.  He concluded that Florida's sentencing procedure is constitutionally adequate; that the Florida rule that statutory aggravating factors must be exclusive affords greater protection than the Federal Constitution requires; that, although a death sentence may not rest solely on a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance, the Constitution requires no more than one valid statutory aggravating circumstance, at least a long as none of the invalid aggravating circumstances is supported by erroneous or misleading information; that there is no merit in petitioner's contention that none of the statutory aggravating circumstances found by the trial court may be sustained under Florida law and the Federal Constitution; that the trial court did not commit reversible error of constitutional magnitude by considering nonstatutory aggravating factors; and that the Florida Supreme Court ha fulfilled its constitutionally mandated responsibility of performing meaningful appellate review of death sentence.  Pp.  463 U. S. 960-974.

Syllabus 
At the guilt phase of respondent's California state court trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilt on a count of first-degree murder, which is punishable under California law by death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole where an alleged ""special circumstance"" (here the commission of murder during a robbery) is found true by the jury at the guilt phase.  In addition to requiring jury instructions at the separate penalty phase on aggravating and mitigating circumstances, California law requires that the trial judge inform the jury that a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole may be commuted by the Governor to a sentence that includes the possibility of parole (the so-called Briggs Instruction).  At the penalty phase of respondent's trial, the judge's instructions included the Briggs Instruction.  The jury returned a verdict of death.  The California Supreme Court affirmed respondent's conviction but reversed the death penalty, concluding that the Briggs Instruction violated the Federal Constitution, and remanded the case for a new penalty phase.
Held:
1. The Federal Constitution does not prohibit an instruction permitting a capital sentencing jury to consider the Governor's power to commute a life sentence without possibility of parole.  Pp.  463 U. S. 997-1009.
(a) The possible commutation of a life sentence does not impermissibly inject an element too speculative for the jury's consideration.  By bringing to the jury's attention the possibility that the defendant may be returned to society, the Briggs Instruction invites the jury to assess whether the defendant is someone whose probable future behavior makes it undesirable that he be permitted to return to society, thus focusing the jury on the defendant's probable future dangerousness.  A jury's consideration of the factor of future dangerousness was upheld in Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262.  Nor does giving the Briggs Instruction result in any diminution in the reliability of the sentencing decision of the kind condemned in Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, which held that a death sentence may not be imposed on the basis of a presentence investigation report containing information that the defendant has had no opportunity to explain or deny.  The Briggs Instruction gives the jury accurate information of which both the defendant and his counsel are aware, and it does not preclude the defendant from offering any evidence 
Page 463 U. S. 993
 or argument regarding the Governor's power to commute a life sentence.  Pp.  463 U. S. 1001-1004.
(b) The Briggs Instruction is not constitutionally infirm on the asserted ground that it deflects the jury's focus from its central task of undertaking an individualized sentencing determination.  In the sense that the instruction focuses attention on the defendant's future dangerousness, the jury's deliberation is individualized.  Also, the California sentencing system ensures that the jury will have before it information regarding the individual characteristics of the defendant and his offense.  The Briggs Instruction simply places before the jury an additional element to be considered, along with many other factors, in determining which sentence is appropriate under the circumstances of the defendant's case.  It does not affect the jury's guilt/innocence determination.  Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, distinguished.  Finally, informing the jury of the Governor's power to commute a sentence of life without possibility of parole is merely an accurate statement of a potential sentencing alternative, and corrects the misconception conveyed by the phrase ""life imprisonment without possibility of parole.""  Pp.  463 U. S. 1005-1009.
2. Nor is the Briggs Instruction unconstitutional because it fails to inform the jury also of the Governor's power to commute a death sentence.  Even assuming, arguendo, that the Briggs Instruction has the impermissible effect of skewing the jury toward imposing the death penalty, an instruction on the Governor's power to commute death sentences as well as life sentences would not restore ""neutrality"" or increase the reliability of the sentencing choice.  In fact, advising jurors that a death verdict is theoretically modifiable, and thus not ""final,"" may incline them to approach their sentencing decision with less appreciation for the gravity of their choice and for the moral responsibility reposed in them as sentencers.  Thus, an instruction disclosing the Governor's power to commute a death sentence may operate to the defendant's distinct disadvantage.  Moreover, the Briggs Instruction alone does not impermissibly impel the jury toward voting for the death sentence.  This information is relevant and factually accurate, and was properly before the jury, and the trial judge's instructions did not emphasize the role of this factor in the jury's decision.  Pp.  463 U. S. 1010-1012.
3. The conclusion that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments do not prohibit an instruction regarding a Governor's power to commute a life sentence does not override the judgment of state legislatures that capital sentencing juries should not be permitted to consider such matter.  The States are free to provide greater protections in their criminal justice system than the Federal Constitution requires.  Pp.  463 U. S. 1013-1014.

The California Supreme Court affirmed respondent's conviction but reversed the death penalty, concluding that the Briggs Instruction violated the Federal Constitution, and remanded the case for a new penalty phase.
Held:
1. The Federal Constitution does not prohibit an instruction permitting a capital sentencing jury to consider the Governor's power to commute a life sentence without possibility of parole.  Pp.  463 U. S. 997-1009.
(a) The possible commutation of a life sentence does not impermissibly inject an element too speculative for the jury's consideration.  By bringing to the jury's attention the possibility that the defendant may be returned to society, the Briggs Instruction invites the jury to assess whether the defendant is someone whose probable future behavior makes it undesirable that he be permitted to return to society, thus focusing the jury on the defendant's probable future dangerousness.  A jury's consideration of the factor of future dangerousness was upheld in Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262.  Nor does giving the Briggs Instruction result in any diminution in the reliability of the sentencing decision of the kind condemned in Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, which held that a death sentence may not be imposed on the basis of a presentence investigation report containing information that the defendant has had no opportunity to explain or deny.  The Briggs Instruction gives the jury accurate information of which both the defendant and his counsel are aware, and it does not preclude the defendant from offering any evidence 
Page 463 U. S. 993
 or argument regarding the Governor's power to commute a life sentence.  Pp.  463 U. S. 1001-1004.
(b) The Briggs Instruction is not constitutionally infirm on the asserted ground that it deflects the jury's focus from its central task of undertaking an individualized sentencing determination.  In the sense that the instruction focuses attention on the defendant's future dangerousness, the jury's deliberation is individualized.  Also, the California sentencing system ensures that the jury will have before it information regarding the individual characteristics of the defendant and his offense.  The Briggs Instruction simply places before the jury an additional element to be considered, along with many other factors, in determining which sentence is appropriate under the circumstances of the defendant's case.  It does not affect the jury's guilt/innocence determination.  Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, distinguished.  Finally, informing the jury of the Governor's power to commute a sentence of life without possibility of parole is merely an accurate statement of a potential sentencing alternative, and corrects the misconception conveyed by the phrase ""life imprisonment without possibility of parole.""  Pp.  463 U. S. 1005-1009.
2. Nor is the Briggs Instruction unconstitutional because it fails to inform the jury also of the Governor's power to commute a death sentence.  Even assuming, arguendo, that the Briggs Instruction has the impermissible effect of skewing the jury toward imposing the death penalty, an instruction on the Governor's power to commute death sentences as well as life sentences would not restore ""neutrality"" or increase the reliability of the sentencing choice.  In fact, advising jurors that a death verdict is theoretically modifiable, and thus not ""final,"" may incline them to approach their sentencing decision with less appreciation for the gravity of their choice and for the moral responsibility reposed in them as sentencers.  Thus, an instruction disclosing the Governor's power to commute a death sentence may operate to the defendant's distinct disadvantage.  Moreover, the Briggs Instruction alone does not impermissibly impel the jury toward voting for the death sentence.  This information is relevant and factually accurate, and was properly before the jury, and the trial judge's instructions did not emphasize the role of this factor in the jury's decision.  Pp.  463 U. S. 1010-1012.
3. The conclusion that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments do not prohibit an instruction regarding a Governor's power to commute a life sentence does not override the judgment of state legislatures that capital sentencing juries should not be permitted to consider such matter.  The States are free to provide greater protections in their criminal justice system than the Federal Constitution requires.  Pp.  463 U. S. 1013-1014.

No. 82-256
Argued February 23, 1983
Decided July 6, 1983
463 U.S. 1032

Syllabus 
Two police officers, patrolling in a rural area at night, observed a car traveling erratically and at excessive speed.  When the car swerved into a ditch, the officers stopped to investigate and were met by respondent, the only occupant of the car, at the rear of the car.  Respondent, who ""appeared to be under the influence of something,"" did not respond to initial requests to produce his license and registration, and when he began walking toward the open door of the car, apparently to obtain the registration, the officers followed him and saw a hunting knife on the floorboard of the driver's side of the car.  The officers then stopped respondent and subjected him to a patdown search, which revealed no weapons.  One of the officers shined his flashlight into the car, saw something protruding from under the armrest on the front seat, and, upon lifting the armrest, saw an open pouch that contained what appeared to be marihuana.  Respondent was then arrested for possession of marihuana.  A further search of the car's interior revealed no more contraband, but the officers decided to impound the vehicle, and more marihuana was found in the trunk.  The Michigan state trial court denied respondent's motion to suppress the marihuana taken from both the car's interior and its trunk, and he was convicted of possession of marihuana.  The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the search of the passenger compartment was valid as a protective search under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, and that the search of the trunk was valid as an inventory search under South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364.  However, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed, holding that Terry did not justify the passenger compartment search, and that the marihuana found in the trunk was the ""fruit"" of the illegal search of the car's interior.
Held:
1. This Court does not lack jurisdiction to decide the case on the asserted ground that the decision below rests on an adequate and independent state ground.  Because of respect for the independence of state courts and the need to avoid rendering advisory opinions, this Court, in determining whether state court references to state law constitute adequate and independent state grounds, will no longer look beyond the opinion under review, or require state courts to reconsider cases to clarify the grounds of their decisions.  Accordingly, when a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven 
Page 463 U. S. 1033
 with federal law, and when the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion, this Court will accept as the most reasonable explanation that the state court decided the case the way it did because it believed that federal law required it to do so.  If the state court decision indicates clearly and expressly that it is alternatively based on bona fide separate, adequate, and independent state grounds, this Court will not undertake to review the decision.  In this case, apart from two citations to the State Constitution, the court below relied exclusively on its understanding of Terry and other federal cases.  Even if it is accepted that the Michigan Constitution has been interpreted to provide independent protection for certain rights also secured under the Fourth Amendment, it fairly appears that the Michigan Supreme Court rested its decision primarily on federal law.  Pp.  463 U. S. 1037-1044.
2. The protective search of the passenger compartment of respondent's car was reasonable under the principles articulated in Terry and other decisions of this Court.  Although Terry involved the stop and subsequent patdown search for weapons of a person suspected of criminal activity, it did not restrict the preventive search to the person of the detained suspect.  Protection of police and others can justify protective searches when police have a reasonable belief that the suspect poses a danger.  Roadside encounters between police and suspects are especially hazardous, and danger may arise from the possible presence of weapons in the area surrounding a suspect.  Thus, the search of the passenger compartment of an automobile, limited to those areas in which a weapon may be placed or hidden, is permissible if the police officer possesses a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant the officer to believe that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons.  If, while conducting a legitimate Terry search of an automobile's interior, the officer discovers contraband other than weapons, he cannot be required to ignore the contraband, and the Fourth Amendment does not require its suppression in such circumstances.  The circumstances of this case justified the officers in their reasonable belief that respondent posed a danger if he were permitted to reenter his vehicle.  Nor did they act unreasonably in taking preventive measures to ensure that there were no other weapons within respondent's immediate grasp before permitting him to reenter his automobile.  The fact that respondent was under the officers' control during the investigative stop does not render unreasonable their belief that he could injure them.  Pp.  463 U. S. 1045-1052.
3. Because the Michigan Supreme Court suppressed the marihuana taken from the trunk as a fruit of what it erroneously held was an illegal

463 U.S. 1073

Syllabus 
Respondent, a female employee of an Arizona state agency, instituted a class action in Federal District Court, alleging that the State's deferred compensation plan for its employees discriminated on the basis of sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Under the plan, employees have the option of receiving retirement benefits from one of several companies selected by the State, all of which pay lower monthly retirement benefits to a woman than to a man who has made the same contributions.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the plaintiff class and ordered that retired female employees be paid benefits equal to those paid to similarly situated men.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The State's retirement plan discriminates on the basis of sex in violation of Title VII, and all retirement benefits derived from contributions made after this decision must be calculated without regard to the beneficiary's sex.  But benefits derived from contributions made prior to this decision may be calculated as provided by the existing terms of the Arizona plan.

Syllabus 
Under Illinois' implied consent statute, if a driver, arrested for driving while intoxicated, refuses to take a breath analysis test, the arresting officer must file with the clerk of the appropriate circuit court an affidavit that includes the statement that the officer had ""reasonable cause to believe the person was driving the motor vehicle . . . while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.""  The clerk must then notify the arrestee that his license will be suspended unless he requests a hearing within a specified time.  Respondent refused to take a breath analysis test after he was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and the arresting officer filed an affidavit that included the assertion that, at the time of the arrest, he had ""reasonable grounds to believe that said person was driving a motor vehicle in this State while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.""  Respondent exercised his statutory right to a hearing before suspension of his license.  At the hearing, the judge found that the officer's affidavit did not comply with the statute, and entered an order denying the State's request for suspension of respondent's license.  The Illinois Appellate Court, although concluding that the affidavit literally complied with the statute's requirements, held that the affidavit was insufficient under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and that the statute would be constitutional only if it required an arresting officer to set out in his affidavit the underlying circumstances which provided him with a reasonable belief that the arrestee was driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor.
Held:  Under the test set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319,  424 U. S. 335, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require an arresting officer, in enforcing Illinois' implied consent statute, to recite in his affidavit the specific evidentiary matters constituting the underlying circumstances which provided him with a reasonable belief that the arrestee was driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  The driver's right to a hearing before he may be deprived of his license for failing to submit to a breath analysis test accords him all of the process that the Federal Constitution assures.  Cf.

Syllabus 
After respondent called the police to report a homicide in which he was involved, he voluntarily accompanied them to the station house, having been told that he was not under arrest.  At the station house, the police did not advise respondent of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and after an interview that lasted less than 30 minutes, he was allowed to leave.  He was arrested five days later and, after receiving Miranda warnings, gave a second confession during which he admitted that his earlier interview had been given voluntarily.  Subsequently, respondent was convicted in a California state court for aiding and abetting first-degree murder, the court having admitted into evidence respondent's statements at both interviews.  The California Court of Appeal reversed, holding that the first police interview constituted custodial interrogation, which activated the need for Miranda warnings.
Held: Miranda warnings were not required at respondent's first interview with the police.  For Miranda purposes, ""custodial interrogation"" means questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.  Respondent was neither taken into custody for the first interview nor significantly deprived of his freedom of action.  Although the circumstances of each case must influence a determination of whether a suspect is ""in custody,"" the ultimate inquiry is merely whether there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.  Miranda warnings are not required simply because the questioning takes place in a coercive environment in the station house or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect.  Cf. Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492.

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 The principal issue in these cases is the constitutionality of the legislative veto as applied to agency rulemaking. Given the Court's recent decision in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha,462 U.S. 919 ___ (1983), the summary affirmance of the Court of Appeals' decisions striking the veto as unconstitutional is hardly surprising. These cases illustrate the constitutional myopia of the Chadha reasoning as applied to independent regulatory agencies and cast further light on the destructiveness of the Chadha holding. 
 In Process Gas Consumers v. Consumer Energy Council of America, the Court of Appeals invalidated the one-house legislative veto provision of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), contained in 202(c) of the Act. 15 U.S.C. 3342(c) (1976 and Supp. IV). The NGPA was a response to the need for financial incentives to encourage the production of natural gas for the interstate market. The Act was a compromise, reached only after months of impasse between the two Houses over the optimal means of deregulating natural gas prices while preventing excessive fuel bills for consumers and industry. Congress finally settled on a phased deregulation of natural gas prices, with a system of incremental pricing to ease the transition. Specifically, the compromise agreed to by the Conference Committee provided for an initial experiment with incremental pricing for a small class of industrial users, while authorizing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to propose expansion of incremental pricing to other industrial users at a later time. This proposal would be submitted to Congress and would become effective unless disapproved by either House.

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 The principal issue in these cases is the constitutionality of the legislative veto as applied to agency rulemaking. Given the Court's recent decision in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha,462 U.S. 919 ___ (1983), the summary affirmance of the Court of Appeals' decisions striking the veto as unconstitutional is hardly surprising. These cases illustrate the constitutional myopia of the Chadha reasoning as applied to independent regulatory agencies and cast further light on the destructiveness of the Chadha holding. 
 In Process Gas Consumers v. Consumer Energy Council of America, the Court of Appeals invalidated the one-house legislative veto provision of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), contained in 202(c) of the Act. 15 U.S.C. 3342(c) (1976 and Supp. IV). The NGPA was a response to the need for financial incentives to encourage the production of natural gas for the interstate market. The Act was a compromise, reached only after months of impasse between the two Houses over the optimal means of deregulating natural gas prices while preventing excessive fuel bills for consumers and industry. Congress finally settled on a phased deregulation of natural gas prices, with a system of incremental pricing to ease the transition. Specifically, the compromise agreed to by the Conference Committee provided for an initial experiment with incremental pricing for a small class of industrial users, while authorizing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to propose expansion of incremental pricing to other industrial users at a later time. This proposal would be submitted to Congress and would become effective unless disapproved by either House. The veto provision was central to this accommodation, because it allowed the Congress to observe the effects of the initial phase of incremental pricing without committing the nation to a broader program which, it was feared, would drive industrial gas users to oil, [463 U.S. 1216 , 1218]

No. 81-1794
Argued February 22, 1983
Decided July 5, 1983
463 U.S. 745

Syllabus 
After respondent was convicted of robbery and assault in a jury trial in a New York state court, counsel was appointed to represent him on appeal.  Respondent informed counsel of several claims that he felt should be raised, but counsel rejected most of the suggested claims, stating that they would not aid respondent in obtaining a new trial and that they could not be raised on appeal because they were not based on evidence in the record.  Counsel then listed seven potential claims of error that he was considering including in his brief, and invited respondent's ""reflections and suggestions"" with regard to those claims.  Counsel's brief to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court concentrated on three of the claims, two of which had been originally suggested by respondent.  In addition, respondent's own pro se briefs were filed.  At oral argument, counsel argued the points presented in his own brief, but not the arguments raised in the pro se briefs.  The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction.  After respondent was unsuccessful in earlier collateral proceedings attacking his conviction, he filed this action in Federal District Court, seeking habeas corpus relief on the basis that his appellate counsel had provided ineffective assistance.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that, under Anders v. California, 386 U. S. 738 -- which held that an appointed attorney must advocate his client's cause vigorously and may not withdraw from a nonfrivolous appeal -- appointed counsel must present on appeal all nonfrivolous arguments requested by his client.  The Court of Appeals held that respondent's counsel had not met this standard, in that he failed to present certain nonfrivolous claims.
Held:  Defense counsel assigned to prosecute an appeal from a criminal conviction does not have a constitutional duty to raise every nonfrivolous issue requested by the defendant.  The accused has the ultimate authority to make certain fundamental decisions regarding his case, including the decision whether to take an appeal; and, with some limitations, he may elect to act as his own advocate.  However, an indigent defendant has no constitutional right to compel appointed counsel to press nonfrivolous points requested by the client, if counsel, as a matter of professional judgment, decides not to present those points.  By promulgating 
Page 463 U. S. 746
 a per se rule that the client must be allowed to decide what issues are to be pressed, the Court of Appeals seriously undermined the ability of counsel to present the client's case in accord with counsel's professional evaluation.  Experienced advocates have emphasized the importance of winnowing out weaker arguments on appeal and focusing on one central issue if possible, or at most on a few key issues.  Selecting the most promising issues for review has assumed a greater importance in an era when the time for oral argument is strictly limited in most courts and when page limits on briefs are widely imposed.  The decision in Anders, far from giving support to the Court of Appeals' rule, is to the contrary; Anders recognized that the advocate's role ""requires that he support his client's appeal to the best of his ability.""  386 U.S. at  386 U.

Syllabus 
A large, locked metal container, shipped by air from Calcutta to respondent in Chicago, was opened by a customs officer at the airport, who found a wooden table with marihuana concealed in a compartment.  A Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent confirmed that it was marihuana, and the table and container were resealed.  The next day, the DEA agent and a Chicago police officer posed as delivery men and delivered the container to respondent, leaving it in the hallway outside his apartment.  The DEA agent stationed himself to keep the container in sight and observed respondent take the container into his apartment.  When the other officer left to secure a warrant to search the apartment, the DEA agent maintained surveillance of the apartment.  Some 30 or 45 minutes after the delivery, but before the other officer could return with a warrant, respondent emerged from the apartment with the shipping container and was immediately arrested and taken to the police station; there the container was reopened and the marihuana found inside the table was seized.  No search warrant had been obtained.  Prior to trial on charges of possession of controlled substances, the Illinois state trial court granted respondent's motion to suppress the marihuana.  The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed, holding that a ""controlled delivery"" had not been made, so as to render a warrant unnecessary, because the DEA agent was not present when the container was resealed at the airport by the customs officers and the container was out of sight while it was in respondent's apartment.
Held:  The warrantless reopening of the container following its reseizure did not violate respondent's rights under the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  463 U. S. 769-773.
(a) If an inspection by police does not intrude upon a legitimate expectation of privacy, there is no ""search"" subject to the Warrant Clause.  No protected privacy interest remains in contraband in a container once government officers lawfully (as here) have opened that container and identified its contents as illegal.  The simple act of resealing the container to enable the police to make a controlled delivery does not operate to revive or restore the lawfully invaded privacy rights, and the subsequent reopening of the container is not a ""search"" within the intendment of the Fourth Amendment.  The rigors and contingencies inescapable in 
Page 463 U. S. 766
 an investigation into illicit drug traffic make ""perfect"" controlled deliveries frequently impossible to attain.  The likelihood that contraband may be removed or other items may be placed inside the container during a gap in surveillance depends on all the facts and circumstances, including the nature and uses of the container, the length of the break in surveillance, and the setting in which the events occur.  A workable, objective standard that limits the risk of intrusion on legitimate privacy interests when there has been an interruption of surveillance is whether there is a substantial likelihood that the contents of the container have been changed during the gap in surveillance.  Pp.  463 U. S. 769-773.
(b) There was no substantial likelihood here that the contents of the shipping container were changed during the brief period that it was out of sight of the surveilling officer.

Syllabus 
The Nebraska Legislature begins each of its sessions with a prayer by a chaplain paid by the State with the legislature's approval. Respondent member of the Nebraska Legislature brought an action in Federal District Court, claiming that the legislature's chaplaincy practice violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and seeking injunctive relief.  The District Court held that the Establishment Clause was not breached by the prayer, but was violated by paying the chaplain from public funds, and accordingly enjoined the use of such funds to pay the chaplain.  The Court of Appeals held that the whole chaplaincy practice violated the Establishment Clause, and accordingly prohibited the State from engaging in any aspect of the practice.
Held:  The Nebraska Legislature's chaplaincy practice does not violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  463 U. S. 786-795.
(a) The practice of opening sessions of Congress with prayer has continued without interruption for almost 200 years, ever since the First Congress drafted the First Amendment, and a similar practice has been followed for more than a century in Nebraska and many other states.  While historical patterns, standing alone, cannot justify contemporary violations of constitutional guarantees, historical evidence in the context of this case sheds light not only on what the drafters of the First Amendment intended the Establishment Clause to mean, but also on how they thought that Clause applied to the chaplaincy practice authorized by the First Congress.  In applying the First Amendment to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, it would be incongruous to interpret the Clause as imposing more stringent First Amendment limits on the states than the draftsmen imposed on the Federal Government.  In light of the history, there can be no doubt that the practice of opening legislative sessions with prayer has become part of the fabric of our society.  To invoke divine guidance on a public body entrusted with making the laws is not, in these circumstances, a violation of the Establishment Clause; it is simply a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country.  Pp.  463 U. S. 786-792.
(b) Weighed against the historical background, the facts that a clergyman of only one denomination has been selected by the Nebraska Legislature

Syllabus 
Respondent construction company hired nonunion workers for a project near Port Arthur, Tex., and a citizen protest against the company's hiring practice was organized at a meeting held by the Executive Committee of the Sabine Area Building and Construction Trades Council.  During the protest at the construction site, company employees (including the two individual respondents) were assaulted and beaten, and construction equipment was burned and destroyed.  The violence and vandalism delayed construction and led the company to default on its contract.  In their action in Federal District Court against petitioners -- the Sabine Area Building and Construction Trades Council and certain local unions and individuals -- respondents asserted that petitioners had conspired to deprive respondents of their legally protected rights, contrary to the provisions of 42 U.S.C.  1985(3) (1976 ed., Supp. V) making available a cause of action to those injured by conspiracies formed
""for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws.""
The District Court entered judgment for respondents, granting injunctive relief and awarding damages.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in pertinent part, holding that the purpose of the conspiracy was to deprive respondents of their First Amendment right not to associate with a union, that for purposes of  1985(3) it was not necessary to show some state involvement in the infringement of First Amendment rights, and that  1985(3) reaches conspiracies motivated by political or economic bias as well as those motivated by racial bias, thus including the conspiracy to harm the nonunion employees of the nonunion contractor.
Held:  An alleged conspiracy to infringe First Amendment rights is not a violation of  1985(3) unless it is proved that the State is involved in the conspiracy or the aim of the conspiracy is to influence the activity of the State.  Moreover, the kind of animus that  1985(3) requires is not present in this case.  Pp.  463 U. S. 830-839.

 constitutionally protected against private as well as official encroachment, such as the rights involved in that case -- the right to travel and Thirteenth Amendment rights.  However, Griffin did not hold or declare that, when the alleged conspiracy is aimed at a right that is, by definition, only a right against state interference, such as First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, the plaintiff in a  1985(3) suit nevertheless need not prove that the conspiracy contemplated state involvement of some sort.  Pp.  463 U. S. 831-834.
(b) The language and legislative history of  1985(3) establish that it requires ""some racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators' action.""  Griffin, supra, at  403 U. S. 102.  Pp.  463 U. S. 834-835.
(c) Though the predominant purpose of  1985(3) was to combat the then-prevalent animus against Negroes and their supporters, it is not necessary to determine here whether  1985(3) must be construed to reach only cases involving racial bias.  Pp.  463 U. S. 835-837.
(d) Even if it is assumed that  1985(3) is to be construed to reach conspiracies aimed at any class or organization on account of its political views or activities, the provision does not reach conspiracies motivated by bias towards others on account of their economic views, status, or activities.  Neither the language nor the legislative history of  1985(3) compels a construction that would include group action resting on economic or commercial animus, such as animus in favor of or against unionization.

No. 81-1717
Argued March 29, 1983
Decided July 5, 1983
463 U.S. 855

Syllabus 
Until 1959, Rev.Stat.  3701 provided in pertinent part that
""[a]ll stocks, bonds, Treasury notes, and other obligations of the United States, shall be exempt from taxation by or under State or municipal or local authority.""
In 1959, Congress amended  3701 by adding a second sentence:
""This exemption extends to every form of taxation that would require that either the obligations or the interest thereon, or both, be considered, directly or indirectly, in the computation of the tax,""
exceptions only for nondiscriminatory franchise taxes or other nonproperty taxes, and for estate or inheritance taxes.  In 1979 and 1980, Texas imposed a property tax on bank shares, and the tax was levied on bank shares of petitioner state and national banks and their shareholders.  The tax was computed on the basis of each bank's net assets without any deduction for the value of United States obligations held by the bank.  Petitioners, in separate state court actions, sought mandamus, declaratory, and injunctive relief, asserting that 3701, as amended, required that the value of their bank shares be reduced by the proportionate value of the United States obligations held by the bank.  Ultimately, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals, in companion cases, upheld the tax.
Held:
1. The Texas tax on bank shares violates Rev.Stat.  3701, as amended.  Pp.  463 U. S. 862-867.
(a) The 1959 amendment to  3701 set aside this Court's pre-1959 interpretation that the statute did not prohibit nondiscriminatory taxes imposed on discrete property interests such as corporate shares, even though the value of that discrete interest was measured by the underlying assets, including United States obligations.  Under the plain language of the 1959 amendment, a tax is barred regardless of its form if federal obligations must be considered, either directly or indirectly, in computing the tax.  Giving the words of amended  3701 their ordinary 
Page 463 U. S. 856
 meaning, there can be no question that federal obligations were considered in computing the bank shares tax at issue here.  The express exceptions to the 1959 amendment -- franchise taxes and estate and inheritance taxes -- reinforce this conclusion.  The fact that the Texas tax statute, on its face, does not require use of the equity capital formula or any other formula based on the value of federal obligations is immaterial.  The tax assessors in fact used the equity capital formula, which is the usual and customary method employed in Texas, and thus the taxes at issue violated  3701's plain language.  Pp.  463 U. S. 862-865.
(b) The legislative history of the 1959 amendment supports construction of the amendment according to its plain language.  Nothing in that history suggests that Congress considered shares taxes to fall outside the scope of the prohibition.  Rather, Congress intended to sweep away formal distinctions and to invalidate all taxes measured directly or indirectly by the value of federal obligations, except those taxes specified in the amendment.  Pp.  463 U. S. 865-867.
2. Nor is the Texas tax authorized by Rev.Stat.  5219, as amended.  That statute provides only that States may not impose discriminatory taxes on national banks.  Section 5219 is capable of coexistence with the plain language of  3701, as amended, and there is no justification for construing  5219 to create an inconsistency.  An unexpressed congressional authorization to tax bank shares at their full value should not be read into the plain language of  5219 on the basis of the language of that section as it existed before it was amended in 1969.  Before 1969,  5219 authorized the States to tax national banks in specified ways, including taxing bank shares.  However, that version did not mention federal obligations;  5219 was, and still is, addressed to the historically and analytically distinct federal interest in prohibiting state taxes that impose an intolerable burden on national banks.  The prior version of  5219 need not be read as giving implied consent to taxation of federal obligations, and the plain language of  3701, as amended in 1959, need not be seen as an ""implied repeal"" of the pre-1969 version of  5219.  The doctrine disfavoring implied repeals thus is irrelevant here.  Pp.  463 U. S. 867-873.

Syllabus 
In Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, it was held that (1) the McCarran Amendment, which waived the sovereign immunity of the United States as to comprehensive state water rights adjudications, provides state courts with jurisdiction to adjudicate Indian water rights held in trust by the United States, and (2), in light of the federal policies underlying that Amendment, a suit brought by the United States in federal court claiming water rights on behalf of itself and certain Indian Tribes was properly dismissed in favor of concurrent adjudication reaching the same issues in a Colorado state court.  The instant cases form a sequel to that decision.  In No. 81-2188, the United States and various Indian Tribes brought actions in Federal District Court, seeking an adjudication of rights in certain streams in Montana.  Subsequently, the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation filed a petition in state court to adjudicate water rights in the same streams.  Still later, the United States brought additional actions in Federal District Court, seeking to adjudicate its rights and the rights of various Indian Tribes in other Montana streams, and these rights also became involved in state proceedings.  Motions to dismiss the federal actions were granted, the District Court relying in part on Colorado River.  On consolidated appeals, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Montana might lack jurisdiction to adjudicate claims in state court because the Enabling Act admitting Montana to the Union and the provision of the Montana Constitution promulgated in response to that Act reserved ""absolute jurisdiction and control"" over Indian lands in Congress; that the State, however, might have acquired such jurisdiction under Pub.L. 280, which allowed a State to acquire certain jurisdiction over Indian affairs and to amend its constitution to remove any impediment to such jurisdiction in a constitutional or statutory declaimer; and that, even if it were found that Montana 
Page 463 U. S. 546
 had validly repealed the disclaimer language in its Constitution, the limited factual circumstances of Colorado River prevented its application to the Montana litigation.  In No. 81-2147, various water rights claimants in Arizona filed petitions in state court to adjudicate rights in a number of river systems, and the United States was joined in each case both in its independent capacity and as trustee for various Indian Tribes.  Thereafter, some of these Indian Tribes filed suits in Federal District Court, seeking, inter alia, federal determinations of their water rights.  The District Court, relying on Colorado River, dismissed most of the actions, while staying one of them pending completion of the state proceedings.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Enabling Act under which Arizona was admitted to statehood and a provision of the Arizona Constitution, both of which were similar to the Montana Enabling Act and Constitution, disabled Arizona from adjudicating Indian water claims.
Held:
1. The federal courts had jurisdiction to hear the suits brought both by the United States and the Indian Tribes, and a dismissal or stay would have been improper if there was no jurisdiction in the concurrent state actions.  Public Law 280 would nor have authorized the States to assume jurisdiction over adjudication of Indian water rights, since it specifically withheld such jurisdiction.  And to the extent that a claimed bar to state jurisdiction is premised on the respective State Constitutions, that is a question of state law over which state courts have binding authority.  Pp.  463 U. S. 559-561.
2. Whatever limitation the Enabling Acts or federal policy may have originally placed on state court jurisdiction over Indian water rights, those limitations were removed by the McCarran Amendment.  That Amendment was designed to deal with the general problem arising out of the limitations that federal sovereign immunity placed on the States' ability to adjudicate water rights, and nowhere in the Amendment's text or legislative history is there any indication that Congress intended the efficacy of the remedy to differ from one State to another.  To declare now that the holding in Colorado River applies only to the immunity of Indian water claims located in States without jurisdictional reservations would constitute a curious and unwarranted retreat from the rationale of Colorado River, and would work the very mischief that the decision in that case sought to avoid.  Pp.  463 U. S. 561-565.
3. Where state courts have jurisdiction to adjudicate Indian water rights, concurrent federal suits brought by Indian Tribes, rather than by the United States, and seeking adjudication only of Indian water rights are subject to dismissal under the Colorado River doctrine.  Pp.  463 U. S. 565-570. 
Page 463 U. S. 547

(a) If, as appears to be the case here, the state courts have jurisdiction over the Indian water rights at issue, then the concurrent federal proceedings are likely to be duplicative and wasteful.  Moreover, since a judgment by either court would ordinarily be res judicata in the other, the existence of the concurrent proceedings creates the potential for spawning an unseemly and destructive race to see which form can resolve the same issues first -- a race contrary to the spirit of the McCarran Amendment and prejudicial to the possibility of reasoned decisionmaking in either forum.  Pp.  463 U. S. 565-569.
(b) In these cases, assuming that the state adjudications are adequate to quantify the rights at issue in the federal suits, and taking into account the McCarran Amendment policies, the expertise and administrative machinery available to the state courts, the infancy of the federal suits, the general judicial bias against piecemeal litigation, and the convenience to the parties, the District Courts were correct in deferring to the state proceedings.

Moreover, since a judgment by either court would ordinarily be res judicata in the other, the existence of the concurrent proceedings creates the potential for spawning an unseemly and destructive race to see which form can resolve the same issues first -- a race contrary to the spirit of the McCarran Amendment and prejudicial to the possibility of reasoned decisionmaking in either forum.  Pp.  463 U. S. 565-569.
(b) In these cases, assuming that the state adjudications are adequate to quantify the rights at issue in the federal suits, and taking into account the McCarran Amendment policies, the expertise and administrative machinery available to the state courts, the infancy of the federal suits, the general judicial bias against piecemeal litigation, and the convenience to the parties, the District Courts were correct in deferring to the state proceedings.

Syllabus 
Petitioner black and Hispanic police officers were appointed to the New York City Police Department upon achieving passing scores on the examinations administered to make entry-level appointments.  Since appointments were made in order of test scores, however, the examinations caused blacks and Hispanics to be hired later than similarly situated whites, which lessened petitioner officers' seniority and related benefits.  Accordingly, when the Department subsequently laid off police officers on a ""last-hired, first-fired"" basis, those officers who had achieved the lowest scores were laid off first, and petitioner officers were disproportionately affected by the layoffs.  Petitioner officers and petitioner organizations then brought a class action in Federal District Court against respondents (the Department and other New York City officials and entities), alleging that the layoffs violated their rights under, inter alia, Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Citing administrative regulations promulgated under Title VI, the District Court ultimately held that an implied private right of action existed under Title VI, and that proof of discriminatory effect was enough to establish a violation of Title VI, thereby rejecting respondents' contention that only proof of discriminatory intent could suffice.  The District Court granted certain relief under Title VII, and also granted the following relief under Title VI:  (1) Each class member was awarded constructive seniority, including the right to backpay and back medical and insurance benefits which he would have received had he been appointed on his constructive seniority date; (2) respondents were directed to give a sergeant's examination to those class members whose constructive seniority would have entitled them to take the last such examination; and (3) respondents were ordered to consult with petitioners on the preparation and use of future examinations to insure that future hiring practices would be nondiscriminatory.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the relief under Title VII, but reversed as to Title VI, holding that the awards of Title VI relief could not be sustained because proof of discriminatory intent was required.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  633 F.2d 232, affirmed. 
Page 463 U. S. 583

JUSTICE WHITE concluded that discriminatory intent is not an essential element of a Title VI violation.  JUSTICE WHITE, joined by JUSTICE REHNQUIST, also concluded that a private plaintiff should recover only injunctive, noncompensatory relief for a defendant's unintentional violation of Title VI, that such relief should not include an award of constructive seniority, and that the Court of Appeals' judgment should be affirmed on this basis, since the relief denied petitioners under that judgment is unavailable to them under Title VI.  Pp.  463 U. S. 593-607.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, would affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment on the ground that private suits to enforce Title VI are not authorized or, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE REHNQUIST, would affirm the judgment on the alternative ground that the Court of Appeals correctly held that a showing of intentional discrimination is a prerequisite to a successful Title VI claim.  Pp.  463 U. S. 608-611.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR would affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment on the ground that proof of purposeful discrimination is a necessary element of a valid Title VI claim, and that hence implementing regulations incorporating an impact standard are not valid.  Pp.  463 U. S. 612-615.

Syllabus 
While serving as an officer of a broker-dealer, petitioner, who specialized in providing investment analysis of insurance company securities to institutional investors, received information from a former officer of an insurance company that its assets were vastly overstated as the result of fraudulent corporate practices, and that various regulatory agencies had failed to act on similar charges made by company employees.  Upon petitioner's investigation of the allegations, certain company employees corroborated the fraud charges, but senior management denied any wrongdoing.  Neither petitioner nor his firm owned or traded any of the company's stock, but, throughout his investigation, he openly discussed the information he had obtained with a number of clients and investors, some of whom sold their holdings in the company.  The Wall Street Journal declined to publish a story on the fraud allegations, as urged by petitioner.  After the price of the insurance company's stock fell during petitioner's investigation, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading in the stock.  State insurance authorities then impounded the company's records and uncovered evidence of fraud.  Only then did the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) file a complaint against the company, and only then did the Wall Street Journal publish a story based largely on information assembled by petitioner.  After a hearing concerning petitioner's role in the exposure of the fraud, the SEC found that he had aided and abetted violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5, by repeating the allegations of fraud to members of the investment community who later sold their stock in the insurance company.  Because of petitioner's role in bringing the fraud to light, however, the SEC only censured him.  On review, the Court of Appeals entered judgment against petitioner.
Held:
1. Two elements for establishing a violation of  10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by corporate insiders are the existence of a relationship affording access to inside information intended to be available only for a corporate purpose, and the unfairness of allowing a corporate insider to take advantage 
Page 463 U. S. 647
 of that information by trading without disclosure.  A duty to disclose or abstain does not arise from the mere possession of nonpublic market information.  Such a duty arises rather from the existence of a fiduciary relationship.  Chiarella v. United States, 445 U. S. 222.  There must also be ""manipulation or deception"" to bring a breach of fiduciary duty in connection with a securities transaction within the ambit of Rule 10b-5.  Thus, an insider is liable under the Rule for inside trading only where he fails to disclose material nonpublic information before trading on it, and thus makes secret profits.  Pp.  463 U. S. 653-654.
2. Unlike insiders who have independent fiduciary duties to both the corporation and its shareholders, the typical tippee has no such relationships.  There must be a breach of the insider's fiduciary duty before the tippee inherits the duty to disclose or abstain.  Pp.  463 U. S. 654-664.
(a) The SEC's position that a tippee who knowingly receives nonpublic material information from an insider invariably has a fiduciary duty to disclose before trading rests on the erroneous theory that the antifraud provisions require equal information among all traders.  A duty to disclose arises from the relationship between parties, and not merely from one's ability to acquire information because of his position in the market.  Pp.  463 U. S. 655-659.
(b) A tippee, however, is not always free to trade on inside information.  His duty to disclose or abstain is derivative from that of the insider's duty.  Tippees must assume an insider's duty to the shareholders not because they receive inside information, but rather because it has been made available to them improperly.  Thus, a tippee assumes a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of a corporation not to trade on material nonpublic information only when the insider has breached his fiduciary duty to the shareholders by disclosing the information to the tippee and the tippee knows or should know that there has been a breach.  Pp.  463 U. S. 659-661.
(c) In determining whether a tippee is under an obligation to disclose or abstain, it is necessary to determine whether the insider's ""tip"" constituted a breach of the insider's fiduciary duty.  Whether disclosure is a breach of duty depends in large part on the personal benefit the insider receives as a result of the disclosure.  Absent an improper purpose, there is no breach of duty to stockholders.  And absent a breach by the insider, there is no derivative breach.  Pp.  463 U. S. 661-664.
3. Under the inside-trading and tipping rules set forth above, petitioner had no duty to abstain from use of the inside information that he obtained, and thus there was no actionable violation by him.  He had no preexisting fiduciary duty to the insurance company's shareholders.  Moreover, the insurance company's employees, as insiders, did not violate 
Page 463 U. S. 648
 their duty to the company's shareholders by providing information to petitioner.  In the absence of a breach of duty to shareholders by the insiders, there was no derivative breach by petitioner.  Pp.  463 U. S. 665-667.

Section 307(f) of the Clean Air Act provides that in a proceeding for judicial review of an emission standard promulgated under the Act, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees ""whenever it determines that such award is appropriate.""  Respondents filed petitions in the Court of Appeals for review of the Environmental Protection Agency's standards limiting the emission of sulfur dioxide by coal-burning powerplants.  The Court of Appeals rejected respondents' claims challenging the validity of the standards.  Subsequently, the Court of Appeals granted respondents' request for attorney's fees incurred in the review proceedings, awarding a specified amount to each respondent.
Held:  Absent some degree of success on the merits by the claimant, it is not ""appropriate"" for a federal court to award attorney's fees under  307(f).  Pp.  463 U. S. 682-694.
(a) There is nothing in  307(f) to indicate that Congress meant to abandon historic fee-shifting principles and intuitive notions of fairness when it enacted that section.  Instead, it appears that the term ""appropriate"" modifies, but does not completely reject, the traditional rule that a fee claimant must ""prevail"" before it may recover attorney's fees.  This result is the most reasonable interpretation of congressional intent.  Pp.  463 U. S. 682-686.
(b) The legislative history of  307(f) does not support respondents' argument that the section was intended as a radical departure from the traditional rule.  Moreover, the relation between  307(f) and  304(d), which, like  307(f), provides for the award of attorney's fees when ""appropriate,"" refutes respondents' argument, since, if that argument were accepted, it would mean that in an unsuccessful suit brought under  304 by a private citizen against a private business for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act, the winning defendant could be required to pay the losing plaintiff's attorney's fees, a result which Congress certainly did not intend.

Syllabus 
Respondent is a federally licensed Indian trader who operates a general store on an Indian reservation in California.  When she was refused an exemption from California's law requiring a state license in order to sell liquor for off-premises consumption, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that she did not need a state license.  The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that respondent was required to have a state license under 18 U.S.C.  1161, which provides that liquor transactions in Indian country are not subject to prohibition under federal law if such transactions are
""in conformity both with the laws of the State in which [they] occu[r] and with an ordinance duly adopted by the tribe having jurisdiction over such area of Indian country.""
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  1161 preempts state licensing and distribution jurisdiction over tribal liquor sales in Indian country.
Held:  California may properly require respondent to obtain a state license in order to sell liquor for off-premises consumption.  Pp.  463 U. S. 718-735.
(a) There is no tradition of tribal sovereign immunity or inherent self-government in favor of liquor regulation by Indians.  Although, in Indian matters, Congress usually acts ""upon the assumption that the States have no power to regulate the affairs of Indians on a reservation,"" Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S. 217,  358 U. S. 220, that assumption is unwarranted in the narrow context of liquor regulation.  In addition to the congressional divestment of tribal self-government in this area, the States have also been permitted, and even required, to impose liquor regulations.  The tradition of concurrent state and federal jurisdiction over the use and distribution of alcoholic beverages in Indian country is justified by the relevant state interests.  Here, respondent's distribution of liquor has a significant impact beyond the limits of the reservation, and the State, independent of the Twenty-first Amendment, has an interest in the liquor traffic within its borders.  Pp.  463 U. S. 720-725.
(b) Title 18 U.S.C.  1161 authorized, rather than preempted, state regulation of Indian liquor transactions.  It is clear from the face of the statute and its legislative history both that Congress intended to remove federal prohibition on the sale and use of liquor imposed on Indians and 
Page 463 U. S. 714
 that Congress intended state laws would apply of their own force to govern tribal liquor transactions as long as the tribe itself approved these transactions by enacting an ordinance.  Congress contemplated that its absolute, but not exclusive, power to regulate Indian liquor transactions would be delegated to the tribes themselves, and to the States, which historically shared concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government.  Because of the lack of tradition of tribal self-government in the area of liquor regulation, it is not necessary that Congress indicate expressly that the State has jurisdiction to license and distribute liquor.  This Court will not apply the canon of construction that state laws generally are not applicable to Indians on a reservation except where Congress has expressly provided that state laws shall apply when application would be tantamount to a formalistic disregard of congressional intent.  Thus, application of the state licensing scheme here does not impair a right granted or reserved by federal law, but, on the contrary, is specifically authorized by Congress, and does not interfere with federal policies concerning the reservation.

			"|"Rice v. Rehner
No. 82-401
Argued March 21, 1983
Decided July 1, 1983
463 U.S. 713

Syllabus 
Respondent is a federally licensed Indian trader who operates a general store on an Indian reservation in California.  When she was refused an exemption from California's law requiring a state license in order to sell liquor for off-premises consumption, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that she did not need a state license.  The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that respondent was required to have a state license under 18 U.S.C.  1161, which provides that liquor transactions in Indian country are not subject to prohibition under federal law if such transactions are
""in conformity both with the laws of the State in which [they] occu[r] and with an ordinance duly adopted by the tribe having jurisdiction over such area of Indian country.""
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  1161 preempts state licensing and distribution jurisdiction over tribal liquor sales in Indian country.
Held:  California may properly require respondent to obtain a state license in order to sell liquor for off-premises consumption.  Pp.  463 U. S. 718-735.
(a) There is no tradition of tribal sovereign immunity or inherent self-government in favor of liquor regulation by Indians.  Although, in Indian matters, Congress usually acts ""upon the assumption that the States have no power to regulate the affairs of Indians on a reservation,"" Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S. 217,  358 U. S. 220, that assumption is unwarranted in the narrow context of liquor regulation.  In addition to the congressional divestment of tribal self-government in this area, the States have also been permitted, and even required, to impose liquor regulations.  The tradition of concurrent state and federal jurisdiction over the use and distribution of alcoholic beverages in Indian country is justified by the relevant state interests.  Here, respondent's distribution of liquor has a significant impact beyond the limits of the reservation, and the State, independent of the Twenty-first Amendment, has an interest in the liquor traffic within its borders.  Pp.  463 U. S. 720-725.
(b) Title 18 U.S.C.  1161 authorized, rather than preempted, state regulation of Indian liquor transactions.  It is clear from the face of the statute and its legislative history both that Congress intended to remove federal prohibition on the sale and use of liquor imposed on Indians and 
Page 463 U. S. 714
 that Congress intended state laws would apply of their own force to govern tribal liquor transactions as long as the tribe itself approved these transactions by enacting an ordinance.  Congress contemplated that its absolute, but not exclusive, power to regulate Indian liquor transactions would be delegated to the tribes themselves, and to the States, which historically shared concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Government.  Because of the lack of tradition of tribal self-government in the area of liquor regulation, it is not necessary that Congress indicate expressly that the State has jurisdiction to license and distribute liquor.  This Court will not apply the canon of construction that state laws generally are not applicable to Indians on a reservation except where Congress has expressly provided that state laws shall apply when application would be tantamount to a formalistic disregard of congressional intent.  Thus, application of the state licensing scheme here does not impair a right granted or reserved by federal law, but, on the contrary, is specifically authorized by Congress, and does not interfere with federal policies concerning the reservation.  Pp.  463 U. S. 725-735.

463 U.S. 418

Syllabus 
After respondents, a company having contracts with the Navy and company officials, were indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy to defraud the United States and tax fraud, the parties reached a plea bargain under which the individual respondents pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to defraud the Government by obstructing an Internal Revenue Service investigation, and other counts against respondents were dismissed.  Thereafter, the Government moved for disclosure of all grand jury materials to attorneys in the Justice Department's Civil Division, their paralegal and secretarial assistants, and certain Defense Department experts for use in preparing and conducting a possible civil suit against respondents under the False Claims Act.  The District Court granted disclosure, concluding that Civil Division attorneys are entitled to disclosure as a matter of right under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(3)(A)(i) (hereinafter (A)(i)), which authorizes disclosure of grand jury materials without a court order to ""an attorney for the government for use in the performance of such attorney's duty.""  The court also stated that disclosure was warranted because the Government had shown particularized need for disclosure.  The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded, holding (1) that Civil Division attorneys could obtain disclosure only by showing particularized need under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) (hereinafter (C)(i)), which authorizes disclosure ""when so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding,"" and (2) that the District Court had not applied a correct standard of particularized need.
Held:
1. Attorneys in the Civil Division of the Justice Department and their assistants and staff may not obtain automatic (A)(i) disclosure of grand jury materials for use in a civil suit, but must instead seek a (C)(i) court order for access to such materials.  Pp.  463 U. S. 427-442.
(a) The automatic disclosure authorized by (A)(i) is limited to those attorneys who conduct the criminal matters to which the grand jury materials pertain.  Rule 6(e) was not intended to grant free access to grand jury materials to Government attorneys other than prosecutors, who 
Page 463 U. S. 419
 perform a special role in assisting the grand jury in its functions and who must know what transpires before the grand jury in order to perform their own prosecutorial duties.  Allowing automatic disclosure to nonprosecutors for civil use would increase the risk of inadvertent or illegal release of grand jury materials to others, and render considerably more concrete the threat to the willingness of witnesses to come forward and testify fully and candidly before the grand jury; would pose a significant threat to the integrity of the grand jury itself by tempting prosecutors to manipulate the grand jury's powerful investigative tools to improperly elicit evidence for use in a civil case; and would threaten to subvert the limitations under federal laws applied outside the grand jury context on the Government's powers of discovery and investigation.  Pp.  463 U. S. 427-435.
(b) The fact that, when subparagraph 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) was added by Congress in 1977 to allow access to grand jury materials by nonattorneys assisting Government attorneys, (A)(ii) was limited to assisting the attorney in the ""performance of [his] duty to enforce federal criminal law"" does not establish that Congress intended to place the limitation to criminal matters on (A)(ii) disclosure but not on (A)(i) disclosure.  The legislative history shows instead that Congress merely made explicit what it believed to be already implicit in (A)(i)'s language (which has been in the Rule since its inception in 1946).  Congress' concerns that grand jury materials not be disclosed for civil use without a court order, and that statutory limits on civil discovery not be subverted, apply to disclosure for civil use by attorneys within the Justice Department as fully as to similar use by other Government agencies.  Pp.  463 U. S. 435-442.
2. A strong showing of particularized need for grand jury materials must be made before any (C)(i) disclosure will be permitted by court order.  The party seeking disclosure must show that the material sought is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding, that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy, and that the request is structured to cover only material so needed.  Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441 U. S. 211.  This standard governs disclosure to Government officials as well as to private parties, but is flexible and accommodates any relevant considerations, peculiar to Government movants, that weigh for or against disclosure in a given case.  Here, the District Court's explanation of its finding of particularized need amounted to little more than its statement that the grand jury materials were rationally related to the civil fraud suit to be brought by the Civil Division, and the Court of Appeals correctly held that this was insufficient, and remanded for reconsideration under the proper legal standard.

Syllabus 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(3)(C)(i) permits disclosure otherwise prohibited by Rule 6 of matters occurring before a grand jury ""when so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.""  Respondent was the target of a grand jury investigation of certain commodity futures transactions.  He was never indicted, but, after plea negotiations, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.  Thereafter, the Government filed a motion under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) for disclosure of grand jury transcripts and documents to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for use in an audit to determine respondent's civil income tax liability.  While holding that disclosure was not authorized by Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i), the District Court nevertheless allowed disclosure under its ""general supervisory powers over the grand jury.""  The Court of Appeals reversed, agreeing that no disclosure is available under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i), but holding that the District Court erred in granting disclosure under ""general supervisory powers.""
Held:  The IRS's civil tax audit is not ""preliminar[y] to or in connection with a judicial proceeding"" within the meaning of Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i), and hence no disclosure is available under that Rule.  The Rule contemplates only uses related fairly directly to some identifiable litigation, pending or anticipated.  It is not enough to show that some litigation may emerge from the matter in which the material is to be used.  The focus is on the actual use to be made of the material.  It follows that disclosure is not appropriate for use here in the IRS's audit, the purpose of which is not to prepare for or conduct litigation, but to assess the amount of tax liability through administrative channels.  The fact that, if the audit discloses a deficiency, respondent may seek judicial redress in a redetermination proceeding in the Tax Court or in a refund action in the Court of Claims or a district court, without more, does not mean that the Government's action is ""preliminar[y] to . . . a judicial proceeding.""

Syllabus 
When negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement between petitioner employer and the union representing certain of its employees reached an impasse, some of the employees went out on strike, and petitioner then unilaterally granted a wage increase for employees who stayed on the job.  Petitioner also advertised for and hired ""permanent"" replacements for striking employees.  Under federal labor law, where employees engage in an economic strike, the employer may hire permanent replacements whom he need not discharge even if the strikers offer to return to work unconditionally.  However, if the strike is an unfair labor practice strike, the employer must discharge replacements in order to accommodate returning strikers.  Based on the unilateral wage increase, the union filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board (Board) against petitioner, which countered with charges of its own, and complaints were issued against both parties.  In the meantime, petitioner assured its replacement employees that they would continue to be permanent replacements, but the unfair labor practice complaints were later dismissed by the Board pursuant to a settlement agreement between the parties under which petitioner agreed to reinstate the strikers.  Respondents, replacement employees who were laid off to make room for returning strikers, then sued petitioner in a Kentucky state court to recover damages for misrepresentation and breach of contract.  The trial court granted summary judgment for petitioner on the ground that respondents' causes of action were preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), but the Kentucky Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:   Respondents' causes of action for misrepresentation and breach of contract are not preempted.  Pp.  463 U. S. 498-512.
(a) The doctrine of Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427 U. S. 132, proscribing state regulation and state law causes of action concerning conduct that Congress intended to be unregulated, does not foreclose this suit.  There is no indication that Congress intended conduct of an employer and a union, such as that involved here, to be controlled solely by the free play of economic forces, so as to preclude state court damages actions by discharged replacement employees on the theory that such actions would upset the delicate balance of forces established by federal law.  Entertaining suits such as the instant suit 
Page 463 U. S. 492
 does not interfere with the asserted policy of federal law favoring settlement of labor disputes.  There is no substantial impact on the availability of settlement of economic or unfair labor practice strikes, because the employer may protect himself against suits like this by promising permanent employment to replacement employees, subject only to settlement with the union or to a Board unfair labor practice order directing reinstatement of strikers.  Such contracts are sufficiently ""permanent"" to permit the employer who prevails in a strike to keep replacements he has hired if he prefers to do so.  Pp.  463 U. S. 499-507.
(b) Nor are respondents' causes of action preempted under San Diego Building Trade Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, which held that state regulations and causes of action are presumptively preempted if they concern conduct that is actually or arguably either prohibited or protected by the NLRA.  While the questions whether the strike was an unfair labor practice strike -- requiring reinstatement of strikers -- because of petitioner's unilateral wage increase and whether its offering permanent employment to respondents was also an unfair labor practice, were matters for the Board, nevertheless, under Garmon, a State may regulate conduct arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA if the conduct is of only peripheral concern to the NLRA or if it is so deeply rooted in local law that it cannot be assumed that Congress intended to preempt the application of state law.  The critical inquiry is whether the controversy presented to the state court is identical to that which could be presented to the Board.  Here, the controversies cannot fairly be called identical, since the focus of the Board's determinations would be on the rights of strikers under federal law, whereas the state court claims would concern the rights of replacement employees under state law.  And at the same time the State has substantial interests in protecting its citizens from misrepresentations that have caused them grievous harm, and in providing a remedy to its citizens for breach of contract.

Syllabus 
Under the District of Columbia Code, a criminal defendant may be acquitted by reason of insanity if his insanity is affirmatively established by a preponderance of the evidence.  He is then committed to a mental hospital and within 50 days thereafter is entitled to a judicial hearing to determine his eligibility for release, at which he has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is no longer mentally ill or dangerous.  The Code also provides that the acquittee is entitled to a judicial hearing every six months at which he may establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to release.  Petitioner was charged in the District of Columbia Superior Court with attempted petit larceny, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum prison sentence of one year.  The Superior Court found petitioner not guilty by reason of insanity and committed him to a mental hospital.  At his subsequent 50-day hearing, the court found that he was mentally ill and constituted a danger to himself or others.  A second release hearing was held after petitioner had been hospitalized for more than one year, the maximum period he could have spent in prison if he had been convicted.  On that basis, he demanded that he be released unconditionally or recommitted pursuant to the civil commitment procedures under the District of Columbia Code, including a jury trial and clear and convincing proof by the Government of his mental illness and dangerousness.  The Superior Court denied his request for a civil commitment hearing, reaffirmed the findings made at the 50-day hearing, and continued his commitment. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed.
Held:  When a criminal defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that he is not guilty of a crime by reason of insanity, the Constitution permits the Government, on the basis of the insanity judgment, to confine him to a mental institution until such time as he has regained his sanity or is no longer a danger to himself or society.  Pp.  463 U. S. 361-370.
(a) A verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity is sufficiently probative of mental illness and dangerousness to justify commitment of the acquittee for the purposes of treatment and the protection of society.  Such a verdict establishes that the defendant committed an act constituting a criminal offense, and that he committed the act because of mental 
Page 463 U. S. 355
 illness.  It was not unreasonable for Congress to determine that these findings constitute an adequate basis for hospitalizing the acquittee as a dangerous and mentally ill person.  The fact that a person has been found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed a criminal act certainly indicates dangerousness.  Nor is it unreasonable to conclude that an insanity acquittal supports an inference of continuing mental illness.  The 50-day hearing assures that every acquittee has prompt opportunity to obtain release if he has recovered.  Pp.  463 U. S. 363-366.
(b) Indefinite commitment of an insanity acquittee, based on proof of insanity by only a preponderance of the evidence, comports with due process.  Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, held that the government, in a civil commitment proceeding, must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is mentally ill and dangerous.  However, the concerns critical to that decision -- based on the risk of error that a person might be committed for mere ""idiosyncratic behavior"" -- are diminished or absent in the case of insanity acquitees, and do not require the same standard of proof in both cases.  Proof that the acquittee committed a criminal act as a result of mental illness eliminates the risk that he is being committed for mere idiosyncratic behavior.  Pp.  463 U. S. 366-368.
(c) An insanity acquittee is not entitled to his release merely because he has been hospitalized for a period longer than he could have been incarcerated if convicted.  The length of a sentence for a particular criminal offense is based on a variety of considerations, including retribution, deterrence, and rehabilitation.  However, because an insanity acquittee was not convicted, he may not be punished.  The purpose of his commitment is to treat his mental illness and protect him and society from his potential dangerousness.  There simply is no necessary correlation between the length of the acquittee's hypothetical criminal sentence and the length of time necessary for his recovery.  Pp.  463 U. S. 368-369.

Syllabus 
Under the District of Columbia Code, a criminal defendant may be acquitted by reason of insanity if his insanity is affirmatively established by a preponderance of the evidence.  He is then committed to a mental hospital and within 50 days thereafter is entitled to a judicial hearing to determine his eligibility for release, at which he has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is no longer mentally ill or dangerous.  The Code also provides that the acquittee is entitled to a judicial hearing every six months at which he may establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to release.  Petitioner was charged in the District of Columbia Superior Court with attempted petit larceny, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum prison sentence of one year.  The Superior Court found petitioner not guilty by reason of insanity and committed him to a mental hospital.  At his subsequent 50-day hearing, the court found that he was mentally ill and constituted a danger to himself or others.  A second release hearing was held after petitioner had been hospitalized for more than one year, the maximum period he could have spent in prison if he had been convicted.  On that basis, he demanded that he be released unconditionally or recommitted pursuant to the civil commitment procedures under the District of Columbia Code, including a jury trial and clear and convincing proof by the Government of his mental illness and dangerousness.

A Minnesota statute ( 290.09, subd. 22) allows state taxpayers, in computing their state income tax, to deduct expenses incurred in providing ""tuition, textbooks and transportation"" for their children attending an elementary or secondary school.  Petitioner Minnesota taxpayers brought suit in Federal District Court against respondent Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue and respondent parents who had taken the tax deduction for expenses incurred in sending their children to parochial schools, claiming that  290.09, subd. 22, violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by providing financial assistance to sectarian institutions.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, holding that the statute is neutral on its face and in its application and does not have a primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 290.09, subd. 22, does not violate the Establishment Clause, but satisfies all elements of the ""three-part"" test laid down in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, that must be met for such a statute to be upheld under the Clause.  Pp.  463 U. S. 392-403.
(a) The tax deduction in question has the secular purpose of ensuring that the State's citizenry is well educated, as well as of assuring the continued financial health of private schools, both sectarian and nonsectarian.  Pp.  463 U. S. 394-395.
(b) The deduction does not have the primary effect of advancing the sectarian aims of nonpublic schools.  It is only one of many deductions -- such as those for medical expenses and charitable contributions -- available under the Minnesota tax laws; is available for educational expenses incurred by all parents, whether their children attend public schools or private sectarian or nonsectarian private schools, Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, distinguished; and provides aid to parochial schools only as a result of decisions of individual parents, rather than directly from the State to the schools themselves.  The Establishment Clause's historic purposes do not encompass the sort of attenuated financial benefit that eventually flows to parochial schools from the neutrally available tax benefit at issue.  The fact that, notwithstanding  290.09, subd. 22's facial neutrality, a particular annual statistical analysis shows that the statute's application primarily benefits religious institutions

(c) Section 290.09, subd. 22, does not ""excessively entangle"" the State in religion.  The fact that state officials must determine whether particular textbooks qualify for the tax deduction and must disallow deductions for textbooks used in teaching religious doctrines is an insufficient basis for finding such entanglement.

Decided June 28, 1983
463 U.S. 277

Syllabus 
In 1979, respondent was convicted in a South Dakota state court of uttering a ""no account"" check for $100.  Ordinarily the maximum punishment for that crime would have been five years' imprisonment and a $5,000 fine.  Respondent, however, was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole under South Dakota's recidivist statute because of his six prior felony convictions -- three convictions for third-degree burglary and convictions for obtaining money under false pretenses, grand larceny, and third-offense driving while intoxicated.  The South Dakota Supreme Court affirmed the sentence.  After respondent's request for commutation was denied, he sought habeas relief in Federal District Court, contending that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. The Eighth Amendment's proscription of cruel and unusual punishments prohibits not only barbaric punishments, but also sentences that are disproportionate to the crime committed.  Pp.  463 U. S. 284-290.
(a) The principle of proportionality is deeply rooted in common law jurisprudence.  It was expressed in Magna Carta, applied by the English courts for centuries, and repeated in the English Bill of Rights in language that was adopted in the Eighth Amendment.  When the Framers of the Eighth Amendment adopted this language, they adopted the principle of proportionality that was implicit in it.  Pp.  463 U. S. 284-286.
(b) The constitutional principle of proportionality has been recognized explicitly in this Court for almost a century.  In several cases, the Court has applied the principle to invalidate criminal sentences.  E.g., Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349.  And the Court often has recognized that the Eighth Amendment proscribes grossly disproportionate punishments, even when it has not been necessary to rely on the proscription.  Pp.  463 U. S. 286-288.
(c) There is no basis for the State's assertion that the principle of proportionality does not apply to felony prison sentences.  Neither the text of the Eighth Amendment nor the history behind it supports such an exception.  Moreover, this Court's cases have recognized explicitly that 
Page 463 U. S. 278
 prison sentences are subject to proportionality analysis.  No penalty is per se constitutional.  Pp.  463 U. S. 288-290.
2. A court's proportionality analysis under the Eighth Amendment should be guided by objective criteria.  Pp.  463 U. S. 290-295.
(a) Criteria that have been recognized in this Court's prior cases include (i) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty; (ii) the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction, that is, whether more serious crimes are subject to the same penalty or to less serious penalties; and (iii) the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.  Pp.  463 U. S. 290-292.
(b) Courts are competent to judge the gravity of an offense, at least on a relative scale.  Comparisons can be made in light of the harm caused or threatened to the victim or to society, and the culpability of the offender.  There are generally accepted criteria for comparing the severity of different crimes, despite the difficulties courts face in attempting to draw distinctions between similar crimes.  Pp.  463 U. S. 292-294.
(c) Courts are also able to compare different sentences.  For sentences of imprisonment, the problem is one of line-drawing.  Decisions of this kind, although troubling, are not unique to this area.  The courts are constantly called upon to draw similar lines in a variety of contexts.  Cf. Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514; Baldwin v. New York, 399 U. S. 66.  Pp.  463 U. S. 294-295.
3. In light of the relevant objective criteria, respondent's sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole is significantly disproportionate to his crime, and is therefore prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.  Pp.  463 U. S. 295-303.
(a) Respondent's crime of uttering a ""no account"" check for $100 is viewed by society as among the less serious offenses.  It involved neither violence nor threat of violence, and the face value of the check was not a large amount.  Respondent's prior felonies were also relatively minor.  All were nonviolent, and none was a crime against a person.  Respondent's sentence was the most severe that the State could have imposed on any criminal for any crime.  He has been treated in the same manner as, or more severely than, other criminals in South Dakota who have committed far more serious crimes.  Nevada is the only other State that authorizes a life sentence without possibility of parole in the circumstances of this case, and there is no indication that any defendant such as respondent, whose prior offenses were so minor, has received the maximum penalty in Nevada.  Pp.  463 U. S. 296-300.
(b) The possibility of commutation of a life sentence under South Dakota law is not sufficient to save respondent's otherwise unconstitutional sentence on the asserted theory that this possibility matches the possibility of parole.  Assuming good behavior, parole is the normal 
Page 463 U. S. 279
 expectation in the vast majority of cases, and is governed by specified legal standards.  Commutation is an ad hoc exercise of executive clemency that may occur at any time for any reason without reference to any standards.  In South Dakota, no life sentence has been commuted in over eight years, while parole -- where authorized -- has been granted regularly during that period.  Moreover, even if respondent's sentence were commuted, he merely would be eligible to be considered for parole.  Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, distinguished.  Pp.  463 U. S. 300-303.
684 F.2d 582, affirmed.

Syllabus 
Title I of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) defines eight categories of natural gas production, specifies the maximum lawful price that may be charged for ""first sales"" in each category, and prescribes rules for increasing ""first sale"" prices each month and passing them on to downstream purchasers.  Section 2(21) of the Act defines ""first sale"" as including, as a general rule, ""any sale"" of natural gas to any interstate or intrastate pipeline or to any local distribution company, but as not including such sales by the enumerated sellers or any affiliate thereof, unless the sale ""is attributable to"" volumes of natural gas produced by such sellers or any affiliate thereof.  In 1979, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order No. 58, promulgating regulations implementing the statutory definition of ""first sale.""  Independent producers and pipeline affiliates were assigned a ""first sale"" for all natural gas transferred to interstate pipelines.  But pipelines themselves were not automatically assigned a ""first sale"" for their production.  A pipeline enjoys a ""first sale"" for gas sold at a wellhead; for gas sold downstream that consists solely of its own production; for downstream sales of commingled independent-producer and pipeline-producer gas, as long as it dedicated an equivalent volume of its production to that purchaser by contract; and for downstream sales of commingled gas in an otherwise unregulated intrastate market.  But if a pipeline sells commingled gas in an interstate market without dedicating a particular volume of its production to that particular sale, it does not enjoy ""first sale"" treatment.  In 1980, the FERC issued Order No. 98, promulgating regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) providing that the NGPA's ""first sale"" pricing should apply to all pipeline production on leases acquired after October 8, 1969, and from wells drilled after January 1, 1973, regardless of when the underlying lease had been acquired.  All other pipeline production would be priced for ratemaking purposes just as it had before the 
Page 463 U. S. 320
 NGPA was enacted.  Respondents (interstate pipeline companies that transport natural gas from the wellhead to their customers) petitioned the Court of Appeals for review of both FERC orders, contending that Order No. 58 was based on a misreading of the NGPA and that, in Order No. 98, the FERC had acted arbitrarily in refusing to authorize NGPA pricing for all pipeline production.  The Court of Appeals held that the NGPA was intended to provide the same incentives to pipeline production as to independent production, that there were no practical obstacles to treating the transfer of gas from a pipeline's production division to its transportation division as a first sale, and that the FERC's reading of the NGPA was inconsistent with Congress' goal.  The Court held Order No. 58 invalid, and therefore did not review Order No. 98 separately.
Held:  The FERC's exclusion of pipeline production from the NGPA's pricing scheme is inconsistent with the statutory mandate, and would frustrate the regulatory policy that Congress sought to implement; the FERC, however, has discretion in deciding which transfer -- intracorporate or downstream -- should receive the ""first sale"" treatment.  Pp.  463 U. S. 325-343.
(a) As respondents contend, the FERC has the authority to treat as a first sale either the intracorporate transfer of natural gas from a pipeline-owned production system to the pipeline or the downstream transfer of commingled gas from the pipeline to a customer, in which case respondents would be able to include an NGPA rate for production among their costs of service, just as they do when they acquire natural gas from independent producers.  The downstream transfer plainly satisfies  2(21)'s ""general rule"" definition, and the legislative history clearly demonstrates that this statute was not intended to prohibit the FERC from deeming the intracorporate transfer a ""sale.""  The statutory exception to the ""general rule"" definition does not diminish the FERC's authority to treat an intracorporate or downstream transfer as a first sale.  Pp.  463 U. S. 325-327.
(b) The purposes of the NGPA to preserve the FERC's authority under the NGA to regulate natural gas sales from pipelines to their customers and to supplant the FERC's authority to establish rates for the wholesale market, the market consisting of so-called ""first sales"" of natural gas, the legislative history, and the overall structure of the NGPA, all show that Congress intended pipeline production to receive ""first sale"" pricing, and did not intend the FERC to be able to exclude pipeline production from the NGPA's coverage completely.  Pp.  463 U. S. 327-338.
(c) The FERC's argument that it would be wrong to assign intracorporate transfers a ""first sale"" price ""automatically,"" because not even independent producers receive such treatment, refutes a position that no one advocates, since it is agreed that such a transfer should not ""automatically"" receive the NGPA ceiling price.  There is no merit to the 
Page 463 U. S. 321
 FERC's argument that giving ""first sale"" treatment to downstream sales would result in the application of ""first sale"" maximum lawful prices to all mixed volume retail sales by interstate and intrastate pipelines and local distributors, thereby supplanting traditional state regulatory authority over the costs of intrastate pipeline transportation service.  Nor is there any merit to the FERC's argument that pipeline producers would enjoy an unintended windfall if they receive ""first sale"" pricing.  Pp.  463 U. S. 339-342.

Mid-Louisiana Gas Co.
No. 81-1889.
Argued March 22, 1983
Decided June 28, 1983*
463 U.S. 319

Syllabus 
Title I of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) defines eight categories of natural gas production, specifies the maximum lawful price that may be charged for ""first sales"" in each category, and prescribes rules for increasing ""first sale"" prices each month and passing them on to downstream purchasers.  Section 2(21) of the Act defines ""first sale"" as including, as a general rule, ""any sale"" of natural gas to any interstate or intrastate pipeline or to any local distribution company, but as not including such sales by the enumerated sellers or any affiliate thereof, unless the sale ""is attributable to"" volumes of natural gas produced by such sellers or any affiliate thereof.  In 1979, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order No. 58, promulgating regulations implementing the statutory definition of ""first sale.""  Independent producers and pipeline affiliates were assigned a ""first sale"" for all natural gas transferred to interstate pipelines.  But pipelines themselves were not automatically assigned a ""first sale"" for their production.  A pipeline enjoys a ""first sale"" for gas sold at a wellhead; for gas sold downstream that consists solely of its own production; for downstream sales of commingled independent-producer and pipeline-producer gas, as long as it dedicated an equivalent volume of its production to that purchaser by contract; and for downstream sales of commingled gas in an otherwise unregulated intrastate market.  But if a pipeline sells commingled gas in an interstate market without dedicating a particular volume of its production to that particular sale, it does not enjoy ""first sale"" treatment.  In 1980, the FERC issued Order No. 98, promulgating regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) providing that the NGPA's ""first sale"" pricing should apply to all pipeline production on leases acquired after October 8, 1969, and from wells drilled after January 1, 1973, regardless of when the underlying lease had been acquired.  All other pipeline production would be priced for ratemaking purposes just as it had before the

 NGPA was enacted.  Respondents (interstate pipeline companies that transport natural gas from the wellhead to their customers) petitioned the Court of Appeals for review of both FERC orders, contending that Order No. 58 was based on a misreading of the NGPA and that, in Order No. 98, the FERC had acted arbitrarily in refusing to authorize NGPA pricing for all pipeline production.  The Court of Appeals held that the NGPA was intended to provide the same incentives to pipeline production as to independent production, that there were no practical obstacles to treating the transfer of gas from a pipeline's production division to its transportation division as a first sale, and that the FERC's reading of the NGPA was inconsistent with Congress' goal.

No. 81-523
Argued January 10, 1983
Decided June 27, 1983
463 U.S. 159

Syllabus 
California imposes a corporate franchise tax geared to income.  It employs the ""unitary business"" principle and formula apportionment in applying that tax to corporations doing business both inside and outside the State.  The formula used -- commonly called the ""three-factor"" formula -- is based, in equal parts, on the proportion of a unitary business' total payroll, property, and sales that are located in the State.  Appellant paperboard packaging manufacturer is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Illinois and doing business in California and elsewhere.  It also has a number of overseas subsidiaries incorporated in the countries in which they operate.  In calculating for the tax years in question in this case the share of its net income that was apportionable to California under the three-factor formula, appellant omitted all of its subsidiaries' payroll, property, and sales.  Appellee Franchise Tax Board issued notices of additional assessments, the gravamen of which was that appellant should have treated its overseas subsidiaries as part of its unitary business, rather than as a passive investment.  After paying the additional assessments under protest, appellant brought an action for a refund in California Superior Court, which upheld the additional assessments.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed.
Held:
1. California's application of the unitary business principle to appellant and its foreign subsidiaries was proper.  Pp.  463 U. S. 175-180.
(a) The taxpayer has the burden of showing by ""clear and convincing evidence"" that the state tax results in extraterritorial values being taxed.  This Court will, if reasonably possible, defer to the judgment of state courts in deciding whether a particular set of activities constitutes a ""unitary business.""  The Court's task is to determine whether the state court applied the correct standards to the case, and, if it did, whether its judgment was within the realm of a permissible judgment.  Pp.  463 U. S. 175-176.
(b) Here, there is no merit to appellant's argument that the Court of Appeal, in important part, analyzed the case under the incorrect legal standard.  Rather, the factors relied upon by the court in holding that appellant and its foreign subsidiaries constituted a unitary business -- 
Page 463 U. S. 160
 which factors included appellant's assistance to its subsidiaries in obtaining equipment and in filling personnel needs that could not be met locally, the substantial role played by appellant in loaning funds to the subsidiaries and guaranteeing loans provided by others, the considerable interplay between appellant and its subsidiaries in the area of corporate expansion, the substantial technical assistance provided by appellant to the subsidiaries, and the supervisory role played by appellant's officers in providing general guidance to the subsidiaries -- taken in combination, clearly demonstrate that the court reached a conclusion ""within the realm of permissible judgment.""  Pp.  463 U. S. 177-180.
2. California's use of the three-factor formula to apportion the income of the unitary business consisting of appellant and its foreign subsidiaries was fair.  Appellant had the burden of proving that the income apportioned to California was out of all appropriate proportions to the business transacted in the State.  This burden was not met by offering various statistics that appeared to demonstrate not only that wage rates are generally lower in the foreign countries in which appellant's subsidiaries operate, but also that those lower wage rates are not offset by lower levels of productivity.  It may well be that, in addition to the foreign payroll going into the production of any given corrugated container by a foreign subsidiary, there is a California payroll, as well as other California factors, contributing to the same production.  The mere fact that this possibility is not reflected in appellant's accounting does not disturb the underlying premises of the formula apportionment method.  Pp.  463 U. S. 180-184.
3. California had no obligation under the Foreign Commerce Clause to employ the ""arm's length"" analysis used by the Federal Government and most foreign nations in evaluating the tax consequences of intercorporate relationships.  Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, distinguished.  Pp.  463 U. S. 184-197.
(a) The double taxation occasioned by the California scheme is not impermissible.  Due in part to the difference between a tax on income and a tax on tangible property, California would have trouble avoiding double taxation of corporations subject to its franchise tax even if it adopted the ""arm's length"" approach.  Moreover, the California tax does not result in ""inevitable"" double taxation.  It would be perverse, simply for the sake of avoiding double taxation, to require California to give up one allocation method that sometimes results in double taxation in favor of another allocation method that sometimes has the same result.  Pp.  463 U. S. 189-193.
(b) The California tax does not violate the ""one voice"" standard established in Japan Line, supra, under which a state tax at variance with federal policy will be struck down if it either implicates foreign policy issues which must be left to the Federal Government or violates a clear 
Page 463 U. S. 161
 federal directive.  Three factors weigh strongly against the conclusion that the tax might lead to significant foreign retaliation.  The tax does not create an automatic ""asymmetry"" in international taxation, it is imposed on a domestic corporation and not on a foreign entity, and even if foreign nations had a legitimate interest in reducing the tax burden of domestic corporations, appellant is amenable to be taxed in California one way or another, and the tax it pays is more the function of California's tax rate than of its allocation method.  Moreover, the California tax is not preempted by federal law or fatally inconsistent with federal policy.  There is no claim that the federal tax statutes themselves provide the necessary preemptive force.  The requirement of some tax treaties that the Federal Government adopt some form of arm's length analysis in taxing the domestic income of multinational enterprises is generally waived as to taxes imposed by each of the contracting nations on its own domestic corporations.  Tax treaties do not cover the taxing activities of States.  And Congress has never enacted legislation designed to regulate state taxation of income.  Pp. 463 U. S. 193-197.

463 U.S. 206

Syllabus 
Respondents -- individuals owning interests in allotted lands on the Quinault Indian Reservation, an unincorporated association of such allottees, and the Quinault Tribe -- filed actions in the Court of Claims seeking to recover damages from the United States for alleged mismanagement of timberlands in the reservation, and asserting that such mismanagement constituted a breach of the fiduciary duty owed respondents by the United States as trustee under various federal statutes and regulations.  The court ultimately held the United States subject to suit for money damages on most of respondents' claims, ruling that the federal timber management statutes, various other federal statutes governing roadbuilding, rights-of-way, Indian funds, and Government fees, and the regulations promulgated under these statutes imposed fiduciary duties upon the United States in its management of forested allotted lands.
Held:  The United States is accountable in money damages for alleged breaches of trust in connection with its management of forest resources on allotted lands of the Quinault Reservation.  Pp.  463 U. S. 211-228.
(a) The Tucker Act provides the United States' consent to suit for claims founded upon statutes or regulations that expressly or implicitly create substantive rights to money damages.  Pp.  463 U. S. 211-219.
(b) In contrast to the bare trust created by the General Allotment Act, United States v. Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535, the statutes and regulations upon which respondents have based their money claims clearly give the Federal Government full responsibility to manage Indian resources and land for the Indians' benefit.  They thereby establish a fiduciary relationship and define the contours of the United States' fiduciary responsibilities.  Moreover, a fiduciary relationship necessarily arises when the Government assumes such elaborate control over forests and property belonging to Indians.  All of the necessary elements of a common law trust are present. a trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the Indian allottees), and a trust corpus (Indian timber, lands, and funds).  Because the statutes and regulations at issue clearly establish a fiduciary obligation of the Government in the management and operation of Indian lands and resources, they can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Government for damages sustained.  Given the existence of a trust relationship, it follows that the Government should be liable in damages for the breach of its fiduciary duties.  A damages

 remedy also furthers the purposes of the statutes and regulations, which clearly require the Secretary of the Interior to manage Indian resources so as to generate proceeds for the Indians.

No. 82-63
Argued February 28, 1983
Decided June 27, 1983
463 U.S. 239

Syllabus 
A police officer of petitioner city wounded a suspect who was attempting to flee from the scene of a breaking and entering.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that petitioner is liable for the medical services rendered by respondent hospital to the wounded person.
Held:
1. This Court does not lack jurisdiction to review the Massachusetts court's opinion on the asserted ground that the decision rested on an adequate and independent state ground.  The Massachusetts court's opinion premised petitioner's liability squarely on the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments.  P.  463 U. S. 242.
2. Respondent has standing in the Art. III sense to raise its constitutional claim in this Court.  Moreover, invoking prudential limitations on respondent's assertion of the rights of a third party (the wounded person) would serve no functional purpose.  Cf. Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190.  Pp.  463 U. S. 242-243.
3. The relevant constitutional provision is not the Eighth Amendment but is, instead, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Although the Eighth Amendment's proscription of cruel and unusual punishments is violated by deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners, Eighth Amendment scrutiny is appropriate only after the State has secured a formal adjudication of guilt.  Ingrahm v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651.  Here, there had been no formal adjudication of guilt against the wounded person at the time he required medical care.  Pp.  463 U. S. 243-244.
4. The Due Process Clause requires the responsible governmental entity to provide medical care to persons who have been injured while being apprehended by the police.  However, as long as the governmental entity ensures that the medical care needed is in fact provided, the Constitution does not dictate how the cost of that care should be allocated as between the entity and the provider of the care.

			"|"City of Revere v. Massachusetts General Hospital
No. 82-63
Argued February 28, 1983
Decided June 27, 1983
463 U.S. 239

Syllabus 
A police officer of petitioner city wounded a suspect who was attempting to flee from the scene of a breaking and entering.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that petitioner is liable for the medical services rendered by respondent hospital to the wounded person.
Held:
1. This Court does not lack jurisdiction to review the Massachusetts court's opinion on the asserted ground that the decision rested on an adequate and independent state ground.  The Massachusetts court's opinion premised petitioner's liability squarely on the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments.  P.  463 U. S. 242.
2. Respondent has standing in the Art. III sense to raise its constitutional claim in this Court.  Moreover, invoking prudential limitations on respondent's assertion of the rights of a third party (the wounded person) would serve no functional purpose.  Cf. Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190.  Pp.  463 U. S. 242-243.
3. The relevant constitutional provision is not the Eighth Amendment but is, instead, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Although the Eighth Amendment's proscription of cruel and unusual punishments is violated by deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners, Eighth Amendment scrutiny is appropriate only after the State has secured a formal adjudication of guilt.  Ingrahm v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651.  Here, there had been no formal adjudication of guilt against the wounded person at the time he required medical care.  Pp.  463 U. S. 243-244.
4. The Due Process Clause requires the responsible governmental entity to provide medical care to persons who have been injured while being apprehended by the police.  However, as long as the governmental entity ensures that the medical care needed is in fact provided, the Constitution does not dictate how the cost of that care should be allocated as between the entity and the provider of the care.  That is a matter of state law.  Here, petitioner fulfilled its constitutional obligation by seeing that the wounded person received the needed medical treatment; how petitioner obtained such treatment is not a federal constitutional question.  Pp.  463 U. S. 244-246.

Syllabus 
Appellant is the putative father of a child born out of wedlock.  Appellee mother of the child married another man (also an appellee) after the child was born.  Subsequently, when the child was over two years old, appellees filed an adoption petition in the Ulster County, N.Y. Family Court, which entered an order of adoption.  Appellant never supported the child or offered to marry appellee mother, did not enter his name in New York's ""putative father registry,"" which would have entitled him to notice of the adoption proceeding, and was not in any of the classes of putative fathers who are entitled under New York law to receive notice of adoption proceedings.  After the adoption proceeding was commenced, appellant filed a paternity petition in the Westchester County, N.Y. Family Court.  Appellant learned of the pending adoption proceeding several months later.  Shortly thereafter, his attorney sought a stay of the adoption proceeding pending the determination of the paternity action, but by that time the Ulster County Family Court had entered the adoption order.  Appellant filed a petition to vacate the adoption order on the ground that it was obtained in violation of his rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Ulster County Family Court denied the petition, and both the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Appellant's rights under the Due Process Clause were not violated.  Pp.  463 U. S. 256-265.
(a) Where an unwed father demonstrates a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by ""com[ing] forward to participate in the rearing of his child,"" Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U. S. 380,  441 U. S. 392, his interest in personal contact with his child acquires substantial protection under the Due Process Clause.  But the mere existence of a biological link does not merit equivalent protection.  If the natural father fails to grasp the opportunity to develop a relationship with his child, the Constitution will not automatically compel a State to listen to his opinion of where the child's best interests lie.  Pp.  463 U. S. 256-263.
(b) Here, New York has adequately protected appellant's inchoate interest in assuming a responsible role in the future of his child.  Under New York's special statutory scheme, the right to receive notice was completely within appellant's control.  By mailing a postcard to the putative 
Page 463 U. S. 249
 father registry, he could have guaranteed that he would receive notice of any adoption proceedings.  The State's conclusion that a more open-ended notice requirement would merely complicate the adoption process, threaten the privacy interests of unwed mothers, create the risk of unnecessary controversy, and impair the desired finality of adoption decrees cannot be characterized as arbitrary.  The Constitution does not require either the trial judge or a litigant to give special notice to nonparties who are presumptively capable of asserting and protecting their own rights.  Pp.  463 U. S. 263-265.
2. Nor were appellant's rights under the Equal Protection Clause violated.  Because he has never established a substantial relationship with his child, the New York statutes at issue did not operate to deny him equal protection.  Cf. Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246.  Appellee mother had a continuous custodial responsibility for the child, whereas appellant never established any custodial, personal, or financial relationship with the child.  In such circumstances, the Equal Protection Clause does not prevent a State from according the two parents different legal rights.  Caban v. Mohammed, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  463 U. S. 265-268.

463 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Appellee Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern California (CLVT) was established by an agreement between construction industry employer associations and a labor union to provide a mechanism for administering the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement granting construction workers a yearly paid vacation.  The trust qualifies as a ""welfare benefit plan"" within the meaning of  3 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and hence is subject to regulation under ERISA.  Appellant California Franchise Tax Board filed a complaint in California state court against CLVT and its trustees, alleging two causes of action:  (1) that CLVT had failed to comply with certain tax levies issued under a California statute, thereby becoming liable for damages for such failure, and (2) that, in view of the defendants' contention that ERISA preempted state law and that the trustees lacked power to honor the levies, a judgment be issued declaring the parties' respective rights.  CLVT removed the case to Federal District Court, which, after denying appellant's motion for remand to the state court, held that ERISA did not preempt the State's power to levy on the funds held in trust by CLVT.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The case is not within the removal jurisdiction conferred by 28 U.S.C. 1441.  Pp. 465 U. S. 7-28. 
Page 463 U. S. 2

(a) Where there is no diversity of citizenship between the parties, as in this case, the propriety of removal turns on whether the case falls within the original ""federal question"" jurisdiction of United States district courts under 28 U.S.C.  1331 (1976 ed., Supp. V).  Under the ""well-pleaded complaint"" rule, a defendant may not remove such a case to federal court unless the plaintiff's complaint establishes that the case ""arises under"" federal law within the meaning of  1331, and it may not be removed on the basis of a federal defense, including the defense of preemption, even if the defense is anticipated in the complaint and both parties admit that the defense is the only question truly at issue.  Pp.  463 U. S. 7-12.
(b) For appellant's first cause of action, a straightforward application of the well-pleaded complaint rule precludes original federal court jurisdiction, and thus the cause of action was not removable.  California law establishes a set of conditions, without reference to federal law, under which a tax levy may be enforced; federal law becomes relevant only by way of a defense to an obligation created entirely by state law, and then only if appellant has made out a valid claim for relief under state law.  Pp.  463 U. S. 13-14.
(c) Nor is appellant's second cause of action removable to federal court.  Under the federal jurisdictional statutes, federal courts do not have original jurisdiction, nor do they acquire jurisdiction on removal, when a federal question is presented by a complaint for a state declaratory judgment, and where, if the plaintiff had sought a federal declaratory judgment, federal jurisdiction would be barred by Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S. 667, under which federal jurisdiction is lacking if, but for the availability of the federal declaratory judgment procedure, a federal claim would arise only as a defense to a state-created action.  The situation presented by a State's suit for a declaration of the validity of state law is sufficiently removed from the spirit of necessity and careful limitation of federal district court jurisdiction that informed this Court's statutory interpretation in Skelly Oil and Gully v. First National Bank in Meridian, 299 U. S. 109, to convince the Court that, until Congress informs it otherwise, such a suit is not within the district courts' original jurisdiction.  Accordingly, the same suit brought originally in state court is not removable.  Pp.  463 U. S. 14-22.
(d) A suit by state tax authorities under a statute like the California tax levy statute involved here does not ""arise"" under ERISA.  The State's right to enforce its tax levies is not of central concern to the federal statute.  Avco Corp. v. Machinists, 390 U. S. 557, distinguished.  Even though ERISA may preclude enforcement of the State's levy in the circumstances of this case, an action to enforce the levy is not itself preempted by ERISA.  On the face of a well-pleaded complaint there are 
Page 463 U. S. 3
 many reasons completely unrelated to ERISA's provisions and purposes why the State may or may not be entitled to the relief it seeks.  Moreover, ERISA does not provide an alternative cause of action in the State's favor to enforce its rights.  Nor does appellant's second cause of action arise under ERISA.  ERISA enumerates the parties entitled to seek a declaratory judgment under  502 of that Act; it does not provide anyone other than participants, beneficiaries, or fiduciaries of an ERISA-covered plan with an express cause of action for a declaratory judgment on the issues of this case.  A suit for similar relief by some other party does not ""arise under"" that provision.  Pp.  463 U. S. 22-27.

Syllabus 
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Act) directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue motor vehicle safety standards that ""shall be practicable, shall meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and shall be stated in objective terms.""  In issuing these standards, the Secretary is directed to consider ""relevant available motor vehicle safety data,"" whether the proposed standard is ""reasonable, practicable and appropriate"" for the particular type of motor vehicle for which it is prescribed, and ""the extent to which such standards will contribute to carrying out the purposes"" of the Act.  The Act authorizes judicial review, under the Administrative Procedure Act, of ""all orders establishing, amending, or revoking"" a motor vehicle safety standard.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), to which the Secretary has delegated his authority to promulgate safety standards, rescinded the requirement of Modified Standard 208 that new motor vehicles produced after September 1982 be equipped with passive restraints (automatic seatbelts or airbags) to protect the safety of the occupants of the vehicle in the event of a collision.  In explaining the rescission, NHTSA maintained that it was no longer able to find, as it had in 1977 when Modified Standard 208 was issued, that the automatic restraint requirement would produce significant safety benefits.  In 1987, NHTSA had assumed that airbags would be installed in 60% of all new cars and automatic seatbelts in 40%.  But by 1981 it became apparent that automobile manufacturers planned to install automatic seatbelts in approximately 99% of the new cars, and that the overwhelming majority of such seatbelts could be easily detached and left that way permanently, thus precluding the realization of the lifesaving potential of airbags and requiring the same type of affirmative action that was the stumbling block 
Page 463 U. S. 30
 to achieving high usage of manual belts.  For this reason, NHTSA concluded that there was no longer a basis for reliably predicting that Modified Standard 208 would lead to any significant increased usage of restraints.  Hence, in NHTSA's view, the automatic restraint requirement was no longer reasonable or practicable.  Moreover, given the high expense of implementing such a requirement and the limited benefits arising therefrom, NHTSA feared that many consumers would regard Modified Standard 208 as an instance of ineffective regulation.  On petitions for review of NHTSA's rescission of the passive restraint requirement, the Court of Appeals held that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious on the grounds that NHTSA's conclusion that it could not reliably predict an increase in belt usage under the Standard was an insufficient basis for the rescission, that NHTSA inadequately considered the possibility of requiring manufacturers to install nondetachable, rather than detachable, passive belts, and that the agency failed to give any consideration to requiring compliance with the Standard by the installation of airbags.  The court found that congressional reaction to various versions of the Standard ""raised doubts"" that NHTSA's rescission ""necessarily demonstrates an effort to fulfill its statutory mandate,"" and that therefore the agency was obligated to provide ""increasingly clear and convincing reasons"" for its action.
Held:  NHTSA's rescission of the passive restraint requirement in Modified Standard 208 was arbitrary and capricious; the agency failed to present an adequate basis and explanation for rescinding the requirement, and must either consider the matter further or adhere to or amend the Standard along lines which its analysis supports.  Pp.  463 U. S. 40-57.
(a) The rescission of an occupant crash protection standard is subject to the same standard of judicial review -- the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard -- as is the promulgation of such a standard, and should not be judged by, as petitioner Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association contends, the standard used to judge an agency's refusal to promulgate a rule in the first place.  The Act expressly equates orders ""revoking"" and ""establishing"" safety standards.  The Association's view would render meaningless Congress' authorization for judicial review of orders revoking safety standards.  An agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required when an agency does not act in the first instance.  While the scope of review under the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard is narrow, and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency, the agency nevertheless must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.  In reviewing that explanation, a court must consider whether the decision was based on a 
Page 463 U. S. 31
 consideration of the relevant factors and whether there was a clear error of judgment.  Pp.  463 U. S. 40-44.
(b) The Court of Appeals correctly found that the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard of judicial review applied to rescission of agency regulations, but erred in intensifying the scope of its review based upon its reading of legislative events.  While an agency's interpretation of a statute may be confirmed or ratified by subsequent congressional failure to change that interpretation, here, even an unequivocal ratification of the passive restraint requirement would not connote approval or disapproval of NHTSA's later decision to rescind the requirement.  That decision remains subject to the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard.  Pp.  463 U. S. 44-46.
(c) The first reason for finding NHTSA's rescission of Modified Standard 208 was arbitrary and capricious is that it apparently gave no consideration to modifying the Standard to require that airbag technology be utilized.  Even if NHTSA's conclusion that detachable automatic seatbelts will not attain anticipated safety benefits because so many individuals will detach the mechanism were acceptable in its entirety, standing alone, it would not justify any more than an amendment of the Standard to disallow compliance by means of one technology which will not provide effective passenger protection.  It does not cast doubt on the need for a passive restraint requirement or upon the efficacy of airbag technology.  The airbag is more than a policy alternative to the passive restraint requirement; it is a technology alternative within the ambit of the existing standard.  Pp.  463 U. S. 46-51.
(d) NHTSA was too quick to dismiss the safety benefits of automatic seatbelts.  Its explanation for rescission of the passive restraint requirement is not sufficient to enable this Court to conclude that the rescission was the product of reasoned decisionmaking.  The agency took no account of the critical difference between detachable automatic seatbelts and current manual seatbelts, failed to articulate a basis for not requiring nondetachable belts, and thus failed to offer the rational connection between facts and judgment required to pass muster under the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard.  Pp.  463 U. S. 51-57.

In issuing these standards, the Secretary is directed to consider ""relevant available motor vehicle safety data,"" whether the proposed standard is ""reasonable, practicable and appropriate"" for the particular type of motor vehicle for which it is prescribed, and ""the extent to which such standards will contribute to carrying out the purposes"" of the Act.  The Act authorizes judicial review, under the Administrative Procedure Act, of ""all orders establishing, amending, or revoking"" a motor vehicle safety standard.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), to which the Secretary has delegated his authority to promulgate safety standards, rescinded the requirement of Modified Standard 208 that new motor vehicles produced after September 1982 be equipped with passive restraints (automatic seatbelts or airbags) to protect the safety of the occupants of the vehicle in the event of a collision.  In explaining the rescission, NHTSA maintained that it was no longer able to find, as it had in 1977 when Modified Standard 208 was issued, that the automatic restraint requirement would produce significant safety benefits.  In 1987, NHTSA had assumed that airbags would be installed in 60% of all new cars and automatic seatbelts in 40%.  But by 1981 it became apparent that automobile manufacturers planned to install automatic seatbelts in approximately 99% of the new cars, and that the overwhelming majority of such seatbelts could be easily detached and left that way permanently, thus precluding the realization of the lifesaving potential of airbags and requiring the same type of affirmative action that was the stumbling block 
Page 463 U. S. 30
 to achieving high usage of manual belts.  For this reason, NHTSA concluded that there was no longer a basis for reliably predicting that Modified Standard 208 would lead to any significant increased usage of restraints.  Hence, in NHTSA's view, the automatic restraint requirement was no longer reasonable or practicable.  Moreover, given the high expense of implementing such a requirement and the limited benefits arising therefrom, NHTSA feared that many consumers would regard Modified Standard 208 as an instance of ineffective regulation.  On petitions for review of NHTSA's rescission of the passive restraint requirement, the Court of Appeals held that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious on the grounds that NHTSA's conclusion that it could not reliably predict an increase in belt usage under the Standard was an insufficient basis for the rescission, that NHTSA inadequately considered the possibility of requiring manufacturers to install nondetachable, rather than detachable, passive belts, and that the agency failed to give any consideration to requiring compliance with the Standard by the installation of airbags.  The court found that congressional reaction to various versions of the Standard ""raised doubts"" that NHTSA's rescission ""necessarily demonstrates an effort to fulfill its statutory mandate,"" and that therefore the agency was obligated to provide ""increasingly clear and convincing reasons"" for its action.
Held:  NHTSA's rescission of the passive restraint requirement in Modified Standard 208 was arbitrary and capricious; the agency failed to present an adequate basis and explanation for rescinding the requirement, and must either consider the matter further or adhere to or amend the Standard along lines which its analysis supports.  Pp.  463 U. S. 40-57.
(a) The rescission of an occupant crash protection standard is subject to the same standard of judicial review -- the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard -- as is the promulgation of such a standard, and should not be judged by, as petitioner Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association contends, the standard used to judge an agency's refusal to promulgate a rule in the first place.  The Act expressly equates orders ""revoking"" and ""establishing"" safety standards.  The Association's view would render meaningless Congress' authorization for judicial review of orders revoking safety standards.  An agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required when an agency does not act in the first instance.  While the scope of review under the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard is narrow, and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency, the agency nevertheless must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.  In reviewing that explanation, a court must consider whether the decision was based on a 
Page 463 U. S. 31
 consideration of the relevant factors and whether there was a clear error of judgment.  Pp.  463 U. S. 40-44.
(b) The Court of Appeals correctly found that the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard of judicial review applied to rescission of agency regulations, but erred in intensifying the scope of its review based upon its reading of legislative events.  While an agency's interpretation of a statute may be confirmed or ratified by subsequent congressional failure to change that interpretation, here, even an unequivocal ratification of the passive restraint requirement would not connote approval or disapproval of NHTSA's later decision to rescind the requirement.  That decision remains subject to the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard.  Pp.  463 U. S. 44-46.
(c) The first reason for finding NHTSA's rescission of Modified Standard 208 was arbitrary and capricious is that it apparently gave no consideration to modifying the Standard to require that airbag technology be utilized.  Even if NHTSA's conclusion that detachable automatic seatbelts will not attain anticipated safety benefits because so many individuals will detach the mechanism were acceptable in its entirety, standing alone, it would not justify any more than an amendment of the Standard to disallow compliance by means of one technology which will not provide effective passenger protection.  It does not cast doubt on the need for a passive restraint requirement or upon the efficacy of airbag technology.  The airbag is more than a policy alternative to the passive restraint requirement; it is a technology alternative within the ambit of the existing standard.  Pp.  463 U. S. 46-51.
(d) NHTSA was too quick to dismiss the safety benefits of automatic seatbelts.  Its explanation for rescission of the passive restraint requirement is not sufficient to enable this Court to conclude that the rescission was the product of reasoned decisionmaking.  The agency took no account of the critical difference between detachable automatic seatbelts and current manual seatbelts, failed to articulate a basis for not requiring nondetachable belts, and thus failed to offer the rational connection between facts and judgment required to pass muster under the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard.  Pp.  463 U. S. 51-57.

Title 39 U.S.C.  3001(e)(2) prohibits the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives.  When appellee manufacturer of contraceptives proposed to mail to the public unsolicited advertisements including informational pamphlets promoting its products but also discussing venereal disease and family planning, the Postal Service notified appellee that the proposed mailings would violate  3001(e)(2).  Appellee then brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in Federal District Court, which held that the statute, as applied to the proposed mailings, violated the First Amendment.
Held:  As applied to appellee's proposed mailings,  3001(e)(2) is unconstitutional.  Pp.  463 U. S. 64-75.
(a) The mailings, which are concededly advertisements, refer to specific products, and are economically motivated, constitute commercial speech notwithstanding the fact that they contain discussions of important public issues such as the prevention of venereal disease and family planning.  Pp.  463 U. S. 64-68.
(b) Advertising for contraceptives not only implicates ""substantial individual and societal interests"" in the free flow of commercial information, but also relates to activity that is protected from unwarranted governmental interference.  Thus, appellee's proposed commercial speech is clearly protected by the First Amendment.  P.  463 U. S. 69.
(c) Neither of the interests asserted by appellants -- that  3001(e)(2) shields recipients of mail from materials that they are likely to find offensive and aids parents' efforts to control the manner in which their children become informed about birth control -- is sufficient to justify the sweeping prohibition on the mailing of unsolicited contraceptive advertisements.  The fact that protected speech may be offensive to some persons does not justify its suppression, and, in any event, recipients of objectionable mailings can avoid further offensiveness simply by averting their eyes or disposing of the mailings in a trash can.  While the second asserted interest is substantial,  3001(e)(2), as a means of effectuating this interest, fails to withstand scrutiny.  The statute's marginal degree of protection afforded those parents who desire to keep their children from confronting such mailings is improperly achieved by purging all mailboxes of unsolicited material that is entirely suitable for adults.  Section 3001(e)(2) is also defective because it denies parents

New York's Human Rights Law forbids discrimination in employee benefit plans on the basis of pregnancy, and its Disability Benefits Law requires employers to pay sick-leave benefits to employees unable to work because of pregnancy.  Section 514(a) of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) provides, with enumerated exceptions, that ERISA shall supersede ""any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan"" covered by ERISA.  ERISA does not mandate that employers provide any particular benefits, and does not itself proscribe discrimination in the provision of employee benefits.  Prior to the effective date of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA), which made discrimination based on pregnancy unlawful under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, appellee employers had welfare benefit plans subject to ERISA that did not provide benefits to employees disabled by pregnancy.  Appellees brought three separate declaratory judgment actions in Federal District Court, alleging that the Human Rights Law was preempted by ERISA.  Appellee airlines also alleged that the Disability Benefits Law was preempted.  The District Court in each case held that the Human Rights Law was preempted, at least insofar as it required the provision of pregnancy benefits prior to the effective date of the PDA.  As to appellee airlines' challenge to the Disability Benefits Law, the District Court construed  4(b)(3) of ERISA as exempting from ERISA coverage those provisions of an employee benefit plan maintained to comply with state disability insurance laws, and, because it concluded that appellees would have provided pregnancy benefits solely to comply with the Disability Benefits Law, the court dismissed the portion of the complaint seeking relief from that law.  The Court of Appeals affirmed as to the Human 
Page 463 U. S. 86
 Rights Law.  With respect to the Disability Benefits Law, the Court of Appeals held that  4(b)(3)'s exemption from preemption applied only when a benefit plan, ""as an integral unit,"" is maintained solely to comply with the disability law.  The Court of Appeals remanded for a determination whether appellee airlines provided benefits through such plans, in which event the Disability Benefits Law would be enforceable, or through portions of comprehensive plans, in which case ERISA regulation would be exclusive.
Held:
1. Given  514(a)'s plain language, and ERISA's structure and legislative history, both the Human Rights Law and the Disability Benefits Law ""relate to any employee benefit plan"" within the meaning of  514(a).  Pp.  463 U. S. 95-100.
2. The Human Rights Law is preempted with respect to ERISA benefit plans only insofar as it prohibits practices that are lawful under federal law.  Pp.  463 U. S. 100-106.
(a) Section 514(d) of ERISA provides that  514(a) shall not ""be construed to . . . modify [or] impair . . . any law of the United States.""  To the extent that the Human Rights Law provides a means of enforcing Title VII's commands, preemption of the Human Rights Law would modify and impair federal law within the meaning of  514(d).  State fair employment laws and administrative remedies play a significant role in the federal enforcement scheme under Title VII.  If ERISA were interpreted to preempt the Human Rights Law entirely with respect to covered benefit plans, the State no longer could prohibit employment practices relating to such plans and the state agency no longer would be authorized to grant relief.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission thus would be unable to refer claims involving covered plans to the state agency.  This would frustrate the goal of encouraging joint state/federal enforcement of Title VII.  Pp.  463 U. S. 100-102.
(b) Insofar as state laws prohibit employment practices that are lawful under Title VII, however, preemption would not impair Title VII within the meaning of  514(d).  While  514(d) may operate to exempt state laws upon which federal laws, such as Title VII, depend for their enforcement, the combination of Congress' enactment of  514(a)'s all-inclusive preemption provision and its enumeration of narrow, specific exceptions to that provision militate against expanding  514(d) into a more general saving clause.  Section 514(d)'s limited legislative history is entirely consistent with Congress' goal of ensuring that employers would not face conflicting or inconsistent state and local regulation of employee benefit plans.  Pp.  463 U. S. 103-106.
3. The Disability Benefits Law is not preempted by ERISA.  Pp.  463 U. S. 106-108. 
Page 463 U. S. 87

(a) Section 4(b)(3) of ERISA, which exempts from ERISA coverage ""any employee benefit plan . . . maintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable . . . disability insurance laws,"" excludes ""plans,"" not portions of plans, from ERISA coverage.  Hence, those portions of appellee airlines' multibenefit plans maintained to comply with the Disability Benefits Law are not exempt from ERISA and are not subject to state regulation.  Section 4(b)(3)'s use of the word ""solely"" demonstrates that the purpose of the entire plan must be to comply with an applicable disability insurance law.  Thus, only separately administered disability plans maintained solely to comply with the Disability Benefits Law are exempt from ERISA coverage under  4(b)(3).  Pp.  463 U. S. 106-108.
(b) A State may require an employer to maintain a separate disability plan, but the fact that state law permits employers to meet their state law obligations by including disability benefits in a multibenefit ERISA plan does not make the state law wholly unenforceable as to employers who choose that option.  P.  463 U. S. 108.

463 U.S. 110

Syllabus 
In 1913, the United States sued in Federal District Court, in what is known as the Orr Ditch litigation, to adjudicate water rights to the Truckee River for the benefit of both the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Reservation) and the Newlands Reclamation Project (Project).  Named as defendants were all water users on the Truckee River in Nevada.  Eventually, in 1944, the District Court entered a final decree, pursuant to a settlement agreement, awarding various water rights to the Reservation and the Project, which by this time was now under the management of the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District (TCID).  In 1973, the United States filed the present action in the same District Court on behalf of the Reservation, seeking additional rights to the Truckee River, and the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe (Tribe) was permitted to intervene in support of the United States.  Named as defendants were all persons presently claiming water rights to the Truckee River and its tributaries in Nevada, including the defendants in the Orr Ditch litigation and their successors, individual farmers who owned land in the Project, and the TCID.  The defendants asserted res judicata as an affirmative defense, claiming that the United States and the Tribe were precluded by the Orr Ditch decree from litigating the asserted claim.  The District Court sustained the defense and dismissed the complaint.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the Orr Ditch decree concluded the dispute between, on the one hand, the Orr Ditch defendants, their successors in interest, and subsequent appropriators of the Truckee River, and, on the other hand, the United States and the Tribe, but not the dispute between the Tribe and the Project landowners.  The court found that, since neither the Tribe nor the Project landowners were parties in Orr Ditch, but instead were represented by the United States, and since their interests may have conflicted in that proceeding, it could not be found that the United States had intended to bind these nonparties inter se, absent a specific statement of adversity in the pleadings. 
Page 463 U. S. 111

Held:  Res judicata prevents the United States and the Tribe from litigating the instant claim.  Pp.  463 U. S. 121-145.
(a) Where the Government represented the Project landowners in Orr Ditch, the landowners, not the Government, received the beneficial interest in the water rights confirmed to the Government.  Ickes v. Fox, 300 U. S. 82; Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589.  Therefore, the Government is not at liberty to simply reallocate the water rights decreed to the Reservation and the Project as if it owned those rights.  Pp.  463 U. S. 121-128.
(b) The cause of action asserted below is the same cause of action that was asserted in the Orr Ditch case.  The record in that case, including the final decree and amended complaint, clearly shows that the Government was given an opportunity to litigate the Reservation's entire water rights to the Truckee River, and that the Government intended to take advantage of that opportunity.  Pp.  463 U. S. 130-134.
(c) All of the parties below are bound by the Orr Ditch decree.  The United States, as a party to the Orr Ditch litigation acting as a representative for the interests of the Reservation and the Project, cannot relitigate the Reservation's water rights with those who could use the Orr Ditch decree as a defense.  The Tribe, whose interests were represented in Orr Ditch by the United States, also is bound by the Orr Ditch decree, as are the Orr Ditch defendants and their successors.  Moreover, under circumstances where, after the Orr Ditch litigation was commenced, the legal relationships were no longer simply those between the United States and the Tribe, but were also those between the United States, TCID, and the Project landowners, the interests of the Tribe and the Project landowners were sufficiently adverse so that both are now bound by the Orr Ditch decree.  It need not be determined what the effect of the Government's representation of different interests would be under the law of private trustees and fiduciaries, for that law does not apply where Congress has decreed that the Government have dual responsibilities.  The Government does not ""compromise"" its obligation to one interest that Congress obliges it to represent when it simultaneously performs another task for another interest that Congress has obligated it by statute to do.  And as to the defendants below who appropriated water from the Truckee River subsequent to the Orr Ditch decree, they too, as a necessary exception to the res judicata mutuality requirement, can use that decree against the plaintiffs below.  These defendants have relied just as much on that decree in participating in the development of western Nevada as have the parties in the Orr Ditch case, and any other conclusion would make it impossible finally to quantify a reserved water right.  Pp.  463 U. S. 134-144.

In 1913, the United States sued in Federal District Court, in what is known as the Orr Ditch litigation, to adjudicate water rights to the Truckee River for the benefit of both the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Reservation) and the Newlands Reclamation Project (Project).  Named as defendants were all water users on the Truckee River in Nevada.  Eventually, in 1944, the District Court entered a final decree, pursuant to a settlement agreement, awarding various water rights to the Reservation and the Project, which by this time was now under the management of the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District (TCID).  In 1973, the United States filed the present action in the same District Court on behalf of the Reservation, seeking additional rights to the Truckee River, and the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe (Tribe) was permitted to intervene in support of the United States.  Named as defendants were all persons presently claiming water rights to the Truckee River and its tributaries in Nevada, including the defendants in the Orr Ditch litigation and their successors, individual farmers who owned land in the Project, and the TCID.  The defendants asserted res judicata as an affirmative defense, claiming that the United States and the Tribe were precluded by the Orr Ditch decree from litigating the asserted claim.  The District Court sustained the defense and dismissed the complaint.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the Orr Ditch decree concluded the dispute between, on the one hand, the Orr Ditch defendants, their successors in interest, and subsequent appropriators of the Truckee River, and, on the other hand, the United States and the Tribe, but not the dispute between the Tribe and the Project landowners.  The court found that, since neither the Tribe nor the Project landowners were parties in Orr Ditch, but instead were represented by the United States, and since their interests may have conflicted in that proceeding, it could not be found that the United States had intended to bind these nonparties inter se, absent a specific statement of adversity in the pleadings. 
Page 463 U. S. 111

Held:  Res judicata prevents the United States and the Tribe from litigating the instant claim.  Pp.  463 U. S. 121-145.
(a) Where the Government represented the Project landowners in Orr Ditch, the landowners, not the Government, received the beneficial interest in the water rights confirmed to the Government.  Ickes v. Fox, 300 U. S. 82; Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589.  Therefore, the Government is not at liberty to simply reallocate the water rights decreed to the Reservation and the Project as if it owned those rights.  Pp.  463 U. S. 121-128.
(b) The cause of action asserted below is the same cause of action that was asserted in the Orr Ditch case.  The record in that case, including the final decree and amended complaint, clearly shows that the Government was given an opportunity to litigate the Reservation's entire water rights to the Truckee River, and that the Government intended to take advantage of that opportunity.  Pp.  463 U. S. 130-134.
(c) All of the parties below are bound by the Orr Ditch decree.  The United States, as a party to the Orr Ditch litigation acting as a representative for the interests of the Reservation and the Project, cannot relitigate the Reservation's water rights with those who could use the Orr Ditch decree as a defense.  The Tribe, whose interests were represented in Orr Ditch by the United States, also is bound by the Orr Ditch decree, as are the Orr Ditch defendants and their successors.  Moreover, under circumstances where, after the Orr Ditch litigation was commenced, the legal relationships were no longer simply those between the United States and the Tribe, but were also those between the United States, TCID, and the Project landowners, the interests of the Tribe and the Project landowners were sufficiently adverse so that both are now bound by the Orr Ditch decree.  It need not be determined what the effect of the Government's representation of different interests would be under the law of private trustees and fiduciaries, for that law does not apply where Congress has decreed that the Government have dual responsibilities.  The Government does not ""compromise"" its obligation to one interest that Congress obliges it to represent when it simultaneously performs another task for another interest that Congress has obligated it by statute to do.  And as to the defendants below who appropriated water from the Truckee River subsequent to the Orr Ditch decree, they too, as a necessary exception to the res judicata mutuality requirement, can use that decree against the plaintiffs below.  These defendants have relied just as much on that decree in participating in the development of western Nevada as have the parties in the Orr Ditch case, and any other conclusion would make it impossible finally to quantify a reserved water right.  Pp.  463 U. S. 134-144.

Syllabus 
Section 8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act prohibits secondary boycotts, but its so-called ""publicity proviso"" exempts from the prohibition publicity advising the public that a product is produced by an employer with whom a union has a primary dispute and is distributed by another employer.  As a result of a wage dispute between respondent union and a building contractor retained by a company to construct a department store in a shopping center owned and operated by petitioner, the union passed out handbills to consumers in the shopping center urging them not to patronize any of the stores in the center until petitioner publicly promised that all construction at the center would be done by contractors who pay their employees fair wages and fringe benefits.  Petitioner filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board, which held that the handbilling was exempted from the secondary boycott prohibition of  8(b)(4) by the ""publicity proviso,"" and dismissed the complaint.  The Board reasoned that there was a ""symbiotic"" relationship between petitioner and its tenants, including the department store company, and that they would derive a substantial benefit from the ""product"" that the building contractor was constructing, namely, the new store, the contractor's status as a producer bringing a total consumer boycott of the shopping center within the ""publicity proviso.""  The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that the building contractor was a producer, and that petitioner and its tenants were distributors within the meaning of the proviso.
Held:  The handbilling does not come within the protection of the ""publicity proviso.""  Pp.  463 U. S. 153-157.
(a) The only publicity exempted from the secondary boycott prohibition is publicity intended to inform the public that the primary employer's product is ""distributed by"" the secondary employer.  Here, the Board's analysis would almost strip the distribution requirement of any limiting effect, and diverts the inquiry away from the relationship between the primary and secondary employers and toward the relationship between the two secondary employers.

(b) The handbills at issue did not merely call for a boycott of the department store company's products; they also called for a boycott of the products being sold by the company's cotenants.  Neither petitioner nor any of the cotenants had any business relationship with the building contractor, nor do they sell any product whose chain of production can reasonably be said to include the contractor.  Hence, there is no justification for treating the products that the cotenants distribute to the public as products produced by the contractor.  Pp.  463 U. S. 156-157.

Section 244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) authorizes either House of Congress, by resolution, to invalidate the decision of the Executive Branch, pursuant to authority delegated by Congress to the Attorney General, to allow a particular deportable alien to remain in the United States.  Appellee-respondent Chadha, an alien who had been lawfully admitted to the United States on a nonimmigrant student visa, remained in the United States after his visa had expired and was ordered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to show cause why he should not be deported.  He then applied for suspension of the deportation, and, after a hearing, an Immigration Judge, acting pursuant to  244(a)(1) of the Act, which authorizes the Attorney General, in his discretion, to suspend deportation, ordered the suspension, and reported the suspension to Congress as required by  244(c)(1).  Thereafter, the House of Representatives passed a resolution pursuant to  244(c)(2) vetoing the suspension, and the Immigration Judge reopened the deportation proceedings.  Chadha moved to terminate the proceedings on the ground that  244(c)(2) is unconstitutional, but the judge held that he had no authority to rule on its constitutionality, and ordered Chadha deported pursuant to the House Resolution.  Chadha's appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals was dismissed, the Board also holding that it had no power to declare  244(c)(2) unconstitutional.  Chadha then filed a petition for review of the deportation order in the Court of Appeals, and the INS joined him in arguing that  244(c)(2) is unconstitutional.  The Court of Appeals held that  244(c)(2) violates the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, and accordingly directed the Attorney General to cease taking any steps to deport Chadha based upon the House Resolution. 
Page 462 U. S. 920

Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction to entertain the INS's appeal in No. 80-1832 under 28 U.S.C.  1252, which provides that ""[a]ny party"" may appeal to the Supreme Court from a judgment of ""any court of the United States"" holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional in ""any civil action, suit, or proceeding"" to which the United States or any of its agencies is a party.  A court of appeals is ""a court of the United States"" for purposes of  1252, the proceeding below was a ""civil action, suit, or proceeding,"" the INS is an agency of the United States and was a party to the proceeding below, and the judgment below held an Act of Congress unconstitutional.  Moreover, for purposes of deciding whether the INS was ""any party"" within the grant of appellate jurisdiction in  1252, the INS was sufficiently aggrieved by the Court of Appeals' decision prohibiting it from taking action it would otherwise take.  An agency's status as an aggrieved party under  1252 is not altered by the fact that the Executive may agree with the holding that the statute in question is unconstitutional.  Pp.  462 U. S. 929-931.
2. Section 244(c)(2) is severable from the remainder of  244.  Section 406 of the Act provides that, if any particular provision of the Act is held invalid, the remainder of the Act shall not be affected.  This gives rise to a presumption that Congress did not intend the validity of the Act as a whole, or any part thereof, to depend upon whether the veto clause of  244(c)(2) was invalid.  This presumption is supported by  244's legislative history.  Moreover, a provision is further presumed severable if what remains after severance is fully operative as a law.  Here,  244 can survive as a ""fully operative"" and workable administrative mechanism without the one-House veto.  Pp.  462 U. S. 931-935.
3. Chadha has standing to challenge the constitutionality of  244(c)(2), since he has demonstrated ""injury in fact and a substantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested will prevent or redress the claimed injury.""  Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59,  438 U. S. 79.  Pp.  462 U. S. 935-936.
4. The fact that Chadha may have other statutory relief available to him does not preclude him from challenging the constitutionality of  244(c)(2), especially where the other avenues of relief are at most speculative.  Pp.  462 U. S. 936-937.
5. The Court of Appeals had jurisdiction under  106(a) of the Act, which provides that a petition for review in a court of appeals ""shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for the judicial review of all final orders of deportation . . . made against aliens within the United States pursuant to administrative proceedings"" under  242(b) of the Act.  Section 106(a) includes all matters on which the final deportation order is contingent, rather than only those determinations made at the deportation 
Page 462 U. S. 921
 hearing.  Here, Chadha's deportation stands or falls on the validity of the challenged veto, the final deportation order having been entered only to implement that veto.  Pp.  462 U. S. 937-939.
6. A case or controversy is presented by these cases.  From the time of the House's formal intervention, there was concrete adverseness, and prior to such intervention, there was adequate Art. III adverseness even though the only parties were the INS and Chadha.  The INS's agreement with Chadha's position does not alter the fact that the INS would have deported him absent the Court of Appeals' judgment.  Moreover, Congress is the proper party to defend the validity of a statute when a Government agency, as a defendant charged with enforcing the statute, agrees with plaintiffs that the statute is unconstitutional.  Pp.  462 U. S. 939-940.
7. These cases do not present a nonjusticiable political question on the asserted ground that Chadha is merely challenging Congress' authority under the Naturalization and Necessary and Proper Clauses of the Constitution.  The presence of constitutional issues with significant political overtones does not automatically invoke the political question doctrine.  Resolution of litigation challenging the constitutional authority of one of the three branches cannot be evaded by the courts simply because the issues have political implications.  Pp.  462 U. S. 940-943.
8. The congressional veto provision in  244(c)(2) is unconstitutional.  Pp.  462 U. S. 944-959.
(a) The prescription for legislative action in Art. I,  1 -- requiring all legislative powers to be vested in a Congress consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives -- and  7 -- requiring every bill passed by the House and Senate, before becoming law, to be presented to the President, and, if he disapproves, to be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House -- represents the Framers' decision that the legislative power of the Federal Government be exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure.  This procedure is an integral part of the constitutional design for the separation of powers.  Pp.  462 U. S. 944-951.
(b) Here, the action taken by the House pursuant to  244(c)(2) was essentially legislative in purpose and effect, and thus was subject to the procedural requirements of Art. I,  7, for legislative action:  passage by a majority of both Houses and presentation to the President.  The one-House veto operated to overrule the Attorney General and mandate Chadha's deportation.  The veto's legislative character is confirmed by the character of the congressional action it supplants; i.e., absent the veto provision of  244(c)(2), neither the House nor the Senate, or both acting together, could effectively require the Attorney General to deport an alien once the Attorney General, in the exercise of legislatively 
Page 462 U. S. 922
 delegated authority, had determined that the alien should remain in the United States.  Without the veto provision, this could have been achieved only by legislation requiring deportation.  A veto by one House under  244(c)(2) cannot be justified as an attempt at amending the standards set out in  244(a)(1), or as a repeal of  244 as applied to Chadha.  The nature of the decision implemented by the one-House veto further manifests its legislative character.  Congress must abide by its delegation of authority to the Attorney General until that delegation is legislatively altered or revoked.  Finally, the veto's legislative character is confirmed by the fact that, when the Framers intended to authorize either House of Congress to act alone and outside of its prescribed bicameral legislative role, they narrowly and precisely defined the procedure for such action in the Constitution.  Pp.  462 U. S. 951-959.

Syllabus 
Since 1938, several dams have been constructed along the Columbia-Snake River system, severely reducing the number of anadromous fish that migrate between the Pacific Ocean and their spawning grounds in those rivers and their tributaries.  Fishing is another factor depleting the anadromous fish population.  In 1976, this Court granted Idaho leave to file its complaint requesting an equitable apportionment against Oregon and Washington of the anadromous fish in the Columbia-Snake River system.  A Special Master was appointed, and after trial and oral argument, he entered the report involved here, recommending that the action be dismissed without prejudice. Idaho filed exceptions to the report.

(a) The doctrine of equitable apportionment is applicable here.  Although that doctrine has its roots in water rights litigation, the natural resource of anadromous fish is sufficiently similar to make equitable apportionment an appropriate mechanism for resolving allocative disputes.  The doctrine is neither dependent on nor bound by existing legal rights to the resource being apportioned.

(b) Because apportionment is based on broad and flexible equitable concerns, rather than on precise legal entitlements, a decree is not intended to compensate for prior legal wrongs.  Instead, it prospectively ensures that a State obtains its equitable share of a resource.  Although a decree may not always be mathematically precise or based on definite present and future conditions, uncertainties about the future do not provide a basis for declining to fashion a decree.  The Special Master erred to the extent that he found that the formulation of a workable decree is impossible in this case.  If Idaho suffers from the injury it alleges, there is no reason why that injury could not be remedied by an equitable decree.  Pp.  462 U. S. 1025-1027.

The evidence does not demonstrate that Oregon and Washington are now injuring Idaho by overfishing, or that they will do so in the future.

462 U.S. 1017

Syllabus 
Since 1938, several dams have been constructed along the Columbia-Snake River system, severely reducing the number of anadromous fish that migrate between the Pacific Ocean and their spawning grounds in those rivers and their tributaries.  Fishing is another factor depleting the anadromous fish population.  In 1976, this Court granted Idaho leave to file its complaint requesting an equitable apportionment against Oregon and Washington of the anadromous fish in the Columbia-Snake River system.  A Special Master was appointed, and after trial and oral argument, he entered the report involved here, recommending that the action be dismissed without prejudice. Idaho filed exceptions to the report.
Held:  The Special Master's recommendation is adopted, and the action is dismissed without prejudice to Idaho's right to bring new proceedings whenever it shall appear that it is being deprived of its equitable share of anadromous fish.  Pp.  462 U. S. 1024-1029.

Syllabus 
During the investigation of the death of a person whose body had been found in his wrecked pickup truck, respondent was questioned at the police station, where he was advised of his Miranda rights, and later arrested for furnishing liquor to the victim, a minor, and again advised of his Miranda rights.  Respondent denied his involvement, and asked for an attorney.  Subsequently, while being transferred from the police station to a jail, respondent inquired of a police officer, ""Well, what is going to happen to me now?""  The officer answered that respondent did not have to talk to him, and respondent said he understood.  There followed a discussion between respondent and the officer as to where respondent was being taken and the offense with which he would be charged.  The officer suggested that respondent take a polygraph examination, which he did, after another reading of his Miranda rights.  When the examiner told respondent that he did not believe respondent was telling the truth, respondent recanted his earlier story and admitted that he had been driving the truck in question and that he had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol and had passed out at the wheel of the truck before it left the highway.  Respondent was charged with first-degree manslaughter, driving while under the influence of intoxicants, and driving while his license was revoked.  His motion to suppress his statements admitting his involvement was denied, and he was found guilty after a bench trial.  The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the inquiry respondent made of the police officer while being transferred to jail did not ""initiate"" a conversation with the officer, and that therefore the statements growing out of this conversation should have been excluded from evidence under Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
54 Ore.App. 949, 636 P.2d 1011, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded that respondent's Fifth Amendment rights were not violated.  Pp.  462 U. S. 1044-1047.
(a) The Oregon Court of Appeals misapprehended the test laid down in Edwards, where it was held that, after the right to counsel has been asserted by an accused, further interrogation should not take place ""unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations 
Page 462 U. S. 1040
 with the police.""  451 U.S. at  451 U. S. 485.  It was not held in that case that the ""initiation"" of a conversation by an accused such as respondent would amount to a waiver of a previously invoked right to counsel.  The Oregon court erred in thinking that an ""initiation"" of a conversation by an accused not only satisfied the Edwards rule, but, ex proprio vigore, suffices to show a waiver of the previously asserted right to counsel. Pp. 1044-1045.
(b) Here, in asking ""Well, what is going to happen to me now?"" respondent ""initiated"" further conversation.

Argued March 2, 1983
Decided June 22, 1983
462 U.S. 725

Syllabus 
As a result of the 1980 census, the New Jersey Legislature reapportioned the State's congressional districts.  The reapportionment plan contained 14 districts, with an average population per district of 526,059, each district, on the average, differing from the ""ideal"" figure by 0.1384%.  The largest district (Fourth District) had a population of 527,472, and the smallest (Sixth District) had a population of 523,798, the difference between them being 0.6984% of the average district.  In a suit by a group of individuals challenging the plan's validity, the District Court held that the plan violated Art. I,  2, of the Constitution because the population deviations among districts, although small, were not the result of a good faith effort to achieve population equality.
Held:
1. The ""equal representation"" standard of Art. I,  2, requires that congressional districts be apportioned to achieve population equality as nearly as is practicable.  Parties challenging apportionment legislation bear the burden of proving that population differences among districts could have been reduced or eliminated by a good faith effort to draw districts of equal population.  If the plaintiffs carry their burden, the State must then bear the burden of proving that each significant variance between districts was necessary to achieve some legitimate goal.  Cf. Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U. S. 526; White v. Weiser, 412 U. S. 783.  Pp.  462 U. S. 730-731.
2. New Jersey's plan may not be regarded per se as the product of a good faith effort to achieve population equality merely because the maximum population deviation among districts is smaller than the predictable undercount in available census data.  Pp.  462 U. S. 731-740.
(a) The ""as nearly as practicable"" standard for apportioning congressional districts
""is inconsistent with adoption of fixed numerical standards which excuse population variances without regard to the circumstances of each particular case.""
Kirkpatrick, supra, at  394 U. S. 530.  Only the principle of population equality as developed in Kirkpatrick, supra, and Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, reflects the aspirations of Art. I,  2.  There are no de minimis population variations, which could practicably 
Page 462 U. S. 726
 be avoided, that may be considered as meeting the standard of Art. I,  2, without justification.  Pp.  462 U. S. 731-734.
(b) There is no merit to the contention that population deviation from ideal district size should be considered to be the functional equivalent of zero as a matter of law where that deviation is less than the predictable undercount in census figures.  Even assuming that the extent to which the census system systematically undercounts actual population can be precisely determined, it would not be relevant.  The census count provides the only reliable -- albeit less than perfect -- indication of the districts' ""real"" relative population levels, and furnishes the only basis for good faith attempts to achieve population equality.  Pp.  462 U. S. 735-738.
(c) The population differences involved here could have been avoided or significantly reduced with a good faith effort to achieve population equality.  Resort to the simple device of transferring entire political subdivisions of known population between contiguous districts would have produced districts much closer to numerical equality.  Thus, the District Court did not err in finding that the plaintiffs met their burden of showing that the plan did not come as nearly as practicable to population equality.  Pp.  462 U. S. 738-740.
3. The District Court properly found that the defendants did not meet their burden of proving that the population deviations in the plan were necessary to achieve a consistent, nondiscriminatory legislative policy.  The State must show with specificity that a particular objective required the specific deviations in its plan.  The primary justification asserted was that of preserving the voting strength of racial minority groups, but appellants failed to show that the specific population disparities were necessary to preserve minority voting strength.  Pp.  462 U. S. 740-744.

462 U.S. 791

Syllabus 
An Indiana statute requires the county auditor to post notice in the county courthouse of the sale of real property for nonpayment of property taxes and to publish notice once each week for three consecutive weeks.  Notice by certified mail must be given to the property owner, but at the time in question in this case, there was no provision for notice by mail or personal service to mortgagees of the property.  The purchaser at a tax sale acquires a certificate of sale that constitutes a lien against the property for the amount paid and is superior to all prior liens.  The tax sale is followed by a 2-year period during which the owner or mortgagee may redeem the property.  If no one redeems the property during this period, the tax sale purchaser may apply for a deed to the property, but before the deed is executed, the county auditor must notify the former owner that he is entitled to redeem the property.  If the property is not redeemed within 30 days, the county auditor may then execute a deed to the purchaser who then acquires an estate in fee simple, free and clear of all liens, and may bring an action to quiet title.  Property on which appellant held a mortgage was sold to appellee for nonpayment of taxes.  Appellant was not notified of the pending sale and did not learn of the sale until more than two years later, by which time the redemption period had run and the mortgagor still owed appellant money on the mortgage.  Appellee then filed suit in state court seeking to quiet title to the property.  The court upheld the tax sale statute against appellant's contention that it had not received constitutionally adequate notice of the pending tax sale and of its opportunity to redeem the property after the sale. The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The manner of notice provided to appellant did not meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  462 U. S. 795-800.
(a) Prior to an action that will affect an interest in life, liberty, or property protected by the Due Process Clause, a State must provide
""notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.""
Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306,  339 U. S. 314.  Notice by publication is not reasonably calculated to inform interested parties who can be notified by more effective means such as personal service or mailed notice.  Pp.  462 U. S. 795-797. 
Page 462 U. S. 792

(b) Since a mortgagee clearly has a legally protected property interest, he is entitled to notice reasonably calculated to apprise him of a pending tax sale.  Constructive notice to a mortgagee who is identified in the public record does not satisfy the due process requirement of Mullane.  Neither notice by publication and posting nor mailed notice to the property owner are means ""such as one desirous of actually informing the [mortgagee] might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.""  Mullane, supra, at  339 U. S. 315.  Personal service or notice by mail is required even though sophisticated creditors have means at their disposal to discover whether property taxes have not been paid and whether tax sale proceedings are therefore likely to be initiated.

Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306,  339 U. S. 314.  Notice by publication is not reasonably calculated to inform interested parties who can be notified by more effective means such as personal service or mailed notice.  Pp.  462 U. S. 795-797. 
Page 462 U. S. 792

(b) Since a mortgagee clearly has a legally protected property interest, he is entitled to notice reasonably calculated to apprise him of a pending tax sale.  Constructive notice to a mortgagee who is identified in the public record does not satisfy the due process requirement of Mullane.  Neither notice by publication and posting nor mailed notice to the property owner are means ""such as one desirous of actually informing the [mortgagee] might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.""  Mullane, supra, at  339 U. S. 315.  Personal service or notice by mail is required even though sophisticated creditors have means at their disposal to discover whether property taxes have not been paid and whether tax sale proceedings are therefore likely to be initiated.

Argued December 1, 1982
Decided June 22, 1983*
462 U.S. 810

Syllabus 
Section 3622(b) of the Postal Reorganization Act (Act) provides that the Postal Rate Commission shall recommend rates for the classes of mail in accordance with nine factors, the third of which ( 3622(b)(3)) is
""the requirement that each class of mail or type of mail service bear the direct and indirect postal costs attributable to that class or type plus that portion of all other costs of the Postal Service reasonably assignable to such class or type.""
In reviewing the ratemaking proceedings involved here, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit -- contrary to earlier decisions of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in reviewing prior ratemaking proceedings -- held that the Act does not require the maximum possible use of cost-of-service principles, including allocation of costs on unverified inferences of causation, but permits use of other approaches, including the Rate Commission's original two-tier approach under which the rate floor for each class of mail was established by first determining the portion of the Postal Service's total costs verifiably caused by (""attributable to"") that class of mail, and then ""reasonably assigning"" remaining costs to the various classes of mail on the basis of the other noncost, discretionary factors set forth in  3622(b).
Held:
1. Although the Act divides ratemaking responsibility between the Rate Commission and the Postal Service, the legislative history and the Act's structure demonstrate that ratemaking authority was vested primarily in the Rate Commission.  Thus, its interpretation of  3622(b) is due deference.  Pp.  462 U. S. 820-821.
2. In enacting the Act to divest itself of its previous control over setting postal rates, Congress was concerned about the influence of lobbyists and resulting discrimination in rates among classes of postal service, but it did not intend to require maximum use of cost-of-service principles or to eliminate the ratesetter's discretion as to the methods for assigning 
Page 462 U. S. 811
 costs; it simply removed the ratesetting function from the political arena.  The legislative history does not suggest that Congress viewed the exercise of discretion as an evil in itself.  Pp.  462 U. S. 821-823.
3. The Rate Commission's two-tier approach is a reasonable construction of  3622(b)(3).  The two-tier approach -- one tier based on causation and the second tier based on other factors -- is consistent with the statutory language, and is supported by the legislative history.  Pp.  462 U. S. 823-825.
4. The statute requires attribution of any costs for which the source can be identified, but leaves it to the Rate Commission, in the first instance, to decide which methods provide reasonable assurance that costs are the result of providing one class of service.  Pp.  462 U. S. 825-833.
(a) The Act does not dictate a specific method for identifying causal relationships between costs and classes of mail, but envisions consideration of all appropriate costing approaches.  Pp.  462 U. S. 825-826.
(b) The Rate Commission acted consistently with the statutory mandate and Congress' policy objectives in refusing to use accounting principles lacking an established causal basis.  On its face,  3622(b)(3) does not deny to the expert ratesetting agency the authority to decide which methods sufficiently identify the requisite causal connection between particular services and particular costs.  The legislative history supports the Rate Commission's view that, when causal analysis is limited by insufficient data, the statute envisions that the Rate Commission will press for better data, rather than construct an ""attribution"" based on unsupported inferences of causation.  Pp.  462 U. S. 826-829.
(c) Because the Rate Commission has decided that methods involving attribution of long-term and short-term variable costs reliably indicate causal connections between classes and postal rates, the Act requires that they be employed.  But the Act's language and legislative history support the Rate Commission's position that Congress did not intend to bar the use of any reliable method of attributing costs.  Pp.  462 U. S. 829-832.
(d) A statement in the legislative history indicating that the rate floor for each class of mail should consist of short-term variable costs does not demonstrate that the Rate Commission's inclusion of long-term variable costs, and consideration of other methods of identifying causation, are inconsistent with the statutory mandate or frustrate Congress' policy.  The statute's plain language and prior legislative history indicate that Congress' broad policy was to mandate a rate floor consisting of all costs that could be identified, in the Rate Commission's view, as causally linked to a class of postal service.  Pp.  462 U. S. 832-833.

Argued March 21, 1983

Syllabus 
The Wyoming Legislature consists of a Senate and a House of Representatives.  The State Constitution provides that each of the State's 23 counties shall constitute a senatorial and representative district and shall have at least one senator and one representative, and requires the senators and representatives to be apportioned among the counties ""as nearly as may be according to the number of their inhabitants.""  A 1981 Wyoming statute reapportioned the House of Representatives and provided for 64 representatives.  Based on the 1980 census placing Wyoming's population at 469,557, the ideal apportionment would have been 7,337 persons per representative.  But the reapportionment resulted in an average deviation from population equality of 16% and a maximum deviation of 89%.  Niobrara County, the State's least populous county, was given one representative, even though its population was only 2,924, the legislature having provided that a county would have a representative even if the statutory formula rounded the county's population to zero.  The legislature also provided that, if Niobrara County's representation were held unconstitutional, it would be combined with a neighboring county in a single district, so that the House would consist of 63 representatives.  Appellants (members of the League of Women Voters and residents of seven counties in which the population per representative is greater than the state average) filed an action in Federal District Court, alleging that granting Niobrara County a representative diluted the voting privileges of appellants and other voters similarly situated in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court upheld the constitutionality of the reapportionment statute.
Held:  Wyoming has not violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by permitting Niobrara County to have its own representative.  Pp.  462 U. S. 842-848.
(a) Some deviations from population equality may be necessary to permit the States to pursue other legitimate objectives such as ""maintain[ing] the integrity of various political subdivisions"" and ""provid[ing] for compact districts of contiguous territory.""  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533,  377 U. S. 578.  But an apportionment plan with population disparities larger 
Page 462 U. S. 836
 than 10% creates a prima facie case of discrimination, and therefore must be justified by the State, the ultimate inquiry being whether the plan may reasonably be said to advance a rational state policy and, if so whether the population disparities resulting from the plan exceed constitutional limits.  Pp.  462 U. S. 842-843.
(b) This case presents an unusually strong example of an apportionment plan the population variations of which are entirely the result of the consistent and nondiscriminatory application of a legitimate state policy.  Wyoming, since statehood, has followed a constitutional policy of using counties as representative districts and ensuring that each county has one representative.  Moreover, Wyoming has applied the factor of preserving political subdivisions free from any taint of arbitrariness or discrimination.  Pp.  462 U. S. 843-846.
(c) Wyoming's policy of preserving county boundaries justifies the additional deviations from population equality resulting from the provision of representation for Niobrara County.  Considerable population variations would remain even if Niobrara County's representative were eliminated.  Under the 63-member plan, the average deviation per representative would be 13% and the maximum deviation would be 66%.  These statistics make it clear that the grant of a representative to Niobrara County is not a significant cause of the population deviations in Wyoming.  Moreover, the differences between the two plans are justified on the basis of the above policy of preserving county boundaries.  By enacting the 64-member plan, the State ensured that this policy applies nondiscriminatorily, whereas the effect of the 63-member plan would be to deprive Niobrara County voters of their own representative.

462 U.S. 862

Syllabus 
In a bifurcated trial in a Georgia state court, a jury found respondent guilty of murder and imposed the death penalty.  At the sentencing phase of the trial, the judge instructed the jury that it was authorized to consider all of the evidence received during the guilt phase of the trial as well as all facts and circumstances presented in mitigation or aggravation during the sentencing proceeding, and that it must find and designate in writing the existence of one or more specified statutory aggravating circumstances in order to impose the death penalty.  The jury stated in writing that it found the statutory aggravating circumstances that respondent had a prior conviction of a capital felony, that he had ""a substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions,"" and that the murder was committed by an escapee.  While respondent's appeal was pending, the Georgia Supreme Court held in another case that one of the aggravating circumstances -- ""substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions"" -- was unconstitutionally vague.  In respondent's case, the Georgia Supreme Court held that the two other aggravating circumstances adequately supported the sentence.  After the Federal District Court denied respondent's petition for habeas corpus, the Court of Appeals held that respondent's death penalty was invalid.  In response to this Court's certified question, Zant v. Stephens, 456 U. S. 410, the Georgia Supreme Court explained the state law premises for its view that the failure of one aggravating circumstance does not invalidate a death sentence that is otherwise adequately supported by other aggravating circumstances.  Under Georgia law, the finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance serves a limited purpose -- it identifies those members of the class of persons convicted of murder who are eligible for the death penalty, without furnishing any further guidance to the jury in the exercise of its discretion in determining whether the death penalty should be imposed.
Held:
1. The limited function served by the jury's finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance does not render Georgia's statutory scheme invalid under the holding in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238.  Under Georgia's scheme, the jury is required to find and identify in writing at least one valid statutory aggravating circumstance, an individualized 
Page 462 U. S. 863
 determination must be made on the basis of the defendant's character and the circumstances of the crime, and the State Supreme Court reviews the record of every death penalty proceeding to determine whether the sentence was arbitrary or disproportionate.  The narrowing function of statutory aggravating circumstances was properly achieved in this case by the two valid aggravating circumstances upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court, because these two findings adequately differentiate this case in an objective, evenhanded, and substantively rational way from the many Georgia murder cases in which the death penalty may not be imposed.  Moreover, the Georgia Supreme Court reviewed respondent's death sentence to determine whether it was arbitrary, excessive, or disproportionate.  Thus the Georgia capital sentencing statute is not invalid as applied here.  Pp.  462 U. S. 873-880.
2. Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359, does not require that respondent's death sentence be vacated.  Stromberg requires that a general guilty verdict be set aside if the jury was instructed that it could rely on any of two or more independent grounds, and one of those grounds is insufficient, because the verdict may have rested exclusively on the insufficient ground.  In this case, however, the jury did not merely return a general verdict stating that it had found at least one aggravating circumstance, but instead expressly found two aggravating circumstances that were valid and legally sufficient to support the death penalty.  Nor is a second rule derived from Stromberg -- requiring that a general guilty verdict on a single-count indictment or information be set aside where it rests on both a constitutional and an unconstitutional ground -- applicable here.  There is no suggestion that any of the aggravating circumstances involved any conduct protected by the Constitution.  Pp.  462 U. S. 880-884.
3. Respondent's death sentence was not impaired on the asserted ground that the jury instruction with regard to the invalid statutory aggravating circumstance may have unduly affected the jury's deliberations.  Although the aggravating circumstance was struck down by the Georgia Supreme Court because it failed to provide an adequate basis for distinguishing a murder case in which the death penalty may be imposed from those cases in which such a penalty may not be imposed, the underlying evidence as to respondent's history of serious assaultive criminal convictions was fully admissible under Georgia law at the sentencing phase of the trial.

After respondent was arrested for disturbing the peace, he was taken to the police station.  There, without obtaining a warrant and in the process of booking him and inventorying his possessions, the police removed the contents of a shoulder bag respondent had been carrying, and found amphetamine pills.  Respondent was subsequently charged with violating the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, and, at a pretrial hearing, the trial court ordered suppression of the pills.  The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed, holding that the shoulder bag search did not constitute a valid search incident to a lawful arrest or a valid inventory search of respondent's belongings.
Held:  The search of respondent's shoulder bag was a valid inventory search.  Pp.  462 U. S. 643-648.
(a) Consistent with the Fourth Amendment, it is reasonable for police to search the personal effects of a person under lawful arrest as part of the routine administrative procedure at a police station incident to booking and jailing the suspect.  The justification for such searches does not rest on probable cause, and hence the absence of a warrant is immaterial to the reasonableness of the search.  Here, every consideration of orderly police administration -- protection of a suspect's property, deterrence of false claims of theft against the police, security, and identification of the suspect -- benefiting both the police and the public points toward the appropriateness of the examination of respondent's shoulder bag.  Pp.  462 U. S. 643-647.
(b) The fact that the protection of the public and of respondent's property might have been achieved by less intrusive means does not, in itself, render the search unreasonable.  Even if some less intrusive means existed, it would be unreasonable to expect police officers in the everyday course of business to make fine and subtle distinctions in deciding which containers or items may be searched, and which must be sealed without examination as a unit.

Syllabus 
After petitioner Puerto Rican educational officials had demoted respondent school employees and shortly before Puerto Rico's l-year statute of limitations would have expired, a class action was filed in Federal District Court against petitioners on behalf of respondents, asserting claims under 42 U.S.C.  1983 arising out of the demotions.  Subsequently, the District Court denied class certification on the ground that the class was insufficiently numerous.  Respondents then filed individual actions under  1983 asserting the same claims that had been asserted on their behalf in the class action.  Each of the individual actions was filed more than one year after the claims accrued, even excluding the period during which the class action was pending, but less than one year after the denial of class certification.  The individual actions were consolidated, and the District Court entered judgment on the merits for respondents.  The Court of Appeals, while modifying the remedy in some respects, rejected petitioners' argument that respondents' claims were barred by the statute of limitations.  Because there was no federal statute of limitations applicable to  1983 claims, the court looked to Puerto Rican law to determine what the limitations period was, whether that period was tolled, and the effect of the tolling.  The court concluded that, as a matter of Puerto Rican law, the statute of limitations was tolled as to the unnamed plaintiffs during the pendency of the class action, and that the statute of limitations began to run anew when the tolling ceased upon the denial of class certification.
Held:  Respondents' individual actions were timely.  The parties agree that the limitations period was tolled during the pendency of the class action.  The Court of Appeals correctly held that the limitations period began to run anew after the denial of class certification, as provided by Puerto Rican law.  American Pipe & Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538 -- which held that certain federal antitrust treble damages claims were not time-barred under the statute of limitations prescribed in the Clayton Act because the statute had been suspended during the pendency of a related class action -- did not establish a uniform federal rule of decision that mandates suspension, rather than renewal, whenever a federal class action tolls a statute of limitations.  In that case, a particular federal statute provided the basis for deciding that the tolling had 
Page 462 U. S. 651
 the effect of suspending the limitations period.  No question of state law was presented.  In a  1983 action, however, Congress in 42 U.S.C.  1988 has specifically directed the courts, in the absence of controlling federal law, to apply state statutes of limitations and state tolling rules unless they are ""inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.""  Here, the Court of Appeals turned to Puerto Rican law to determine the tolling effect of the class action.  Its decision on this issue is consistent with the rationale of both American Pipe and Board of Regents v. Tomanio, 446 U. S. 478, where it was held that a  1983 claim was barred by New York's statute of limitations, because New York law did not provide for tolling of the statute during the pendency of a related, but independent, cause of action.  Since the application of the Puerto Rican rule gave unnamed class members the same protection as if they had filed actions in their own names which were subsequently dismissed, the federal interest, set forth in American Pipe, in assuring the efficiency and economy of the class action procedure is fully protected.  Until Congress enacts a federal statute of limitations to govern  1983 litigation, federal courts must continue the practice of ""limitations borrowing"" outlined in Tomanio.  Pp.  462 U. S. 655-662.

Syllabus 
Section 703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of the employee's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  Title VII was amended in 1978 by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.  Petitioner employer then amended its health insurance plan to provide its female employees with hospitalization benefits for pregnancy-related conditions to the same extent as for other medical conditions, but the plan provided less extensive pregnancy benefits for spouses of male employees.  Petitioner filed an action in Federal District Court challenging the EEOC's guidelines which indicated that the amended plan was unlawful, and the EEOC in turn filed an action against petitioner alleging discrimination on the basis of sex against male employees in petitioner's provision of hospitalization benefits.  The District Court upheld the lawfulness of petitioner's amended plan and dismissed the EEOC's complaint.  On a consolidated appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The pregnancy limitation in petitioner's amended health plan discriminates against male employees in violation of  703(a)(1).  Pp.  462 U. S. 676-685.
(a) Congress, by enacting the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, not only overturned the holding of General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125, that the exclusion of disabilities caused by pregnancy from an employer's disability plan providing general coverage did not constitute discrimination based on sex, but also rejected the reasoning employed in that case that differential treatment of pregnancy is not gender-based discrimination because only women can become pregnant.  Pp.  462 U. S. 676-682.
(b) The Pregnancy Discrimination Act makes it clear that it is discriminatory to exclude pregnancy coverage from an otherwise inclusive benefits plan.  Thus, petitioner's health plan unlawfully gives married male employees a benefit package for their dependents that is less inclusive than the dependency coverage provided to married female employees.  Pp.  462 U. S. 682-684.
(c) There is no merit to petitioner's argument that the prohibitions of Title VII do not extend to pregnant, spouses because the statute applies only to discrimination in employment.  Since the Pregnancy Discrimination 
Page 462 U. S. 670
 Act makes it clear that discrimination based on pregnancy is, on its face, discrimination based on sex, and since the spouse's sex is always the opposite of the employee's sex, discrimination against female spouses in the provision of fringe benefits is also discrimination against male employees.

When respondent's behavior aroused the suspicion of law enforcement officers as he waited in line at the Miami International Airport to purchase a ticket to New York's La Guardia Airport, the officers approached respondent and requested and received identification.  Respondent consented to a search of the two suitcases he had checked, but, because his flight was about to depart, the officers decided not to search the luggage.  The officers then found some discrepancies in the address tags on the luggage and called Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorities in New York to relay this information.  Upon respondent's arrival at La Guardia Airport, two DEA agents approached him, said that they believed he might be carrying narcotics, and asked for and received identification.  When respondent refused to consent to a search of his luggage, one of the agents told him that they were going to take it to a federal judge to obtain a search warrant.  The agents then took the luggage to Kennedy Airport where it was subjected to a ""sniff test"" by a trained narcotics detection dog which reacted positively to one of the suitcases.  At this point, 90 minutes had elapsed since the seizure of the luggage.  Thereafter, the agents obtained a search warrant for that suitcase and, upon opening it, discovered cocaine.  Respondent was indicted for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and the District Court denied his motion to suppress the contents of the suitcase.  He pleaded guilty to the charge and was convicted, but reserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the prolonged seizure of respondent's luggage exceeded the limits of the type of investigative stop permitted by Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, and hence amounted to a seizure without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
Held:  Under the circumstances, the seizure of respondent's luggage violated the Fourth Amendment.  Accordingly, the evidence obtained from the subsequent search of the luggage was inadmissible, and respondent's conviction must be reversed.  Pp.  462 U. S. 700-710.
(a) When an officer's observations lead him reasonably to believe that a traveler is carrying luggage that contains narcotics, the principles of Terry and its progeny permit the officer to detain the luggage temporarily to investigate the circumstances that aroused the officer's suspicion, 
Page 462 U. S. 697
 provided that the investigative detention is properly limited in scope.  Pp.  462 U. S. 700-706.
(b) The investigative procedure of subjecting luggage to a ""sniff test"" by a well-trained narcotics detection dog does not constitute a ""search"" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  462 U. S. 706-707.
(c) When the police seize luggage from the suspect's custody, the limitations applicable to investigative detentions of the person should define the permissible scope of an investigative detention of the luggage on less than probable cause.  Under this standard, the police conduct here exceeded the permissible limits of a Terry-type investigative stop.  The length of the detention of respondent's luggage alone precludes the conclusion that the seizure was reasonable in the absence of probable cause.  This Fourth Amendment violation was exacerbated by the DEA agents' failure to inform respondent accurately of the place to which they were transporting his luggage, of the length of time he might be dispossessed, and of what arrangements would be made for return of the luggage if the investigation dispelled the suspicion.

 SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA et al.v. CONSUMERS UNION OF the UNITED STATES, INC., et alNo. 82-1301 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 20, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 This petition marks the third occasion this case has been before us. The case arose in 1975 when respondent brought 
Page 462 U.S. 1137 , 1138
 a suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983 alleging that particular provisions of the State Bar Code promulgated by the Virginia Supreme Court violated respondent's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Having prevailed in its 1983 suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Virginia Supreme Court and its Chief Justice (together, the ""Virginia Court""), the issue now is whether respondent is entitled to attorney's fees from that court 1 under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. 1988. This was also the issue we addressed the last time this case came before us, when we vacated an award of attorney's fees against the Virginia Court on the ground that it ""was premised on acts or omissions for which [the Virginia Court] enjoyed absolute legislative immunity."" Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union of the United States, Inc., 446 U.S. 719, 738, 1977 ( 1980) (Consumers Union ). 
 Justice POWELL took no part in the consideration or decision of this petition. 
 On remand, a divided three-judge District Court reinstated the award of attorney's fees against the Virginia court, 505 F.Supp. 822 (ED Va.1981 ), and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 688 F.2d 218 ( CA4 1982). Because I believe that the District Court misinterpreted our opinion in Consumers Union and erred in reinstating the fee award, I would grant certiorari. 
 I

 SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA et al.v. CONSUMERS UNION OF the UNITED STATES, INC., et alNo. 82-1301 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 20, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 This petition marks the third occasion this case has been before us. The case arose in 1975 when respondent brought 
Page 462 U.S. 1137 , 1138
 a suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983 alleging that particular provisions of the State Bar Code promulgated by the Virginia Supreme Court violated respondent's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Having prevailed in its 1983 suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Virginia Supreme Court and its Chief Justice (together, the ""Virginia Court""), the issue now is whether respondent is entitled to attorney's fees from that court 1 under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. 1988. This was also the issue we addressed the last time this case came before us, when we vacated an award of attorney's fees against the Virginia Court on the ground that it ""was premised on acts or omissions for which [the Virginia Court] enjoyed absolute legislative immunity."" Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union of the United States, Inc., 446 U.S. 719, 738, 1977 ( 1980) (Consumers Union ). 
 Justice POWELL took no part in the consideration or decision of this petition. 
 On remand, a divided three-judge District Court reinstated the award of attorney's fees against the Virginia court, 505 F.Supp. 822 (ED Va.1981 ), and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. 688 F.2d 218 ( CA4 1982). Because I believe that the District Court misinterpreted our opinion in Consumers Union and erred in reinstating the fee award, I would grant certiorari.

No. 65, Orig.
Argued March 30, 1983
Decided June 17, 1983
462 U.S. 554

Syllabus 
The Pecos River Compact was entered into by Texas and New Mexico (and approved by Congress) to govern allocation of the waters of the Pecos River, which rises in New Mexico and flows into Texas.  Article III(a) of the Compact requires that New Mexico
""not deplete by man's activities the flow of the Pecos River at the New Mexico-Texas state line below an amount which will give to Texas a quantity of water equivalent to that available to Texas under the 1947 condition.""
The Compact establishes the Pecos River Commission (Commission) -- consisting of one Commissioner from each State and a nonvoting representative of the United States -- and empowers it to make all findings of fact necessary to administer the Compact.  The two voting Commissioners were unable to agree when a dispute arose between the States concerning the methods for determining annual shortfalls of state-line water flow with regard to Texas' right to receive as much water as it would have received under the consumption conditions prevailing in New Mexico in 1947.  Texas filed this action against New Mexico (the United States intervened to protect its claims on the waters of the river), alleging that New Mexico had breached its obligations under Art. III(a) of the Compact and seeking a decree commanding New Mexico to deliver water in accordance with the Compact.  This Court appointed a Special Master, who ultimately filed the report involved here, and the parties filed various exceptions thereto.
Held:
1. Exceptions of the Government and New Mexico to the Master's recommendation that either the United States Commissioner or some other third party be given a vote on the Commission and be empowered to participate in all Commission deliberations are sustained.  Once congressional consent is given to an interstate compact as required by the Compact Clause, the compact is transformed into a law of the United States, and unless the compact is unconstitutional, no court may order relief inconsistent with its express terms.  Here, the Compact provides that the Government Commissioner shall not have the right to vote, and no other third party is given the right to vote on matters before the Commission.  This Court cannot rewrite the Compact so as to provide for a third, tie-breaking vote.  Moreover, the Court's equitable powers have never been exercised so as to appoint quasi-administrative officials 
Page 462 U. S. 555
 to control the division of interstate waters on a day-to-day basis.  Pp.  462 U. S. 564-566.
2. New Mexico's exception to the Master's alternative recommendation to continue the suit as presently postured is overruled, and the recommendation is accepted.  There is no merit to New Mexico's contention that this Court may do nothing more than review the Commission's official actions, and that the case should be dismissed if it is found either that there is no Commission action to review or that actions taken by the Commission were not arbitrary or capricious.  This Court's original jurisdiction to resolve controversies between two States extends to a suit by one State to enforce its compact with another State or to declare rights under a compact.  Here, fundamental structural considerations of the Compact militate against New Mexico's theory, since, if all questions under the Compact had to be decided by the Commission in the first instance, New Mexico could indefinitely prevent authoritative Commission action solely by exercising its veto on the Commission.  Nor do the Compact's express terms constitute the Commission as the sole arbiter of disputes over New Mexico's Art. III obligations.  Moreover, if authorized representatives of the compacting States have reached an agreement on action to be taken by the Commission, this Court will not review the Commission's action at the behest of one of the States absent extraordinary cause or a precise mandate from Congress.  Pp.  462 U. S. 566-571.
3. Texas' exception to the Master's recommendation against approval of Texas' motion to adopt a so-called ""Double Mass Analysis"" method for determining when a shortfall in state-line flows has occurred is overruled.  The Compact provides that, until the Commission adopts a more feasible method, an ""inflow-outflow method"" shall be used to measure state-line shortfalls.  The ""Double Mass Analysis"" is not close enough to what the Compact terms an ""inflow-outflow method, as described in the Report of the Engineering Advisory Committee"" to make it acceptable for use in determining New Mexico's compliance with its Art. III obligations.  While the Compact leaves the Commission free to adopt the ""Double Mass Analysis,"" this Court may not apply it against New Mexico in the absence of Commission action.  Pp.  462 U. S. 571-574.
Exceptions to Special Master's report sustained in part and overruled in part.

462 U.S. 579

Syllabus 
Title 19 U.S.C.  1581(a) authorizes customs officers to board any vessel at any time and at any place in the United States to examine the vessel's manifest and other documents.  Customs officers, while patroling a ship channel which connects the Gulf of Mexico with Lake Charles, La., a Customs Port of Entry, sighted an anchored, 40-foot sailboat.  The wake of a passing vessel caused the sailboat to rock violently, and when one of the two respondents, who were aboard the vessel, shrugged his shoulders in an unresponsive manner when asked if the sailboat and crew were all right, one of the customs officers, accompanied by a Louisiana State Police officer, boarded the sailboat and asked to see the vessel's documentation.  While examining a document, the customs officer smelled what he thought to be burning marihuana and, looking through an open hatch, saw burlap-wrapped bales that proved to be marihauna.  Respondents were then arrested and given Miranda warnings, and a subsequent search revealed more marihuana stored throughout the vessel.  Upon trial in Federal District Court, respondents were convicted of various federal drug offenses, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the officers' boarding of the sailboat violated the Fourth Amendment because the boarding occurred in the absence of ""a reasonable suspicion of a law violation.""
Held:  The action of the customs officers in boarding the sailboat pursuant to  1581(a) was ""reasonable,"" and was therefore consistent with the Fourth Amendment.  Although no Act of Congress can authorize a violation of the Constitution, in 1790, in a lineal ancestor to  1581(a), the First Congress clearly authorized the suspicionless boarding of vessels by Government officers, reflecting its view that such boardings are not contrary to the Fourth Amendment, which was promulgated by the same Congress.

462 U.S. 611

Syllabus 
In 1960, the Cuban Government established respondent to serve as an official autonomous credit institution for foreign trade, with full juridical capacity of its own.  Respondent sought to collect on a letter of credit issued by petitioner bank in respondent's favor in support of a contract for delivery of Cuban sugar to a buyer in the United States.  Shortly thereafter, all of petitioner's assets in Cuba were seized and nationalized by the Cuban Government.  When respondent brought suit on the letter of credit in Federal District Court, petitioner counterclaimed, asserting a right to set off the value of its seized Cuban assets.  After the suit was brought, but before petitioner filed its counterclaim, respondent was dissolved and its capital was split between Banco Nacional, Cuba's central bank, and certain foreign trade enterprises or houses of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade.  Rejecting respondent's contention that its separate juridical status shielded it from liability for the acts of the Cuban Government, the District Court held that, since the value of petitioner's Cuban assets exceeded respondent's claim, the setoff could be granted in petitioner's favor, and therefore dismissed the complaint.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent was not an alter ego of the Cuban Government for the purpose of petitioner's counterclaim.
Held:  Under principles of equity common to international law and federal common law, petitioner may apply the claimed setoff, notwithstanding the fact that respondent was established as a separate juridical entity.  Pp.  462 U. S. 619-633.
(a) The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 does not control the determination of whether petitioner may apply the setoff.  That Act was not intended to affect the substantive law determining the liability of a foreign state or instrumentality, or the attribution of liability among such instrumentalities.  Pp.  462 U. S. 619-621.
(b) Duly created instrumentalities of a foreign state are to be accorded a presumption of independent status.  This presumption may be overcome, however, where giving effect to the corporate form would permit a foreign state to be the sole beneficiary of a claim pursued in United States courts while escaping liability to the opposing party imposed by international law.  Pp.  462 U. S. 623-630. 
Page 462 U. S. 612

(c) Thus, here, giving effect to respondent's juridical status, even though it has long been dissolved, would permit the real beneficiary of such an action, the Cuban Government, to obtain relief in our courts that it could not obtain in its own right without waiving its sovereign immunity and answering for the seizure of petitioner's assets in violation of international law.  The corporate form will not be blindly adhered to where doing so would cause such an injustice.  Having dissolved respondent and transferred its assets to entities that may be held liable on petitioner's counterclaim, Cuba cannot escape liability for acts in violation of international law simply by retransferring assets to separate juridical entities.  To hold otherwise would permit governments to avoid the requirements of international law simply by creating juridical entities whenever the need arises.  Pp.  462 U. S. 630-633.

462 U.S. 393

Syllabus 
Acting on unfair labor practice charges filed by an employee of respondent, petitioner National Labor Relations Board found that respondent had discharged the employee, a bus driver, for his union activities, in violation of  8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act.  The Board applied its rule that the General Counsel has the burden of persuading the Board by a preponderance of the evidence that an antiunion animus contributed to the employer's decision to discharge the employee, and the employer can avoid the conclusion that it violated the Act by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee would have been fired for permissible reasons even if he had not been involved in protected union activities.  The Board concluded that respondent failed to carry its burden of persuading the Board that the employee's discharge would have taken place, even if he had not been engaged in protected union activities, because of his practice of leaving his keys in the bus and taking unauthorized breaks.  The Court of Appeals refused to enforce the Board's order, based on its view that it was error to place the burden on the employer, and that the General Counsel carried the burden of proving not only that a forbidden motivation contributed to the discharge but also that the discharge would not have taken place independently of the employee's protected conduct.
Held:
1. The burden of proof placed on the employer under the Board's rule is consistent with  8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3), as well as with  10(c) of the Act, which provides that the Board must find an unfair labor practice by a ""preponderance of the testimony.""  The Board's construction of the statute, which is not mandated by the Act, extends to the employer what the Board considers to be an affirmative defense, but does not change or add to the elements of the unfair labor practice that the General Counsel has the burden of proving under  10(c).  This is a permissible construction, and the Board's allocation of the burden of proof is reasonable.  Cf. Mt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274.  Pp.  462 U. S. 397-404.
2. The Board was justified in this case in finding that the employee would not have been discharged had respondent not considered his protected

 activities.  Such finding was supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.   462 U. S.  404-405.

Syllabus 
A corporation in Illinois, operated by Roger Smith, sold a new airplane to respondents, who paid the sale price in full and took possession of the plane.  Smith, however, did not give respondents the original bills of sale reflecting the plane's chain of title, but gave them only photocopies and an assurance that he would ""take care of the paperwork.""  Subsequently, Smith purported to sell the plane to petitioner, giving it the title documents, which petitioner's financing bank later recorded with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  Respondents filed an action in Federal District Court to determine title to the plane.  Petitioner argued that it had title because respondents never recorded their interest in the plane with the FAA, relying on  503(c) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, which provides that ""[n]o conveyance or instrument"" affecting title to civil aircraft shall be valid against third parties not having actual notice of the sale, until such conveyance or instrument is recorded with the FAA.  But the District Court awarded summary judgment in respondents' favor, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that  503(c) did not preempt Illinois state law under which no documentation for a valid transfer of an aircraft is required and an oral sale is valid against third parties once the buyer takes possession of the aircraft.
Held:  State laws, such as the Illinois law, allowing undocumented or unrecorded transfers of interests in aircraft to affect innocent third parties are preempted by the federal Act.  Although if  503(c) were interpreted literally in accordance with the federal Act's definition of ""conveyance"" -- ""a bill of sale, contract of conditional sale, mortgage, assignment of mortgage, or other instrument affecting title to, or interest in, property"" -- it would invalidate only unrecorded title instruments, and not unrecorded title transfers, thus enabling a claimant to establish title against an innocent third party without relying on an instrument, it is apparent that Congress did not intend  503(c) to be interpreted in this manner.  Rather,  503(c) means that every aircraft transfer must be evidenced by an instrument, and every such instrument must be recorded before the rights of innocent third parties can be affected.  Because of these requirements, state laws permitting undocumented or unrecorded transfers are preempted, for there is a direct conflict between  503(c) and such state laws.  These conclusions are dictated by the federal 
Page 462 U. S. 407
 Act's legislative history.  Any other construction would defeat Congress' purpose in enacting  503(c) of creating a ""central clearing house"" for recordation of title so that a person could have ""ready access"" to information about an aircraft's title.  Pp.  462 U. S. 409-414.

Syllabus 
An Akron, Ohio, ordinance, inter alia, (1) requires all abortions performed after the first trimester of pregnancy to be performed in a hospital ( 1870.03); (2) prohibits a physician from performing an abortion on an unmarried minor under the age of 15 unless he obtains the consent of one of her parents or unless the minor obtains an order from a court having jurisdiction over her that the abortion be performed ( 1870.05(B)); (3) requires that the attending physician inform his patient of the status of her pregnancy, the development of her fetus, the date of possible viability, the physical and emotional complications that may result from an abortion, and the availability of agencies to provide her with assistance and information with respect to birth control, adoption, and childbirth ( 1870.06(B)), and also inform her of the particular risks associated with her pregnancy and the abortion technique to be employed ( 1870.06(C)); (4) prohibits a physician from performing an abortion until 24 hours after the pregnant woman signs a consent form ( 1870.07); and (5) requires physicians performing abortions to ensure that fetal remains are disposed of in a ""humane and sanitary manner"" ( 1870.16).  A violation of the ordinance is punishable as a misdemeanor.  Respondents and cross-petitioners filed an action in Federal District Court against petitioners and cross-respondents, challenging the ordinance.  The District Court invalidated   1870.05(B),  1870.06(B), and  1870.16, but upheld   1870.03,  1870.06(C), and  1870.07.  The Court of Appeals affirmed as to   1870.03,  1870.05(B),  1870.06(B), and  1870.16, but reversed as to   1870.06(C) and  1870.07.
Held:
1. Section 1870.03 is unconstitutional.  Pp.  462 U. S. 431-439.
(a) While a State's interest in health regulation becomes compelling at approximately the end of the first trimester, the State's regulation may be upheld only if it is reasonably designed to further that interest.  If, during a substantial portion of the second trimester, the State's regulation 
Page 462 U. S. 417
 departs from accepted medical practice, it may not be upheld simply because it may be reasonable for the remaining portion of the trimester.  Rather, the State is obligated to make a reasonable effort to limit the effect of its regulations to the period in the trimester during which its health interest may be furthered.  Pp.  462 U. S. 433-434.
(b) It cannot be said that the lines drawn in  1870.03 are reasonable.  By preventing the performance of dilatation-and-evacuation abortions in an appropriate nonhospital setting, Akron has imposed a heavy and unnecessary burden on women's access to a relatively inexpensive, otherwise accessible, and safe abortion procedure.  Section 1870.03 has the effect of inhibiting the vast majority of abortions after the first trimester, and therefore unreasonably infringes upon a woman's constitutional right to obtain an abortion.  Pp.  462 U. S. 434-439.
2. Section 1870.05(B) is unconstitutional as making a blanket determination that all minors under the age of 15 are too immature to make an abortion decision, or that an abortion never may be in the minor's best interests without parental approval.  Under circumstances where the Ohio statute governing juvenile proceedings does not mention minors' abortions nor suggest that the Ohio Juvenile Court has authority to inquire into a minor's maturity or emancipation,  1870.05(B), as applied in juvenile proceedings, is not reasonably susceptible of being construed to create an opportunity for case-by-case evaluations of the maturity of pregnant minors.  Pp.  462 U. S. 439-442.
3. Sections  1870.06(B) and  1870.06(C) are unconstitutional.  Pp.  462 U. S. 442-449.
(a) The validity of an informed consent requirement rests on the State's interest in protecting the pregnant woman's health.  But this does not mean that a State has unreviewable authority to decide what information a woman must be given before she chooses to have an abortion.  A State may not adopt regulations designed to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.  Pp.  462 U. S. 442-444.
(b) Section 1870.06(B) attempts to extend the State's interest in ensuring ""informed consent"" beyond permissible limits, and intrudes upon the discretion of the pregnant woman's physician.  While a State may require a physician to make certain that his patient understands the physical and emotional implications of having an abortion,  1870.06(B) goes far beyond merely describing the general subject matter relevant to informed consent.  By insisting upon recitation of a lengthy and inflexible list of information, the section unreasonably has placed obstacles in the path of the physician.  Pp.  462 U. S. 444-445.
(c) With respect to  1870.06(C)'s requirement that the ""attending physician"" must inform the woman of the specified information, it is unreasonable for a State to insist that only a physician is competent to 
Page 462 U. S. 418
 provide the information and counseling relevant to informed consent.  Pp.  462 U. S. 446-449.
4. Section 1870.07 is unconstitutional.  Akron has failed to demonstrate that any legitimate state interest is furthered by an arbitrary and inflexible waiting period.  There is no evidence that the abortion procedure will be performed more safely.  Nor does it appear that the State's legitimate concern that the woman's decision be informed is reasonably served by requiring a 24-hour delay as a matter of course.  Pp.  462 U. S. 449-451.
5. Section 1870.16 violates the Due Process Clause by failing to give a physician fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden.  Pp.  462 U. S. 451-452.

Syllabus 
Missouri statutes require abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy to be performed in a hospital ( 188.025); require a pathology report for each abortion performed ( 188.047); require the presence of a second physician during abortions performed after viability ( 188.030.3); and require minors to secure parental consent or consent from the Juvenile Court for an abortion ( 188.028).  In an action challenging the constitutionality of these provisions, the District Court invalidated all provisions except  188.047.  The Court of Appeals reversed as to  188.028 and  188.047 but affirmed as to  188.030.3 and  188.025.
Held:  Section 188.025 is unconstitutional, but  188.047, 188.030.3, and 188.028 are constitutional.
664 F.2d 687, affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the second trimester hospitalization requirement of  188.025 ""unreasonably infringes upon a woman's constitutional right to obtain an abortion.""  Akron v. Akron Center of Reproductive Health, Inc., ante at  462 U. S. 439.   462 U. S.  481-482.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, concluded in Parts III, IV, and V that:
1. The second physician requirement of  188.030.3 is constitutional as reasonably furthering the State's compelling interest in protecting the lives of viable fetuses.  Pp.  462 U. S. 482-486.
2. The pathology report requirement of  188.047 is constitutional.  On its face and in effect, such requirement is reasonably related to generally accepted medical standards, and furthers important health-related state concerns.  In light of the substantial benefits that a pathologist's examination can have, the small additional cost of such an examination does not significantly burden a pregnant woman's abortion decision.  Pp.  462 U. S. 486-490

3. Section 188.028 is constitutional.  A State's interest in protecting immature minors will sustain a requirement of a consent substitute, either parental or judicial.  And as interpreted by the Court of Appeals to mean that the Juvenile Court cannot deny a minor's application for consent to an abortion ""for good cause"" unless the court first finds that the minor was not mature enough to make her own decision,  188.028 provides a judicial alternative that is consistent with established legal standards.

3. Assuming, arguendo, that the State cannot impose a parental veto on a minor's decision to undergo an abortion, the parental consent provision of  188.028.2 is constitutional because it imposes no undue burden on any right that a minor may have to undergo an abortion.  P.  462 U. S. 505.

No. 81-1255
Argued November 30, 1982
Decided June 15, 1983*
462 U.S. 476

Syllabus 
Missouri statutes require abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy to be performed in a hospital ( 188.025); require a pathology report for each abortion performed ( 188.047); require the presence of a second physician during abortions performed after viability ( 188.030.3); and require minors to secure parental consent or consent from the Juvenile Court for an abortion ( 188.028).  In an action challenging the constitutionality of these provisions, the District Court invalidated all provisions except  188.047.  The Court of Appeals reversed as to  188.028 and  188.047 but affirmed as to  188.030.3 and  188.025.
Held:  Section 188.025 is unconstitutional, but  188.047, 188.030.3, and 188.028 are constitutional.
664 F.2d 687, affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the second trimester hospitalization requirement of  188.025 ""unreasonably infringes upon a woman's constitutional right to obtain an abortion.""  Akron v. Akron Center of Reproductive Health, Inc., ante at  462 U. S. 439.   462 U. S.  481-482.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, concluded in Parts III, IV, and V that:
1. The second physician requirement of  188.030.3 is constitutional as reasonably furthering the State's compelling interest in protecting the lives of viable fetuses.  Pp.  462 U. S. 482-486.
2. The pathology report requirement of  188.047 is constitutional.  On its face and in effect, such requirement is reasonably related to generally accepted medical standards, and furthers important health-related state concerns.  In light of the substantial benefits that a pathologist's examination can have, the small additional cost of such an examination does not significantly burden a pregnant woman's abortion decision.  Pp.  462 U. S. 486-490

No. 81-185
Argued November 30, 1982
Decided June 15, 1983
462 U.S. 506

Syllabus 
Appellant, an obstetrician-gynecologist, was convicted after a Virginia state court trial for violating Virginia statutory provisions that make it unlawful to perform an abortion during the second trimester of pregnancy outside of a licensed hospital.  ""Hospital"" is defined to include outpatient hospitals, and State Department of Health regulations define ""outpatient hospital"" as including institutions that primarily furnish facilities for the performance of surgical procedures on outpatients.  The regulations also provide that second trimester abortions may be performed in an outpatient surgical clinic licensed as a ""hospital"" by the State.  The evidence at appellant's trial established, inter alia, that he performed a second trimester abortion on an unmarried minor by an injection of saline solution at his unlicensed clinic; that the minor understood appellant to agree to her plan to deliver the fetus in a motel, and did not recall being advised to go to a hospital when labor began, although such advice was included in an instruction sheet provided her by appellant; and that the minor, alone in a motel, aborted her fetus 48 hours after the saline injection.  The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed appellant's conviction.
Held:
1. The Virginia abortion statute was not unconstitutionally applied to appellant on the asserted ground that the State failed to allege in the indictment and to prove lack of medical necessity for the abortion.  Under the authoritative construction of the statute by the Virginia Supreme Court, the prosecution was not obligated to prove lack of medical necessity beyond a reasonable doubt until appellant invoked medical necessity as a defense.  Placing upon the defendant the burden of going forward with evidence on an affirmative defense is normally permissible.  And appellant's contention that the prosecution failed to prove that his acts in fact caused the fetus' death is meritless, in view of the undisputed facts proved at trial.  P.  462 U. S. 510.
2. Virginia's requirement that second trimester abortions be performed in licensed outpatient clinics is not an unreasonable means of furthering the State's important and legitimate interest in protecting the woman's health, which interest becomes ""compelling"" at approximately the end of the first trimester.  In Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive 
Page 462 U. S. 507
 Health, Inc., ante p.  462 U. S. 416, and Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, ante p.  462 U. S. 476, constitutional challenges were upheld with regard to requirements mandating that all second trimester abortions be performed in ""general, acute-care facilities.""  In contrast, the Virginia statutes and regulations do not require that such abortions be performed exclusively in full-service hospitals, but permit their performance at licensed outpatient clinics.  Thus, the decisions in Akron and Ashcroft are not controlling here.  Although a State's discretion in determining standards for the licensing of medical facilities does not permit it to adopt abortion regulations that depart from accepted medical practice, the Virginia regulations on their face are compatible with accepted medical standards governing outpatient second trimester abortions.

Syllabus 
Respondent was injured in the course of his employment while employed by petitioner as a loading helper on petitioner's coal barge in Pennsylvania.  The injury made respondent permanently unable to return to his job or to perform other than light work.  Respondent brought an action in Federal District Court against petitioner, alleging that his injury had been ""caused by the negligence of the vessel"" within the meaning of  5(b) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA).  The District Court found in respondent's favor and awarded damages of $275,881.31, holding that receipt of compensation from petitioner under  4 of the LHWCA did not bar a separate recovery of damages for negligence.  In calculating the damages, the court did not increase the award to take inflation into account nor did it discount the award to reflect the present value of the future stream of income.  Instead, the court followed a decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which had held ""as a matter of law that future inflation shall be presumed equal to future interest rates with these factors offsetting.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. A longshoreman may bring a negligence action under  5(b) against the owner of a vessel who acts as his own stevedore, even though the longshoreman has received compensation from the owner-employer under  4.  The plain language of  5(a), which provides that the liability of an employer for compensation prescribed in  4 ""shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such an employer to the employee,"" appears to support petitioner's contention that since, as respondent's employer, it had paid compensation to him under  4,  5(a) absolves it of all other responsibility to respondent for damages.  But such contention is undermined by the plain language of  5(b), which authorizes a longshoreman whose injury is caused by the negligence of a vessel to bring a separate action against such a vessel as a third party, unless the injury was caused by the negligence of persons engaged in providing stevedoring services to the vessel.  If  6(a) had been intended to bar all negligence suits against owner-employers, there would have been no need to put an additional sentence in  5(b) barring suits against owner-employers 
Page 462 U. S. 524
 for injuries caused by fellow servants.  And the history of the LHWCA further refutes the contention that  5(a) bars respondent's suit under  5(b).  Pp.  462 U. S. 528-532.
2. The District Court, in performing its damages calculation, erred in applying the theory of the Pennsylvania decision as a mandatory federal rule of decision.  Pp. 533-553.
(a) The two elements that determine the calculation of a damages award to a permanently injured employee in an inflation-free economy are the amount that the employee would have earned during each year that he could have been expected to work after the injury, and the appropriate discount rate, reflecting the safest available investment.  Pp.  462 U. S. 533-538.
(b) In an inflationary economy, inflation should ideally affect both stages of the calculation described above.  This Court, however, will not at this time select one of the many rules proposed by the litigants and amici in this case and establish it for all time as the exclusive method in all federal courts for calculating an award for lost earnings in an inflationary economy.  First, by its very nature, the calculation of an award for lost earnings must be a rough approximation.  Second, sustained price inflation can make the award substantially less precise.  And third, the question of lost earnings can arise in many different contexts.  Pp.  462 U. S. 538-547.
(c) Respondent's cause of action is rooted in federal maritime law, and thus the fact that Pennsylvania has adopted the total offset rule for all negligence cases in that forum is not of controlling importance in this case.  Moreover, the reasons that may support the adoption of the rule for a State's entire judicial system are not necessarily applicable to the special class of workers covered by the LHWCA.  P.  462 U. S. 547.
(d) In calculating an award for a longshoreman's lost earnings caused by a vessel's negligence, the discount rate should be chosen on the basis of the factors that are used to estimate the lost stream of future earnings.  If the trier of fact relies on a specific forecast of the future rate of price inflation, and if the estimated lost stream of future earnings is calculated to include price inflation along with individual factors and other societal factors, then the proper discount rate would be the after-tax market interest rate.  But since specific forecasts of future price inflation remain too unreliable to be useful in many cases, it will normally be a costly and ultimately unproductive waste of longshoremen's resources to make such forecasts the centerpiece of litigation under  5(b).  On the other hand, if forecasts of future price inflation are not used, it is necessary to choose an appropriate below-market discount rate.  As long as inflation continues, the amount of the ""offset"" against the market rate should be chosen on the basis of the same factors that are used to 
Page 462 U. S. 525
 estimate the lost stream of future earnings.  If full account is taken of the individual and societal factors (excepting price inflation) that can be expected to have resulted in wage increases, then all that should be set off against the market interest rate is an estimate of future price inflation.  Pp.  462 U. S. 547-549.
(e) On remand, whatever rate the District Court may choose to discount the estimated stream of future earnings, it must make a deliberate choice, rather than assuming that it is bound by a rule of state law.  Pp.  462 U. S. 552-553.

Respondent Navy enlisted men brought an action for damages and other relief in Federal District Court against petitioner superior officers, alleging that petitioners in making duty assignments and performance evaluations and in imposing penalties had discriminated against respondents because of their race in violation of their constitutional rights.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the actions complained of were nonreviewable military decisions, that petitioners were entitled to immunity, and that respondents had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Enlisted military personnel may not maintain a suit to recover damages from a superior officer for alleged constitutional violations.  The special status of the military has required, the Constitution has contemplated, Congress has created, and this Court has long recognized two systems of justice:  one for civilians and one for military personnel.  The need for unhesitating and decisive action by military officers and equally disciplined responses by enlisted personnel would be undermined by a judicially created remedy exposing officers to personal liability at the hands of those they are charged to command.  Moreover, Congress, the constitutionally authorized source of authority over the military system of justice, has not provided a damages remedy for claims by military personnel that constitutional rights have been violated by superior officers. Any action to provide a judicial response by way of such a remedy would be inconsistent with Congress' authority.  Taken together, the unique disciplinary structure of the military establishment and Congress' activity in the field constitute ""special factors"" which dictate that it would be inappropriate to provide enlisted military personnel a Bivens-type remedy against their superior officers.

Syllabus 
A Virginia trial court accepted respondent's plea of guilty to a charge of manufacturing a controlled substance.  At the hearing at which respondent pleaded guilty, one of petitioner police officers gave a brief account of the search of respondent's apartment that led to the discovery of material typically used in manufacturing the controlled substance.  Thereafter, respondent brought a damages action under 42 U.S.C.1983 in Federal District Court against petitioners, officers who participated in the search of his apartment, alleging that his Fourth Amendment rights had been violated.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners on the ground that respondent's guilty plea to the criminal charge barred his  1983 claim.  The Court of Appeals reversed in pertinent part and remanded.
Held:
1. The  1983 action is not barred on the asserted ground that, under principles of collateral estoppel generally applied by the Virginia courts, respondent's conviction would bar his subsequent civil challenge to police conduct, and that a federal court must therefore give the state conviction the same effect under 28 U.S.C.  1738, which generally requires federal courts to give preclusive effect to state court judgments if the courts of the State from which the judgments emerged would do so.  Under collateral estoppel rules applied by Virginia courts, unless an issue was actually litigated and determined in the prior judicial proceeding, it will not be treated as final for purposes of the later action.  Furthermore, under Virginia law, collateral estoppel precludes litigation of only those issues necessary to support the judgment entered in the first action.  Thus, the collateral estoppel doctrine would not be invoked in this case by Virginia courts for at least three reasons.  First, the legality of the search of respondent's apartment was not litigated in the criminal proceedings.  Second, the criminal proceedings did not decide against respondent any issue on which he must prevail in order to establish his 1983 claim, the only question determined by the guilty plea being whether respondent unlawfully engaged in the manufacture of a controlled substance.  This question is irrelevant to the legality of the search or to respondent's right to compensation from state officials under 
Page 462 U. S. 307
  1983.  Finally, none of the issues in the  1983 action could have been ""necessarily"" determined in the criminal proceeding.  A determination as to whether or not the search of respondent's apartment was legal would have been entirely irrelevant in the context of the guilty plea proceeding.  Pp.  462 U. S. 312-317.
2. Nor is litigation of respondent's  1983 damages claim barred on the asserted ground that, because he had an opportunity to raise his Fourth Amendment claim in the criminal prosecution, by pleading guilty, he should be deemed to have either admitted the legality of the search or waived any Fourth Amendment claim.  The guilty plea in no way constituted an admission that the search of his apartment was proper under the Fourth Amendment.  It may not be assumed that a guilty plea is based on a defendant's determination that he would be unable to prevail on a motion to suppress evidence, since a decision to plead guilty may have any number of other motivations.  Cf. Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U. S. 258,  411 U. S. 263,  411 U. S. 268.  Similarly, although a guilty plea results in the defendant's loss of any meaningful opportunity he might otherwise have had in the criminal proceeding to challenge the admissibility of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, it does not follow that a guilty plea is a ""waiver"" of antecedent Fourth Amendment claims that may be given effect outside the confines of the criminal proceeding.  And while a Fourth Amendment claim ordinarily may not be raised in a habeas corpus proceeding following a guilty plea, that conclusion does not rest on any notion of waiver, but rests on the fact that the claim is irrelevant to the constitutional validity of the conviction.  Thus, the justifications for denying habeas review of Fourth Amendment claims following a guilty plea are inapplicable to an action under  1983.  Adoption of a rule of preclusion in this case would threaten important interests in preserving federal courts as an available forum for the vindication of constitutional rights.  Pp.  462 U. S. 317-323.
667 F.2d 1133, affirmed.
MARSHALL, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

No. 82-331
Argued April 19, 1983
Decided June 13, 1983
462 U.S. 324

Syllabus 
With extensive federal assistance, respondent Indian Tribe has established a comprehensive scheme for managing the fish and wildlife resources on its reservation in New Mexico.  Federally approved tribal ordinances regulate in detail the conditions under which both members of the Tribe and nonmembers may hunt and fish.  New Mexico has hunting and fishing regulations that conflict with, and in some instances are more restrictive than, the tribal regulations, and the State has applied its regulations to hunting and fishing by nonmembers on the reservation.  The Tribe filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking to prevent the State from regulating on-reservation hunting and fishing.  The District Court ruled in the Tribe's favor and granted declaratory and injunctive relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The application of New Mexico's laws to on-reservation hunting and fishing by nonmembers of the Tribe is preempted by the operation of federal law.  Pp.  462 U. S. 330-344.
(a) The exercise of concurrent jurisdiction by the State would effectively nullify the Tribe's unquestioned authority to regulate the use of its resources by members and nonmembers, would interfere with the comprehensive tribal regulatory scheme, and would threaten Congress' overriding objective of encouraging tribal self-government and economic development.  Pp.  462 U. S. 338-341.
(b) The State has failed to identify any interests that would justify the assertion of concurrent regulatory authority.  Any financial interest that the State might have by way of revenues from the sale of licenses to nonmembers who hunt or fish on the reservation or matching federal funds based on the number of state licenses sold is insufficient justification, especially where the loss of such revenues is likely to be insubstantial.  Pp.  462 U. S. 341-343.

462 U.S. 345

Syllabus 
Respondent, a Negro male, after being discharged by petitioner employer in 1977, filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which, on November 9, 1978, upon finding no reasonable cause to believe the charge was true, sent respondent a Notice of Right to Sue pursuant to  706(f) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Previously, while respondent's charge was still pending before the EEOC, two other Negro males formerly employed by petitioner had filed a class action against petitioner in Federal District Court, alleging employment discrimination and purporting to represent a class of which respondent was a member.  Subsequently, on September 4, 1980, the District Court denied the named plaintiffs' motion for class certification, and the action then proceeded as an individual action.  Within 90 days thereafter, but almost two years after receiving his Notice of Right to Sue, respondent filed an action under Title VII against petitioner in Federal District Court, alleging that his discharge was racially motivated.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner on the ground that respondent had failed to file his action within 90 days of receiving his Notice of Right to Sue as required by  706(f)(1).  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The filing of the class action tolled the statute of limitations for respondent and other members of the putative class.  Since respondent did not receive his Notice of Right to Sue until after the class action was filed, he retained a full 90 days in which to bring suit after class certification was denied, and hence his suit was timely filed.  Pp.  462 U. S. 349-354.
(a) While American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538, concerned only intervenors in a class action, the holding of that case -- that the filing of a class action tolls the running of the applicable statute of limitations for all asserted members of the class -- is to be read as not being limited to intervenors, but as extending to class members filing separate actions.  Otherwise, class members would be led to file individual actions prior to denial of class certification in order to preserve their rights.  The result would be a needless multiplicity of actions -- precisely the situation that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and the tolling rule of American Pipe were designed to avoid.  Pp.  462 U. S. 349-351.
(b) Failure to apply American Pipe to class members filing separate actions would also be inconsistent with this Court's reliance on American 
Page 462 U. S. 346
 Pipe in Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, where it was held that Rule 23(c)(2) required individual notice to class members so that each of them could decide whether to ""opt out"" of the class and thereby preserve his right to pursue his own lawsuit.  A class member would be unable to pursue his own lawsuit if the limitations period had expired while the class action was pending.  Pp.  462 U. S. 351-352.
(c) A tolling rule for class actions is not inconsistent with the purposes served by statutes of limitations of putting defendants on notice of adverse claims and of preventing plaintiffs from sleeping on their rights.  These ends are met when a class action is filed.  Class members who do not file suit while the class action is pending cannot be accused of sleeping on their rights.  And a class complaint notifies the defendants not only of the claims against them, but also of the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs.  Pp.  462 U. S. 352-353.
(d) Once the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all putative members of the class, it remains suspended until class certification is denied.  Pp.  462 U. S. 353-354.

A provision of the Bank Robbery Act, 18 U.S.C.  2113(b), imposes criminal sanctions on
""[w]hoever takes and carries away, with intent to steal or purloin, any property or money or any other thing of value exceeding $100 belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of any bank, credit union, or any savings and loan association.""
Petitioner opened an account at a savings and loan institution using his own name, but giving a false address, birth date, and social security number.  Later that day, at another branch, he deposited into his account a third party's $10,000 check on which the endorsement had been altered to show petitioner's account number.  Subsequently petitioner closed his account and was paid the total balance in cash.  He was convicted of violating  2113(b) after trial in Federal District Court.  The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed, concluding that the statute embraces all felonious takings -- including obtaining money under false pretenses.
Held:  Section 2113(b) is not limited to common law larceny, but also proscribes petitioner's crime of obtaining money under false pretenses.  Pp.  462 U. S. 358-362.
(a) The statutory language does not suggest that it covers only common law larceny.  The language ""takes and carries away"" is traditional common law language, but represents only one element of common law larceny.  It is entirely consistent with false pretenses, although not a necessary element of that crime.  Moreover, other language of  2113(b) shows an intention to go beyond common law larceny.  Section 2113(b) does not apply to a case of false pretenses in which there is not a taking and carrying away, but it proscribes petitioner's conduct here.  Pp.  462 U. S. 360-361.
(b) The legislative history of  2113(b) also suggests that Congress intended the statute to reach petitioner's conduct.  The congressional purpose was to protect banks from those who wished to steal banks' assets -- even if they used no force in doing so.  Pp.  462 U. S. 361-362.

462 U.S. 367

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an aerospace engineer employed at the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, a facility operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), made a number of public statements to the news media highly critical of the Center.  Subsequently, respondent Director of the Center demoted petitioner for making the public statements on the ground that they were false and misleading.  The Federal Employee Appeals Authority upheld the demotion, but the Civil Service Commission's Appeals Review Board, upon reopening the proceeding at petitioner's request, found that the demotion had violated his First Amendment rights.  NASA accepted the Board's recommendation that petitioner be restored to his former position retroactively and that he receive backpay.  While his administrative appeal from the demotion was pending, petitioner filed an action against respondent in an Alabama state court, seeking to recover damages for violation of his First Amendment rights.  Respondent removed the action to Federal District Court, which granted summary judgment for respondent.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that petitioner had no cause of action for damages under the First Amendment for retaliatory demotion in view of the available remedies under the Civil Service Commission regulations.
Held:  Because petitioner's claims arise out of an employment relationship that is governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions giving meaningful remedies against the United States, it would be inappropriate for this Court to supplement that regulatory scheme with a new nonstatutory damages remedy.  Pp.  462 U. S. 374-390.
(a) The federal courts' statutory jurisdiction to decide federal questions confers adequate power to award damages to the victim of a constitutional violation even if Congress has not expressly authorized such a remedy.  When Congress provides an alternative remedy, it may indicate its intent that this power should not be exercised.  In the absence of such a congressional directive, the federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is inpropriate for a common law tribunal, paying particular heed, however, to any special factors counseling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.  Pp.  462 U. S. 374-380.
(b) The Government's comprehensive scheme protecting civil servants against arbitrary action by supervisors provides meaningful remedies for 
Page 462 U. S. 368
 employees who may have been unfairly disciplined for making critical comments about their agencies.  Given the history of the development of civil service remedies and the comprehensive nature of the remedies currently available, the question in this case is not what remedy the court should provide for a wrong that would otherwise go unredressed, but whether an elaborate remedial system that has been constructed step by step, with careful attention to policy considerations, should be augmented by the creation of a new judicial remedy for the constitutional violation at issue.  This Court declines to create such a remedy, because Congress is in a better position to decide whether or not the public interest would be served by creating it.  Pp.  462 U. S. 380-390.
647 F.2d 573, affirmed.

Marshall Space Flight Center, a facility operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), made a number of public statements to the news media highly critical of the Center.  Subsequently, respondent Director of the Center demoted petitioner for making the public statements on the ground that they were false and misleading.  The Federal Employee Appeals Authority upheld the demotion, but the Civil Service Commission's Appeals Review Board, upon reopening the proceeding at petitioner's request, found that the demotion had violated his First Amendment rights.  NASA accepted the Board's recommendation that petitioner be restored to his former position retroactively and that he receive backpay.  While his administrative appeal from the demotion was pending, petitioner filed an action against respondent in an Alabama state court, seeking to recover damages for violation of his First Amendment rights.  Respondent removed the action to Federal District Court, which granted summary judgment for respondent.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that petitioner had no cause of action for damages under the First Amendment for retaliatory demotion in view of the available remedies under the Civil Service Commission regulations.
Held:  Because petitioner's claims arise out of an employment relationship that is governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions giving meaningful remedies against the United States, it would be inappropriate for this Court to supplement that regulatory scheme with a new nonstatutory damages remedy.  Pp.  462 U. S. 374-390.
(a) The federal courts' statutory jurisdiction to decide federal questions confers adequate power to award damages to the victim of a constitutional violation even if Congress has not expressly authorized such a remedy.  When Congress provides an alternative remedy, it may indicate its intent that this power should not be exercised.  In the absence of such a congressional directive, the federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is inpropriate for a common law tribunal, paying particular heed, however, to any special factors counseling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.  Pp.  462 U. S. 374-380.
(b) The Government's comprehensive scheme protecting civil servants against arbitrary action by supervisors provides meaningful remedies for 
Page 462 U. S. 368
 employees who may have been unfairly disciplined for making critical comments about their agencies.  Given the history of the development of civil service remedies and the comprehensive nature of the remedies currently available, the question in this case is not what remedy the court should provide for a wrong that would otherwise go unredressed, but whether an elaborate remedial system that has been constructed step by step, with careful attention to policy considerations, should be augmented by the creation of a new judicial remedy for the constitutional violation at issue.  This Court declines to create such a remedy, because Congress is in a better position to decide whether or not the public interest would be served by creating it.  Pp.  462 U. S. 380-390.

The fourth paragraph of  8 of the Clayton Act provides that

if such corporations are competitors.  The United States brought test cases, consolidated in Federal District Court, against petitioners, certain banks, bank holding companies, mutual life insurance companies, and individuals who each served on the board of directors of one of the banks or bank holding companies and one of the insurance companies.  It was stipulated that the interlocked banks and insurance companies compete in the interstate market for mortgage and real estate loans.  The Government asserted that the interlocking directorates violated the fourth paragraph of  8, arguing that the ""other than banks"" clause simply prevented overlapping regulation of interlocks between banks, which are separately regulated in the first three paragraphs of  8.  The District Court entered summary judgment for petitioners, holding that the statutory proscription applies only to two corporations, neither of which is a bank.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The fourth paragraph of  8 does not bar interlocking directorates between a bank and a competing insurance company.  Pp.  462 U. S. 126-140.
(a) The most natural reading of the language of the statute is that the interlocked corporations must all be corporations ""other than banks,"" and that thus the fourth paragraph of  8 does not, by its express terms, prohibit interlocking directorates between a bank and a competing nonbanking corporation.  This reading of the statute is reinforced both by the structure of the Clayton Act and by the structure of the fourth paragraph of  8.  Pp.  462 U. S. 128-130.
(b) Great weight is to be given to the contemporaneous interpretation of a challenged statute by an agency charged with its enforcement, but, for over 60 years prior to its present interpretation of  8, the Government made no attempt to apply the statute to interlocks between banks and insurance companies, even though such interlocks were widespread and a matter of public record throughout the period.

The issue in each of these cases is what statute of limitations applies in an employee suit against an employer and a union, alleging the employer's breach of a collective bargaining agreement and the union's breach of its duty of fair representation by mishandling the ensuing grievance or arbitration proceedings.  United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, 451 U. S. 56, held in a similar suit that an employee's claim against the employer was governed by a state statute of limitations for vacation of an arbitration award, rather than by a state statute for an action for breach of contract, but left open the issues as to what state statute should govern the employee's claim against the union or whether, instead of applying a state statute of limitations, the provisions of  10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act establishing a 6-month limitations period for making charges of unfair labor practices to the National Labor Relations Board should be borrowed.  In No. 81-2386, respondent local union brought a formal grievance under the collective bargaining agreement based on petitioner employee's alleged improper discharge.  After a hearing, a joint union-management committee informed petitioner of its conclusion that the grievance was without merit, and the committee's determination became final on September 20, 1977.  On March 16, 1978, petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the employer had discharged him in violation of the collective bargaining agreement, and that the union had represented him in the grievance procedure in a discriminatory, arbitrary, and perfunctory manner.  The District Court ultimately granted summary judgment against petitioner, concluding that Mitchell compelled application of Maryland's 30-day statute of limitations for actions to vacate arbitration awards to both of petitioner's claims.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  In No. 81-2408, petitioner local union invoked arbitration after it was unsuccessful in processing respondent employees' grievances based on the employer's alleged violations of the bargaining agreement arising from job-assignment practices.  On February 
Page 462 U. S. 152
 24, 1978, the arbitrator issued an award upholding the employer's job assignments, and on January 19, 1979, respondents filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the employer had violated the bargaining agreement, and that the union had violated its duty of fair representation in handling respondents' claims.  The District Court, applying New York's 90-day statute of limitations for actions to vacate arbitration awards, dismissed the complaint against both the employer and the union.  Ultimately, the Court of Appeals, acting in light of the intervening decision in Mitchell, rejected the contention that  10(b) should be applied; affirmed the dismissal as to the employer under the 90-day arbitration statute; but reversed as to the union, concluding that New York's 3-year statute for malpractice actions governed.
Held:
1. In this type of suit, the 6-month limitations period in  10(b) governs claims against both the employer and the union.  Pp. 158-172.
(a) When, as here, there is no federal statute of limitations expressly applicable to a federal cause of action, it is generally concluded that Congress intended that the courts apply the most closely analogous statute of limitations under state law.  However, when adoption of state statutes would be at odds with the purpose or operation of federal substantive law, timeliness rules have been drawn from federal law -- either express limitations periods from related federal statutes, or such alternatives as laches.  Auto Workers v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp., 383 U. S. 696, distinguished.  Pp.  462 U. S. 158-163.
(b) An employee's suit against both the employer and the union, such as is involved here, has no close analogy in ordinary state law, and the analogies suggested in Mitchell suffer from flaws of both legal substance and practical application.  Typically short state limitations periods for vacating arbitration awards fail to provide the aggrieved employee with a satisfactory opportunity to vindicate his rights, and analogy to an action to vacate an arbitration award is problematic, at best, as applied to the employee's claim against the union.  While a state limitations period for legal malpractice is the closest state law analogy for the claim against the union, application of such a limitations period would not solve the problem caused by the too-short time in which the employee could sue the employer, and would preclude the relatively rapid resolution of labor disputes favored by federal law.  In contrast,  10(b)'s 6-month period for filing unfair labor practice charges is designed to accommodate a balance of interests very similar to that at stake here.  Both the union's breach of its duty and the employer's breach of the bargaining agreement are often also unfair labor practices.  Moreover, in  10(b),
""Congress established a limitations period attuned to what it viewed as the proper balance between the national interests in stable bargaining relationships and finality of private settlements, and 
Page 462 U. S. 153
 an employee's interest in setting aside what he views as an unjust settlement under the collective bargaining system.""
Mitchell, supra, at  451 U. S. 70-71 (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment).  Pp.  462 U. S. 163-172.
2. The judgment in No. 81-2408 is reversed because it is conceded that the suit was filed more than 10 months after respondents' causes of action accrued.  However, in No. 81-2386, the judgment is reversed, but the case is remanded, since petitioner contends that certain events tolled the running of the limitations period until about three months before he filed suit, but the District Court, applying a 30-day limitations period, declined to consider any tolling issue.  P.  462 U. S. 172.

Syllabus 
An Alabama statute imposes a severance tax on oil and gas extracted from wells located in the State.  In 1979, a statute (Act 79-434) was enacted which increased the tax, exempted royalty owners from the increase, and prohibited producers from passing on the increase to consumers.  Appellant producers were parties to preexisting contracts that provided for allocation of severance taxes among themselves, the royalty owners, and any nonworking interests.  The contracts also required the purchasers to reimburse appellants for severance taxes paid.  After paying the increase in the severance tax under protest, appellants and other producers filed suit in an Alabama state court, seeking a declaratory judgment that Act 79-434 was unconstitutional and a refund of the taxes paid.  Concluding that both the royalty owner exemption and the pass-through prohibition violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Contract Clause, and that the pass-through prohibition was also preempted by the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), the trial court held Act 79-434 invalid in its entirety and ordered appellee Alabama Commissioner of Revenue to refund the taxes.  The Alabama Supreme Court reversed.
Held:
1. The pass-through prohibition of Act 79-434 was preempted by federal law insofar as it applied to sales of gas in interstate commerce, but not insofar as it applied to sales of gas in intrastate commerce.  Pp.  462 U. S. 180-187.
(a) The Natural Gas Act, which was enacted in 1938, was intended to occupy the field of wholesale sales of natural gas in interstate commerce.  Alabama's pass-through prohibition trespassed upon the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under that Act to regulate the wholesale prices of natural gas sold in interstate commerce, for the prohibition bars gas producers from increasing their prices to pass on a particular expense -- the increase in the severance tax -- to their purchasers.  Whether or not producers should be permitted 
Page 462 U. S. 177
 to recover this expense from their purchasers is a matter within the sphere of FERC's regulatory authority.  Pp.  462 U. S. 184-186.
(b) Although the NGPA extended federal authority to control natural gas prices to the intrastate market, Congress also provided that this extension did not deprive the States of the power to establish a price ceiling for intrastate sales at a level lower than the federal ceiling.  Since a State may establish a lower price ceiling, it may also impose a severance tax and forbid sellers to pass it through to their customers.  Pp.  462 U. S. 186-187.
2. The royalty owner exemption of Act 79-434 does not violate the Contract Clause, since it did not nullify any contractual obligation of which appellants were the beneficiaries.  The exemption provides only that the incidence of the severance tax increase shall not fall on royalty owners, and nowhere states that producers may not shift the burden of the increase to royalty owners.  Pp.  462 U. S. 187-189.
3. Nor does the pass-through prohibition of Act 79-434 violate the Contract Clause.  While the prohibition affected contractual obligations of which appellants were the beneficiaries, it does not constitute a ""Law impairing the Obligations of Contracts"" within the meaning of the Contract Clause.  The prohibition imposed a generally applicable rule of conduct, the main effect of which was to shield consumers from the burden of the tax increase.  Its effect on existing contracts permitting producers to pass the increase through to consumers was only incidental.  Cf. Producers Transportation Co. v. Railroad Comm'n of California, 251 U. S. 228.  Pp.  462 U. S. 189-194.
4. Neither the pass-through prohibition nor the royalty owner exemption of Act 79-434 violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Both measures pass muster under the standard of rationality applied in considering equal protection challenges to statutes regulating economic and commercial matters.  The pass-through prohibition plainly bore a rational relationship to the State's legitimate purpose of protecting consumers from excessive prices.  Similarly, the Alabama Legislature could have reasonably determined that the royalty owner exemption would encourage investment in oil or gas production.  Pp.  462 U. S. 195-196.
404 So.2d 1, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.
MARSHALL, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

S. 228.  Pp.  462 U. S. 189-194.
4. Neither the pass-through prohibition nor the royalty owner exemption of Act 79-434 violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Both measures pass muster under the standard of rationality applied in considering equal protection challenges to statutes regulating economic and commercial matters.  The pass-through prohibition plainly bore a rational relationship to the State's legitimate purpose of protecting consumers from excessive prices.  Similarly, the Alabama Legislature could have reasonably determined that the royalty owner exemption would encourage investment in oil or gas production.  Pp.  462 U. S. 195-196.

Syllabus 
Section 542(a) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (Act) requires an entity, other than a custodian, in possession of property of the debtor that the trustee in bankruptcy can use, sell, or lease under  363 to deliver that property to the trustee.  Section 543(b)(1) requires a custodian in possession or control of any property of the debtor to deliver the property to the trustee.  Promptly after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seized respondent swimming pool firm's tangible personal property to satisfy a tax lien, respondent filed a petition for reorganization under the Act.  The Bankruptcy Court, pursuant to  543(b)(1), ordered the IRS to turn the property over to respondent on the condition that respondent provide the IRS with specified protection for its interests.  The District Court reversed, holding that a turnover order against the IRS was not authorized by either  542(a) or  543(b)(1).  The Court of Appeals in turn reversed the District Court, holding that a turnover order could issue against the IRS under  542(a).
Held:
1. The reorganization estate includes property of the debtor that has been seized by a creditor prior to the filing of a petition for reorganization.  Pp.  462 U. S. 202-209.
(a) Both the congressional goal of encouraging reorganization of troubled enterprises and Congress' choice of protecting secured creditors by imposing limits or conditions on the trustee's power to sell, use, or lease property subject to a secured interest, rather than by excluding such property from the reorganization estate, indicate that Congress intended a broad range of property, including property in which a creditor has a secured interest, to be included in the estate.  Pp.  462 U. S. 203-204.
(b) The statutory language reflects this view of the scope of the estate.  Section 541(a)(1) of the Act, which provides that the estate shall include ""all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case,"" is intended to include any property made available to the estate by other provisions of the Act, such as  542(a).  In effect,  542(a) grants to the estate a possessory interest in certain property of the debtor that was not held by the debtor at the commencement of reorganization proceedings.  Pp.  462 U. S. 204-207.
(c) This interpretation of  542(a) is supported by its legislative history, and is consistent with judicial precedent predating the Act.  
Page 462 U. S. 199
 Any other interpretation would deprive the reorganization estate of the assets and property essential to its rehabilitation effort, and thereby would frustrate the congressional purpose behind the reorganization provisions.  Pp.  462 U. S. 207-208.
2. Section 542(a) authorizes the Bankruptcy Court to order the IRS to turn over the seized property in question.  Pp.  462 U. S. 209-211.
(a) The IRS is bound by  542(a) to the same extent as any secured creditor.  Nothing in the Act or its legislative history indicates that Congress intended a special exception for tax collectors.   462 U. S.  209.
(b) While  542(a) would not apply if a tax levy or seizure transferred to the IRS ownership of the property seized, the Internal Revenue Code does not transfer ownership of such property until the property is sold to a bona fide purchaser at a tax sale.  Pp.  462 U. S. 209-211.

Syllabus 
On May 3, 1978, the Police Department of Bloomingdale, Ill., received an anonymous letter which included statements that respondents, husband and wife, were engaged in selling drugs; that the wife would drive their car to Florida on May 3 to be loaded with drugs, and the husband would fly down in a few days to drive the car back; that the car's trunk would be loaded with drugs; and that respondents presently had over $100,000 worth of drugs in their basement.  Acting on the tip, a police officer determined respondents' address and learned that the husband made a reservation on a May 5 flight to Florida.  Arrangements for surveillance of the flight were made with an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the surveillance disclosed that the husband took the flight, stayed overnight in a motel room registered in the wife's name, and left the following morning with a woman in a car bearing an Illinois license plate issued to the husband, heading north on an interstate highway used by travelers to the Bloomingdale area.  A search warrant for respondents' residence and automobile was then obtained from an Illinois state court judge, based on the Bloomingdale police officer's affidavit setting forth the foregoing facts and a copy of the anonymous letter.  When respondents arrived at their home, the police were waiting, and discovered marihuana and other contraband in respondents' car trunk and home.  Prior to respondents' trial on charges of violating state drug laws, the trial court ordered suppression of all the items seized, and the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed.  The Illinois Supreme Court also affirmed, holding that the letter and affidavit were inadequate to sustain a determination of probable cause for issuance of the search warrant under Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108, and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410, since they failed to satisfy the ""two-pronged test"" of (1) revealing the informant's ""basis of knowledge"" and (2) providing sufficient facts to establish either the informant's ""veracity"" or the ""reliability"" of the informant's report.
Held:
1. The question -- which this Court requested the parties to address -- whether the rule requiring the exclusion at a criminal trial of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment should be modified so as, for example, not to require exclusion of evidence obtained in the reasonable 
Page 462 U. S. 214
 belief that the search and seizure at issue was consistent with the Fourth Amendment, will not be decided in this case, since it was not presented to or decided by the Illinois courts.  Although prior decisions interpreting the ""not pressed or passed on below"" rule have not involved a State's failure to raise a defense to a federal right or remedy asserted below, the purposes underlying the rule are, for the most part, as applicable in such a case as in one where a party fails to assert a federal right.  The fact that the Illinois courts affirmatively applied the federal exclusionary rule does not affect the application of the ""not pressed or passed on below"" rule.  Nor does the State's repeated opposition to respondents' substantive Fourth Amendment claims suffice to have raised the separate question whether the exclusionary rule should be modified.  The extent of the continued vitality of the rule is an issue of unusual significance, and adhering scrupulously to the customary limitations on this Court's discretion promotes respect for its adjudicatory process and the stability of its decisions, and lessens the threat of untoward practical ramifications not foreseen at the time of decision.  Pp.  462 U. S. 217-224.
2. The rigid ""two-pronged test"" under Aguilar and Spinelli for determining whether an informant's tip establishes probable cause for issuance of a warrant is abandoned, and the ""totality of the circumstances"" approach that traditionally has informed probable cause determinations is substituted in its place.  The elements under the ""two-pronged test"" concerning the informant's ""veracity,"" ""reliability,"" and ""basis of knowledge"" should be understood simply as closely intertwined issues that may usefully illuminate the common sense, practical question whether there is ""probable cause"" to believe that contraband or evidence is located in a particular place.  The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.  And the duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.  This flexible, easily applied standard will better achieve the accommodation of public and private interests that the Fourth Amendment requires than does the approach that has developed from Aguilar and Spinelli.  Pp.  462 U. S. 230-241.
3. The judge issuing the warrant had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause to search respondents' home and car existed.  Under the ""totality of the circumstances"" analysis, corroboration of details of an informant's tip by independent police work is of significant value.  Cf. Draper v. United States, 358 U. S. 307.  Here, even standing alone, the facts obtained through the independent investigation of the Bloomingdale police officer and the DEA at least suggested that 
Page 462 U. S. 215
 respondents were involved in drug trafficking.  In addition, the judge could rely on the anonymous letter, which had been corroborated in major part by the police officer's efforts.  Pp.  462 U. S. 241-246.

Syllabus 
Under Tennessee law, the father of an illegitimate child is responsible for the child's support.  Enforcement of this obligation depends on the establishment of paternity.  A Tennessee statute provides that a paternity and support action must be filed within two years of the child's birth unless the father has provided support or has acknowledged his paternity in writing, or unless the child is, or is liable to become, a public charge, in which case the State or any person can bring suit at any time prior to the child's 18th birthday.  In May, 1978, appellant mother of an illegitimate child born in November, 1968, brought a paternity and support action in the Tennessee Juvenile Court against appellee Brown, who moved to dismiss the action on the ground that it was barred by the 2-year limitations period.  The court held that the limitations period violated, inter alia, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because it imposed a restriction on the support rights of some illegitimate children that was not imposed on the identical rights of legitimate children.  The Tennessee Supreme Court reversed and upheld the constitutionality of the 2-year limitations period.
Held:  The 2-year limitations period in question denies certain illegitimate children the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  462 U. S. 7-18.
(a) Restrictions on support suits by illegitimate children ""will survive equal protection scrutiny to the extent they are substantially related to a legitimate state interest.""  Mills v. Habluetzel, 456 U. S. 91,  456 U. S. 99.  The period for obtaining paternal support has to be long enough to provide a 
Page 462 U. S. 2
 reasonable opportunity for those with an interest in illegitimate children to bring suit on their behalf; and any time limit on that opportunity has to be substantially related to the State's interest in preventing the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims.  Id. at  465 U. S. 99-100.  Pp.  462 U. S. 7-11.
(b) Here, the 2-year limitations period does not provide an illegitimate child who is not covered by one of the exceptions in the statute with an adequate opportunity to obtain support.  The mother's financial difficulties caused by the child's birth, the loss of income attributable to the need to care for the child, continuing affection for the child's father, a desire to avoid family and community disapproval, and emotional strain and confusion that often attend the birth of an illegitimate child, all may inhibit a mother from filing a paternity suit within two years after the child's birth.  Pp.  462 U. S. 12-13.
(c) Nor is the 2-year limitations period substantially related to the legitimate state interest in preventing the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims.  It amounts to a restriction effectively extinguishing the support rights of illegitimate children that cannot be justified by the problems of proof surrounding paternity actions.  The State's argument that the different treatment accorded legitimate and illegitimate children is substantially related to the above legitimate state interest is seriously undermined by the exception for illegitimate children who are, or are likely to become, public charges, since claims filed on behalf of these children when they are more than two years old would be just as stale or as vulnerable to fraud as claims filed on behalf of illegitimate children who are not public charges at the same age.  Moreover, the fact that Tennessee tolls most actions during a child's minority, when considered in combination with the above factors, leads one to question whether the burden placed on illegitimate children is designed to advance permissible state interests.

Syllabus 
Exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exempts from disclosure under the Act ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party . . . in litigation with the agency.""  Petitioner Federal Trade Commission (FTC) conducted an investigation of a subsidiary of respondent in connection with a civil penalty action against the subsidiary in Federal District Court filed by the Department of Justice.  The action was later dismissed with prejudice when the Government declined to comply with a discovery order.  Thereafter, respondent filed a request with the FTC for disclosure of certain documents concerning the investigation of the subsidiary, but the FTC denied the request on the ground that the documents were exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5.  Respondent then brought suit in Federal District Court to compel release of the documents.  The District Court held that the documents were exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5 as, inter alia, attorney work product.  The Court of Appeals held that the documents generated during the action against the subsidiary could not be withheld on the basis of the work product rule unless the FTC could show that ""litigation related to the terminated action exists or potentially exists.""  The court reasoned that the work product rule encompassed by Exemption 5 was coextensive with the work product privilege under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and that a requirement that documents must be disclosed in the absence of the existence or potential existence of related litigation best comported with the fact that the work product privilege is a qualified one.
Held:  Under Exemption 5, attorney work product is exempt from mandatory disclosure without regard to the status of the litigation for which it was prepared.  By its own terms, Exemption 5 requires reference to whether discovery would normally be required during litigation with the agency.  Under a literal reading of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3), the work product of agency attorneys would not be subject to discovery in subsequent litigation unless there was a showing of need, and thus would fall within the scope of Exemption 5.

Syllabus 
Exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exempts from disclosure under the Act ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party . . . in litigation with the agency.""  Petitioner Federal Trade Commission (FTC) conducted an investigation of a subsidiary of respondent in connection with a civil penalty action against the subsidiary in Federal District Court filed by the Department of Justice.  The action was later dismissed with prejudice when the Government declined to comply with a discovery order.  Thereafter, respondent filed a request with the FTC for disclosure of certain documents concerning the investigation of the subsidiary, but the FTC denied the request on the ground that the documents were exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5.  Respondent then brought suit in Federal District Court to compel release of the documents.  The District Court held that the documents were exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5 as, inter alia, attorney work product.  The Court of Appeals held that the documents generated during the action against the subsidiary could not be withheld on the basis of the work product rule unless the FTC could show that ""litigation related to the terminated action exists or potentially exists.""  The court reasoned that the work product rule encompassed by Exemption 5 was coextensive with the work product privilege under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and that a requirement that documents must be disclosed in the absence of the existence or potential existence of related litigation best comported with the fact that the work product privilege is a qualified one.
Held:  Under Exemption 5, attorney work product is exempt from mandatory disclosure without regard to the status of the litigation for which it was prepared.  By its own terms, Exemption 5 requires reference to whether discovery would normally be required during litigation with the agency.  Under a literal reading of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3), the work product of agency attorneys would not be subject to discovery in subsequent litigation unless there was a showing of need, and thus would fall within the scope of Exemption 5.  But regardless of how Rule 26(b)(3) is construed, the Court of Appeals erred in construing Exemption 5 to protect work product material only if related litigation

Syllabus 
The Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 (SRHA) provided for the settlement of homesteads on lands the surface of which was ""chiefly valuable for grazing and raising forage crops.""  Section 9 of the SRHA reserved to the United States title to ""all the coal and minerals"" in lands patented under the Act.  When respondent mining company acquired a fee interest in land covered by a patent under the Act, it proceeded to remove gravel from a pit located on the land to use in paving streets and sidewalks in a company town where its workers lived.  The Bureau of Land Management then notified respondent, and later determined, after a hearing, that the removal of the gravel constituted a trespass in violation of a Department of the Interior regulation for which respondent was liable in damages to the United States.  The Interior Board of Land Appeals affirmed, holding that gravel is a mineral reserved to the United States in patents issued under the SRHA.  Respondent then filed suit in Federal District Court, which affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Gravel found on lands patented under the SRHA is a mineral reserved to the United States within the meaning of  9 of the Act.  Pp.  462 U. S. 42-60.
(a) For a substance to be a mineral reserved under the SRHA, it must not only be a mineral within a familiar definition of that term, as is gravel, but must also be the type of mineral that Congress intended to reserve to the United States in lands patented under the Act.  Pp.  462 U. S. 42-46.
(b) Congress' purpose in the SRHA of facilitating the concurrent development of both surface and subsurface resources supports construing the mineral reservation to encompass gravel.  While Congress expected that homesteaders would use the surface of SRHA lands for stockraising and raising crops, it sought to ensure that valuable subsurface resources would remain subject to disposition by the United States, under the general mining laws or otherwise, to persons interested in exploiting them.  Given Congress' understanding that the surface of SRHA lands would be used for ranching and farming, the mineral reservation in the Act is properly interpreted to include substances, such as gravel, that are mineral in character, can be removed from the soil, and can be used for 
Page 462 U. S. 37
 commercial purposes, and that there is no reason to suppose were intended to be included in the surface estate.  Pp.  462 U. S. 46-56.
(c) The conclusion that gravel is a mineral for purposes of the SRHA is also supported by the treatment of gravel under other federal statutes concerning minerals, and by federal administrative and judicial decisions over the last 50 years that have consistently recognized that gravel deposits could be located under the general mining laws.  Pp.  462 U. S. 56-59.
(d) Finally, this conclusion is further buttressed by the rule that land grants are construed favorably to the Government.  This rule applies here with particular force, because the legislative history of the SRHA reveals Congress' understanding that the mineral reservation would limit the operation of the Act strictly to the surface of the lands.

Held. This exemption does not violate the Uniformity Clause's requirement that taxes be ""uniform throughout the United States.""  Pp.  462 U. S. 80-86.
(a) The Uniformity Clause does not require Congress to devise a tax that falls equally or proportionately on each State, nor does the Clause prevent Congress from defining the subject of a tax by drawing distinctions between similar classes.  Pp.  462 U. S. 80-82.
(b) Identifying ""exempt Alaskan oil"" in terms of its geographic boundaries does not render the exemption invalid.

Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to consider the environmental impact of any major federal action.  The dispute in these cases concerns the adoption by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) of a series of generic rules to evaluate the environmental effects of a nuclear powerplant's fuel cycle.  In these rules, the NRC decided that licensing boards should assume, for purposes of NEPA, that the permanent storage of certain nuclear wastes would have no significant environmental impact (the so-called ""zero release"" assumption), and thus should not affect the decision whether to license a particular nuclear powerplant.  At the heart of each rule is Table S-3, a numerical compilation of the estimated resources used and effluents released by fuel cycle activities supporting a year's operation of a typical light-water reactor.  Challenges to the rules ultimately resulted in a decision by the Court of Appeals, on a petition for review of the final version of the rules, that the rules were arbitrary and capricious and inconsistent with NEPA because the NRC had not factored the consideration of uncertainties surrounding the zero release assumption into the licensing process in such a manner that the uncertainties could potentially affect the outcome of any decision to license a plant.
Held:  The NRC complied with NEPA, and its decision is not arbitrary or capricious within the meaning of  10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  Pp.  462 U. S. 97-108.
(a) The zero release assumption, which was designed for the limited purpose of individual licensing decisions and which is but a single figure in Table S-3, is within the bounds of reasoned decisionmaking required by the APA.  The NRC, in its statement announcing the final Table S-3 rule, summarized the major uncertainties of long-term storage of nuclear wastes, noted that the probability of intrusion was small, and found the evidence ""tentative but favorable"" that an appropriate storage site 
Page 462 U. S. 88
 could be found.  Table S-3 refers interested persons to staff studies that discuss the uncertainties in greater detail.  In these circumstances, the NRC complied with NEPA's requirements of consideration and disclosure of the environmental impacts of its licensing decisions.  It is not the task of this Court to determine what decision it would have reached if it had been the NRC.  The Court's only task is to determine whether the NRC had considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.  Under this standard, the zero release assumption, within the context of Table S-3 as a whole, was not arbitrary or capricious.  Pp.  462 U. S. 97-106.
(b) It is inappropriate to cast doubt on the licensing proceedings simply because of a minor ambiguity in the language of an earlier rule as to whether licensing boards were required to consider health effects, socioeconomic effects, or cumulative impacts, where there is no evidence that this ambiguity prevented any party from making as full a presentation as desired or ever affected the decision to license a plant.

The Court of Appeals reversed, apparently holding that, under 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(8), the state trial court's determination that respondent was competent to stand trial was not ""fairly supported by the record.""  The state court had denied respondent's motion for appointment of a competency commission, which motion was filed on the morning of trial and was supported solely by a psychiatrist's testimony -- based upon a brief prison cell interview on the preceding day -- that respondent had paranoid delusions that rendered him incompetent to stand trial, respondent having said that he was withholding from his counsel the names of alibi witnesses for fear that they would be arrested and prevented from testifying.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erroneously substituted its own judgment as to the credibility of witnesses for that of the Louisiana courts -- a prerogative which 28 U.S.C.  2264 does not allow it.  The trial judge's conclusion as to respondent's competency was ""fairly supported by the record,"" which showed that the judge based his conclusion on, inter alia, his observation of respondent's conduct both before and during trial; his inferences regarding the fact that respondent's alleged refusal to disclose his alibi witnesses either never occurred or was remedied; and his conclusion that respondent's surprise, 11th-hour motion for appointment of a competency commission was merely a subterfuge to attempt to obtain a severance to avoid being tried with codefendants.

Syllabus 
These cases present the issue whether  7403 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 which authorizes a federal district court, in a suit instituted by the Government, to decree a sale of certain properties to satisfy the tax indebtedness of delinquent taxpayers -- empowers a district court to order the sale of the family home in which a delinquent taxpayer had an interest at the time he incurred his indebtedness, but in which the taxpayer's spouse, who does not owe any of that indebtedness, also has a separate ""homestead"" right as defined by Texas law.  Under Texas statutory and constitutional provisions, each spouse -- regardless of whether one or both owns the fee interest -- has a separate and undivided possessory interest in the homestead, which is only lost by death or abandonment and may not be compromised by either the other spouse or his or her heirs, and which, in effect, is an interest akin to an undivided life estate in the property.  In the Rodgers case, the Government filed suit against respondents, the widow, children, and executor of Philip Bosco, to reduce to judgment, assessments made against Philip before his death for unpaid taxes and to enforce the Government's tax liens, including one that had attached to his interest in the homestead.  The District Court granted summary judgment on respondents' claim that the tax liens could not defeat the widow's state-created right not to have her homestead (which she continued to occupy) subjected to a forced sale.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  In the Ingram case, which involved tax assessments made before a divorce both against the husband alone relating to unpaid taxes withheld from employee's wages and against both spouses relating to their joint income tax liability, the residence was destroyed by fire shortly before the divorce, and the Government, as a defendant in quiet title proceedings in Federal District Court, filed a counterclaim against both spouses, seeking judicial sale of the property under  7403.  Pursuant to the parties' stipulation, the property was sold and the proceeds were deposited in the court's registry, the parties agreeing that their rights would be determined as if the sale had not taken place and that the proceeds would be divided according to their respective interests.  The District Court granted summary judgment on the Government's counterclaim.  Affirming in part, and reversing 
Page 461 U. S. 678
 and remanding in part, the Court of Appeals agreed that the Government could foreclose its lien on the proceeds to collect for the income tax owed by both spouses jointly, but held that the Government could not reach the proceeds to collect the husband's individual liability if the wife had maintained her homestead interest in the property.  The court remanded for a factual determination of whether the wife had ""abandoned"" the homestead by dividing the fire insurance proceedings with the husband and by attempting, before the stipulation with the Government, to sell the property and divide the proceeds with the husband.
Held:
1. Section 7403 grants power to a federal district court to order the sale of the home itself, not just the delinquent taxpayer's interest in the property.  If the home is sold, the nondelinquent spouse is entitled, as part of the distribution of proceeds required under  7403, to so much of the proceeds as represents complete compensation for the loss of such spouse's separate homestead interest.  Pp.  461 U. S. 690-702.
(a) While the Government's lien cannot extend beyond the property interests held by the delinquent taxpayer, the plain meaning of the statute authorizes sale of the entire property.  Section 7403(a) provides that the Government may seek to

""may decree a sale of such property . . . and a distribution of the proceeds of such sale according to the findings of the court in respect to the interests of the parties and of the United States.""
Reading  7403 to authorize sale of the entire property is also consistent with the policy of prompt and certain collection of delinquent taxes and with the history of state in rem tax enforcement proceedings, and is further bolstered by a comparison with the statutory language which limits the Government's administrative remedy, available under 26 U.S.C.  6331, to sale of the delinquent taxpayer's interest in property.  Moreover,  7403's requirements for distribution of the proceeds of the sale provide compensation for the taking of the property interest (such as the homestead estate in Texas) of an innocent third party, thus precluding any difficulties under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

(b) Nor do the special protections accorded by the exemption aspect of Texas homestead law immunize property held as a homestead by a nondelinquent third party from the reach of  7403.

2. Section 7403, which provides that a district court ""may"" decree the sale of property, does not require the court to authorize a forced sale under absolutely all circumstances.  Some limited room is left in the statute for the exercise of reasoned discretion.  Pp.  461 U. S. 703-712.

(b) In determining whether to authorize a sale under  7403 when the interests of nondelinquent third parties are involved, a district court should consider such factors as the following:  (1) the extent to which the Government's financial interests would be prejudiced if it were relegated to a forced sale of the partial interest actually liable for the delinquent taxes; (2) whether the third party with a nonliable separate interest in the property would, in the normal course of events, have a legally recognized expectation that such separate property would not be subject to forced sale by the delinquent taxpayer or his or her creditors; (3) the likely prejudice to the third party, both in personal dislocation costs and in practical undercompensation; and (4) the relative character and value of the nonliable and liable interests held in the property.

			"|"United States v. Rogers
No. 81-1476
Argued December 6, 1982
Decided May 31, 1983*
461 U.S. 677

Syllabus 
These cases present the issue whether  7403 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 which authorizes a federal district court, in a suit instituted by the Government, to decree a sale of certain properties to satisfy the tax indebtedness of delinquent taxpayers -- empowers a district court to order the sale of the family home in which a delinquent taxpayer had an interest at the time he incurred his indebtedness, but in which the taxpayer's spouse, who does not owe any of that indebtedness, also has a separate ""homestead"" right as defined by Texas law.  Under Texas statutory and constitutional provisions, each spouse -- regardless of whether one or both owns the fee interest -- has a separate and undivided possessory interest in the homestead, which is only lost by death or abandonment and may not be compromised by either the other spouse or his or her heirs, and which, in effect, is an interest akin to an undivided life estate in the property.  In the Rodgers case, the Government filed suit against respondents, the widow, children, and executor of Philip Bosco, to reduce to judgment, assessments made against Philip before his death for unpaid taxes and to enforce the Government's tax liens, including one that had attached to his interest in the homestead.  The District Court granted summary judgment on respondents' claim that the tax liens could not defeat the widow's state-created right not to have her homestead (which she continued to occupy) subjected to a forced sale.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  In the Ingram case, which involved tax assessments made before a divorce both against the husband alone relating to unpaid taxes withheld from employee's wages and against both spouses relating to their joint income tax liability, the residence was destroyed by fire shortly before the divorce, and the Government, as a defendant in quiet title proceedings in Federal District Court, filed a counterclaim against both spouses, seeking judicial sale of the property under  7403.  Pursuant to the parties' stipulation, the property was sold and the proceeds were deposited in the court's registry, the parties agreeing that their rights would be determined as if the sale had not taken place and that the proceeds would be divided according to their respective interests.  The District Court granted summary judgment on the Government's counterclaim.  Affirming in part, and reversing 
Page 461 U. S. 678
 and remanding in part, the Court of Appeals agreed that the Government could foreclose its lien on the proceeds to collect for the income tax owed by both spouses jointly, but held that the Government could not reach the proceeds to collect the husband's individual liability if the wife had maintained her homestead interest in the property.  The court remanded for a factual determination of whether the wife had ""abandoned"" the homestead by dividing the fire insurance proceedings with the husband and by attempting, before the stipulation with the Government, to sell the property and divide the proceeds with the husband.
Held:
1. Section 7403 grants power to a federal district court to order the sale of the home itself, not just the delinquent taxpayer's interest in the property.  If the home is sold, the nondelinquent spouse is entitled, as part of the distribution of proceeds required under  7403, to so much of the proceeds as represents complete compensation for the loss of such spouse's separate homestead interest.  Pp.  461 U. S. 690-702.
(a) While the Government's lien cannot extend beyond the property interests held by the delinquent taxpayer, the plain meaning of the statute authorizes sale of the entire property.  Section 7403(a) provides that the Government may seek to
""subject any property, of whatever nature, of the delinquent, or in which he has any right, title, or interest, to the payment of such tax or liability. ""
Section 7403(b) then provides that all persons ""claiming any interest in the property involved in such action"" shall be made parties thereto, and  7403(c) provides that the district court should ""determine the merits of all claims"" to the property, and, if the Government's claim is established,
""may decree a sale of such property . . . and a distribution of the proceeds of such sale according to the findings of the court in respect to the interests of the parties and of the United States.""

461 U.S. 731

Syllabus 
After one Helton, a waitress at petitioner's restaurant, filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleging that she had been fired because of her efforts to organize a union, Helton and others, including other waitresses, picketed the restaurant and distributed leaflets.  Petitioner and three of its co-owners then filed a suit for damages and injunctive relief against Helton and the other demonstrators in an Arizona state court, alleging that the defendants had harassed customers, blocked access to the restaurant, created a threat to public safety, and libeled plaintiffs by false statements in the leaflets.  On the following day, Helton filed a second charge with the NLRB, alleging, inter alia, that petitioner had filed the civil suit in retaliation for the defendants' protected, concerted activities and the filing of charges against petitioner with the NLRB.  After a consolidated hearing on the unfair labor practice complaints, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that, ""on the basis of the record and from [his] observation of the witnesses,"" the evidence failed to support the allegations of the complaint in the state court action, and that such action thus lacked a ""reasonable basis"" and its prosecution was retaliatory, in violation of  8(a)(1) and (4) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act).  On petitioner's appeal, the NLRB adopted, with minor exceptions, the ALJ's findings and recommendations, and ordered petitioner to withdraw its state court complaint.  The Court of Appeals enforced the NLRB's order.
Held:
1. The NLRB may not halt the prosecution of a state court lawsuit, regardless of the plaintiff's motive, unless the suit lacks a reasonable basis in fact or law.  Retaliatory motive and lack of reasonable basis are both essential prerequisites to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order against a state suit.  Pp.  461 U. S. 740-744.
(a) The filing and prosecution of a well-founded lawsuit may not be enjoined as an unfair labor practice, even if it would not have been commenced but for the plaintiff's desire to retaliate against the defendant for exercising rights protected by the Act.  The Act's provisions guaranteeing employees the enjoyment of their rights to unionize, engage 
Page 461 U. S. 732
 in concerted activity, and utilize the NLRB's processes without fear of coercion or retaliation by their employer are to be liberally construed.  However, countervailing considerations against allowing the NLRB to condemn the filing of a suit as an unfair labor practice include the First Amendment right of access to the courts and the States' compelling interests in maintaining domestic peace and protecting its citizens' health and welfare.  Thus, the NLRB's interpretation of the Act that the only essential element of a violation by the employer is retaliatory motive in filing a state court suit is untenable.  Pp.  461 U. S. 740-743.
(b) However, it is an enjoinable unfair labor practice to prosecute a baseless lawsuit with the intent of retaliating against an employee for the exercise of rights protected by the Act.  Such suits are not within the scope of First Amendment protection, and the state interests noted above do not enter into play when the suit has no reasonable basis.  Pp.  461 U. S. 743-744.
2. In determining whether a state court suit lacks a reasonable basis, the NLRB is not limited to considering the bare pleadings in the suit, but its inquiry must be structured in a manner that will preserve the state plaintiff's right to have a state court jury or judge resolve genuine material factual or state law legal disputes pertaining to the lawsuit.  Therefore, if the NLRB is called upon to determine whether a suit is unlawful prior to the time that the state court renders final judgment, and if the state plaintiff can show that such genuine material factual or legal issues exist, the NLRB must await the results of the state court adjudication with respect to the merits of the state suit.  If the state proceedings result in a judgment adverse to the plaintiff, the NLRB may then consider the matter further and, if it is found that the lawsuit was filed with retaliatory intent, the NLRB may find a violation and order appropriate relief.  Pp.  461 U. S. 744-747.
3. This case must be returned to the NLRB for further consideration in light of the proper standards.  It was not the ALJ's province, based on his own evaluation of the evidence, to determine that the libel and business-interference counts in petitioner's state court suit were in fact without merit.  He should have limited his inquiry to the question whether petitioner's evidence raised factual issues that were genuine and material.  Furthermore, because, in enforcing the NLRB's order, the Court of Appeals ultimately relied on the fact that ""substantial evidence"" supported the NLRB's finding that the prosecution of the lawsuit violated the Act, the NLRB's error has not been cured.  Pp.  461 U. S. 747-748.

Faced with the prospect of liability for violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in its hiring practices, petitioner employer signed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) a conciliation agreement that conflicted with the seniority provisions of petitioner's existing collective bargaining agreement with respondent union.  Petitioner sued in Federal District Court to enjoin arbitration of certain employee grievances under the collective bargaining agreement.  The District Court held that the conciliation agreement should prevail with respect to layoffs of employees in conflict with the seniority provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.  The Court of Appeals reversed and compelled petitioner to arbitrate.  Among the grievances arbitrated were those of two employees who had been laid off pursuant to the conciliation agreement and in violation of the collective bargaining agreement.  The arbitrator awarded backpay damages against petitioner under the collective bargaining agreement, interpreting that agreement as not requiring him to follow a contrary prior arbitration award involving the same contractual issue, as providing that the District Court's order did not extinguish petitioner's liability for its breach, and as not providing a good faith defense to claims of violation of its seniority provisions.  Petitioner then brought an action to overturn the award, and the District Court entered summary judgment for petitioner, finding that public policy prevented enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement during the period prior to the Court of Appeals' reversal in the prior action.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The award in question is properly to be enforced.  Pp.  461 U. S. 764-772.
(a) A federal court may not overrule an arbitrator's decision simply because the court believes its own interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement would be the better one.  Thus, here, regardless of what this Court's view might be of the correctness of the arbitrator's contractual interpretation, petitioner and respondent bargained for that interpretation, and a federal court may not second-guess it.  The arbitrator's analysis of the merits of the grievance is entitled to the same deference.  Pp.  461 U. S. 764-766. 
Page 461 U. S. 758

(b) Enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement as interpreted by the arbitrator will not compromise the public policy requiring obedience to a court order.  Even assuming that the District Court's order that the conciliation agreement should prevail was a mandatory injunction, nothing in the collective bargaining agreement as interpreted by the arbitrator required petitioner to violate that order.  The arbitrator's award neither mandated layoffs nor required that layoffs be conducted according to the collective bargaining agreement, but simply held retrospectively that the employees were entitled to damages for the prior breach of the seniority provisions.  Petitioner was cornered by its own actions, and cannot now argue that liability under the collective bargaining agreement violates public policy.  No public policy is violated by holding petitioner to its collective bargaining agreement obligations, which bar petitioner's attempted reallocation to union members of the burden of the losses resulting from petitioner's employment discrimination.  Pp.  461 U. S. 766-770.
(c) Nor will enforcement of the arbitrator's award inappropriately affect the public policy favoring voluntary compliance with Title VII.  Although petitioner and the EEOC agreed to nullify the collective bargaining agreement's seniority provisions, the conciliation process did not include respondent.  Absent a judicial determination, the EEOC, not to mention petitioner, cannot alter the collective bargaining agreement without respondent's consent.  Pp.  461 U. S. 770-772.

Syllabus 
Respondent States received funds as part of the federal grant-in-aid prog1am under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) a program designed to improve the educational opportunities available to disadvantaged children.  Subsequently, federal auditors determined that each State had misapplied the funds.  The Education Appeal Board (Board), while modifying the auditors' findings, assessed deficiencies against both States.  The Secretary of Education (Secretary) declined to review the orders establishing the deficiencies, and, after a period for comment, the orders became final.  Both States filed petitions for review in the Court of Appeals, which consolidated the cases and held that the Department of Education did not have the authority to issue the orders.
Held:
1.

Syllabus 
Respondent States received funds as part of the federal grant-in-aid prog1am under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) a program designed to improve the educational opportunities available to disadvantaged children.  Subsequently, federal auditors determined that each State had misapplied the funds.  The Education Appeal Board (Board), while modifying the auditors' findings, assessed deficiencies against both States.  The Secretary of Education (Secretary) declined to review the orders establishing the deficiencies, and, after a period for comment, the orders became final.  Both States filed petitions for review in the Court of Appeals, which consolidated the cases and held that the Department of Education did not have the authority to issue the orders.

Syllabus 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC) provides that ""[c]orporations . . . organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable . . . or educational purposes"" are entitled to tax exemption.  Until 1970, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) granted tax-exempt status under  501(c)(3) to private schools, independent of racial admissions policies, and granted charitable deductions for contributions to such schools under  170 of the IRC.  But in 1970, the IRS concluded that it could no longer justify allowing tax-exempt status under  501(c)(3) to private schools that practiced racial discrimination, and in 1971 issued Revenue Ruling 71-447 providing that a private school not having a racially nondiscriminatory policy as to students is not ""charitable"" within the common law concepts reflected in  170 and 501(c)(3).  In No. 81-3, petitioner Bob Jones University, while permitting unmarried Negroes to enroll as students, denies admission to applicants engaged in an interracial marriage or known to advocate interracial marriage or dating.  Because of this admissions policy, the IRS revoked the University's tax-exempt status.  After paying a portion of the federal unemployment taxes for a certain taxable year, the University filed a refund action in Federal District Court, and the Government counterclaimed for unpaid taxes for that and other taxable years.  Holding that the IRS exceeded its powers in revoking the University's tax-exempt status and violated the University's rights under the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, the District Court ordered the IRS to refund the taxes paid and rejected the counterclaim. The Court of Appeals reversed.  In No. 81-1, petitioner Goldsboro Christian Schools maintains a racially discriminatory admissions policy based upon its interpretation of the Bible, accepting for the most part only Caucasian students.  The IRS determined that Goldsboro was not an organization described in  501(c)(3), and hence was required to pay federal social security and unemployment taxes.  After paying a portion of such taxes for certain years, Goldsboro filed a refund suit in Federal District Court, and the IRS counterclaimed for unpaid taxes.  The District Court entered summary judgment for 
Page 461 U. S. 575
 the IRS, rejecting Goldsboro's claim to tax-exempt status under  501(c) (3) and also its claim that the denial of such status violated the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Neither petitioner qualifies as a tax-exempt organization under  501(c)(3).  Pp.  461 U. S. 585-605.
(a) An examination of the IRC's framework and the background of congressional purposes reveals unmistakable evidence that, underlying all relevant parts of the IRC, is the intent that entitlement to tax exemption depends on meeting certain common law standards of charity -- namely, that an institution seeking tax-exempt status must serve a public purpose and not be contrary to established public policy.  Thus, to warrant exemption under  501(c)(3), an institution must fall within a category specified in that section, and must demonstrably serve and be in harmony with the public interest, and the institution's purpose must not be so at odds with the common community conscience as to undermine any public benefit that might otherwise be conferred.  Pp.  461 U. S. 585-592.
(b) The IRS's 1970 interpretation of  501(c)(3) was correct.  It would be wholly incompatible with the concepts underlying tax exemption to grant tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private educational entities.  Whatever may be the rationale for such private schools' policies, racial discrimination in education is contrary to public policy.  Racially discriminatory educational institutions cannot be viewed as conferring a public benefit within the above ""charitable"" concept or within the congressional intent underlying  501(c)(3).  Pp.  461 U. S. 592-596.
(c) The IRS did not exceed its authority when it announced its interpretation of  501(c)(3) in 1970 and 1971.  Such interpretation is wholly consistent with what Congress, the Executive, and the courts had previously declared.  And the actions of Congress since 1970 leave no doubt that the IRS reached the correct conclusion in exercising its authority.  Pp.  461 U. S. 596-62.
(d) The Government's fundamental, overriding interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education substantially outweighs whatever burden denial of tax benefits places on petitioners' exercise of their religious beliefs.  Petitioners' asserted interests cannot be accommodated with that compelling governmental interest, and no less restrictive means are available to achieve the governmental interest.  Pp.  461 U. S. 602-604.
(e) The IRS properly applied its policy to both petitioners.  Goldsboro admits that it maintains racially discriminatory policies, and, contrary to Bob Jones University's contention that it is not racially discriminatory, discrimination on the basis of racial affiliation and association is a form of racial discrimination.  P.  461 U. S. 605.

Syllabus 
Section 2(13) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) defines ""wages"" for the purpose of computing compensation benefits under the Act as meaning
""the money rate at which the service rendered is recompensed under the contract of hiring in force at the time of the injury, including the reasonable value of board, rent, housing, lodging, or similar advantage received from the employer, and gratuities received in the course of employment from others than the employer.""
An employee of petitioner construction company (employer) was fatally injured while working on the District of Columbia Metrorail System.  At the time of his death, the employee was covered by the District of Columbia Workmen's Compensation Act, which incorporates the LHWCA, and he was also a beneficiary of a collective bargaining agreement between the employer and his union.  The employer began to pay 66 2/3% of the employee's ""average weekly wage"" in death benefits to his widow and minor children pursuant to the LHWCA.  The widow disputed the amount of the benefits, claiming that her husband's average weekly wage included not only his take-home pay but also the 68 cents per hour in contributions the employer was required to make to union trust funds under the collective bargaining agreement for health and welfare, pensions, and training.  The Administrative Law Judge rejected the widow's claim, and the Benefits Review Board affirmed, holding that only values that are readily identifiable and calculable may be included in the determination of wages, and that the employee's rights in his union trust funds were too speculative to meet this definition.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the employer's contributions were a reasonable measurement of the value of the benefits to the employee.
Held:  Employer contributions to union trust funds are not included in the term ""wages"" as defined in  2(13).  Pp.  461 U. S. 629-637.
(a) The contributions are not ""money . . . recompensed"" or ""gratuities received . . . from others"" nor are they a ""similar advantage"" to ""board, rent, housing, [or] lodging.""  Board, rent, housing, or lodging are benefits with a present value that can readily be converted into a cash equivalent 
Page 461 U. S. 625
 on the basis of their market values, whereas the present value of the trust funds is not so easily converted into a cash equivalent.  The employer's cost of maintaining the funds is irrelevant in this context, since it measures neither the employee's benefit nor his compensation.  Nor can the value of the funds be measured by the employee's expectation of interest in them, for that interest is, at best, speculative.  Pp.  461 U. S. 630-632.

(c) A comprehensive statute such as the LHWCA is not to be judicially expanded because of ""recent trends.""

No. 81-1661
Argued December 7, 1982
Decided May 24, 1983
461 U.S. 648

Syllabus 
Prior to 1946, the section of the patent laws governing recovery in patent infringement actions contained no reference to interest.  In 1946 the section was amended, and now provides in 35 U.S.C.  284 that the court shall award a successful claimant
""damages adequate to compensate for the infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer, together with interest and costs as fixed by the court.""
In respondent Devex Corp.'s action against petitioner for infringement of a patent covering a lubricating process used in the cold-forming of metal car parts by pressure, the District Court entered judgment for Devex pursuant to  284, awarding, in addition to royalties and postjudgment interest, prejudgment interest.  After determining what the annual royalty payments would have been, the court calculated prejudgment interest on each payment from the time it would have become due.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The award of prejudgment interest was proper in this case.  Pp.  461 U. S. 651-657.
(a) Section 284 does not incorporate the pre-1946 common law standard enunciated in Duplate Corp. v. Triplex Safety Glass Co., 298 U. S. 448, under which prejudgment interest could not be awarded where damages were unliquidated, absent bad faith or other exceptional circumstances.  Rather,  284 gives a court general authority to fix interest, and this authority, on the face of  284, is not restricted to exceptional circumstances.  Pp.  461 U. S. 651-654.
(b) Both the background and language of  284 provide evidence that the underlying purpose of the provision is that prejudgment interest should ordinarily be awarded where necessary to afford the plaintiff full compensation for the infringement.  Consistent with this purpose, prejudgment interest should ordinarily be awarded absent some justification for withholding such an award.  In the typical case, an award of prejudgment interest is necessary to ensure that the patent owner is in as good a position as he would have been if the infringer had entered into a reasonable royalty agreement.  An award of interest from the time that the royalty payments would have been received merely serves to make the patent owner whole, since his damages consist not only of the 
Page 461 U. S. 649
 value of the royalty payments but also of the forgone use of the money between the time of infringement and the date of the judgment.  Pp.  461 U. S. 654-657.

			"|"General Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp.
No. 81-1661
Argued December 7, 1982
Decided May 24, 1983
461 U.S. 648

Syllabus 
Prior to 1946, the section of the patent laws governing recovery in patent infringement actions contained no reference to interest.  In 1946 the section was amended, and now provides in 35 U.S.C.  284 that the court shall award a successful claimant
""damages adequate to compensate for the infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer, together with interest and costs as fixed by the court.""
In respondent Devex Corp.'s action against petitioner for infringement of a patent covering a lubricating process used in the cold-forming of metal car parts by pressure, the District Court entered judgment for Devex pursuant to  284, awarding, in addition to royalties and postjudgment interest, prejudgment interest.  After determining what the annual royalty payments would have been, the court calculated prejudgment interest on each payment from the time it would have become due.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The award of prejudgment interest was proper in this case.  Pp.  461 U. S. 651-657.
(a) Section 284 does not incorporate the pre-1946 common law standard enunciated in Duplate Corp. v. Triplex Safety Glass Co., 298 U. S. 448, under which prejudgment interest could not be awarded where damages were unliquidated, absent bad faith or other exceptional circumstances.  Rather,  284 gives a court general authority to fix interest, and this authority, on the face of  284, is not restricted to exceptional circumstances.  Pp.  461 U. S. 651-654.
(b) Both the background and language of  284 provide evidence that the underlying purpose of the provision is that prejudgment interest should ordinarily be awarded where necessary to afford the plaintiff full compensation for the infringement.  Consistent with this purpose, prejudgment interest should ordinarily be awarded absent some justification for withholding such an award.  In the typical case, an award of prejudgment interest is necessary to ensure that the patent owner is in as good a position as he would have been if the infringer had entered into a reasonable royalty agreement.  An award of interest from the time that the royalty payments would have been received merely serves to make the patent owner whole, since his damages consist not only of the 
Page 461 U. S. 649
 value of the royalty payments but also of the forgone use of the money between the time of infringement and the date of the judgment.  Pp.  461 U. S. 654-657.
667 F.2d 347, affirmed.

No. 81-6633
Argued January 11, 1983

461 U.S. 660

Syllabus 
Petitioner pleaded guilty in a Georgia trial court to burglary and theft by receiving stolen property, but the court, pursuant to the Georgia First Offender's Act, did not enter a judgment of guilt, and sentenced petitioner to probation on the condition that he pay a $500 fine and $250 in restitution, with $100 payable that day, $100 the next day, and the $550 balance within four months.  Petitioner borrowed money and paid the first $200, but about a month later he was laid off from his job, and, despite repeated efforts, was unable to find other work.  Shortly before the $550 balance became due, he notified the probation office that his payment was going to be late.  Thereafter, the State filed a petition to revoke petitioner's probation because he had not paid the balance, and the trial court, after a hearing, revoked probation, entered a conviction, and sentenced petitioner to prison.  The record of the hearing disclosed that petitioner had been unable to find employment and had no assets or income.  The Georgia Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's claim that imprisoning him for inability to pay the fine and make restitution violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Georgia Supreme Court denied review.
Held:  A sentencing court cannot properly revoke a defendant's probation for failure to pay a fine and make restitution, absent evidence and findings that he was somehow responsible for the failure or that alternative forms of punishment were inadequate to meet the State's interest in punishment and deterrence, and hence, here the trial court erred in automatically revoking petitioner's probation and turning the fine into a prison sentence without making such a determination.  Pp.  461 U. S. 664-674.
(a) If a State determines a fine or restitution to be the appropriate and adequate penalty for the crime, it may not thereafter imprison a person solely because he lacked the resources to pay it.  Williams v. Illinois, 399 U. S. 235; Tate v. Short, 401 U. S. 395.  If the probationer has willfully refused to pay the fine or restitution when he has the resources to pay or has failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts to seek employment or borrow money to pay, the State is justified in using imprisonment as a sanction to enforce collection.  But if the probationer has made all reasonable bona fide efforts to pay the fine and yet cannot do so through no fault of his own, it is fundamentally unfair to revoke probation automatically without considering whether adequate alternative methods of punishing 
Page 461 U. S. 661
 the probationer are available to meet the State's interest in punishment and deterrence.  Pp.  461 U. S. 664-669.
(b) The State may not use as the sole justification for imprisonment the poverty or inability of the probationer to pay the fine and to make restitution if he has demonstrated sufficient bona fide efforts to do so.  Pp.  461 U. S. 669-672.
(c) Only if alternative measure of punishment are not adequate to meet the State's interests in punishment and deterrence may the court imprison a probationer who has made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay the fine.  To do otherwise would deprive the probationer of his conditional freedom simply because, through no fault of his own, he cannot pay.  Such a deprivation would be contrary to the fundamental fairness required by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  461 U. S. 672-673.

Syllabus 
A contract between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and petitioner Dutch corporation for the purchase of cement by Nigeria provided that Nigeria was to establish a confirmed letter of credit for the purchase price.  Subsequently, petitioner sued respondent bank, an instrumentality of Nigeria, in Federal District Court, alleging that certain actions by respondent constituted an anticipatory breach of the letter of credit.  Petitioner alleged jurisdiction under the provision of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (Act), 28 U.S.C.  1330(a), granting federal district courts jurisdiction without regard to the amount in controversy of
""any nonjury civil action against a foreign state . . . as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either under sections 1605-1607 of this title or under any applicable international agreement.""
The District Court, while holding that the Act permitted actions by foreign plaintiffs, dismissed the action on the ground that none of the exceptions to sovereign immunity specified in the Act applied.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but on the ground that the Act exceeded the scope of Art. III of the Constitution, which provides, in part, that the judicial power of the United States shall extend to ""all Cases . . . arising under [the] Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made . . . under their Authority,"" and to ""Controversies . . . between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens, or Subjects.""  The court held that neither the Diversity Clause nor the ""Arising Under"" Clause of Art. III is broad enough to support jurisdiction over actions by foreign plaintiffs against foreign sovereigns.
Held:
1. For the most part, the Act codifies, as a matter of federal law, the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity under which immunity is confined to suits involving the foreign sovereign's public acts, and does not extend to cases arising out of its strictly commercial acts.  If one of the specified exceptions to sovereign immunity applies, a federal district court may exercise subject matter jurisdiction under  1330(a), but if the claim does not fall within one of the exceptions, the court lacks such jurisdiction.  Pp.  461 U. S. 486-489. 
Page 461 U. S. 481

2. On it face,  1330(a) allows a foreign plaintiff to sue a foreign sovereign in federal court provided the substantive requirements of the Act are satisfied.  The Act contains no indication of any limitation based on the plaintiff's citizenship.  And, when considered as a whole, the legislative history reveals an intent not to limit jurisdiction under the Act to actions brought by American citizens.  Pp.  461 U. S. 489-491.
3. Congress did not exceed the scope of Art. III by granting federal district courts subject matter jurisdiction over certain civil actions by foreign plaintiffs against foreign sovereigns where the rule of decision may be provided by state law.  While the Diversity Clause of Art. III is not broad enough to support such subject matter jurisdiction, the ""Arising Under"" Clause is an appropriate basis for the statutory grant of jurisdiction.  In enacting the Act, Congress expressly exercised its power to regulate foreign commerce, along with other specified Art. I powers.  The Act does not merely concern access to the federal courts, but rather governs the types of actions for which foreign sovereigns may be held liable in a federal court and codifies the standards governing foreign sovereign immunity as an aspect of substantive federal law.  Thus, a suit against a foreign state under the Act necessarily involves application of a comprehensive body of substantive federal law, and hence ""arises under"" federal law within the meaning of Art. III.  Pp.  461 U. S. 491-497.
4. Since the Court of Appeal, in affirming the District Court, did not find it necessary to address the statutory question of whether the present action fell within any specified exception to foreign sovereign immunity, the court on remand must consider whether jurisdiction exists under the Act itself.

Syllabus 
At respondents' trial in Federal District Court on charges of kidnaping, transporting women across state lines for immoral purposes, and conspiracy to commit such offenses, the victims' testimony included recitals concerning multiple incidents of rape and sodomy by respondents.  The defense relied on a theory of consent and -- inconsistently -- on the possibility that the victims' identification of respondents was mistaken.  None of the respondents testified.  During the prosecutor's summation to the jury, defense counsel objected when the prosecutor began to comment on the defense evidence, particularly that respondents never challenged the kidnaping, the interstate transportation of the victims, and the sexual acts.  A motion for a mistrial was denied, and the jury returned a guilty verdict as to each respondent on all counts.  The Court of Appeals reversed the convictions and remanded for retrial, concluding that the summation violated respondents' Fifth Amendment rights under Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609.  The court declined to rely on the harmless error doctrine, stating that application of the doctrine ""would impermissibly compromise the clear constitutional violation of the defendants' Fifth Amendment rights.""
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in reversing the convictions apparently on the basis that it had the supervisory power to discipline prosecutors for continuing violations of Griffin, supra, regardless of whether the prosecutor's arguments constituted harmless error.  Pp.  461 U. S. 504-509.
(a) The goals that are implicated by supervisory powers -- implementing a remedy for violation of recognized rights, preserving judicial integrity by ensuring that a conviction rests on appropriate considerations before the jury, and deterring illegal conduct -- are not significant in the context of this case if the errors alleged are harmless.  Reversals of convictions under a court's supervisory power must be approached with some caution and with a view toward balancing the interests involved.  Pp.  461 U. S. 505-507.
(b) Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, held that a Griffin error is not per se error requiring automatic reversal, and that a conviction should be affirmed if the reviewing court concludes that, on the whole record, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is the reviewing court's duty to consider the trial record as a whole and to ignore 
Page 461 U. S. 500
 errors that are harmless, including most constitutional violations.  Here, the Court of Appeals' analysis, in making passing reference to the harmless error doctrine but not applying it, failed to strike the balance between disciplining the prosecutor on the one hand and the interest in the prompt administration of justice and the victims' interests in not being subjected to the burdens of another trial on the other.  Pp.  461 U. S. 507-509.
2. On the whole record, the error identified by the Court of Appeals was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  This Court has the authority to review records to evaluate a harmless error claim, and the pertinent question here is whether, absent the prosecutor's allusion to the failure of the defense to proffer evidence to rebut the victims' testimony, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict.  The victims' testimony negated any doubt as to identification, and neutral witnesses corroborated critical aspects of the victims' testimony, thus establishing a compelling case of guilt.  On the other hand, the scanty evidence tendered by respondents related to their claims of mistaken identity and consent.  The patent inconsistency of these defense theories could hardly have escaped the jurors' attention.  Pp.  461 U. S. 510-512.

Syllabus 
Under  33(b) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (Act), an injured longshoreman who accepts ""compensation under an award in a compensation order filed by the deputy commissioner or [Benefits Review] Board"" has six months in which to file a negligence action against a third party, after which time the longshoreman's cause of action is irrevocably assigned to his employer.  Respondent was injured while working as a longshoreman aboard a vessel that had been chartered by petitioner's predecessor corporation.  Respondent's employer (another company) did not contest his right to compensation under the Act, and filed a form (Form LS-206) with the Labor Department indicating the employer's agreement to make payments to respondent.  Approximately 23 months later, the employer terminated the payment of benefits by filing another form (Form LS-208) with the Department.  Respondent subsequently filed suit in Federal District Court to recover for his injuries, alleging that they had been caused by the vessel charterer's negligence.  The District Court dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that jurisdiction could properly be asserted over petitioner and that, in the absence of a formal compensation order or award entered by the Secretary of Labor, an employee's acceptance of compensation payments could not lead to an assignment of his right of action against third parties.
Held:  Respondent's acceptance of voluntary compensation payments did not constitute acceptance of compensation ""under an award in a compensation order"" so as to give rise to the assignment of his claims against third parties under  33(b).  Pp.  461 U. S. 532-539.
(a) Under the Act's comprehensive scheme governing the rights of an injured longshoreman, the term ""compensation order"" refers specifically to an administrative award of compensation.  Here, no administrative proceedings ever took place.  Although respondent's employer, as required by the Act, filed Forms LS-206 and LS-208 relating to voluntary payment of compensation, nothing in the Act suggests that the filing of the forms is equivalent to an ""award in a compensation order.""  Pp.  461 U. S. 532-535.
(b) The Act's history confirms that ""a compensation order"" does not include a document testifying to an employer's voluntary payment of compensation under the Act.  The requirement of a formal award was 
Page 461 U. S. 530

			"|"Pallas Shipping Agency, Ltd. v. Duris
No. 82-502
Argued April 25, 1983
Decided May 23, 1983
461 U.S. 529

Syllabus 
Under  33(b) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (Act), an injured longshoreman who accepts ""compensation under an award in a compensation order filed by the deputy commissioner or [Benefits Review] Board"" has six months in which to file a negligence action against a third party, after which time the longshoreman's cause of action is irrevocably assigned to his employer.  Respondent was injured while working as a longshoreman aboard a vessel that had been chartered by petitioner's predecessor corporation.  Respondent's employer (another company) did not contest his right to compensation under the Act, and filed a form (Form LS-206) with the Labor Department indicating the employer's agreement to make payments to respondent.  Approximately 23 months later, the employer terminated the payment of benefits by filing another form (Form LS-208) with the Department.  Respondent subsequently filed suit in Federal District Court to recover for his injuries, alleging that they had been caused by the vessel charterer's negligence.  The District Court dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that jurisdiction could properly be asserted over petitioner and that, in the absence of a formal compensation order or award entered by the Secretary of Labor, an employee's acceptance of compensation payments could not lead to an assignment of his right of action against third parties.
Held:  Respondent's acceptance of voluntary compensation payments did not constitute acceptance of compensation ""under an award in a compensation order"" so as to give rise to the assignment of his claims against third parties under  33(b).  Pp.  461 U. S. 532-539.
(a) Under the Act's comprehensive scheme governing the rights of an injured longshoreman, the term ""compensation order"" refers specifically to an administrative award of compensation.  Here, no administrative proceedings ever took place.  Although respondent's employer, as required by the Act, filed Forms LS-206 and LS-208 relating to voluntary payment of compensation, nothing in the Act suggests that the filing of the forms is equivalent to an ""award in a compensation order.""  Pp.  461 U. S. 532-535.
(b) The Act's history confirms that ""a compensation order"" does not include a document testifying to an employer's voluntary payment of compensation under the Act.  The requirement of a formal award was 
Page 461 U. S. 530
 designed to protect the longshoreman from the unexpected loss of his rights against a negligent third party by acceptance of voluntary compensation payments, and to permit him to make a considered choice among available remedies.  Cf. Bloomer v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 445 U. S. 74; American Stevedores, Inc. v. Porello, 330 U. S. 446.  Pp.  461 U. S. 535-538.

Syllabus 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code) grants tax exemption to certain nonprofit organizations ""no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting to influence legislation.""  Section 170(c)(2) permits taxpayers who contribute to  501(c)(3) organizations to deduct the amount of their contributions on their federal income tax returns.  Section 501(c)(4) grants tax-exempt status to certain nonprofit organizations, but contributions to these organizations are not deductible.  Taxation With Representation of Washington (TWR) is a nonprofit corporation organized to promote its view of the ""public interest"" in the area of federal taxation; it was formed to take over the operation of two other nonprofit organizations, one of which had tax-exempt status under  501(c)(3) and the other under  501(c)(4).  The Internal Revenue Service denied TWR's application for tax-exempt status under  501(c)(3) because it appeared that a substantial part of TWR's activities would consist of attempting to influence legislation.  TWR then brought suit in Federal District Court against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the United States, claiming that  501(c)(3)'s prohibition against substantial lobbying is unconstitutional under the First Amendment by imposing an ""unconstitutional burden"" on the receipt of tax-deductible contributions, and is also unconstitutional under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause because the Code permits taxpayers to deduct contributions to veterans' organizations that.qualify for tax exemption under  501(c)(19).  The District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  501(c)(3) does not violate the First Amendment, but does violate the Fifth Amendment.
Held:
1. Section 501(c)(3) does not violate the First Amendment.  Congress has not infringed any First Amendment rights or regulated any First

 Amendment activity, but has simply chosen not to subsidize TWR's lobbying out of public funds.  Cammarano v. United States, 358 U. S. 498.  Pp.  461 U. S. 545-546.
2. Nor does  501(c)(3) violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  The sections of the Code at issue do not employ any suspect classification.  A legislature's decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe that right, and thus is not subject to strict scrutiny.  It was not irrational for Congress to decide that tax-exempt organizations such as TWR should not further benefit at the expense of taxpayers at large by obtaining a further subsidy for lobbying.  Nor was it irrational for Congress to decide that, even though it will not subsidize lobbying by charities generally, it will subsidize lobbying by veterans' organizations.  Pp.  461 U. S. 546-551.

Argued January 18, 1983
Decided May 23, 1983
461 U.S. 555

Syllabus 
The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, 31 U.S.C.  1101, requires persons knowingly transporting monetary instruments exceeding $5,000 into the United States to file a report with the Customs Service declaring the amount transported.  The Government is authorized under 31 U.S.C.  1102(a) to seize and forfeit any monetary instruments for which the required report was not filed.  On September 10, 1975, claimant Vasquez, upon arrival at Los Angeles International Airport from Canada, declared that she was not carrying more than $5,000 in currency, but a customs inspector discovered and seized from her $8,850 in United States currency.  On September 18, 1975, the Customs Service informed Vasquez by letter that the seized currency was subject to forfeiture and that she had a right to petition for remission or mitigation.  A week later, she filed such a petition.  Thereafter, from October, 1975, to April, 1976, the Customs Service, suspecting Vasquez of narcotics violations, conducted an investigation of the petition, but concluded, after contacting federal, state, and Canadian law enforcement officials, that there was no evidence of any violations.  Vasquez, however, was indicted in June, 1976, for, and convicted in December, 1976, of, knowingly and willfully making false statements to a customs officer.  In March, 1977, a complaint seeking forfeiture of the currency under 31 U.S.C.  1102(a) was filed in Federal District Court.  Vasquez claimed that the 18-month delay between the seizure of the currency and the filing of the forfeiture action violated her right to due process, but the District Court held that the time that had elapsed was reasonable under the circumstances and declared the currency forfeited.  The Court of Appeals reversed and ordered dismissal of the forfeiture action.
Held:  On the facts, the Government's 18-month delay in filing a civil proceeding for forfeiture of the currency did not violate the claimant's right to due process of law.  Pp.  461 U. S. 562-570.
(a) The balancing test of Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, developed to determine when Government delay has abridged the right to a speedy trial, provides the relevant framework for determining whether the 
Page 461 U. S. 556
 delay in filing a forfeiture action was reasonable.  That test involves a weighing of four factors:  length of the delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.  Pp.  461 U. S. 562-565.
(b) In this case, the balance of factors under the Barker test indicates that the Government's delay in instituting civil forfeiture proceedings was reasonable.  Although the 18-month delay was a substantial period of time, it was justified where there is no evidence that the Government's investigation of the petition for remission or mitigation was not pursued with diligence or that the Government was responsible for the slow pace of the criminal proceedings.  Nor is there any evidence that Vasquez desired early commencement of a civil forfeiture proceeding, she never having used the available remedies to seek return of the seized currency, and she has never alleged or shown that the delay prejudiced her ability to defend against the forfeiture.

The District Court denied relief in respondent's habeas corpus proceedings, holding that certain statements made by him and introduced in evidence against him in his Arizona murder trial were voluntary.  Relying on Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200, which requires the exclusion of custodial statements following an arrest that violates the Fourth Amendment, unless the circumstances show the attenuation of the taint of the illegal arrest, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court should have permitted respondent to argue the Fourth Amendment issue, and that the record established that his custodial statements were obtained in violation of Dunaway.
Held:  Federal courts may not, on a state prisoner's habeas corpus petition, consider a claim that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment should have been excluded at his trial, when the prisoner has had an opportunity for full and fair litigation of that claim in the state courts.  Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465.  Thus, the Court of Appeals should not have considered the Fourth Amendment Dunaway issue, and on remand should only review the District Court's decision on the Fifth Amendment issue of the voluntariness of respondent's statements.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 23, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Maryland. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice BLACKMUN join, dissenting. 
 Maryland requires criminal defendants, upon request, to provide the State with the name and address of each alibi witness they wish to call at trial. Md.Rule Proc. 741. As a sanction for failure to abide by this rule, the trial court has the discretion to prohibit the defendant from introducing the testimony of an undisclosed alibi witness. Ibid. This case presents the question whether the exclusion of a witness merely for failure to abide by a discovery rule such as Rule 741 impermissibly infringes upon a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to offer witnesses on his behalf. See Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 302, 1049 (1973); Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 1923 (1967). 
 On the second day of trial in the present case, petitioner sought to call Edward Rich as an alibi witness, even though Rich had not been named in response to the State's Rule 741 request. The State indicated that it would have no objection to Rich's testifying if the case were continued for a few days, so that an investigation of Rich could be conducted. The trial court declined to order a continuance; instead, it ordered that Rich not be permitted to testify. The court did not find 
Page 461 U.S. 948 , 949
 that petitioner's violation of Rule 741 was deliberate; rather, it found that petitioner had not been ""diligent"" and ""hadn't made any real effort, except yesterday, to locate this witness."" App. to Petn. for Cert. A-90-A- 91. The court's ruling severely prejudiced petitioner, since alibi was his only defense, and Rich was his only alibi witness. Petitioner was convicted, and the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed by a 4-3 vote. 456 A.2d 29 (Md.1983). The dissent vigorously protested that where, as here, the sanction of exclusion deprives a defendant of his only alibi witness, the violation of the discovery rule is not deliberate, and any prejudice to the prosecution can be cured by a short continuance, the exclusionary sanction violates the defendant's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. 456 A.2d, at 41 (Eldridge, J., dissenting). 
 This Court has twice expressly reserved judgment on this Sixth Amendment question. Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 472, n. 4, 2211, n. 4 (1973); Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 83, n. 14, 1897, n. 14 (1970). Respondent concedes that the question is significant. Brief in Opposition 1. At least one federal Court of Appeals has flatly held ""that the compulsory process clause of the sixth amendment forbids the exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence solely as a sanction to enforce discovery rules or orders against criminal defendants."" United States v. Davis, 639 F.2d 239, 243 (CA5 1981). Accord, Hackett v. Mulcahy, 493 F.Supp. 1329 (D NJ 1980). See also Ronson v. Commissioner of Corrections, 604 F.2d 176 (CA2 1979). The American Bar Association and several scholarly writers have also found arguable constitutional infirmity in the exclusionary sanction. See 2 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 11-4.7(a), and accompanying commentary ( 2d ed. 1980); Clinton, The Right to Present a Defense: An Emergent Constitutional Guarantee in Criminal Trials, 9 Ind.L.Rev. 711, 838-839 ( 1976); Westen, The Compulsory Process Clause, 73 Mich.L.Rev. 71, 137-139 ( 1974); Note, 81 Yale L.J. 1342 (1972).

Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 83, n. 14, 1897, n. 14 (1970). Respondent concedes that the question is significant. Brief in Opposition 1. At least one federal Court of Appeals has flatly held ""that the compulsory process clause of the sixth amendment forbids the exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence solely as a sanction to enforce discovery rules or orders against criminal defendants."" United States v. Davis, 639 F.2d 239, 243 (CA5 1981). Accord, Hackett v. Mulcahy, 493 F.Supp. 1329 (D NJ 1980). See also Ronson v. Commissioner of Corrections, 604 F.2d 176 (CA2 1979). The American Bar Association and several scholarly writers have also found arguable constitutional infirmity in the exclusionary sanction. See 2 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 11-4.7(a), and accompanying commentary ( 2d ed. 1980); Clinton, The Right to Present a Defense: An Emergent Constitutional Guarantee in Criminal Trials, 9 Ind.L.Rev. 711, 838-839 ( 1976); Westen, The Compulsory Process Clause, 73 Mich.L.Rev. 71, 137-139 ( 1974); Note, 81 Yale L.J. 1342 (1972).

461 U.S. 375

Syllabus 
Appellant is a customer-owned rural power cooperative established with loan funds and technical assistance provided by the federal Rural Electrification Administration (REA), but unlike most such cooperatives, which provide power directly to consumers, appellant's sole members and primary customers are 17 smaller Arkansas rural power cooperatives which, in turn, serve the ultimate consumer.  Although tied into an interstate ""grid"" arrangement with other producers, appellant obtains most of its energy from powerplants located in Arkansas, which it wholly or partially owns, and sells most of what it generates to its member cooperatives.  Appellee Arkansas Public Service Commission entered an order asserting jurisdiction over the wholesale rates charged by appellant to its member cooperatives, concluding that state regulation was neither forbidden by Public Utilities Comm'n of R. I. v. Attleboro Steam & Electric Co., 273 U. S. 83 -- which held that, while consistent with the Commerce Clause, the States could regulate retail sales of electricity, they could not regulate wholesale sales -- nor preempted by the Federal Power Act or the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.  On review, the Pulaski County Circuit Court set aside appellee's order, but the Arkansas Supreme Court reversed.
Held:
1. Appellee's assertion of jurisdiction over the wholesale rates charged by appellant to its members does not offend the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.  Pp.  461 U. S. 383-389.
(a) Neither the Federal Power Act nor administrative actions taken thereunder preempt state regulation.  The Federal Power Commission determined in 1967 that it did not have jurisdiction under the Act over the wholesale rates charged by rural power cooperatives under the supervision of the REA, and such decision was based on the Commission's conclusion that the relevant statutes gave the REA exclusive authority among federal agencies to regulate rural power cooperatives, not on a conclusion that, as a matter of policy, such cooperatives that are engaged in sales for resale should be left unregulated.  Pp.  461 U. S. 383-385.
(b) The Rural Electrification Act does not expressly preempt state rate regulation of power cooperatives financed by the REA, and the legislative history of the Act establishes that, although the REA was expected to assist the fledgling rural power cooperatives in setting their 
Page 461 U. S. 376
 rate structures, it would do so within the constraints of existing state regulatory schemes.  In addition, the REA's present policy is wholly inconsistent with preemption of state regulatory jurisdiction over wholesale rates.  Pp.  461 U. S. 385-389.
2. Appellee's assertion of regulatory jurisdiction over wholesale rates does not offend the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  461 U. S. 389-395.
(a) If the mechanical wholesale/retail test articulated in Attleboro, supra, were applied here, it would require setting aside appellee's assertion of jurisdiction.  However, the general trend in this Court's modern Commerce Clause jurisprudence is to look in every case to the nature of the state regulation involved, the State's objective, and the effect of the regulation upon the national interest in the commerce involved, and that modern jurisprudence, rather than the mechanical line drawn in Attleboro, must govern the decision here.  Pp.  461 U. S. 389-393.
(b) ""Where [a] statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits,"" Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137,  397 U. S. 142.  Economic protectionism is not implicated here, and state regulation of the wholesale rates charged by appellant to its members is well within the scope of ""legitimate local public interests,"" particularly considering that, although appellant is tied into an interstate grid, its basic operation consists of supplying power from generating facilities located within the State to member cooperatives, all of which are located within the State.  Although appellee's regulation of appellant's rates charged to its members will have an incidental effect on interstate commerce, ""the burden imposed on such commerce is not clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.""

461 U.S. 402

Syllabus 
Section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) was designed to encourage the development of cogeneration facilities and small power production facilities and to reduce the demand for fossil fuels.  Section 210(a) directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to prescribe rules requiring electric utilities to deal with qualifying cogeneration and small power facilities.  With respect to utilities' purchases of electricity from such facilities,  210(b) provides that rates set by FERC ""shall be just and reasonable to the electric consumers of the electric utility and in the public interest,"" shall not discriminate against qualified cogeneration and small power facilities, and shall not exceed ""the incremental cost to the electric utility of alternative electric energy.""  Following rulemaking proceedings, FERC promulgated a rule requiring utilities to purchase electric energy from a qualifying facility at a rate equal to the utility's ""full avoided cost,"" i.e., the cost to the utility which, but for the purchase from the qualifying facility, would be incurred by the utility in generating the electricity itself or purchasing the electricity from another source.  FERC also promulgated a rule requiring utilities to make such physical interconnections with cogenerators and small power producers as are necessary to effect purchases or sales of electricity authorized by PURPA.  Upon review, the Court of Appeals vacated both rules, holding that FERC had not adequately explained its adoption of the full-avoided-cost rule, and that it exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating the interconnection rule, in view of  210(e)(3) of PURPA, which provides that ""[n]o qualifying small power production facility or qualifying cogeneration facility may be exempted under this subsection from"" specified provisions of the Federal Power Act (FPA) which require FERC to afford an opportunity for a hearing before ordering an interconnection.
Held:
1. FERC did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in promulgating the full-avoided-cost rule, which is the maximum rate permissible under 
Page 461 U. S. 403
  210(b).  Such rule plainly satisfies the requirement of  210(b) that the rate not discriminate against qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities.  FERC also adequately explained why the rate is ""just and reasonable to the electric consumers of the electric utility and in the public interest.""  Both the statutory language and the legislative history confirm that Congress did not intend to impose traditional ratemaking concepts on sales by qualifying facilities to utilities.  And although FERC recognized that the rule would not directly provide any rate savings to consumers, it reasonably deemed it more important at this time that the rule would provide a significant incentive for the development of cogeneration and small power production, and that ratepayers and the Nation as a whole will benefit from the decreased reliance on scarce fossil fuels and the more efficient use of energy.  Pp.  461 U. S. 412-418.
2. Nor did FERC exceed its authority in promulgating the interconnection rule.  The authority granted by  210(a) to promulgate such rules as are necessary to require utilities to deal with qualifying facilities plainly encompasses the power to promulgate rules requiring utilities to make physical connections with such facilities, and FERC reasonably interpreted  210(e)(3) as forbidding it to exempt qualifying facilities from being the ""target"" of interconnection applications by other facilities under the FPA, but not as forbidding it to grant qualifying facilities the right to obtain interconnections under PURPA without applying for an order under the FPA.  Such interpretation is supported by the purposes of PURPA and the statutory scheme created by both Acts.  Pp.  461 U. S. 418-423.

Syllabus 
Respondents, on behalf of all persons involuntarily confined in the forensic unit of a Missouri state hospital, brought suit in Federal District Court against petitioner hospital officials, challenging the constitutionality of treatment and conditions at the hospital.  The District Court, after a trial, found constitutional violations in five of the six general areas of treatment.  Subsequently, respondents filed a request for attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.  1988, which provides that, in federal civil rights actions, ""the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.""  After determining that respondents were prevailing parties under  1988 even though they had not succeeded on every claim, the District Court refused to eliminate from the attorney's fees award the hours spent by respondents' attorneys on the unsuccessful claims, finding that the significant extent of the relief clearly justified the award of a reasonable attorney's fee.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court did not properly consider the relationship between the extent of success and the amount of the attorney's fee award.  The extent of a plaintiff's success is a crucial factor in determining the proper amount of an attorney's fee award under  1988.  Where the plaintiff failed to prevail on a claim unrelated to the successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee.  Where a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney's fee reduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention raised.  But where the plaintiff achieved only limited success, the court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained.  Pp.  461 U. S. 429-440.

461 U.S. 458

Syllabus 
To be entitled to disability benefits under the Social Security Act, a person must not only be unable to perform his former work but must also be unable, considering his age, education, and work experience, to perform any other kind of gainful work that exists in the national economy.  Prior to 1978, in cases where a claimant was found unable to pursue his former occupation, but his disability was not so severe as to prevent his pursuing any gainful work, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) relied on vocational experts to determine whether jobs existed in the national economy that the claimant could perform.  In 1978, to improve the uniformity and efficiency of such determinations, the Secretary promulgated medical-vocational guidelines setting forth rules to establish whether such jobs exist.  If a claimant's qualifications correspond to the job requirements identified by a rule, the guidelines direct a conclusion as to whether work exists that the claimant can perform.  If such work exists, the claimant is not considered disabled.  After respondent's application for disability benefits was denied, she requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, who, relying on the guidelines, found that jobs existed that a person of respondent's qualifications could perform, and accordingly concluded that she was not disabled.  Both the Social Security Appeals Council and the District Court upheld this determination. But the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the guidelines did not provide adequate evidence of specific alternative jobs that respondent could perform, that, in the absence of such evidence, respondent was deprived of any chance to present evidence that she could not perform the types of jobs identified by the guidelines, and that therefore the determination that she was not disabled was not supported by substantial evidence.
Held:  The Secretary's use of the medical-vocational guidelines to determine a claimant's right to disability benefits does not conflict with the Social Security Act, nor are the guidelines arbitrary or capricious.  Pp.  461 U. S. 465-470.
(a) While the statutory scheme contemplates that disability hearings will be individualized determinations based on evidence, this does not bar the Secretary from relying on rulemaking to resolve certain classes of issues.  The determination as to whether jobs exist that a person having 
Page 461 U. S. 459
 the claimant's qualifications could perform requires the Secretary to determine a factual issue that is not unique to each claimant, and may be resolved as fairly through rulemaking as by introducing testimony of vocational experts at each disability hearing.  To require the Secretary to relitigate the existence of jobs in the national economy at each hearing would hinder an already overburdened agency.  Pp.  461 U. S. 465-468.
(b) The principle of administrative law that, when an agency takes official or administrative notice of facts, a litigant must be given an adequate opportunity to respond is inapplicable where, as in this case, the agency has promulgated valid regulations.  When the accuracy of such facts has been tested fairly during rulemaking, the rulemaking proceeding itself provides sufficient procedural protection.  Pp.  461 U. S. 468-470.

Page 461 U. S. 459
 the claimant's qualifications could perform requires the Secretary to determine a factual issue that is not unique to each claimant, and may be resolved as fairly through rulemaking as by introducing testimony of vocational experts at each disability hearing.  To require the Secretary to relitigate the existence of jobs in the national economy at each hearing would hinder an already overburdened agency.  Pp.  461 U. S. 465-468.
(b) The principle of administrative law that, when an agency takes official or administrative notice of facts, a litigant must be given an adequate opportunity to respond is inapplicable where, as in this case, the agency has promulgated valid regulations.  When the accuracy of such facts has been tested fairly during rulemaking, the rulemaking proceeding itself provides sufficient procedural protection.  Pp.  461 U. S. 468-470.

North Dakota filed suit in Federal District Court against several federal officials to resolve a dispute as to ownership of certain portions of a riverbed within the State.  The United States claims title to most of the disputed area on the basis of its status as a riparian landowner on a nonnavigable river, while the State asserts that the river was navigable when North Dakota was admitted to the Union in 1889, and thus it owns the riverbed under the equal-footing doctrine.  In addition to seeking injunctive, declaratory, and mandamus relief under various federal statutes, North Dakota asserted a claim under the Quiet Title Act of 1972 (QTA), by which the United States, subject to certain exceptions, has waived its sovereign immunity and has permitted plaintiffs to name it as a party defendant in civil actions to adjudicate title disputes involving real property.  After trial, the court entered judgment for the State, holding that the QTA's 12-year statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C.  2409a(f), does not apply where the plaintiff is a State.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The legislative history establishes that Congress intended the QTA to provide the exclusive means by which adverse claimants can challenge the United States' title to real property.  Thus there is no merit to North Dakota's contention that, even if suit under the QTA is time-barred under  2409a(f), the judgment below is still correct because the suit is maintainable as an ""officer's suit"" for injunctive or mandamus relief against the federal officials charged with supervision of the disputed area.  The rule that a precisely drawn, detailed statute preempts more general remedies is applicable here.  Cf. Brown v. GSA, 425 U. S. 820.  Pp.  461 U. S. 280-286.
2. The limitations provision in  2409a(f) is as fully applicable to a State as it is to all others who sue under the QTA.  When Congress attaches 
Page 461 U. S. 274
 conditions, such as a statute of limitations, to legislation waiving the United States' sovereign immunity, those conditions must be strictly observed, and exceptions thereto are not to be lightly implied.  Section 2409a(f) expressly states that any civil action is time-barred unless filed within 12 years after the date it accrued.  Even assuming that the canon of statutory construction that a sovereign is normally exempt from the operation of a generally worded statute of limitations in the absence of express contrary intent has relevance in construing the applicability to the States of a congressionally imposed statute of limitations not expressly including the States, here the legislative history shows that Congress did not intend to exempt the States from compliance with  2409a(f).  Pp.  461 U. S. 286-290.
3. Nor is  209a(f) invalid under the equal-footing doctrine and the Tenth Amendment, as North Dakota asserts.  A federal law depriving a State of land vested in it by the Constitution would not be invalid on such grounds, but would constitute a taking of the State's property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Section 2409a(f), however, does not purport to strip anyone of any property or to effectuate a transfer of title.  A dismissal pursuant to the statute does not quiet title to the disputed land in the United States; the title dispute remains unresolved.  Thus, there is no constitutional infirmity in  2409a(f).  Pp.  461 U. S. 291-292.
4. If North Dakota's suit is barred by  2409a(f), the courts below had no jurisdiction to inquire into the merits.  Since the lower courts made no findings as to the date on which North Dakota's suit accrued for purposes of the statute, the cases must be remanded for further proceedings.  Pp.  461 U. S. 292-293.

461 U.S. 300

Syllabus 
Section 72(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC) provides that liabilities involved in the sale or exchange of a partnership interest are to be treated ""in the same manner as liabilities in connection with the sale or exchange of property not associated with partnerships.""  Under  1001(a) of the IRC, the gain or loss from a sale or other disposition of property is defined as the difference between ""the amount realized"" on the disposition and the property's adjusted basis.  Section 1001(b) defines the ""amount realized"" as ""the sum of any money received plus the fair market value of the property (other than money) received.""  A general partnership formed by respondents in 1970 to construct an apartment complex entered into a $1,851,500 nonrecourse mortgage loan with a savings association.  The complex was completed in 1971.  Due to the partners' capital contributions to the partnership and income tax deductions for their allocable shares of ordinary losses and depreciation, the partnership's claimed adjusted basis in the property in 1972 was $1,455,740.  Because of an unanticipated reduction in rental income, the partnership was unable to make the payments due on the mortgage.  Each partner thereupon sold his interest to a third party, who assumed the mortgage.  The fair market value on the date of transfer did not exceed $1,400,000.  Each partner reported the sale on his income tax return and indicated a partnership loss of $55,740.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, however, determined that the sale resulted in a partnership gain of approximately $400,000 on the theory that the partnership had realized the full amount of the nonrecourse obligation.  The United States Tax Court upheld the deficiencies, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  When a taxpayer sells or disposes of property encumbered by a nonrecourse obligation exceeding the fair market value of the property sold, as in this case, the Commissioner may require him to include in the ""amount realized"" the outstanding amount of the obligation; the fair market value of the property is irrelevant to this calculation.  Cf. Crane v. Commissioner, 331 U. S. 1.  Pp.  461 U. S. 304-317. 
Page 461 U. S. 301

(a) When the mortgagor's obligation to repay the mortgage loan is canceled, he is relieved of his responsibility to repay the sum he originally received, and thus realizes value to that extent within the meaning of  1001(b).  To permit the taxpayer to limit his realization to the fair market value of the property would be to recognize a tax loss for which he has suffered no corresponding economic loss.  A taxpayer must account for the proceeds of obligations he has received tax-free and has included in basis.  Nothing in either  1001(b) or in this Court's prior decisions requires the Commissioner to permit a taxpayer to treat a sale of encumbered property asymmetrically, by including the proceeds of the nonrecourse obligation in basis but not accounting for the proceeds upon transfer of the property.  Pp.  461 U. S. 304-319.
(b) Section 752(c) of the IRC -- which provides that, for purposes of  752,
""a liability to which property is subject shall, to the extent of the fair market value of such property, be considered as a liability of the owner of the property""
-- does not authorize this type of asymmetrical treatment in the sale or disposition of partnership property.  Rather, the legislative history indicates that the fair market value limitation of  752(c) was intended to apply only to transactions between a partner and his partnership under  752(a) and (b), and was not intended to limit the amount realized in a sale or exchange of a partnership interest under  752(d).  Pp.  461 U. S. 314-317.

Texas Education Code  21.031(d) permits a school district to deny tuition-free admission to its public schools for a minor who lives apart from a ""parent, guardian, or other person having lawful control of him"" if his presence in the district is ""for the primary purpose of attending the public free schools.""  Petitioner's brother left his parents' home in Mexico to live with petitioner in McAllen, Tex., for the primary purpose of attending school there.  When the School District denied her brother's application for tuition-free admission, petitioner, as his next friend, and other custodians of school-age children brought an action in Federal District Court, alleging that  21.031(d) is unconstitutional on its face.  The District Court granted judgment for the defendants, holding that  21.031(d) was justified by the State's legitimate interests in protecting and preserving the quality of its educational system and the right of its bona fide residents to attend state schools on a preferred tuition basis.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 21.031 is a bona fide residence requirement that satisfies constitutional standards.  Pp.  461 U. S. 325-333.
(a) A bona fide residence requirement, appropriately defined and uniformly applied, furthers the substantial state interest in assuring that services provided for the State's residents are enjoyed only by residents.  Such a requirement with respect to attendance in public free schools does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment nor burden the constitutional right of interstate travel.  A bona fide residence requirement simply requires that the person establish residence before demanding the services that are restricted to residents.  Moreover, in the public school context, the fact that provision for primary and secondary education is one of the most important functions of local government is an adequate justification for local residence requirements.  Absent such requirements, the proper planning and operation of the schools would suffer significantly.  Pp.  461 U. S. 325-330.
(b) At the very least, a school district generally would be justified in requiring school-age children or their parents to satisfy the traditional, basic residence criteria -- i.e., to live in the district with a bona fide intention of remaining there -- before it treated them as residents.  Section 
Page 461 U. S. 322
 21.031 not only grants the benefits of residency to all who satisfy the traditional residence definition, but goes further and extends those benefits to many children even if they (or their families) do not intend to remain in the district indefinitely.  As long as the child is not living in the district for the sole purpose of attending school, he satisfies the statutory test.  Since there is no indication that this extension of the traditional definition has any impermissible basis, it cannot be said that  21.031(d) violates the Constitution.  Pp.  461 U. S. 330-333.

Syllabus 
A California statute requires persons who loiter or wander on the streets to identify themselves and to account for their presence when requested by a peace officer.  The California Court of Appeal has construed the statute to require a person to provide ""credible and reliable"" identification when requested by a police officer who has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to justify a stop under the standards of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1.  The California court has defined ""credible and reliable"" identification as
""carrying reasonable assurance that the identification is authentic and providing means for later getting in touch with the person who has identified himself.""
Appellee, who had been arrested and convicted under the statute, brought an action in Federal District Court challenging the statute's constitutionality.  The District Court held the statute unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The statute, as drafted and as construed by the state court, is unconstitutionally vague on its face within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to clarify what is contemplated by the requirement that a suspect provide a ""credible and reliable"" identification.  As such, the statute vests virtually complete discretion in the hands of the police to determine whether the suspect has satisfied the statute and must be permitted to go on his way in the absence of probable cause to arrest.

Appellee, who had been arrested and convicted under the statute, brought an action in Federal District Court challenging the statute's constitutionality.  The District Court held the statute unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The statute, as drafted and as construed by the state court, is unconstitutionally vague on its face within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to clarify what is contemplated by the requirement that a suspect provide a ""credible and reliable"" identification.  As such, the statute vests virtually complete discretion in the hands of the police to determine whether the suspect has satisfied the statute and must be permitted to go on his way in the absence of probable cause to arrest.  Pp.  461 U. S. 355-361.

Argued January 17, 1983

461 U.S. 260

Syllabus 
Section 8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) authorizes construction industry employers and unions to enter into so-called ""prehire"" agreements setting the terms and conditions of employment for workers hired by the signatory employer without the union's majority status first having been established under  9 of the Act.  Section 8(f) also provides that such an agreement shall not bar a petition for a representative election under  9.  A local union and a contractors association entered into a Master Labor Agreement which provided that work at jobsites was to be performed only by subcontractors who had signed a labor agreement with the union and that covered employees, including those of subcontractors, must become union members.  The agreement also required employers to make monthly contributions to fringe benefit trust funds on behalf of covered employees.  When petitioner subcontractor began work on a jobsite, it was not a signatory to a labor agreement with the union, and none of its employees on the jobsite were union members.  Upon being notified by representatives of the union and the general contractor that it was required to do so, petitioner became a signatory to the Master Labor Agreement, and its employees signed union cards.  After petitioner submitted monthly reports to the union trust funds, falsely stating that ""no members of this craft were employed during this month,"" petitioner on several occasions postponed audits requested by respondents, the trustees of the funds, to verify the monthly reports.  Respondents then filed suit in Federal District Court under  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act to compel an accounting and to recover payment of any trust fund contributions found to be due.  The District Court entered summary judgment for respondents and ordered payment of unpaid contributions.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Monetary obligations assumed by an employer under a prehire contract authorized by  8(f) may be recovered in a  301 action brought by a union prior to repudiation of the contract by the employer, even though the union has not obtained majority support in the relevant unit.  Pp.  461 U. S. 265-272.
(a) In authorizing  8(f) prehire contracts even though the union's majority status was not first established, Congress recognized that, because of the uniquely temporary, transitory, and sometimes seasonal nature of 
Page 461 U. S. 261
 construction industry employment, unions often would not be able to establish majority support with respect to many bargaining units.  Congress also recognized that an employer must know labor costs in preparing contract bids, and must have available a supply of skilled craftsmen for quick referral.  Pp.  461 U. S. 265-267.
(b) The question presented was not decided by NLRB v. Iron Workers, 434 U. S. 335, which held that  8(b)(7)(C) of the NLRA, prohibiting picketing to force an employer to recognize a union that is not the certified representative of the employees in the relevant unit, was violated by a union's picketing to enforce a  8(f) contract with the employer where the union had failed to request a timely representative election.  That decision was based on Congress' intent, when it enacted  8(f), to protect employees' rights to select their own bargaining representatives, and to ensure that prehire agreements are arrived at voluntarily and are voidable until the union attains majority support in the relevant unit.  However, union enforcement, by way of a  301 suit, of monetary obligations incurred by an employer under a prehire contract prior to its repudiation does not impair the right of employees to select their own bargaining agent, or trench on the voluntary and voidable characteristics of a  8(f) prehire agreement.  Allowing an action such as respondents' vindicates Congress' policies in authorizing prehire contracts to meet problems unique to the construction industry.  When a  8(f) agreement is voluntarily executed, as here, both parties must abide by its terms until it is repudiated.  Pp.  461 U. S. 267-271.

461 U.S. 238

Syllabus 
Petitioner members of a prison ""Program Committee,"" after investigating a breakdown in discipline and the failure of certain programs within the maximum control unit of the Hawaii State Prison outside Honolulu, singled out respondent and another inmate as troublemakers.  After a hearing -- respondent having been notified thereof and having retained counsel to represent him -- the same Committee recommended that respondent's classification as a maximum security risk be continued and that he be transferred to a prison on the mainland.  Petitioner administrator of the Hawaii prison accepted the Committee's recommendation, and respondent was transferred to a California state prison.  Respondent then filed suit against petitioners in Federal District Court, alleging that he had been denied procedural due process because the Committee that recommended his transfer consisted of the same persons who had initiated the hearing, contrary to a Hawaii prison regulation, and because the Committee was biased against him.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that the Hawaii regulations governing prison transfers did not create a substantive liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. An interstate prison transfer does not deprive an inmate of any liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause in and of itself.  Just as an inmate has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular prison within a State so as to implicate the Due Process Clause directly when an intrastate prison transfer is made, Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215; Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U. S. 236, he has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular State.  Statutes and interstate agreements recognize that, from time to time, it is necessary to transfer inmates to prisons in other States.  Confinement in another State is within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the transferring State to impose.  Even when, as here, the transfer involves long distances and an ocean crossing, the confinement remains within constitutional limits.  Pp.  461 U. S. 214-18.
2. Nor do Hawaii's prison regulations create a constitutionally protected liberty interest.  Although a State creates a protected liberty interest 
Page 461 U. S. 239
 by placing substantive limitations on official discretion, Hawaii's prison regulations place no substantive limitations on the prison administrator's discretion to transfer an inmate.  For that matter, the regulations prescribe no substantive standards to guide the Program Committee whose task is to advise the administrator.  Thus, no significance attaches to the fact that the prison regulations require a particular kind of hearing before the administrator can exercise his unfettered discretion.  Pp.  461 U. S. 248-251.

After the Circuit Justice had denied respondent's application for a stay of execution of his death sentence, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, which temporarily stayed the execution.  The Court of Appeals denied the State's motion to vacate the stay, and the State then filed with the Circuit Justice the instant application to vacate the District Court's stay.

There is no merit to respondent's new challenge that the trial court construed in an unconstitutionally broad manner the statutory aggravating factor of his having knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons.  On the facts, there was no violation of the principle established in Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420, that aggravating factors must be construed and applied in a nonarbitrary manner.

461 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
When respondent was charged in California Superior Court with various crimes, including rape, robbery, and burglary, all concerning the same female victim, the court assigned the Deputy Public Defender to defend respondent.  The Deputy Public Defender represented respondent at the preliminary hearing and supervised an extensive investigation.  Shortly before the trial, the Deputy Public Defender was hospitalized for surgery, and six days before the scheduled trial date, a senior trial attorney in the Public Defender's Office was assigned to represent respondent.  After the trial was under way, respondent moved for a continuance, claiming that his newly assigned attorney did not have time to prepare the case.  The attorney, however, told the court that he was fully prepared and ""ready"" for trial, and the court denied a continuance.  Respondent was convicted on some counts, but there was a mistrial on other counts on which the jury could not agree.  A second trial, during which respondent refused to cooperate with his lawyer, also resulted in convictions.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed the convictions on all counts, and the California Supreme Court denied review.  Thereafter, respondent filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, alleging that the California Superior Court abused its discretion in denying a continuance.  The District Court denied the writ.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to counsel with whom the accused has a ""meaningful attorney-client relationship,"" and that the state trial judge abused his discretion

Held:  The state trial court did not violate respondent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel by denying a continuance.  Pp.  461 U. S. 11-15.
(a) Broad discretion must be granted trial courts on matters of continuances.  Here, in the face of an unequivocal and uncontradicted statement by a responsible officer of the court that he was fully prepared and ""ready"" for trial, it was far from an abuse of discretion to deny a continuance.  Nor is there any merit to the claim that the denial of a continuance prevented the substituted attorney from being fully prepared for trial.  Pp.  461 U. S. 11-12.
(b) In holding that the trial judge violated respondent's right to counsel by arbitrarily refusing a continuance that would have permitted the Deputy Public Defender to try the case, the Court of Appeals misread the record and the controlling law and announced a new constitutional standard -- ""meaningful attorney-client relationship"" -- that is unsupported by any authority.  The court erred in reading the record as indicating that respondent timely and in good faith moved for a continuance to permit the Deputy Public Defender to represent him.  On the contrary, the record shows that the trial court was abundantly justified in denying respondent's midtrial motion for a continuance so as to have the Deputy Public Defender represent him.

Syllabus 
Respondent, while an inmate in a Missouri reformatory for youthful first offenders, was harassed, beaten, and sexually assaulted by his cellmates.  He brought suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 in Federal District Court against petitioner, a guard at the reformatory, and others, alleging that his Eighth Amendment rights had been violated.  Because of petitioner's qualified immunity, as a prison guard, from  1983 liability, the trial judge instructed the jury that respondent could recover only if petitioner was guilty of ""gross negligence"" or ""egregious failure to protect"" respondent.   The judge also charged the jury that it could award punitive damages in addition to actual damages if petitioner's conduct was shown to be ""a reckless or callous disregard of, or indifference to, the rights or safety of others.""  The District Court entered judgment on a verdict finding petitioner liable and awarding both compensatory and punitive damages.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Punitive damages are available in a proper case under  1983. While there is little in the legislative history of  1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (from which  1983 is derived) concerning the damages recoverable for the tort liability created by the statute, the availability of punitive damages was accepted as settled law by nearly all state and federal courts at the time of enactment.  Moreover, this Court has rested decisions on related issues on the premise that punitive damages are available under  1983.  Pp.  461 U. S. 34-38.
2. A jury may be permitted to assess punitive damages in a  1983 action when the defendant's conduct involves reckless or callous indifference to the plaintiff's federally protected rights, as well as when it is motivated by evil motive or intent.  The common law, both in 1871 and now, allows recovery of punitive damages in tort cases not only for actual malicious intent, but also for reckless indifference to the rights of others.  Neither the policies nor the purposes of  1983 require a departure from the common law rule.  Petitioner's contention that an actual intent standard is preferable to a recklessness standard because it is less vague, and would more readily serve the purpose of deterrence of future egregious conduct, is unpersuasive.  Cf. Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323.  Pp.  461 U. S. 38-51. 
Page 461 U. S. 31

3. The threshold standard for allowing punitive damages for reckless or callous indifference applies even in a case, such as here, where the underlying standard of liability for compensatory damages is also one of recklessness.  There is no merit to petitioner's contention that actual malicious intent should be the standard for punitive damages because the deterrent purposes of such damages would be served only if the threshold for those damages is higher in every case than the underlying standard for liability in the first instance.  The common law rule is otherwise, and there is no reason to depart from the common law rule in the context of  1983.  Pp.  461 U. S. 51-55.

No. 81-1064
Argued November 2, 1982
Decided April 20, 1983
461 U.S. 95

Syllabus 
Respondent filed suit in Federal District Court against petitioner City of Los Angeles and certain of its police officers, alleging that, in 1976, he was stopped by the officers for a traffic violation, and that, although he offered no resistance, the officers, without provocation or justification, seized him and applied a ""chokehold,"" rendering him unconscious and causing damage to his larynx.  In addition to seeking damages, the complaint sought injunctive relief against petitioner, barring the use of chokeholds except in situations where the proposed victim reasonably appeared to be threatening the immediate use of deadly force.  It was alleged that, pursuant to petitioner's authorization, police officers routinely applied chokeholds in situations where they were not threatened by the use of any deadly force; that numerous persons had been injured as a result thereof; that respondent justifiably feared that any future contact he might have with police officers might again result in his being choked without provocation; and that there was thus a threatened impairment of various rights protected by the Federal Constitution.  The District Court ultimately entered a preliminary injunction against the use of chokeholds under circumstances that did not threaten death or serious bodily injury.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The case is not rendered moot even though, while it was pending in this Court, city police authorities prohibited use of a certain type of chokehold in any circumstances and imposed a 6-month moratorium on the use of another type of chokehold except under circumstances where deadly force was authorized.  The moratorium, by its terms, was not permanent, and thus intervening events have not irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged misconduct.  Pp.  461 U. S. 100-101.
2. The federal courts are without jurisdiction to entertain respondent's claim for injunctive relief.  O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488; Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U. S. 362. Pp. 101-113.
(a) To satisfy the ""case or controversy"" requirement of Art. III, a plaintiff must show that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of the challenged official conduct, and the injury or threat of injury must be ""real and immediate,"" not ""conjectural"" or ""hypothetical.""
""Past exposure to illegal conduct 
Page 461 U. S. 96
 does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.""
O'Shea, supra, at  414 U. S. 495-496.  Pp.  461 U. S. 101-105.
(b) Respondent has failed to demonstrate a case or controversy with petitioner that would justify the equitable relief sought.  That respondent may have been illegally choked by the police in 1976, while presumably affording him standing to claim damages against the individual officers and perhaps against petitioner, does not establish a real and immediate threat that he would again be stopped for a traffic violation, or for any other offense, by an officer who would illegally choke him into unconsciousness without any provocation.  If chokeholds were authorized only to counter resistance to an arrest by a suspect, or to thwart an effort to escape, any future threat to respondent from petitioner's policy or from the conduct of police officers would be no more real than the possibility that he would again have an encounter with the police and that he would either illegally resist arrest or the officers would disobey their instructions and again render him unconscious without any provocation.  The equitable doctrine that cessation of the challenged conduct (here the few seconds while the chokehold was being applied to respondent) does not bar an injunction is not controlling, since respondent's lack of standing does not rest on the termination of the police practice, but on the speculative nature of his claim that he will again experience injury as the result of that practice even if continued.  The rule that a claim does not become moot where it is capable of repetition, yet evades review, is likewise inapposite.  Pp.  461 U. S. 105-110.
(c) Even assuming that respondent's pending damages suit affords him Art. III standing to seek an injunction as a remedy for the claim arising out of the 1976 events, nevertheless the equitable remedy is unavailable because respondent failed to show irreparable injury -- a requirement that cannot be met where there is no showing of any real or immediate threat that the plaintiff will be wronged again.  Nor will respondent's injury allegedly suffered in 1976 go unrecompensed; for that injury, he has an adequate damages remedy at law.  Recognition of the need for a proper balance between state and federal authority counsels restraint in the issuance of injunctions against state officers engaged in the administration of the State's criminal laws in the absence of irreparable injury which is both great and immediate.  Pp.  461 U. S. 111-113.

Syllabus 
Respondent was employed as an Assistant District Attorney in New Orleans with the responsibility of trying criminal cases. When petitioner District Attorney proposed to transfer respondent to prosecute cases in a different section of the criminal court, she strongly opposed the transfer, expressing her view to several of her supervisors, including petitioner.  Shortly thereafter, she prepared a questionnaire that she distributed to the other Assistant District Attorneys in the office concerning office transfer policy, office morale, the need for a grievance committee, the level ,of confidence in supervisors, and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns.  Petitioner then informed respondent that she was being terminated for refusal to accept the transfer, and also told her that her distribution of the questionnaire was considered an act of insubordination.  Respondent filed suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 (1976 ed., Supp. V), alleging that she was wrongfully discharged because she had exercised her constitutionally protected right of free speech.  The District Court agreed, ordered her reinstated, and awarded backpay, damages, and attorney's fees.  Finding that the questionnaire, not the refusal to accept the transfer, was the real reason for respondent's termination, the court held that the questionnaire involved matters of public concern and that the State had not ""clearly demonstrated"" that the questionnaire interfered with the operation of the District Attorney's office.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Respondent's discharge did not offend the First Amendment.  Pp.  461 U. S. 142-154.
(a) In determining a public employee's rights of free speech, the problem is to arrive
""at a balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.""
Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U. S. 563,  391 U. S. 568.  P.  461 U. S. 142.
(b) When a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern, but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not 
Page 461 U. S. 139
 the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee's behavior.  Here, except for the question in respondent's questionnaire regarding pressure upon employees to work in political campaigns, the questions posed do not fall under the rubric of matters of ""public concern.""  Pp.  461 U. S. 143-149.
(c) The District Court erred in imposing an unduly onerous burden on the State to justify respondent's discharge by requiring it to ""clearly demonstrate"" that the speech involved ""substantially interfered"" with the operation of the office.  The State's burden in justifying a particular discharge varies depending upon the nature of the employee's expression.  Pp.  461 U. S. 149-150.
(d) The limited First Amendment interest involved here did not require petitioner to tolerate action that he reasonably believed would disrupt the office, undermine his authority, and destroy the close working relationships within the office.  The question on the questionnaire regarding the level of confidence in supervisors was a statement that carried the clear potential for undermining office relations.  Also, the fact that respondent exercised her rights to speech at the office supports petitioner's fears that the function of his office was endangered.

Syllabus 
Title 40 U.S.C.  13k prohibits the ""display [of] any flag, banner, or device designed or adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization, or movement"" in the United States Supreme Court building or on its grounds, which are defined to include the public sidewalks constituting the outer boundaries of the grounds.  One appellee was threatened with arrest by Court police officers for violation of the statute when he distributed leaflets concerning various causes on the sidewalk in front of the Court.  The other appellee was similarly threatened with arrest for displaying on the sidewalk a picket sign containing the text of the First Amendment.  Appellees then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking an injunction against enforcement of  13k and a declaratory judgment that it was unconstitutional on its face.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  The Court of Appeals, after determining that such dismissal was erroneous, struck down  13k on its face as an unconstitutional restriction on First Amendment rights in a public place.
Held:  Section 13k, as applied to the public sidewalks surrounding the Court building, is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.  Pp.  461 U. S. 175-184.
(a) The conduct of each appellee falls into the statutory ban, and hence it is proper to reach the constitutional question involved.  Pp.  461 U. S. 175-176.
(b) As a general matter, peaceful picketing and leafletting are expressive activities involving ""speech"" protected by the First Amendment.  ""Public places,"" such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, historically associated with the free exercise of expressive activities, are considered, without more, to be ""public forums.""  In such places, the Government may enforce reasonable time, place, and manner regulations, but additional restrictions, such as an absolute prohibition of a particular type of expression, will be upheld only if narrowly drawn to accomplish a compelling governmental interest.  Pp.  461 U. S. 176-178.
(c) The Court grounds are not transformed into ""public forum"" property merely because the public is permitted to freely enter and leave the grounds at practically all times and is admitted to the building during specified hours.  But where the sidewalks forming the perimeter of the grounds are indistinguishable from any other sidewalks in Washington, 
Page 461 U. S. 172
 D.C., they should not be treated any differently, and thus are public forums for First Amendment purposes.  Pp.  461 U. S. 178-180.
(d) Insofar as it totally bans specified communicative activity on the public sidewalks around the Court grounds,  13k cannot be justified as a reasonable place restriction.  A total ban on carrying a flag, banner, or device on the public sidewalks does not substantially serve the purposes of the statute of which  13k is a part -- to provide for the maintenance of law and order on the Court grounds.  Nor do  13k's prohibitions here at issue sufficiently serve the averred purpose of protecting the Court from outside influence or preventing it from appearing to the public that the Court is subject to such influence or that picketing or marching is an acceptable way of influencing the Court, where, as noted, the public sidewalks surrounding the Court grounds are no different than other public sidewalks in the city.

The Court of Appeals, after determining that such dismissal was erroneous, struck down  13k on its face as an unconstitutional restriction on First Amendment rights in a public place.
Held:  Section 13k, as applied to the public sidewalks surrounding the Court building, is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.  Pp.  461 U. S. 175-184.
(a) The conduct of each appellee falls into the statutory ban, and hence it is proper to reach the constitutional question involved.  Pp.  461 U. S. 175-176.
(b) As a general matter, peaceful picketing and leafletting are expressive activities involving ""speech"" protected by the First Amendment.  ""Public places,"" such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, historically associated with the free exercise of expressive activities, are considered, without more, to be ""public forums.""  In such places, the Government may enforce reasonable time, place, and manner regulations, but additional restrictions, such as an absolute prohibition of a particular type of expression, will be upheld only if narrowly drawn to accomplish a compelling governmental interest.  Pp.  461 U. S. 176-178.
(c) The Court grounds are not transformed into ""public forum"" property merely because the public is permitted to freely enter and leave the grounds at practically all times and is admitted to the building during specified hours.  But where the sidewalks forming the perimeter of the grounds are indistinguishable from any other sidewalks in Washington, 
Page 461 U. S. 172
 D.C., they should not be treated any differently, and thus are public forums for First Amendment purposes.  Pp.  461 U. S. 178-180.
(d) Insofar as it totally bans specified communicative activity on the public sidewalks around the Court grounds,  13k cannot be justified as a reasonable place restriction.  A total ban on carrying a flag, banner, or device on the public sidewalks does not substantially serve the purposes of the statute of which  13k is a part -- to provide for the maintenance of law and order on the Court grounds.  Nor do  13k's prohibitions here at issue sufficiently serve the averred purpose of protecting the Court from outside influence or preventing it from appearing to the public that the Court is subject to such influence or that picketing or marching is an acceptable way of influencing the Court, where, as noted, the public sidewalks surrounding the Court grounds are no different than other public sidewalks in the city.  Pp.  461 U. S. 180-183.

461 U.S. 190

Syllabus 
Section 25524.1(b) of the California Public Resources Code provides that before a nuclear powerplant may be built, the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission must determine on a case-by-case basis that there will be ""adequate capacity"" for interim storage of the plant's spent fuel at the time the plant requires such storage.  Section 25524.2 imposes a moratorium on the certification of new nuclear plants until the State Commission finds that there has been developed, and that the United States through its authorized agency has approved, a demonstrated technology or means for the permanent and terminal disposal of high-level nuclear wastes.  Petitioner electric utilities filed an action in Federal District Court seeking a declaration that these provisions, inter alia, are invalid under the Supremacy Clause because they were preempted by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.  The District Court, after finding that the issues presented by the two provisions were ripe for adjudication, held that they were preempted by and in conflict with the Atomic Energy Act.  The Court of Appeals agreed that the challenge to  25524.2 was ripe for review, but found that the challenge to  25524. 1(b) v. as not, because it could not be known whether the State Commission will ever find a nuclear plant's storage capacity to be inadequate.  The court went on to hold that  25524.2 was not designed to provide protection against radiation hazards but was adopted because uncertainties in the nuclear fuel cycle make nuclear power an uneconomical and uncertain source of energy, and therefore that the section was not preempted because  271 and 274(k) of the Atomic Energy Act constituted authorization for States to regulate nuclear powerplants for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.  The court further held that  25524.2 was not invalid as a barrier to fulfillment of the federal goal of encouraging the development of atomic energy.
Held:
1. The challenge to  25524.2 is ripe for judicial review, but the questions concerning  25524.1(b) are not.  Pp. 200-203.

 consideration.""  Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136,  387 U. S. 149.  Both of these factors counsel in favor of finding the challenge to  25524.2 ripe for adjudication.  The question of preemption is predominantly legal, and to require the industry to proceed without knowing whether the moratorium imposed by  25524.2 is valid would impose a palpable and considerable hardship on the utilities, and may ultimately work harm on the citizens of California.  Moreover, if  25524.2 is void as hindering commercial development of atomic energy, delayed resolution would frustrate one of the key purposes of the Atomic Energy Act.  Pp.  461 U. S. 200-202.
(b) Under circumstances where it is uncertain whether the State Commission will ever find a nuclear plant's interim storage capacity to be inadequate, and where, because of this Court's holding infra that  25524.2 is not preempted by federal law, it is unlikely that industry behavior would be uniquely affected by such uncertainty surrounding the interim storage provision, a court should not stretch to reach an early, and perhaps a premature, decision respecting  25524.1(b).  P.  461 U. S. 203.
2. Section 25524.2 is not preempted by the Atomic Energy Act.  Pp.  461 U. S. 203-223.
(a) From the passage of the Atomic Energy Act in 1954, through several revisions, and to the present day, Congress has preserved the dual regulation of nuclear powered electricity generation:  the Federal Government maintains complete control of the safety and ""nuclear"" aspects of energy generation, whereas the States exercise their traditional authority over economic questions such as the need for additional generating capacity, the type of generating facilities to be licensed, land use, and ratemaking.  This Court accepts California's avowed economic, rather than safety, purpose as the rationale for enacting  25524.2, and accordingly the statute lies outside the federally occupied field of nuclear safety regulation.  Pp.  461 U. S. 205-216.
(b) Section 25524.2 does not conflict with federal regulation of nuclear waste disposal, with the decision of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that it is permissible to continue to license reactors, notwithstanding uncertainty surrounding the waste disposal problem, or with Congress' recent passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 directed at that problem.  Because the NRC's decision does not and could not compel a utility to develop a nuclear plant, compliance with both that decision and  25524.2 is possible.  Moreover, because the NRC's regulations are aimed at insuring that plants are safe, not necessarily that they are economical,  25524.2 does not interfere with the objective of those regulations.  And as there is no attempt on California's part to enter the field of developing and licensing nuclear waste disposal technology, a field occupied by the Federal Government,  25524.2 is not preempted any more by the NRC's obligations in the waste disposal 
Page 461 U. S. 192
 field than by its licensing power over the plants themselves.  Nor does it appear that Congress intended, through the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, to make the decision for the States as to whether there is now sufficient federal commitment to fuel storage and waste disposal that licensing of nuclear reactors may resume.  Moreover, that Act can be interpreted as being directed at solving the nuclear waste disposal problem for existing reactors without necessarily encouraging or requiring that future plant construction be undertaken.  Pp.  461 U. S. 217-220.
(c) Section 25524.2 does not frustrate the Atomic Energy Act's purpose to develop the commercial use of nuclear power.  Promotion of nuclear power is not to be accomplished ""at all costs.""  Moreover, Congress has given the States authority to determine, as a matter of economics, whether a nuclear plant vis-a-vis a fossil fuel plant should be built.  California's decision to exercise that authority does not, in itself, constitute a basis for preemption.  Pp.  461 U. S. 220-223.

No. 81-419
Argued January 12, 1983
Decided April 19, 1983
460 U.S. 730

Syllabus 
A Fort Worth, Tex., police officer stopped respondent's automobile at night at a routine driver's license checkpoint, asked him for his license, shined his flashlight into the car, and saw an opaque, green party balloon, knotted near the tip, fall from respondent's hand to the seat beside him.  Based on his experience in drug offense arrests, the officer was aware that narcotics frequently were packaged in such balloons, and while respondent was searching in the glove compartment for his license, the officer shifted his position to obtain a better view and noticed small plastic vials, loose white powder, and an open bag of party balloons in the glove compartment.  After respondent stated that he had no driver's license in his possession and complied with the officer's request to get out of the car, the officer picked up the green balloon, which seemed to contain a powdery substance within its tied-off portion.  Respondent was then advised that he was under arrest, an on-the-scene inventory search of the car was conducted, and other items were seized.  At a suppression hearing in respondent's state court trial for unlawful possession of heroin, a police department chemist testified that heroin was contained in the balloon seized by the officer and that narcotics frequently were so packaged.  Suppression of the evidence was denied, and respondent was convicted.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed, holding that the evidence should have been suppressed because it was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Rejecting the State's contention that the so-called ""plain view"" doctrine justified the seizure, the court concluded that, under Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, for that doctrine to apply, not only must the officer be legitimately in a position to view the object, but also it must be ""immediately apparent"" to the police that they have evidence before them, and thus the officer here had to know that incriminating evidence was before him when he seized the balloon.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
617 S.W.2d 196, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded that the police officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment in seizing the green balloon from respondent's automobile.  The plain view doctrine provides grounds for 
Page 460 U. S. 731
 a warrantless seizure of a suspicious item when the officer's access to the item has some prior justification under the Fourth Amendment.  This rule merely reflects an application of the Fourth Amendment's central requirement of reasonableness to the law governing seizures of property.  Here, the officer's initial stop of respondent's vehicle was valid, and his actions in shining his flashlight into the car and changing his position to see what was inside did not violate any Fourth Amendment rights.  The ""immediately apparent"" language in Coolidge, supra, does not establish a requirement that a police officer ""know"" that certain items are contraband or evidence of a crime.
""The seizure of property in plain view involves no invasion of privacy, and is presumptively reasonable, assuming that there is probable cause to associate the property with criminal activity.""
Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573,  445 U. S. 587.  Probable cause is a flexible, common-sense standard, merely requiring that the facts available to the officer would warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that certain items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime; it does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.  In view of the police officer's testimony here, corroborated by that of the police department chemist, as to the common use of balloons in packaging narcotics, the officer had probable cause to believe that the balloon contained an illicit substance.  Moreover, the requirement of the plain view doctrine under Coolidge, supra, that the officer must discover incriminating evidence ""inadvertently,"" without knowing in advance the location of the particular evidence and intending to seize it by use of the doctrine as a pretext, was no bar to the seizure here.  Pp.  460 U. S. 735-744.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment, concluded that the articulation in Coolidge, supra, of the plain view exception to the Warrant Clause requirements of the Fourth Amendment is dispositive of the issue here.  Respondent conceded that the officer's initial intrusion was lawful, and that the discovery of the tied-off balloon was inadvertent, in that it was observed in the course of a lawful inspection of the front seat area of the automobile.  If probable cause must be shown to justify the seizure, it existed here, in light of the evidence that tied-off balloons are common containers for carrying illegal narcotics.  Moreover, a law enforcement officer may rely on his training and experience to draw inferences and make deductions that might well elude an untrained person.  Pp.  460 U. S. 744-746.
JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL, concurring in the judgment, concluded that, under the ""plain view"" exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, the officer's warrantless temporary seizure of the balloon was proper, but that. before the balloon's contents could be used as evidence, the State

No. 81-1120
Argued January 18, 1983
Decided April 19, 1983
460 U.S. 752

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) summoned respondent Rylander (respondent) to appear before an IRS agent and to produce for examination, and testify with respect to, records of two corporations of which respondent was president.  When respondent failed to comply with the summons, the District Court enforced it and ordered him to produce the corporate records.  Subsequently, after a hearing, the District Court held respondent in civil contempt for failure to comply with the court's enforcement order, finding that he had failed to introduce any evidence in support of his claim that he did not possess the records.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's out-of-court declaration that he did not possess the documents, together with his invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment, required the Government to shoulder the burden of producing evidence that respondent was able to produce the records in question, and that, notwithstanding the issuance of the enforcement order, respondent was free to relitigate the question of his possession or control of the records in the contempt proceeding.
Held:  The Court of Appeals was incorrect both in its view of the relationship between the enforcement proceeding and the contempt proceeding and in its view of the effect of respondent's invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege on the burden of production at the contempt hearing.  Pp.  460 U. S. 756-762.
(a) Because a proceeding to enforce an IRS summons is an adversary proceeding in which the defendant may contest the summons on any appropriate ground, and because lack of possession or control of records is such a ground, the issue may not be raised for the first time in a contempt proceeding.  In the latter proceeding, the defendant may assert a present inability to comply with the enforcement order, but in raising this defense, he has the burden of production.  Thus, while respondent in the contempt hearing could not attack the enforcement order on the ground that he lacked possession or control of the records at the time the order was issued, he could defend the contempt charge on the ground that he was then unable to comply because he lacked possession or control.  Pp.  460 U. S. 756-757. 
Page 460 U. S. 753

(b) While assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege may be a valid ground upon which a witness such as respondent declines to answer questions, it is not a substitute for evidence that would assist in meeting a burden of production.

			"|"United States v. Rylander
No. 81-1120
Argued January 18, 1983
Decided April 19, 1983
460 U.S. 752

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) summoned respondent Rylander (respondent) to appear before an IRS agent and to produce for examination, and testify with respect to, records of two corporations of which respondent was president.  When respondent failed to comply with the summons, the District Court enforced it and ordered him to produce the corporate records.  Subsequently, after a hearing, the District Court held respondent in civil contempt for failure to comply with the court's enforcement order, finding that he had failed to introduce any evidence in support of his claim that he did not possess the records.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's out-of-court declaration that he did not possess the documents, together with his invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment, required the Government to shoulder the burden of producing evidence that respondent was able to produce the records in question, and that, notwithstanding the issuance of the enforcement order, respondent was free to relitigate the question of his possession or control of the records in the contempt proceeding.
Held:  The Court of Appeals was incorrect both in its view of the relationship between the enforcement proceeding and the contempt proceeding and in its view of the effect of respondent's invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege on the burden of production at the contempt hearing.  Pp.  460 U. S. 756-762.
(a) Because a proceeding to enforce an IRS summons is an adversary proceeding in which the defendant may contest the summons on any appropriate ground, and because lack of possession or control of records is such a ground, the issue may not be raised for the first time in a contempt proceeding.  In the latter proceeding, the defendant may assert a present inability to comply with the enforcement order, but in raising this defense, he has the burden of production.  Thus, while respondent in the contempt hearing could not attack the enforcement order on the ground that he lacked possession or control of the records at the time the order was issued, he could defend the contempt charge on the ground that he was then unable to comply because he lacked possession or control.  Pp.  460 U. S. 756-757. 
Page 460 U. S. 753

(b) While assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege may be a valid ground upon which a witness such as respondent declines to answer questions, it is not a substitute for evidence that would assist in meeting a burden of production.  Curcio v. United States, 354 U. S. 118, distinguished.  The Court of Appeals' view would convert the privilege from the shield against compulsory self-incrimination that it was intended to be into a sword whereby a claimant asserting the privilege would be freed from adducing proof in support of a burden that would otherwise have been his.

No. 81-2399
Argued March 1, 1983
Decided April 19, 1983*
460 U.S. 766

Syllabus 
Petitioner Metropolitan Edison Co. (Metropolitan) owns two licensed nuclear plants at Three Mile Island near Harrisburg, Pa.  On a day when one plant (TMI-1) was shut down for refueling, the other plant (TMI-2) suffered a serious accident that damaged the reactor and caused widespread concern.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) then ordered Metropolitan to keep TMI-1 shut down until it could be determined whether the plant could be operated safely, and published a notice of hearing that included an invitation to interested parties to submit briefs on whether psychological harm or other indirect effects of the accident or of renewed operation of TMI-1 should be considered.  Respondent People Against Nuclear Energy (PANE), an association of residents of the Harrisburg area who are opposed to further operation of either TMI reactor, responded to this invitation, contending that restarting TMI-1 would cause both severe psychological damage to persons living in the vicinity and serious damage to the stability, cohesiveness, and wellbeing of neighboring communities.  When the NRC decided not to take evidence of these contentions, PANE filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals, contending that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), inter alia, required the NRC to address its contentions.  The court held that the NRC improperly failed to consider whether the risk of an accident at TMI-1 might cause harm to the psychological health and community wellbeing of residents of the area surrounding Three Mile Island.
Held:  The NRC need not consider PANE's contentions.  Pp. 771-779.
(a) Section 102(C) of NEPA -- which provides that where an agency action significantly affects the quality of the human environment, the agency must evaluate the ""environmental impact"" and any unavoidable adverse ""environmental effects"" of its proposed action -- does not require the agency to assess every impact or effect of its proposed action, but 
Page 460 U. S. 767
 only the impact or effect on the environment.  The statute's context shows that Congress was talking about the physical environment.  Although NEPA states its goals in sweeping terms of human health and welfare, these goals are ends that Congress has chosen to pursue by means of protecting the physical environment.  Pp.  460 U. S. 772-773.
(b) NEPA does not require agencies to evaluate the effects of risk, qua risk.  The terms ""environmental effects"" and ""environmental impact"" in  102(C) should be read to include a requirement of a reasonably close causal relationship between a change in the physical environment and the effect at issue.  Here, the federal action that affects the environment is permitting renewed operation of T-1.  The direct effects of this action include release of low-level radiation, increased fog, and the release of warm water into the Susquehanna River, all of which effects the NRC has considered.  The NRC has also considered the risk of a nuclear accident.  But a risk of an accident is not an effect on the physical environment.  In a causal chain from renewed operation of TMI-1 to psychological health damage, the element of risk and its perception by PANE's members are necessary middle links.  That element of risk lengthens the causal chain beyond NEPA's reach.  Pp.  460 U. S. 773-777.
(c) Regardless of the gravity of the harm alleged by PANE, if a harm does not have a sufficiently close connection to the physical environment, NEPA does not apply.  P.  460 U. S. 778.
(d) That PANE's claim was made in the wake of the accident at TMI-2 is irrelevant.  NEPA is not directed at the effects of past accidents, and does not create a remedial scheme for past federal actions.  Pp.  460 U. S. 778-779.

No. 81-1635
Argued December 6, 1982
Decided April 19, 1983
460 U.S. 780

Syllabus 
An Ohio statute requires an independent candidate for President to file a statement of candidacy and nominating petition in March in order to appear on the general election ballot in November.  On April 24, 1980, petitioner Anderson announced that he was an independent candidate for President.  Thereafter, on May 16, 1980, his supporters tendered a nominating petition and statement of candidacy, satisfying the substantive requirements for ballot eligibility, to respondent Ohio Secretary of State.  Respondent refused to accept the documents because they had not been filed within the time required by the Ohio statute.  Anderson and petitioner voters then filed an action in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the statute.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners and ordered respondent to place Anderson's name on the general election ballot, holding that the statutory deadline was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the early deadline served the State's interest in voter education by giving voters a longer opportunity to see how Presidential candidates withstand the close scrutiny of a political campaign.
Held:  Ohio's early filing deadline places an unconstitutional burden on the voting and associational rights of petitioner Anderson's supporters.  Pp.  460 U. S. 786-806.
(a) In resolving constitutional challenges to a State's election laws, a court must first consider the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate.  It must then identify and evaluate the interests asserted by the State to justify the burden imposed by its rule.  In passing judgment, the Court must not only determine the legitimacy and strength of each of these interests, it must also consider the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff's rights.  Only after weighing all these factors is the court in a position to decide whether the challenged provision is unconstitutional.  Pp.  460 U. S. 786-790. 
Page 460 U. S. 781

(b) The Ohio filing deadline not only burdens the associational rights of independent voters and candidates, it also places a significant state-imposed restriction on a nationwide electoral process.  A burden that falls unequally on independent candidates or on new or small political parties impinges, by its very nature, on associational choices protected by the First Amendment, and discriminates against those candidates and voters whose political preferences lie outside the existing political parties.  And in the context of a Presidential election, state-imposed restrictions implicate a uniquely important national interest, because the President and Vice President are the only elected officials who represent all the voters in the Nation, and the impact of the votes cast in each State affects the votes cast in other States.  Pp.  460 U. S. 790-795.
(c) None of the three interests that Ohio seeks to further by its early filing deadline justifies that deadline.  As to the State's asserted interest in voter education, it is unrealistic in the modern world to suggest that it takes more than seven months to inform the electorate about the qualifications of a particular candidate simply because he lacks a partisan label.  Moreover, it is not self-evident that the interest in voter education is served at all by the early filing deadline.  The State's asserted interest in equal treatment for partisan and independent candidates is not achieved by imposing the early filing deadline on both, since, although a candidate participating in a primary election must declare his candidacy on the same date as an independent, both the burdens and benefits of the respective requirements are materially different, and the reasons for early filing for a primary candidate are inapplicable to independent candidates in the general election.  And the State's asserted interest in political stability amounts to a desire to protect existing political parties from competition generated by independent candidates who have previously been affiliated with a party, an interest that conflicts with First Amendment values.  The Ohio deadline does not serve any state interest ""in maintaining the integrity of the various routes to the ballot"" for the Presidency, because Ohio's Presidential preference primary does not serve to narrow the field for the general election.  Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, distinguished.  The deadline is not drawn to protect the parties from ""intraparty feuding,"" and may actually impair the State's interest in preserving party harmony.  Pp.  460 U. S. 796-806.

460 U.S. 824

Syllabus 
Merck & Co. entered into three fixed-price negotiated contracts with the Defense Supply Agency and one such contract with the Veterans' Administration for the sale of pharmaceutical products to those agencies.  The prices were based on Merck's catalog prices.  As required by statute, each contract contained a standard access-to-records clause granting the Comptroller General the right to examine any ""directly pertinent"" records involving transactions related to the contract.  Relying on these clauses, the Comptroller General, for the stated purpose of reviewing the reasonableness of the contract prices, demanded of Merck access to cost records pertinent to the contracts, including records of costs of direct materials, labor, and overhead, and support for the prices charged.  Merck refused to comply with the demand, and brought an action in Federal District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the Comptroller General's demand exceeded his statutory authority.  The District Court granted partial summary judgment for each party, permitting access to records of direct costs, including manufacturing and delivery costs, but barring access to records of indirect costs, including research and development, marketing and promotion, distribution, and administration costs, except to the extent that these costs were included in the direct costs.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Comptroller General may inspect Merck's records of direct costs, but not records of indirect costs.  Pp.  460 U. S. 830-844.
(a) It is plain from the face of the statutes in question that the words ""directly pertinent"" are words of limitation designed to restrict the class of records to which access is permitted by requiring some close connection between the type of record sought and the particular contract.  The legislative history underscores what the language reflects:  Congress' intention to limit to some degree the Comptroller General's access power.  The legislative history also reveals that Congress sought, in granting this access authority, to equip the General Accounting Office (GAO), 
Page 460 U. S. 825
 which the Comptroller General heads, with a tool to detect fraud, waste, inefficiency, and extravagance in Government contracting.  Given these dual, conflicting congressional aims, in construing the statute, the public interest served by GAO investigations must be balanced against the private interest in freedom from officious governmental intermeddling in the contractor's private business affairs.  Pp.  460 U. S. 830-835.
(b) To define as ""directly pertinent"" the records of any costs defrayed from commingled revenues that include Government payments under the contract would completely eviscerate the congressional goal of protecting the privacy of the contractor's business records by permitting far-ranging governmental scrutiny of records of nongovernmental transactions completely unrelated to either the contract or the product procured under the contract.  P.  460 U. S. 836.
(c) There is no merit to the Government's argument that the GAO has had a consistent and longstanding interpretation of its authority under the access-to-records statutes that supports the view that indirect cost records are subject to examination under the contracts in question.  Pp.  460 U. S. 837-839.
(d) Here, the appropriate balance of public and private interests weighs in favor of access to Merck's direct cost records, but against access to its indirect costs records.  Because direct costs have a direct influence on the price charged the Government, the GAO needs to examine records of these costs to determine whether the contractor is making an excessively high profit or the Government is getting a ""fair deal"" under the contract.  On the other hand, even though indirect costs may influence the setting of a catalog price, nevertheless, the degree of intrusion into the contractor's private business affairs is far greater, particularly where fixed-price contracts are involved.  Pp.  460 U. S. 839-843.
(e) The fact that the records here were sought for the purpose of either conducting an economic study of the pharmaceutical industry or securing information desired by individual Members of Congress did not vitiate the GAO's authority under the statutes to examine directly pertinent records under the contracts in order to determine the reasonableness of the contract prices and to detect inefficiency and wastefulness.

 Chief Justice BURGER, statement concerning the denial of certiorari. 
 The time has come to consider limitations on the availability of the writ of habeas corpus in federal courts, especially

 for prisoners pressing stale claims that were fully ventilated in state courts. Others have expressed frustration in coping with stale cases, see, e.g., Illinois v.

Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 773, 1450 (1970), and this petition underscores the views of those who have expressed concern as to the misuse and abuse of the writ. Relief on claims presented many years after conviction should be limited to cases in which the petitioner can demonstrate a miscarriage of justice or a colorable claim of innocence. The astonishing facts underlying this petition are illustrative and instructive. 
 Justice BLACKMUN would grant certiorari. 
 On October 14, 1965, a jury in King County, Washington, found Arthur Aiken and his co-defendant guilty of murder in the first degree for the robbery and slayings of three gas station attendants in separate incidents within one month. Each victim was shot several times. The jury imposed the death penalty. On direct appeal, Aiken advanced numerous challenges to his conviction. Following a remand to the trial court, the Washington Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and the sentence, 72 Wash.2d 306, 434 P.2d 10 (Wash.1967). On petition for certiorari to this Court, the conviction was vacated and the case remanded for reconsideration in light of Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 ( 1968), 392 U.S. 652 (1968). After a second petition for certiorari, the conviction was again vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light of Maxwell v. Bishop, 398 U.S. 262 (1970), Boulden v. Holman, 394 U.S. 478 (1969), and Witherspoon v. Ill., 391 U.S. 510 (1968), 403 U.S. 946d 856 (1971). The state trial court then resentenced Aiken to three consecutive life prison terms. 
 On July 26, 1979, fourteen years after his original conviction and eight years after his resentencing, Aiken filed this petition in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington under 28 U.S.C. 2254. He raised claims concerning pretrial publicity, the voluntariness of his confession, and the trial court's failure to grant severance- [460 U.S. 1093 , 1095]

Page 460 U.S. 1098 , 1099
 
 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice O'CONNOR join, dissenting. 
 Respondent Norman Longval robbed a drug store in Swampscott, Massachusetts. Longval, who had a previous record for larcenies and had served time for armed robbery, stole the get-away car and carried a shotgun during the robbery. 
 One of Longval's codefendants, Richard Ellard, pleaded guilty. Ellard stated that he was drunk at the time and did not carry the gun. The sentencing judge noted that Ellard had not been in serious trouble before, and sentenced him to three years imprisonment and three years probation with a special term of probation requiring him to obtain treatment for alcoholism. 
 Longval stood trial for armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and unlawfully carrying a sawed-off shotgun, and was convicted. The trial judge sentenced Longval to 40-50 years in prison. The state appellate court later reduced this sentence to 30-40 years. 
 Longval sought a writ of error from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, claiming that the trial judge had improperly threatened him in an effort to coerce him into pleading guilty. The Supreme Judicial Court appointed a special master, who found that during the presentation of the prosecution's case-in-chief, the trial judge told Longval's defense attorney, in substance, that: 
 the evidence in this case as it is coming in is very serious-robbery of a drug store, taking drugs, use of a shot gun. I am wondering if you and the commonwealth have had any discussion regarding a plea [of guilty]. I strongly suggest that you ask your client to consider a plea, because, if the jury returns a verdict of guilty, I might be disposed to impose a substantial prison sentence. You know that I am capable of doing that because you know of the sentences in a previous trial. 693 F.2d 236, 237 (CA1 1982). [460 U.S. 1098 , 1100]

 April 18, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 A defendant's right to due process is violated when the trial judge, in charging the jury on the issue of criminal intent, ""require[s] the jury, if satisfied as to [specified] facts . . ., to find intent unless the defendant offer[s] evidence to the contrary."" Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 515, 2454 (1979). Such a presumption is inconsistent with the constitutional requirement that the State prove every element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970).

 At petitioner's trial on the charge of first-degree murder, the trial judge twice instructed the jury as follows: 
 For reasons fully elaborated by three federal judges who have considered the constitutionality of an identical instruction, the instruction in this case was impermissible because it described a mandatory presumption of intent. See Pigee v. Israel, 670 F.2d 690, 697- 699 (CA7) (Baker, J., dissenting) cert. denied, 459 U.S. --- (1982); Austin v. Israel, 516 F.Supp. 461 (E.D.Wis. 1981); Harris v.

The decision below, which denied petitioner's request for the issuance of a certificate of probable cause to appeal, therefore cannot be squared with Sandstrom.

No. 81-1574
Argued December 1, 1982

460 U.S. 669

Syllabus 
Respondent filed a charge with a Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board (Board), alleging that petitioner Union (Union) had procured his discharge by a company from his position as a ""supervisor"" because he was not a member in good standing with the Union.  Supervisors are expressly excluded from the definition of ""employee"" under the National Labor Relations Act.  The Union's conduct allegedly violated  8(b)(1)(A) of the Act, which proscribes unions from coercing employees in the exercise of their rights under  7 to engage in concerted action, and  8(b)(1)(B), which prohibits unions from coercing employers in the selection of their representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.  The Regional Director refused to issue a complaint, concluding that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the Union had caused respondent's discharge or had coerced the company in the selection of its bargaining representative.  Instead of appealing to the Board's General Counsel, respondent filed suit against the Union and others in a Georgia state court, alleging that the Union had interfered with his employment contract by coercing the company into breaching the contract.  The trial court dismissed the complaint, concluding that the common law tort action was preempted because the subject matter of the complaint was arguably within the Board's exclusive jurisdiction, but the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of the case against the Union.
Held:  Respondent's state court action against the Union is preempted by the National Labor Relations Act.  Pp.  460 U. S. 675-684.
(a) If the conduct that a State seeks to regulate or to make the basis of liability is actually or arguably prohibited or protected by the Act, otherwise applicable state law and procedures are ordinarily preempted.  However, when the conduct at issue is only a peripheral concern of the Act or touches on interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, it cannot be inferred that Congress intended to deprive the State of the power to act, the state regulation or sanction is not preempted.  Pp.  460 U. S. 675-676.
(b) Here, the Union arguably violated  8(b)(1)(A), because it is not unusual for workers in the construction industry, such as respondent, to 
Page 460 U. S. 670
 fluctuate between supervisory and nonsupervisory positions and, in view of the low-level supervisory position that respondent held, it was not unlikely that he would from time to time serve in a nonsupervisory position, and that he might be intimidated by the Union's conduct once he again became a statutory employee.  The Union's conduct also arguably violated  8(b)(1)(B), since it was at least arguable that respondent was a ""supervisor"" within the Act's meaning, his complaint filed with the Regional Director having indicated that he would have collective bargaining responsibilities.  It was for the Board, not the state courts, to decide whether respondent was the kind of supervisor who could invoke  8(b)(1)(B).  Cf. Iron Workers v. Perko, 373 U. S. 701.  Pp.  460 U. S. 678-680.
(c) Preemption cannot be avoided on the theory that the Regional Director concluded that the Board lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the complaint because of respondent's supervisory status, since the Regional Director instead addressed the merits of the complaint.  Nor did the Regional Director's rejection of the complaint for insufficient evidence satisfy all of the federal law interests involved, so as to clear the way for a state cause of action.  The preemption doctrine not only mandates substantive preemption by the federal law in the areas to which it applies, but also protects the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board over matters arguably within the Act's reach.  Nor can preemption be avoided on the asserted grounds that the state cause of action and the  8(b)(1)(B) unfair labor practice charge were not sufficiently alike, Sears Roebuck & Co. v. Carpenters, 436 U. S. 180, distinguished; or that respondent should be permitted to proceed in the state court because he could be awarded punitive damages and attorney's fees there, whereas he would be limited to backpay if his complaint had gone forward before the Board.

No. 81-1664
Argued January 11, 1983
Decided April 4, 1983
460 U.S. 693

Syllabus 
Despite a no-strike clause in the collective bargaining agreement between petitioner employer and the Electrical Workers union, which represented over half of petitioner's employees, union members participated in four unlawful work stoppages between 1970 and 1974, and on each occasion petitioner disciplined the local union officials more severely than the other participants.  Twice the union filed a grievance because of the disparate treatment accorded its officials, and in both cases the arbitrators upheld petitioner's actions, finding that union officials have an affirmative duty to uphold the bargaining agreement, the breach of which duty justified petitioner's imposition of more severe sanctions.  Subsequently, in 1977, an unrelated union, the Operating Engineers, set up an informational picket line at the entrance to the site where petitioner was constructing a nuclear generating station.  Electrical Workers union members refused to cross the picket line.  Eventually, after a settlement between the Operating Engineers and petitioner was reached, the picket line came down and the union's members returned to work.  Petitioner then disciplined all of its employees who had refused to cross the picket line by imposing 5- to 10-day suspensions, but imposed 25-day suspensions on two local Electrical Workers officials for failure to attempt to end the strike by crossing the picket line.  The Electrical Workers union filed an unfair labor practice charge against petitioner, and the National Labor Relations Board affirmed the Administrative Law Judge's holding that the selective discipline of union officials violated  8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer
""by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.""
The Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order, holding that an employer may impose greater discipline on union officials only when the collective bargaining agreement specifies that the officials have an affirmative duty to prevent illegal work stoppages, and that, if the agreement does not provide for such a duty, any disparate treatment of union officials violates  8(a)(3).  The court rejected petitioner's argument that the two earlier arbitration

 awards were sufficient to impose a contractual duty on the union officials to cross the picket line.
Held:  In the absence of an explicit contractual duty, the imposition of more severe sanctions on union officials than on other employees for participating in an unlawful work stoppage violates  8(a)(3).  Pp.  460 U. S. 699-710.
(a) Section 8(a)(3) not only proscribes discrimination that affects union membership, it also makes unlawful discrimination against employees who participate in concerted activities protected by  7 of the Act.  Holding union office clearly falls within such protected activities, and an employer's unilateral imposition of discipline on union officials inhibits qualified employees from holding office.  While the disruptive effect of wildcat strikes makes it important to ensure compliance with no-strike clauses, it does not follow that an employer may assume that a union official is required to attempt to enforce a no-strike clause by complying with the employer's directions, and may impose a penalty on the official for declining to comply.  The imposition of such a penalty violates  8(a)(3).  The Board's decision here furthers Congress' policy in seeking to avoid the dilemma presented to the union official whereby his failure to comply with the employer's direction would place his job in jeopardy but compliance might cause him to take actions that would diminish the respect and authority necessary to perform his job as a union official.  Pp.  460 U. S. 699-705.
(b) While a union may waive the protection afforded union officials against the imposition of more severe sanctions than those imposed on other employees for participating in an unlawful work stoppage, no waiver occurred here.  Such a waiver must be clear and unmistakable, and the two prior arbitration awards did not establish a pattern of decisions clear enough to convert the union's silence after those awards were made into a binding waiver.  There is no showing that the parties intended to incorporate those awards into the subsequent agreement.  Pp.  460 U. S. 705-710.

No. 81-1664
Argued January 11, 1983
Decided April 4, 1983
460 U.S. 693

Syllabus 
Despite a no-strike clause in the collective bargaining agreement between petitioner employer and the Electrical Workers union, which represented over half of petitioner's employees, union members participated in four unlawful work stoppages between 1970 and 1974, and on each occasion petitioner disciplined the local union officials more severely than the other participants.  Twice the union filed a grievance because of the disparate treatment accorded its officials, and in both cases the arbitrators upheld petitioner's actions, finding that union officials have an affirmative duty to uphold the bargaining agreement, the breach of which duty justified petitioner's imposition of more severe sanctions.  Subsequently, in 1977, an unrelated union, the Operating Engineers, set up an informational picket line at the entrance to the site where petitioner was constructing a nuclear generating station.  Electrical Workers union members refused to cross the picket line.  Eventually, after a settlement between the Operating Engineers and petitioner was reached, the picket line came down and the union's members returned to work.  Petitioner then disciplined all of its employees who had refused to cross the picket line by imposing 5- to 10-day suspensions, but imposed 25-day suspensions on two local Electrical Workers officials for failure to attempt to end the strike by crossing the picket line.  The Electrical Workers union filed an unfair labor practice charge against petitioner, and the National Labor Relations Board affirmed the Administrative Law Judge's holding that the selective discipline of union officials violated  8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer
""by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.""
The Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order, holding that an employer may impose greater discipline on union officials only when the collective bargaining agreement specifies that the officials have an affirmative duty to prevent illegal work stoppages, and that, if the agreement does not provide for such a duty, any disparate treatment of union officials violates  8(a)(3).  The court rejected petitioner's argument that the two earlier arbitration 
Page 460 U. S. 694
 awards were sufficient to impose a contractual duty on the union officials to cross the picket line.
Held:  In the absence of an explicit contractual duty, the imposition of more severe sanctions on union officials than on other employees for participating in an unlawful work stoppage violates  8(a)(3).  Pp.  460 U. S. 699-710.

460 U.S. 711

Syllabus 
Respondent, a black employee of the United States Postal Service, filed suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming that the Postal Service had discriminated against him on account of his race by refusing to promote him.  After a bench trial, the District Court entered judgment for the Postal Service, but the Court of Appeals ultimately reversed, holding that the District Court had erred in requiring respondent to offer direct proof of discriminatory intent and to show as part of his prima facie case that he was ""as qualified or more qualified"" than the people who were promoted.
Held:  By framing the issue here in terms of whether a prima facie case is established by an employee's showing only that he was black, that he applied for a promotion for which he possessed the minimum qualifications, and that the employer selected a nonminority applicant, the parties and the Court of Appeals have unnecessarily evaded the ultimate question of discrimination vel non.  By establishing a prima facie case, the plaintiff creates a rebuttable presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against him, and to rebut the presumption, the defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for the plaintiff's rejection.  But when the defendant fails to persuade the district court to dismiss the action for lack of a prima facie case, and responds to the plaintiff's proof by offering evidence of the reason for the plaintiff's rejection, as was done here, the presumption drops from the case and the factfinder must then decide the ultimate factual issue of whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff.  Here, the District Court erroneously thought that respondent was required to submit direct evidence of discriminatory intent, and erroneously focused on the question of prima facie case, rather than directly on the question of discrimination.  Thus it is not clear that its findings of fact in favor of the Postal Service were not influenced by its mistaken view of the law; accordingly, the case is remanded so that the District Court may decide on the basis of the evidence before it whether the Postal Service discriminated against respondent.

Syllabus 
In his action in Federal District Court, and in state administrative and judicial proceedings, respondent, a white male, asserted a variety of common law and statutory claims against Arizona State University and certain of its officials (including petitioners) arising out of incidents occurring while he was a member of the University's football squad.  One of the claims was that three of the petitioners had engaged in a conspiracy to intimidate and threaten various potential material witnesses in order to prevent them from testifying ""freely, fully and truthfully"" in the action, in violation of the first part of 42 U.S.C.  1985(2) (1976 ed., Supp. V).  The District Court dismissed the entire complaint.  The Court of Appeals, while affirming the dismissal of certain of respondent's claims and remanding as to others, reversed with respect to the claim at issue.  The court concluded that respondent's claims of witness intimidation, insofar as they related to obstruction of justice at the state level, were not actionable under the second part of  1985(2) -- which prohibits a conspiracy to obstruct the due course of justice in a State ""with intent to deny any citizen the equal protection of the laws"" -- because there was no sufficient allegation of racial or class-based invidiously discriminatory animus.  The court concluded, however, that such an allegation -- which was held to be necessary in Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U. S. 88, to avoid creating a general federal tort law with regard to a portion of  1985(3) -- was not applicable to alleged intimidation of witnesses in the federal courts in violation of the first part of  1985(2).
Held:  No allegations of racial or class-based invidiously discriminatory animus are required to establish a cause of action under the first part of  1985(2).  The statutory provisions now codified at  1985 were originally enacted as  2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and the substantive meaning of the 1871 Act has not been changed.  The provisions relating to institutions and processes of the Federal Government (including the first part of  1985(2)) -- unlike those encompassing activity that is usually of primary state concern (including the second part of  1985(2) and the part of  1985(3) involved in Griffin, supra -- contain no language requiring that the conspirators act with intent to deprive their victims of the equal protection of the laws.  Thus, the reasoning of Griffin is not applicable here, and, given the structure of  2 of the 1871 Act, it is clear 
Page 460 U. S. 720
 that Congress did not intend to impose a requirement of class-based animus on persons seeking to prove a violation of their rights under the first part of  1985(2).  The legislative history supports this conclusion.  Pp.  460 U. S. 724-727.

The appeals are dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  Treating the papers whereon the appeals were taken as petitions for writs of certiorari, certiorari is denied.
JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE REHNQUIST and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, dissenting from the order dismissing the appeals.
These appeals present substantial unresolved questions regarding the accommodation of competing First Amendment values:  the interests of would-be candidates and voters in eligibility for the ballot, and the interests of party members in political association without undue governmental intrusion.  Massachusetts law requires that a person seeking to be placed on the party primary ballot for a statewide office must be an enrolled member of that party and must file certain documents, including nominating papers signed by a specified number of voters.  Mass.Gen.Laws Ann., ch. 53,  9, 44, 45, and 48.  The statute itself contains no other express requirements for access to the ballot, but the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that these rules are ""supplemented by"" a rule -- the ""15% rule"" -- adopted by the Massachusetts Democratic Party.  This rule permits an individual to run in the party primary only if he or she has received 15% of the votes on any ballot at the state party's convention to endorse candidates, which is held before the primary.  According to the Massachusetts court, the 15% rule is designed to assure that primary candidates have a ""modicum of support from members with substantial affiliation with the party."" 
Page 460 U. S. 1058

Frederick C. Langone, who wished to be a candidate in the Democratic primary for Lieutenant Governor in 1982, satisfied all of the requirements for ballot eligibility that were expressly set forth in the statute, including the submission of 10,000 certified signatures.  Nevertheless, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts excluded him from the primary ballot because he had not obtained at least 15% of the votes cast at the party convention, as the 15% rule required.  He filed suit in state court seeking an injunction requiring the Secretary to place his name on the primary ballot.  The Attorney General of Massachusetts intervened as a plaintiff and filed a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  Two questions of law were reserved and reported to the full Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which rendered its decision in favor of the Secretary's implementation of the statute.
The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court construed Chapter 53 to recognize the Democratic party's 15% rule because it believed that such a construction was required by the United States Constitution in order to avoid an impermissible infringement of the associational rights of party members.  It noted that nomination papers may be signed by voters who are not members of the party, and that persons may vote in a party primary even if they have not enrolled in the party until immediately before they vote.

460 U.S. 605

Syllabus 
This extended litigation over rights to the waters of the Colorado River began in 1952, when Arizona brought an original action in this Court against California and several of its public agencies.  Later, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and the United States became parties.  Following the report of a Special Master, the major issue in the case -- the apportionment of water among the lower basin States -- was resolved in the Court's opinion,  373 U. S. 373 U.S. 546, and 1964 decree,  376 U. S. 376 U.S. 340.  A supplemental decree identifying present perfected rights was entered in 1979.   439 U. S. 439 U.S. 419.  Pursuant to the Court's initial opinion and decree, the United States acquired water rights for the reservations of five Indian Tribes that are dependent upon the river for their water.  The proper standard for measuring the water rights intended for the reservations was held to be ""practicably irrigable acreage,"" and the Special Master's calculation of the amount of such acreage was approved.  The United States, and the Tribes which ask to intervene in the action, now seek to have those water rights increased to account for (1) ""omitted lands"" -- irrigable lands within recognized reservation boundaries for which water rights were not claimed in the earlier litigation; and (2) ""boundary lands"" -- irrigable lands claimed to now have been finally determined to lie within the reservations.  A Special Master appointed by the Court issued a preliminary finding allowing the Tribes to intervene and a final report concluding that the Tribes are entitled to the additional rights.
Held:
1. The Indian Tribes' motions to intervene are granted.  Since the Tribes do not seek to bring new claims or issues against the States, but only ask leave to participate in an adjudication of their water rights that was commenced by the United States, this Court's judicial power over the controversy is not enlarged by granting leave to intervene, and the States' sovereign immunity protected by the Eleventh Amendment is not compromised.  Moreover, the Tribes satisfy the standards for permissive intervention set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which serve as a guide in an original action in this Court.  Pp.  460 U. S. 613-615.
2. The States' exceptions to the Special Master's conclusion that the Tribes are entitled to increased water rights for omitted lands are sustained.  
Page 460 U. S. 606
 The prior determination of Indian water rights in the 1964 decree precludes relitigation of the irrigable acreage issue.  Article IX of the 1964 decree -- which provided that this Court would retain jurisdiction of the action
""for the purpose of any order, direction, or modification of the decree, or any supplementary decree, that may at any time be deemed proper in relation to the subject matter in controversy""
-- must be subject to the general principles of finality and repose, absent changed circumstances or unforeseen issues not previously litigated.  The principles of res judicata advise against reopening the calculation of the amount of practicably irrigable acreage to which the Tribes are entitled.  To apply the law-of-the-case doctrine in this Court's original actions, as the Special Master would here, would weaken the finality of the decrees in such actions, particularly in a case such as this one, which turns on statutory, rather than Court-fashioned, equitable criteria.  Recalculating the amount of practicably irrigable acreage runs directly counter to the strong interests in finality in this litigation, a major purpose of which has been to provide the necessary assurance to the States and various private interests involved of the amount of water they can anticipate receiving from the Colorado River.  Article IX did not contemplate a departure from these fundamental principles so as to permit retrial of factual or legal issues that were fully and fairly litigated 20 years ago.  The absence of the Indian Tribes in the prior proceedings does not require relitigation of their reserved rights.  Pp.  460 U. S. 615-628.
3. The States' and state agencies' exceptions to the Special Master's finding that certain reservation boundaries extended by order of the Secretary of the Interior have been ""finally determined"" within the meaning of Article II(D)(5) of the 1964 decree -- which provided that the quantities of water fixed in the provisions of the decree setting forth the reservations' water rights in the Colorado River shall be subject to appropriate adjustment by agreement or decree of this Court in the event ""the boundaries of the respective reservations are finally determined"" -- are sustained.  But with respect to the boundaries determined by judicial decree in certain quiet title actions, the exceptions are overruled, and the Special Master's conclusion that these boundaries were ""finally determined"" within the meaning of Article II(D)(5) is adopted.  Accordingly, the 1979 supplemental decree in this case should be amended to provide to the respective reservations appropriate water rights to service the irrigable acreage the Special Master found to be contained within the tracts adjudicated by the specified quiet title judgments to be reservation land.  Pp.  460 U. S. 628-641.
Exceptions to the Special Master's Report sustained in part and overruled in part, and motions to intervene granted.

Since the Tribes do not seek to bring new claims or issues against the States, but only ask leave to participate in an adjudication of their water rights that was commenced by the United States, this Court's judicial power over the controversy is not enlarged by granting leave to intervene, and the States' sovereign immunity protected by the Eleventh Amendment is not compromised.  Moreover, the Tribes satisfy the standards for permissive intervention set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which serve as a guide in an original action in this Court.  Pp.  460 U. S. 613-615.
2. The States' exceptions to the Special Master's conclusion that the Tribes are entitled to increased water rights for omitted lands are sustained.  
Page 460 U. S. 606
 The prior determination of Indian water rights in the 1964 decree precludes relitigation of the irrigable acreage issue.  Article IX of the 1964 decree -- which provided that this Court would retain jurisdiction of the action
""for the purpose of any order, direction, or modification of the decree, or any supplementary decree, that may at any time be deemed proper in relation to the subject matter in controversy""
-- must be subject to the general principles of finality and repose, absent changed circumstances or unforeseen issues not previously litigated.  The principles of res judicata advise against reopening the calculation of the amount of practicably irrigable acreage to which the Tribes are entitled.  To apply the law-of-the-case doctrine in this Court's original actions, as the Special Master would here, would weaken the finality of the decrees in such actions, particularly in a case such as this one, which turns on statutory, rather than Court-fashioned, equitable criteria.  Recalculating the amount of practicably irrigable acreage runs directly counter to the strong interests in finality in this litigation, a major purpose of which has been to provide the necessary assurance to the States and various private interests involved of the amount of water they can anticipate receiving from the Colorado River.  Article IX did not contemplate a departure from these fundamental principles so as to permit retrial of factual or legal issues that were fully and fairly litigated 20 years ago.  The absence of the Indian Tribes in the prior proceedings does not require relitigation of their reserved rights.  Pp.  460 U. S. 615-628.
3. The States' and state agencies' exceptions to the Special Master's finding that certain reservation boundaries extended by order of the Secretary of the Interior have been ""finally determined"" within the meaning of Article II(D)(5) of the 1964 decree -- which provided that the quantities of water fixed in the provisions of the decree setting forth the reservations' water rights in the Colorado River shall be subject to appropriate adjustment by agreement or decree of this Court in the event ""the boundaries of the respective reservations are finally determined"" -- are sustained.  But with respect to the boundaries determined by judicial decree in certain quiet title actions, the exceptions are overruled, and the Special Master's conclusion that these boundaries were ""finally determined"" within the meaning of Article II(D)(5) is adopted.  Accordingly, the 1979 supplemental decree in this case should be amended to provide to the respective reservations appropriate water rights to service the irrigable acreage the Special Master found to be contained within the tracts adjudicated by the specified quiet title judgments to be reservation land.  Pp.  460 U. S. 628-641.
Exceptions to the Special Master's Report sustained in part and overruled in part, and motions to intervene granted.

460 U.S. 660

Syllabus 
In 1971, petitioner, who was then 19 years old, pleaded guilty to the charge of carrying a pistol without a license in violation of a provision of the District of Columbia Code and was placed on probation for two years under  5010(a) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act (YCA).  At the end of the 2-year probationary period, he was unconditionally discharged from the YCA program.  In 1980, petitioner was again convicted of carrying a pistol without a license under the same provision of the District of Columbia Code, and was sentenced to imprisonment as a felon, rather than a misdemeanant, under the recidivist provision of the Code.  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contention that his earlier conviction could not properly provide the basis for his being sentenced as a recidivist because, following his successful completion of the 2-year probationary term, that conviction had been expunged under  5021(b) of the YCA, which provides that, where a youth offender has been placed on probation, the court may thereafter, in its discretion,
""unconditionally discharge such youth offender from probation prior to the expiration of the maximum period of probation theretofore fixed by the court, which discharge shall automatically set aside the conviction.""
Held:  Under the interpretation of  5021(b) plainly suggested by its language, the conviction of a youth offender placed on probation under  5010(a) is not set aside where, as here, the court has not exercised its discretion to discharge him unconditionally ""prior to the expiration of the maximum period of probation theretofore fixed by the court.""  This limitation is fully consistent with the YCA's rehabilitation purposes, as well as with Congress' intent to employ the set-aside as an incentive for positive behavior by youths sentenced under the YCA.  Accordingly, the trial court was free to take petitioner's previous conviction into account in imposing sentence under the recidivist provision of the District of Columbia Code.  Pp.  460 U. S. 663-668.
440 A.2d 1008, affirmed.

460 U.S. 536

Syllabus 
Washington state statutes impose a sales tax on federal contractors with respect to the sale of materials to such contractors for work on federal projects, but with regard to nonfederal construction projects, the tax is imposed on the landowner, who pays tax on the full price of the project, including the contractor's labor costs and markup, as well as the cost of tangible personal property sold to the contractor.  The United States filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and an order requiring a refund of sales taxes for which the Federal Government had reimbursed its contractors.  The District Court granted partial summary judgment for the United States, holding that the statutes discriminate against federal contractors in violation of the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Washington statutes are not invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.  460 U. S. 540-546.
(a) The Federal Government's constitutional immunity from state taxation may not be conferred on a third party simply because the tax has an effect on the United States, or even because the Federal Government shoulders the entire economic burden of the levy.  Nor can immunity be conferred simply because the state tax falls on the earnings of a contractor providing services to the Government.  United States v. New Mexico, 455 U. S. 720,  455 U. S. 734.  ""So long as the tax is not directly laid on the Federal Government, it is valid if nondiscriminatory . . . or until Congress declares otherwise.""  United States v. County of Fresno, 429 U. S. 452,  429 U. S. 460.  P.  460 U. S. 540.
(b) Washington's tax is not invalid on the asserted ground that the State has circumvented the Federal Government's tax immunity by identifying a federal activity for different tax treatment.  Washington imposes a sales tax of the same rate on all purchases from nonfederal contractors.  The only deviation from equality between the Federal Government and federal contractors on one hand, and every other taxpayer on the other hand, is that the former are taxed on a smaller proportion of the value of the project than the latter.  Thus the Federal Government and its contractors are better off than other taxpayers, which is not the mistreatment of the Federal Government against which the Supremacy Clause 
Page 460 U. S. 537
 protects.  A tax is not invalid simply because it treats those who deal with the Federal Government differently than it treats others.  Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School District, 361 U. S. 376, distinguished.  Cf. United States v. County of Fresno, supra; United States v. City of Detroit, 355 U. S. 466.  Pp.  460 U. S. 541-544.
(c) The important consideration is not whether the State differentiates in determining what entity shall bear the legal incidence of the tax, but whether the tax is discriminatory with regard to the economic burdens that result.  The State does not discriminate against the Federal Government and those with whom it deals unless it treats someone else better than it treats them.  Here, Washington has not singled out contractors who work for the United States for discriminatory treatment.  It has merely accommodated for the fact that it may not impose a tax directly on the United States as the project owner.  Pp.  460 U. S. 544-546.

Syllabus 
Section 4F(a) of the Clayton Act, enacted in 1976, provides that, whenever the Attorney General of the United States has brought an action under the federal antitrust laws and has reason to believe that any state attorney general would be entitled to bring an action under the Act based on substantially the same alleged violation, he shall give written notification to that official.  Under  4F(b), in order to assist a state attorney general in evaluating this notice or in bringing an action, the United States Attorney General, upon the state attorney general's request, must make available to him,
""to the extent permitted by law, any investigative files or other materials which are or may be relevant or material to the actual or potential cause of action""
under the Act.  After the Justice Department had refused the State of Illinois' request for certain grand jury materials involved in an investigation of alleged violations of the federal antitrust laws, the Attorney General of Illinois filed a petition in Federal District Court asserting a right of access to such materials, and contending that  4F(b) made it unnecessary for him to meet the ""particularized need"" standard required under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e).  The District Court denied the petition, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 4F(b) does not give the state attorney general a special right of access to grand jury materials that is independent of or modifies the limitations imposed by Rule 6(e).  Pp.  460 U. S. 565-573.
(a) Rule 6(e) establishes a ""General Rule of Secrecy"" by providing that grand jury transcripts shall remain in the custody of the attorney for the Federal Government ""unless otherwise ordered by the court in a particular case.""  One seeking disclosure under Rule 6(e) is normally required to make a showing of a ""particularized need"" in order to obtain access to grand jury materials.  Under that Rule, a state attorney general cannot obtain access to federal grand jury proceedings without federal court approval, and such approval cannot be obtained merely by alleging that the materials are relevant to an actual or potential civil antitrust action.  Accordingly, it follows from the language of  4F(b) mandating disclosure of investigative files and other materials only ""to

 the extent permitted by law,"" that the Illinois Attorney General is not entitled to the disclosure sought in this case.  Pp.  460 U. S. 565-568.
(b) Section 4F(b)'s legislative history supports the conclusion that Congress intended the section to recognize the ""General Rule of Secrecy,"" and did not intend to change applicable law concerning grand jury materials.  Pp.  460 U. S. 568-571.
(c) The Act's general goals of enhancing federal-state cooperation and encouraging more state lawsuits against price-fixers are not sufficient to show that Congress intended to change existing rules of law, absent an affirmative expression of intent to do so.  Pp.  460 U. S. 572-573.

Syllabus 
While exempting periodic publications from its general sales and use tax, Minnesota imposes a ""use tax"" on the cost of paper and ink products consumed in the production of such a publication, but exempts the first $100,000 worth of paper and ink consumed in any calendar year.  Appellant newspaper publisher brought an action seeking a refund of the ink and paper use taxes it had paid during certain years, contending that the tax violates, inter alia, the guarantee of the freedom of the press in the First Amendment.  The Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the tax.
Held:  The tax in question violates the First Amendment.  Pp.  460 U. S. 579-593.
(a) There is no legislative history, and no indication, apart from the structure of the tax itself, of any impermissible or censorial motive on the part of the Minnesota Legislature in enacting the tax.  Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233, distinguished.  Pp. 579-580.
(b) But by creating the special use tax, which is without parallel in the State's tax scheme, Minnesota has singled out the press for special treatment.  When a State so singles out the press, the political constraints that prevent a legislature from imposing crippling taxes of general applicability are weakened, and the threat of burdensome taxes becomes acute.  That threat can operate as effectively as a censor to check critical comment by the press, thus undercutting the basic assumption of our political system that the press will often serve as an important restraint on government.  Moreover, differential treatment, unless justified by some special characteristic of the press, suggests that the goal of the regulation is not unrelated to suppression of expression, and such goal is presumptively unconstitutional.  Differential treatment of the press, then, places such a burden on the interests protected by the First Amendment that such treatment cannot be countenanced unless the State asserts a counterbalancing interest of compelling importance that it cannot achieve without differential taxation.  Pp.  460 U. S. 581-585.
(c) Minnesota has offered no adequate justification for the special treatment of newspapers.  Its interest in raising revenue, standing alone, cannot justify such treatment, for the alternative means of taxing businesses generally is clearly available.  And the State has offered no explanation of why it chose to use a substitute for the sales tax, rather 
Page 460 U. S. 576
 than the sales tax itself.  A rule that would automatically allow the State to single out the press for a different method of taxation as long as the effective burden is no different from that on other taxpayers or, as Minnesota asserts here, is lighter than that on other businesses, is to be avoided.  The possibility of error inherent in such a rule poses too great a threat to concerns at the heart of the First Amendment.  Pp.  460 U. S. 586-590.
(d) Minnesota's ink and paper tax violates the First Amendment not only because it singles out the press, but also because it targets a small group of newspapers.  The effect of the $100,000 exemption is that only a handful of publishers in the State pay any tax at all, and even fewer pay any significant amount of tax.  To recognize a power in the State not only to single out the press, but also to tailor the tax so that it singles out a few members of the press, presents such a potential for abuse that no interest suggested by Minnesota can justify the scheme.

No. 81-1335
Argued December 8, 1982
Decided March 23, 1983
460 U.S. 462

Syllabus 
Respondents filed petitions in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals asking for waivers of that court's District of Columbia Bar admission rule that requires applicants to have graduated from a law school approved by the American Bar Association.  The court issued per curiam orders denying the petitions.  Respondents then filed complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the District of Columbia Court of Appeals' denials of their waiver petitions and also challenging the constitutionality of the bar admission rule.  The District Court dismissed the complaints on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and remanded.
Held:
1. The proceedings before the District of Columbia Court of Appeals were judicial in nature.  They involved a ""judicial inquiry"" in which the court was called upon to investigate, declare, and enforce ""liabilities as they [stood] on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist.""  Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U. S. 210,  211 U. S. 226.  With respect to both respondents, the court adjudicated claims of a present right to admission to the Bar.  Pp.  460 U. S. 476-482.
2. United States district courts have no jurisdiction over challenges to state court decisions in particular cases arising out of judicial proceedings even if those challenges allege that the state court's action was unconstitutional.  Review of those decisions may be had only in this Court.  Thus, to the extent that respondents sought review in the District Court of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals' denials of their petitions for waiver, the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their complaints.  But United States district courts do have subject matter jurisdiction over general challenges to state bar rules promulgated by state courts in nonjudicial proceedings, which do not require review of a final state court judgment in a particular case.  Accordingly, here the District Court has jurisdiction over the elements of respondents' complaints involving a general attack on the constitutionality of the District of Columbia Bar admission rule.  Pp.  460 U. S. 482-488.

Syllabus 
After purchasing a one-way airline ticket to New York City at Miami International Airport under an assumed name and checking his two suitcases bearing identification tags with the same assumed name, respondent went to the concourse leading to the airline boarding area, where he was approached by two detectives, who previously had observed him and believed that his characteristics fit the so-called ""drug courier profile.""  Upon request, but without oral consent, respondent produced his airline ticket and driver's license, which carried his correct name.  When the detectives asked about the discrepancy in names, respondent explained that a friend had made the ticket reservation in the assumed name.  The detectives then informed respondent that they were narcotics investigators and that they had reason to suspect him of transporting narcotics, and, without returning his airline ticket or driver's license, asked him to accompany them to a small room adjacent to the concourse.  Without respondent's consent, one of the detectives retrieved respondent's luggage from the airline and brought it to the room.  While he did not respond to the detectives' request that he consent to a search of the luggage, respondent produced a key and unlocked one of the suitcases in which marihuana was found.  When respondent said he did not know the combination to the lock on the second suitcase, but did not object to its being opened, the officers pried it open and found more marihuana.  Respondent was then told he was under arrest.  Following the Florida trial court's denial of his pretrial motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the search of the suitcases, respondent was convicted of felony possession of marihuana.  The Florida District Court of Appeal reversed, holding that respondent had been involuntarily confined within the small room without probable cause, that, at the time his consent to search was obtained, the involuntary detention had exceeded the limited restraint permitted by Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, and that such consent was therefore invalid because tainted by the unlawful confinement.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
389 So.2d 1007, affirmed.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that respondent was being illegally detained when he consented to the search of his luggage and that such consent

 was tainted by the illegality, and hence was ineffective to justify the search.  Pp.  460 U. S. 497-508.
(a) When the detectives identified themselves as narcotics agents, told respondent he was suspected of transporting narcotics, and asked him to accompany them to the police room, while retaining his airline ticket and driver's license and without indicating in any way that he was free to depart, respondent was effectively seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.  At the time respondent produced the key to his suitcase, the detention to which he was then subjected was a more serious intrusion on his personal liberty than is allowable on mere suspicion of criminal activity.  What had begun as a consensual inquiry in a public place escalated into an investigatory procedure in a police interrogation room, and respondent, as a practical matter, was under arrest at that time.  Moreover, the detectives' conduct was more intrusive than necessary to effectuate an investigative detention otherwise authorized by the Terry line of cases.  Pp.  460 U. S. 501-507.

Argued October 13, 1982
Decided March 22, 1983
460 U.S. 428

Syllabus 
During a certain period from 1972 through 1978, petitioner sold its beer to respondent, the sole wholesale distributor for petitioner's beer in Vanderburgh County, Ind., at a higher price than petitioner charged its only wholesale distributor in Henderson County, Ky., the two counties forming a single metropolitan area across the state line.  Under Indiana law, brewers were required to sell to all Indiana wholesalers at a single price, Indiana wholesalers were prohibited from selling to out-of-state retailers, and Indiana retailers were not permitted to purchase beer from out-of-state wholesalers.  Respondent filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that petitioner's price discrimination violated  2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act.  After trial, the court held that respondent had established a prima facie case of price discrimination, finding that, although respondent and petitioner's Kentucky wholesaler did not sell to the same retailers, they competed for sale of petitioner's beer to consumers of beer from retailers in the market area; that petitioner's pricing policy resulted in lower retail prices for its beer in Kentucky than in Indiana; that many customers living in the Indiana portion of the market ignored Indiana law to purchase petitioner's beer more cheaply from Kentucky retailers; and that petitioner's pricing policy thus prevented respondent from competing effectively with petitioner's Kentucky wholesaler, and caused respondent to sell less beer to Indiana retailers.  The court rejected petitioner's ""meeting competition"" defense under  2(b) of the Clayton Act, which provides that a defendant may rebut a prima facie showing of illegal price discrimination by establishing that its lower price to any purchaser or purchasers ""was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor.""  The court reasoned that, instead of reducing its prices to meet those of a competitor, petitioner had created the price disparity by raising its prices to Indiana wholesalers more than it had raised its Kentucky prices; that, instead of adjusting prices on a customer-to-customer basis to meet competition from other brewers, petitioner charged a single price throughout each State; and that the higher Indiana price was not set in good faith, but instead was raised solely to allow petitioner to follow other brewers to enhance its profits.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
Page 460 U. S. 429

Held:
1. The District Court's findings, supported by direct evidence of diverted sales, more than established the ""competitive injury"" (the reasonable possibility that a price difference may harm competition) required to establish a prima facie violation of  2(a).  For  2(a)'s purposes, injury to competition is established prima facie by proof of a substantial price discrimination between competing purchasers over time, although the inference of competitive injury may be overcome by evidence breaking the causal connection between the price differential and lost sales or profits.  This rule is not limited to cases where the favored competitor is extraordinarily large.  Nor is the competitive injury component of a Robinson-Patman Act violation limited to the injury to competition between the favored and the disfavored purchaser; it also encompasses the injury to competition between their customers.  Pp.  460 U. S. 434-438.
2. Petitioner's meeting-competition defense under  2(b) is not defeated on the theory that the price difference resulted from price increases in Indiana, rather than price decreases in Kentucky, and that the higher Indiana price resulted from petitioner's policy of following the Indiana prices of its larger competitors in order to enhance its profits.  FTC v. A. E. Staley Mfg. Co., 324 U. S. 746, distinguished.  Pp.  460 U. S. 438-447.
(a) The meeting-competition defense at least requires the seller to show the existence of facts that would lead a reasonable and prudent person to believe that the seller's lower price to the favored purchaser or purchasers would meet the equally low price of a competitor.  The defense also requires the seller to demonstrate that its lower price was actually a good faith response to that competing low price.  Pp.  460 U. S. 439-441.
(b) The standard governing the requirement of a ""good faith response"" is the standard of a prudent businessman responding fairly to what he reasonably believes is a situation of competitive necessity.  Here, the District Court did not address the crucial question whether petitioner's Kentucky prices remained lower than its Indiana prices in response to competitors' prices in Kentucky.  If petitioner set its lower price in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor, it did not violate the Robinson-Patman Act.  Moreover, the existence of industry-wide price discrimination within the geographic retail market did not itself establish collusion inconsistent with a good faith response, particularly since the interstate price difference could well have been attributable not to petitioner, but to Indiana's extensive regulation of the sale of beer.  Pp.  460 U. S. 441-444.
(c) Nothing in  2(b) requires a seller to lower its prices in order to meet competition.  On the contrary,  2(b) requires the defendant to show only that its lower price was made in good faith to meet a competitor's 
Page 460 U. S. 430
 equally low price.  A price discrimination created by selective smaller price increases can result from a good faith effort to meet a competitor's low price.  Nor is the good faith with which the lower price is offered impugned if the prices raised, like those kept lower, respond to competitors' prices and are set with the goal of increasing the seller's profits.  Pp.  460 U. S. 444-446.
(d) The meeting-competition defense is not limited to price discrimination for the purpose of retaining a customer.  A seller's price discrimination must be a defensive response to competition, in the sense that the lower price must be calculated and offered in good faith to ""meet not beat"" the competitor's low price, but  2(b) does not distinguish between meeting a competitor's lower price to retain an old customer and meeting a competitor's lower price in an attempt to gain new customers.  Pp.  460 U. S. 446-447.
3. Petitioner's meeting-competition defense is not defeated on the theory that  2(b) applies only where the defendant sets its lower price on a customer-by-customer basis ,rather than, as here, by the defendant's use of area-wide pricing.  Congress did not intend to limit the availability of  2(b) to customer-specific responses, but also intended to allow reasonable pricing responses on an area-specific basis where competitive circumstances warrant them.  A seller choosing to price on a territorial basis must show that the decision was a genuine, reasonable response to prevailing competitive circumstances.  Pp.  460 U. S. 447-451.
4. In the absence of further findings, petitioner has not established its meeting-competition defense as a matter of law.  While there is evidence in the record that might support an inference that petitioner's decision to set a lower statewide price in Kentucky was a good faith, well-tailored response to the competitive circumstances prevailing there, the question whether to draw such inference is for the trier of fact, not this Court.  Pp.  460 U. S. 451-452.

While there is evidence in the record that might support an inference that petitioner's decision to set a lower statewide price in Kentucky was a good faith, well-tailored response to the competitive circumstances prevailing there, the question whether to draw such inference is for the trier of fact, not this Court.

No. 81-1222
Argued November 3, 1982
Decided March 22, 1983
460 U.S. 453

Syllabus 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) prohibits the marketing of a ""new drug"" without the prior approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Section 201(p) of the Act defines a ""new drug"" as
""any drug . . . [which] is not generally recognized . . . as safe and effective . . . or . . . which has not, otherwise than in [safety and effectiveness] investigations, been used to a material extent or for a material time.""
Section 201(g)(1) defines the term ""drug"" as, inter alia, ""articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or in other animals.""  The Government brought an action in Federal District Court to enjoin respondent Generix Drug Corp. (respondent) from distributing a number of generic drug products containing specified active ingredients, alleging that the FDA had never approved ""new drug"" applications with respect to such products.  Holding that a generic drug product containing the same active ingredients as a previously approved pioneer drug marketed under a brand name is a ""new drug"" if there is a reasonable possibility that the differences in inactive ""excipients"" between the generic product and the pioneer drug will make the generic product less safe and effective, and finding that the Government had established a reasonable possibility that the safety and effectiveness of respondent's generic drug products might be affected by differences between their inactive ""excipients"" and those found in approved products, the court enjoined respondent from distributing the products in question.  The Court of Appeals vacated the injunction and remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint, holding that the statutory prohibition against the sale of a ""new drug"" without prior FDA approval does not apply to a drug product having the same active ingredients as a previously approved drug product, regardless of any differences in ""excipients.""
Held:  A generic product is a ""drug"" within the meaning of the indicated definition in  201(g)(1).  That definition is broad enough to encompass entire drug products, complete with their active and inactive ingredients.  Accordingly, a generic drug product is a ""new drug,"" subject to prior FDA approval, until the product (and not merely its active ingredients) no longer falls within the terms of  201(p).  Pp.  460 U. S. 457-461.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 21, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Montana. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of Montana to consider whether its judgment is based upon federal or state constitutional grounds, or both, California v. Krivda, 409 U.S. 33, 93 S. Ct. 32 (1972), and, if its judgment is not based upon state constitutional grounds, for further consideration in light of South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U.S. ---, 74 L.Ed.2d ___ (1983). 

 Justice STEVENS, dissenting. 
 In its opinion explaining its holding that the defendant's refusal to submit to a breathalizer sobriety test is inadmissible, the majority of the Supreme Court of Montana stated, in part: 
 After analyzing the federal constitutional question in the light of this Court's opinion in Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, the court continued: 
 ""The issue is also controlled by Art. II, 25 of our own constitution, which provides that 'no person shall be compelled to testify against himself in a criminal proceeding.' The issue involves a communication that is testimonial in nature, and we must resolve the issue by applying Art. II, 25. Clearly, to permit evidence of defendant's refusal to take the breathalyzer test would 
Page 460 U.S. 1030 , 1031
 violate not only the United States Constitution, but also our own constitution. 
 ""In State v. Finley (1977), 173 Mont. 162, 566 P.2d 1119, we held that a defendant's privilege against self-incrimination was not violated by admitting into evidence a videotape recording of his post- arrest words and actions. We decided that the tape had not been introduced for the incriminating content of the words uttered by the defendant, but rather for the purpose of aiding the jury in understanding the testimony of the witnesses who had observed the defendant's unsteady walk and his slurred speech after his arrest. We specifically noted that the videotape did not contain incriminating responses to interrogation by the police. But the same situation does not exist here. It is obvious that defendant's refusal is inherently self-incriminating because it carries a strong inference of guilt-the prosecutor would surely argue that defendant's refusal to take the test was prompted only by his knowledge that the test results would reveal his intoxication, and therefore incriminate him. 
 ""We hold under our own constitution, that if a communication of refusal, whether written, verbal, or otherwise, involves the defendant's consciousness of the facts and the operation of his mind in expressing it, the communication is testimonial in nature. A defendant's silence or negative reply to an officer's request which calls for an immediate reply is clearly an overt communication of the defendant's thoughts in response to the request. Doyle v. Ohio (1976 ), 426 U.S. 610. It is the act of refusal that is pertinent and suggestive of guilt, rather than the way in which it is communicated. Under our constitution, the privilege against self-incrimination forbids any compulsory communication of an accused person's thoughts, whether by acts or words spoken, and the fact that it does not extend its protection to forbid [460 U.S. 1030 , 1032]

Argued January 19, 1983
Decided March 7, 1983
460 U.S. 289

Syllabus 
In her complaint in the later-described action, respondent asserted the following facts.  She obtained a loan from the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) under the Housing Act of 1949 for the construction of a prefabricated house.  She then contracted with a builder to construct the house.  The contract required the work to conform to plans approved by FmHA and granted FmHA the right to inspect and test all materials and workmanship and reject any that were defective.  During and at the completion of construction of the house, an FmHA official inspected the site and reported that the construction accorded with FmHA-approved drawings and specifications.  After respondent moved into the house, she discovered, and FmHA officials identified, a number of defects.  The builder refused to comply with FmHA's request to cure the defects in accordance with the builder's warranty, and FmHA declined to pay for certain defects.  Respondent then brought an action in Federal District Court under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), alleging that the defects were partly attributable to FmHA's employees' failure properly to inspect and supervise construction of the house.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the complaint stated a claim for negligence and that the action was not barred by 28 U.S.C.  2680(h), which precludes recovery under the FTCA for ""[a]ny claim arising out of . . . misrepresentation.""
Held:   Respondent's claim did not ""aris[e] out of . . . misrepresentation"" within the meaning of  2680(h), and thus is not barred by that provision, because respondent did not seek to recover on the basis of misstatements made by FmHA officials.  United States v. Neustadt, 366 U. S. 696, distinguished.  Although FmHA may have undertaken both to supervise construction of respondent's house and to provide her with information regarding the progress of construction, her action is based solely on the former conduct.  The essence of an action for misrepresentation is the communication of misinformation on which the recipient relies.  Here, the FmHA's duty to use due care to ensure that the builder adhered to the approved plans and cured all defects before completing construction was distinct from any duty to use due care in communicating information to respondent.

No. 81-773
Argued November 2, 1982
Decided March 7, 1983
460 U.S. 300

Syllabus 
The federal Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire easements over wetland areas suitable for migratory waterfowl breeding and nesting grounds.  Section 3 of the Wetlands Act of 1961 (Loan Act) provides that no land suitable for waterfowl habitats can be acquired with money from the fund established for such acquisitions unless the acquisition ""has been approved"" by the Governor or an appropriate agency of the State in which the land is located.  Between 1961 and 1977, successive Governors of North Dakota consented to the acquisition of easements covering approximately 1.6 million acres of wetlands in that State.  By 1977, the United States had obtained easements covering about half of this acreage.  In the 1970's, however, cooperation between North Dakota and the United States began to break down, and in 1977, North Dakota enacted statutes restricting the United States' ability to acquire easements over wetlands.  These statutes set out certain conditions that must be met ""prior to final approval"" of the acquisition of the easements, permitted a landowner to drain any after-expanded wetland in excess of the legal description in the easement, and limited all easements to a maximum term of 99 years.  The United States brought suit in Federal District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that, inter alia, the 1977 North Dakota statutes were hostile to federal law and could not be applied, and any easement acquired in violation of such statutes would nevertheless be valid.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the United States, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The consent required by  3 of the Loan Act cannot be revoked at the will of an incumbent Governor.  To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with the Loan Act's purpose of facilitating the acquisition of wetlands.  Here, the acquisition in question clearly ""has been approved"" by North Dakota's Governors as  3's language provides.  Nothing in the statute authorizes the withdrawal of approval previously given.  Nor does  3's legislative history suggest that Congress intended to permit Governors to revoke their consent.  Pp. 312-316.
2. Since  3 of the Loan Act does not permit North Dakota to revoke its consent outright, the State may not revoke its consent based on noncompliance 
Page 460 U. S. 301
 with the conditions set forth in the 1977 legislation.  And to the extent that such legislation authorizes landowners to drain after-expanded wetlands contrary to the terms of their easement agreements, it is hostile to federal interests, and may not be applied.  For the same reason, the statute limiting easements to a maximum term of 99 years may not be applied to wetlands acquired by the United States pursuant to previously given consents.  Pp.  460 U.

No. 81-1404
Argued November 9, 1982
Decided March 7, 1983
460 U.S. 325

Syllabus 
Held:   Title 42 U.S.C.  1983 (1976 ed., Supp. V) does not authorize a convicted state defendant to assert a claim for damages against a police officer for giving perjured testimony at the defendant's criminal trial.  Pp.  460 U. S. 329-346.
(a) The common law provided absolute immunity from subsequent damages liability for all persons -- governmental or otherwise -- who were integral parts of the judicial process.  Section 1983 does not authorize a damages claim against private witnesses.  Similarly, judges, Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, and prosecutors, Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, may not be held liable for damages under  1983 for the performance of their respective duties in judicial proceedings.  When a police officer appears as a witness, he may reasonably be viewed as acting like any witness sworn to tell the truth, in which event he can make a strong claim to witness immunity.  Alternatively, he may be regarded as an official performing a critical role in the judicial process, in which event he may seek the benefit afforded to other governmental participants in the same proceeding.  Nothing in  1983's language suggests that a police officer witness belongs in a narrow, special category lacking protection against damages suits.  Pp.  460 U. S. 329-336.
(b) Nor does anything in the legislative history of the statute indicate that Congress intended to abrogate common law witness immunity in order to provide a damages remedy under  1983 against police officers or any other witnesses.  Pp.  460 U. S. 336-341.
(c) There is some force to the contentions that the reasons supporting common law witness immunity -- the need to avoid intimidation and self-censorship -- apply with diminished force to police officers, and that police officers' perjured testimony is likely to be more damaging to constitutional rights than such testimony by ordinary citizens.  But immunity analysis rests on functional categories, not on the defendant's status.  A police officer witness performs the same functions as any other witness.  Moreover, to the extent that traditional reasons for witness immunity are less applicable to governmental witnesses, other considerations of public policy support absolute immunity for such witnesses more emphatically than for ordinary witnesses.  Subjecting government officials, such as police officers, to damages liability under  1983 for their testimony might undermine not only their contribution to the judicial 
Page 460 U. S. 326
 process but also the effective performance of their other public duties.  Pp.  460 U. S. 341-346.

(b) Nor does anything in the legislative history of the statute indicate that Congress intended to abrogate common law witness immunity in order to provide a damages remedy under  1983 against police officers or any other witnesses.  Pp.  460 U. S. 336-341.
(c) There is some force to the contentions that the reasons supporting common law witness immunity -- the need to avoid intimidation and self-censorship -- apply with diminished force to police officers, and that police officers' perjured testimony is likely to be more damaging to constitutional rights than such testimony by ordinary citizens.  But immunity analysis rests on functional categories, not on the defendant's status.  A police officer witness performs the same functions as any other witness.  Moreover, to the extent that traditional reasons for witness immunity are less applicable to governmental witnesses, other considerations of public policy support absolute immunity for such witnesses more emphatically than for ordinary witnesses.  Subjecting government officials, such as police officers, to damages liability under  1983 for their testimony might undermine not only their contribution to the judicial 
Page 460 U. S. 326
 process but also the effective performance of their other public duties.  Pp.  460 U. S. 341-346.

460 U.S. 370

Syllabus 
Until 1970, Illinois imposed a property tax on shares of stock held in incorporated banks, but in 1970 the Illinois Constitution was amended to prohibit such taxes.  The Illinois courts thereafter held that the amendment violated the Federal Constitution, but, pending disposition of the case in this Court, Illinois enacted a statute providing for collection of the disputed taxes and placement of the receipts in escrow.  Petitioner Bank in No. 81-485 paid the taxes for its shareholders in 1972, taking the deduction for the amount of the taxes pursuant to  164(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC), which grants a corporation a deduction for taxes imposed on its shareholders but paid by the corporation and denies the shareholders any deduction for the tax.  The authorities placed the receipts in escrow.  After this Court upheld the constitutional amendment, the amounts in escrow were refunded to the shareholders.  When petitioner, on its federal income tax return for 1973, recognized no income from this sequence of events, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a deficiency against petitioner, requiring it to include as income the amount paid its shareholders from the escrow.  Petitioner then sought a redetermination in the Tax Court, which held that the refund of the taxes was includible in petitioner's income.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  In No. 81-930, respondent corporation, which operated a dairy, in the taxable year ending June 30, 1973, deducted the full cost of the cattle feed purchased for use in its operations as permitted by  162 of the IRC, but a substantial portion of the feed was still on hand at the end of the taxable year.  Two days into the next taxable year, respondent adopted a plan of liquidation and distributed its assets, including the cattle feed, to its shareholders.  Relying on  336 of the IRC, which shields a corporation from the recognition of gain on the distribution of property to its shareholders on liquidation, respondent reported no income on the transaction.  The Commissioner challenged respondent's treatment of 
Page 460 U. S. 371
 the transaction, asserting that it should have included as income the value of the feed distributed to the shareholders, and therefore increased respondent's income by $60,000.  Respondent paid the resulting assessment and sued for a refund in Federal District Court, which rendered a judgment in respondent's favor.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Unless a nonrecognition provision of the IRC prevents it, the tax benefit rule ordinarily applies to require the inclusion of income when events occur that are fundamentally inconsistent with an earlier deduction.  Pp.  460 U. S. 377-391.
2. In No. 81-485, the tax benefit rule does not require petitioner to recognize income with respect to the tax refund.  The purpose of  164(e) was to provide relief for corporations making payments for taxes imposed on their shareholders, the focus being on the act of payment, rather than on the ultimate use of the funds by the State.  As long as the payment itself was not negated by a refund to the corporation, the change in character of the funds in the hands of the State does not require the corporation to recognize income.  Pp.  460 U. S. 391-395.
3. In No. 81-930, however, the tax benefit rule requires respondent to recognize income with respect to the distribution of the cattle feed to its shareholders on liquidation.  The distribution of expensed assets to shareholders is inconsistent with the earlier deduction of the cost as a business expense.  Section 336, which clearly does not shield the taxpayer from recognition of all income on distribution of assets, does not prevent application of the tax benefit rule in this case.  Section 336's legislative history, the application of other general rules of tax law, and the construction of identical language in  337, which governs sales of assets followed by distribution of the proceeds in liquidation and shields a corporation from the recognition of gain on the sale of the assets, all indicate that  336 does not permit a liquidating corporation to avoid the tax benefit rule.  Pp.  460 U. S. 395-402.

 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSIONv. STEERE TANK LINES, INC., et alNo. 82-41 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 7, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice POWELL and Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting from the denial of certiorari. 
 The Motor Carrier Act of 1980, 49 U.S.C. (Supp. IV) 10101 et seq., authorizes the Interstate Commerce Commission to lift restrictions on motor carriers' existing authority where the removal would, among other things, ""rea- 
Page 460 U.S. 1025 , 1026
 sonably broaden the categories of property authorized by the carriers' certificate or permit."" 10922(h)(1)(B)(i). Pursuant to the statute, the Commission issued guidelines for processing removal-restriction applications. The guidelines invite carriers authorized to haul ""one or more named commodities"" to apply for a broader authorization, such as authority to transport ""commodities in bulk."" 
 In this case, the Maxwell Company applied to the Commission to broaden the commodity description in one of its existing certificates from "" spent silica gel catalyst, in bulk"" to ""commodities in bulk."" After considering submissions from Maxwell, and comments filed by two carriers objecting to the proposed broadening, the Commission's Restriction Removal Board concluded that the application should be granted. The Board found that the proposed broadening ""will reduce the consumption of energy resources, will offer potential cost savings and improved efficiency, will enable applicant to provide full service to a broader range of shippers and in rural communities, and will be consistent with the [transportation policies of the Act]."" The Commission denied internal appeal. 
 Steere Tank Lines, one of the objecting carriers, then challenged the Commission's action in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, arguing that the Commission's guidelines were not valid under the Act. Relying on its earlier decision in American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. ICC, 659 F.2d 452 (1981), cert. pending, (No. 82-86), the court held that the Commission's action was improper. The Fifth Circuit maintained that the Commission's guidelines fail to account for the Motor Carrier Act's mandate that every carrier be ""fit, willing, and able to provide the transportation to be authorized by the certificate."" 49 U.S.C. 10922(a)( 1). Accordingly, the court remanded the decision in this case to the Commission for further proceedings. [460 U.S. 1025 , 1027]

No. 81-554
Argued October 5, 1982
Decided March 2, 1983
460 U.S. 226

Syllabus 
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any employee or potential employee between the ages of 40 and 70 on the basis of age, except
""where age is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business. or where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age.""
In 1974, the definition of ""employer"" under  11(b) of the Act was extended to include state and local governments.  After a supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department was involuntarily retired at age 55 pursuant to a Wyoming statute, he filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging violation of the Act.  The Commission ultimately filed suit in Federal District Court against appellees, the State and various state officials, seeking relief on behalf of the supervisor and others similarly situated.  The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that, insofar as the Act regulated Wyoming's employment relationship with its game wardens and other law enforcement officials, it violated the doctrine of Tenth Amendment immunity articulated in National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833, which struck down Congress' attempt to extend the wage and hour provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to state and local governments.
Held:  The extension of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to cover state and local governments is a valid exercise of Congress' powers under the Commerce Clause, both on its face and as applied in this case, and is not precluded by virtue of external constraints imposed on Congress' commerce powers by the Tenth Amendment.  Pp.  460 U. S. 235-244.
(a) The purpose of the doctrine of Tenth Amendment immunity articulated in National League of Cities, supra, is to protect States from federal intrusions that might threaten their ""separate and independent existence.""  A claim that congressional commerce power legislation is invalid can succeed only if (1) the challenged statute regulates the States as States, (2) the federal regulation addresses matters that are indisputably attributes of state sovereignty, and (3) the States' compliance with the federal law would ""directly impair their ability to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.'""

Page 460 U. S. 227
 The first requirement is met in this case, but even assuming, arguendo, that the second requirement is met, the Act does not ""directly impair"" the State's ability to ""structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.""  Pp.  460 U. S. 236-239.
(b) In this case, the degree of federal intrusion on the States' ability to structure their integral operations is not sufficient to override Congress' choice to extend its regulatory authority to the States.  Appellees claim no substantial stake in their retirement policy other than assuring the physical preparedness of Wyoming game wardens to perform their duties.  The Act does not require the State to abandon those goals, or the public policy decisions underlying them.  Under the Act, the State may assess the fitness of its game wardens on an individualized basis, and may dismiss those wardens whom it reasonably finds to be unfit.  Moreover, appellees remain free under the Act to continue to do precisely what they are doing now, if they can demonstrate that age is a ""bona fide occupational qualification"" for the job of game warden.  And nothing in the nature of the Act suggests that it will have substantial and unintended consequential effects on state decisionmaking in other areas, such as the allocation of state financial resources or the pursuit of broad social and economic policies.

Decided March 2, 1983
460 U.S. 276

Syllabus 
Having reason to believe that one Armstrong was purchasing chloroform to be used in the manufacture of illicit drugs, Minnesota law enforcement officers arranged with the seller to place a beeper (a radio transmitter) inside a chloroform container that was sold to Armstrong.  Officers then followed the car in which the chloroform was placed, maintaining contact by using both visual surveillance and a monitor which received the beeper signals, and ultimately tracing the chloroform, by beeper monitoring alone, to respondent's secluded cabin in Wisconsin.  Following three days of intermittent visual surveillance of the cabin, officers secured a search warrant and discovered the chloroform container, and a drug laboratory in the cabin, including chemicals and formulas for producing amphetamine.  After his motion to suppress evidence based on the warrantless monitoring of the beeper was denied, respondent was convicted in Federal District Court for conspiring to manufacture controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C.  846.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the monitoring of the beeper was prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.
Held:   Monitoring the beeper signals did not invade any legitimate expectation of privacy on respondent's part, and thus there was neither a ""search"" nor a ""seizure"" within the contemplation of the Fourth Amendment.  The beeper surveillance amounted principally to following an automobile on public streets and highways.  A person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements.  While respondent had the traditional expectation of privacy within a dwelling place insofar as his cabin was concerned, such expectation of privacy would not have extended to the visual observation from public places of the automobile arriving on his premises after leaving a public highway, or to movements of objects such as the chloroform container outside the cabin.  The fact that the officers relied not only on visual surveillance, but also on the use of the beeper, does not alter the situation.  Nothing in the Fourth Amendment prohibited the police from augmenting their sensory faculties with such enhancement as science and technology afforded them in this case.  There is no indication that the beeper was used in any way to reveal information as to the movement of the chloroform container within the cabin, or in any 
Page 460 U. S. 277
 way that would not have been visible to the naked eye from outside the cabin.  Pp.  460 U. S. 280-285.

Having reason to believe that one Armstrong was purchasing chloroform to be used in the manufacture of illicit drugs, Minnesota law enforcement officers arranged with the seller to place a beeper (a radio transmitter) inside a chloroform container that was sold to Armstrong.  Officers then followed the car in which the chloroform was placed, maintaining contact by using both visual surveillance and a monitor which received the beeper signals, and ultimately tracing the chloroform, by beeper monitoring alone, to respondent's secluded cabin in Wisconsin.  Following three days of intermittent visual surveillance of the cabin, officers secured a search warrant and discovered the chloroform container, and a drug laboratory in the cabin, including chemicals and formulas for producing amphetamine.  After his motion to suppress evidence based on the warrantless monitoring of the beeper was denied, respondent was convicted in Federal District Court for conspiring to manufacture controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C.  846.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the monitoring of the beeper was prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.
Held:   Monitoring the beeper signals did not invade any legitimate expectation of privacy on respondent's part, and thus there was neither a ""search"" nor a ""seizure"" within the contemplation of the Fourth Amendment.  The beeper surveillance amounted principally to following an automobile on public streets and highways.  A person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements.  While respondent had the traditional expectation of privacy within a dwelling place insofar as his cabin was concerned, such expectation of privacy would not have extended to the visual observation from public places of the automobile arriving on his premises after leaving a public highway, or to movements of objects such as the chloroform container outside the cabin.  The fact that the officers relied not only on visual surveillance, but also on the use of the beeper, does not alter the situation.  Nothing in the Fourth Amendment prohibited the police from augmenting their sensory faculties with such enhancement as science and technology afforded them in this case.  There is no indication that the beeper was used in any way to reveal information as to the movement of the chloroform container within the cabin, or in any 
Page 460 U. S. 277
 way that would not have been visible to the naked eye from outside the cabin.  Pp.  460 U. S. 280-285.

Syllabus 
Petitioner Mayor of Boston, Mass., issued an executive order requiring all construction projects funded in whole or in part by city funds or funds that the city had authority to administer to be performed by a workforce at least half of which are bona fide residents of the city.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held the order unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.
Held:  The Commerce Clause does not prevent the city from giving effect to the Mayor's executive order.  Pp.  460 U. S. 206-215.
(a) When a state or local government enters the market as a participant, it is not subject to the restraints of the Commerce Clause.  Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794; Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429.  In a case like the instant one, the only inquiry is whether the challenged program constituted direct state or local participation in the market.  Pp.  460 U. S. 206-208.
(b) Insofar as the city expended only its own funds in entering into construction contracts for public projects, it was a market participant, and entitled to be treated as such under the rule of Alexandria Scrap Corp.   Even if implementation of the Mayor's order might have a significant impact on specialized construction firms employing out-of-state residents, this is not relevant to the inquiry of whether the city is participating in the marketplace when it provides funds for construction.  Impact on out-of-state residents figures in the equation only after it is decided that the city is regulating the market, rather than participating in it, for only in the former case need it be determined whether any burden on interstate commerce is permitted by the Commerce Clause.  And, even if the Mayor's order is characterized as sweeping too broadly, such characterization is relevant only if the Commerce Clause imposes restraints on the city's activity, and is no help in deciding whether those restraints apply.  Pp.  460 U. S. 209-211.
(c) Insofar as the Mayor's order was applied to projects funded in part with funds obtained from certain federal programs, the order was affirmatively sanctioned by the pertinent regulations of those programs.

No. 81-1203
Argued November 2, 1982
Decided February 23, 1983
460 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a hospital located in North Carolina, entered into a contract with respondent contractor, an Alabama corporation, for construction of additions to the hospital building.  Contract disputes were to be initially referred to the architect who was hired to design and oversee the construction project.  Disputes decided by the architect or not decided within a specified time could be submitted to binding arbitration under an arbitration clause in the contract.  Subsequently, during construction, respondent submitted claims to the architect for extended overhead or increase in construction costs due to petitioner's delay or inaction.  But the claims were not resolved, and petitioner refused to pay them.  Petitioner then filed an action in a North Carolina state court against respondent and the architect, seeking a declaratory judgment that there was no right to arbitration, that petitioner was not liable to respondent, and that, if it was liable it would be entitled to indemnity from the architect.  A few days later, petitioner obtained an ex parte injunction from the state court forbidding respondent to take any steps toward arbitration, but when respondent objected, the stay was dissolved.  Respondent then filed a diversity of citizenship action in Federal District Court, seeking an order compelling arbitration under  4 of the United States Arbitration Act.  The District Court stayed the action pending resolution of the state court suit because the two suits involved the identical issue of the arbitrability of respondent's claims.  The Court of Appeals, holding that it had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1291, reversed the 
Page 460 U. S. 2
 District Court's stay order, and remanded the case with instructions to enter an order to arbitrate.
Held:
1. The District Court's stay order was appealable as a ""final decision"" to the Court of Appeals under 28 U.S.C.  1291.  Since the order was based on the conclusion that the federal and state actions involved the identical issue of arbitrability, and this issue was the only substantive issue present in the federal action, a stay of the federal action pending resolution of the state action meant that there would be no further litigation in the federal court.  Thus, respondent was ""effectively out of court,"" so that the stay order amounted to a dismissal of the federal action.  Moreover, even if the stay order was not final for appealability purposes, it was nevertheless appealable within the finality rule exception that applies where an order conclusively determines the disputed question, resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits, and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.  Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541.  Pp.  460 U. S. 8-13.
2. The District Court abused its discretion in granting the stay.  Pp.  460 U. S. 13-28.
(a) A federal district court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction because of parallel state court litigation only in exceptional circumstances; only the clearest of justifications will warrant dismissal.  Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U. S. 800,  424 U. S. 818-819.  The decision whether to stay or dismiss a federal action on grounds of wise judicial administration does not rest on a mechanical checklist, but on a careful balancing of the important factors (which court first assumed jurisdiction over property involved in the litigation, inconvenience of the federal forum, avoidance of piecemeal litigation, and the order in which the concurrent forums obtained jurisdiction) relevant to the decision as they apply in a given case, with the balance heavily weighted in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction.  Ibid.  Pp.  460 U. S. 13-16.
(b) The exceptional circumstances test set forth in Colorado River, supra, was not undermined by Will v. Calvert Fire Insurance Co., 437 U. S. 655.  Pp.  460 U. S. 16-19.
(c) There was no showing of the requisite exceptional circumstances to justify the District Court's stay order.  Concededly, there was no assumption by either court of jurisdiction over any res or property, or any contention that the federal court was any less convenient to the parties than the state court.  The other factors -- avoidance of piecemeal litigation and the order in which the current forums obtained jurisdiction -- rather than supporting the stay, counsel against it.  The fact that, if respondent obtains an arbitration order, petitioner will be forced to resolve 
Page 460 U. S. 3
 the dispute with respondent and the related dispute with the architect in different forums is not the result of any choice between federal and state courts, but occurs because the relevant federal law, the Arbitration Act, requires piecemeal resolution when necessary to give effect to an arbitration agreement.  Hence, a decision to allow the issue of arbitrability to be decided in federal, rather than state, court does not cause piecemeal resolution of the parties' underlying disputes.  And the fact that the state court suit was filed before the federal suit is not sufficient reason to justify the stay order where, because petitioner's refusal to arbitrate did not occur until less than a day before it filed its state suit, respondent had no reasonable opportunity to file its federal suit first.  Moreover, priority should not be measured exclusively by which complaint was filed first, but rather in terms of how much progress has been made in the two actions.  Here, no substantial proceedings had taken place in the state suit at the time of the District Court's stay order, whereas, in the federal suit, the parties had taken most of the steps necessary to a resolution of the arbitrability issue.  The stay order thus frustrated the Arbitration Act's policy of rapid and unobstructed enforcement of arbitration agreements.  Pp.  460 U. S. 19-23.
(d) The fact that federal law in the terms of the Arbitration Act governs the issue of the arbitrability of the dispute between petitioner and respondent in either the state or the federal court is another factor militating against the District Court's stay order.  See Calvert, supra.  Pp.  460 U. S. 23-26.
(e) Finally, an important reason against allowing a stay is the probable inadequacy of the state suit to protect respondent's rights, since it is doubtful that respondent could obtain from the state court an order compelling petitioner to arbitrate.  Pp.  460 U. S. 26-27.
(f) The fact that the District Court stayed the federal action, rather than dismissing it outright, does not render the Colorado River exceptional circumstances test inapplicable.  Pp.  460 U. S. 27-28.
3. The Court of Appeals acted within its authority in deciding that the contractual dispute was arbitrable under the Arbitration Act and the contract, where the court had briefs and evidentiary submissions from both parties on the merits of arbitrability.  P.  460 U. S. 29.

Syllabus 
Under a collective bargaining agreement between the Board of Education of Perry Township, Ind., and Perry Education Association (PEA) as the exclusive bargaining representative for the School District's teachers, PEA was granted access to the interschool mail system and teacher mailboxes in the Perry Township schools.  The bargaining agreement also provided that access rights to the mail facilities were not available to any rival union, such as Perry Local Educators' Association (PLEA).  PLEA and two of its members filed suit in Federal District Court against PEA and individual members of the School Board, contending that PEA's preferential access to the internal mail system violated the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court entered summary judgment for the defendants, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. The appeal is not proper under 28 U.S.C.  1254(2), which grants this Court appellate jurisdiction over federal court of appeals' decisions holding a state statute repugnant to the Federal Constitution.  Here, only certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, not the Indiana statute authorizing such agreements, were held to be constitutionally invalid, and the bargaining agreement cannot be considered to be in essence a legislative act.  However, regarding the jurisdictional statement as a petition for a writ of certiorari, certiorari is granted because the constitutional issues presented are important and the decision below conflicts with the judgments of other federal and state courts.  Pp.  460 U. S. 42-44.
2. The First Amendment is not violated by the preferential access to the interschool mail system granted to PEA.  Pp.  460 U. S. 44-54.
(a) With respect to public property that is not, by tradition or government designation, a forum for public communication, a State may reserve the use of the property for its intended purposes, communicative or otherwise, as long as a regulation on speech is reasonable, and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker's view.   The school mail facilities were not a ""limited public forum"" merely because the system had been opened for periodic use by 
Page 460 U. S. 38
 civic and church organizations, or because PLEA was allowed to use the school mail facilities on an equal footing with PEA prior to PEA's certification as the teachers' exclusive bargaining representative.  Pp.  460 U. S. 45-49.
(b) The differential access provided PEA and PLEA is reasonable, because it is wholly consistent with the School District's legitimate interest in preserving the property for the use to which it was lawfully dedicated.  Use of school mail facilities enables PEA to perform effectively its statutory obligations as exclusive representative of all Perry Township teachers.  Conversely, PLEA does not have any official responsibility in connection with the School District, and need not be entitled to the same rights of access to school mailboxes.  The reasonableness of the limitations on PLEA's access to the school mail system is also supported by the substantial alternative channels that remain open for union-teacher communication to take place.  Moreover, under Indiana law, PLEA is assured of equal access to all modes of communication while a representation election is in progress.  Pp.  460 U. S. 50-54.
3. The differential access provided the rival unions does not constitute impermissible content discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Since the grant of exclusive access to PEA does not burden a fundamental right of PLEA, the School District's policy need only rationally further a legitimate state purpose.  That purpose is clearly found in the special responsibilities of an exclusive bargaining representative.  Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, and Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, distinguished.  Pp.  460 U. S. 54-55.

However, regarding the jurisdictional statement as a petition for a writ of certiorari, certiorari is granted because the constitutional issues presented are important and the decision below conflicts with the judgments of other federal and state courts.  Pp.  460 U. S. 42-44.
2. The First Amendment is not violated by the preferential access to the interschool mail system granted to PEA.  Pp.  460 U. S. 44-54.
(a) With respect to public property that is not, by tradition or government designation, a forum for public communication, a State may reserve the use of the property for its intended purposes, communicative or otherwise, as long as a regulation on speech is reasonable, and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker's view.   The school mail facilities were not a ""limited public forum"" merely because the system had been opened for periodic use by 
Page 460 U. S. 38
 civic and church organizations, or because PLEA was allowed to use the school mail facilities on an equal footing with PEA prior to PEA's certification as the teachers' exclusive bargaining representative.  Pp.  460 U. S. 45-49.
(b) The differential access provided PEA and PLEA is reasonable, because it is wholly consistent with the School District's legitimate interest in preserving the property for the use to which it was lawfully dedicated.  Use of school mail facilities enables PEA to perform effectively its statutory obligations as exclusive representative of all Perry Township teachers.  Conversely, PLEA does not have any official responsibility in connection with the School District, and need not be entitled to the same rights of access to school mailboxes.  The reasonableness of the limitations on PLEA's access to the school mail system is also supported by the substantial alternative channels that remain open for union-teacher communication to take place.  Moreover, under Indiana law, PLEA is assured of equal access to all modes of communication while a representation election is in progress.  Pp.  460 U. S. 50-54.
3. The differential access provided the rival unions does not constitute impermissible content discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Since the grant of exclusive access to PEA does not burden a fundamental right of PLEA, the School District's policy need only rationally further a legitimate state purpose.  That purpose is clearly found in the special responsibilities of an exclusive bargaining representative.  Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, and Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, distinguished.  Pp.  460 U. S. 54-55.

Syllabus 
Upon a jury trial in a Connecticut state court, respondent was convicted of all the charges under a multicount information, including charges of attempted murder and robbery.  The trial court's general instructions to the jury included an instruction that
""a person's intention may be inferred from his conduct and every person is conclusively presumed to intend the natural and necessary consequences of his act.""
In specific instructions on the elements of each crime, the charge as to attempted murder again referred to a conclusive presumption of intent, but the instructions on robbery did not contain any further discussion of intent.  While respondent's appeal was pending, this Court decided Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510, which held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was violated by a jury instruction that ""the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts,"" because a reasonable juror might have viewed it as creating a conclusive presumption of intent or as shifting the burden of proof as to intent.  Sandstrom left open the question whether, if a jury is so instructed, the error can ever be harmless.  Thereafter, the Connecticut Supreme Court, while affirming respondent's convictions on other counts in the information, reversed his convictions for attempted murder and robbery.  Without discussing the State's argument that the Sandstrom violation was harmless, the court concluded that the unconstitutional ""conclusive presumption"" language in the general instructions was not cured by the specific instructions on attempted murder and robbery.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.  185 Conn.163, 440 A.2d 858, affirmed.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded that the instructional error deprived respondent of ""constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error,"" Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18,  386 U. S. 23.  No matter how strong the prosecution's evidence, a reviewing court cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt that a Sandstrom error did not contribute to the jury's verdict.  A trial judge may not direct a jury to return a guilty verdict regardless of how overwhelmingly the evidence may point in that direction, and a conclusive presumption on the issue of intent is the functional equivalent of a directed verdict on that issue.  Respondent's jurors reasonably could have 
Page 460 U. S. 74
 interpreted the instructions as requiring a conclusive presumption on the issue of intent, an element of the crimes charged, leading them to ignore the evidence -- including evidence relating to respondent's apparent defense that he intended to borrow, rather than steal, the victim's car, and that he did not intend to kill the victim -- in finding that the State had proved respondent guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If so, a reviewing court cannot hold that the error did not contribute to the verdict, since the fact that the reviewing court may view the evidence of intent as overwhelming is irrelevant.  While there may be rare situations in which the reviewing court can be confident that a Sandstrom error did not play any role in the jury's verdict -- such as where, by raising a particular defense or by his other actions, the defendant himself has taken the issue of intent from the jury -- such an exception, regardless of its boundaries, does not apply here.  Pp.  460 U. S. 81-88.
JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that no federal question was raised by the Connecticut Supreme Court's refusal to consider whether the Sandstrom error here was harmless, and that therefore the writ of certiorari should simply be dismissed.  However, because a fifth vote was necessary to authorize the entry of a Court judgment, he joined the disposition allowing the Connecticut Supreme Court's judgment to stand.  Pp.  460 U. S. 88-90.

Syllabus 
Title IV of the Gun Control Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.  922(g)(1) and (h)(1), makes it unlawful for any person ""who has been convicted . . . of . . . a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year"" to ship, transport, or receive any firearm or ammunition in interstate commerce.  Title IV also makes it unlawful to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms without a license from the Secretary of the Treasury.  One ground for denial of a license is where the applicant is under the prohibitions imposed by  922(g)(1) and (h)(1), and if the applicant is a corporation, a license will be denied if a person with power to direct the management of the corporation is under such prohibitions.  One Kennison, the chairman of the board and a shareholder of respondent corporation, after plea negotiations, pleaded guilty in an Iowa state court to the state crime of carrying a concealed handgun.  This crime was punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both.  The state court, however, pursuant to an Iowa statute, ""deferred"" entry of a formal judgment and placed Kennison on probation.  At the completion of his probation term, he was discharged, also pursuant to a state statute, and his record with respect to the deferred judgment was expunged.  Subsequently, respondent applied to the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (Bureau) for licenses as a firearms and ammunition dealer and manufacturer, but did not disclose Kennison's plea of guilty to the Iowa concealed weapon charge.  The licenses were issued but were later revoked when the Bureau learned of the Iowa charge.  The District Court upheld the revocation, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although Kennison had been ""convicted"" of an offense that triggered firearms disabilities, that fact could not serve as a predicate for a Gun Control Act violation or license revocation, because the conviction had been expunged under the Iowa deferred judgment procedure.
Held:  The firearms disabilities imposed by  922(g)(1) and (h)(1) apply to Kennison, and were not removed by the expunction of the record of his guilty plea to the concealed weapon charge.  Pp.  460 U. S. 110-122. 
Page 460 U. S. 104

(a) For purposes of the federal gun control laws, a plea of guilty to a disqualifying crime and its notation by a state court, followed by a sentence of probation, is equivalent to being ""convicted"" within the language of  922(g)(1) and (h)(1).  Pp.  460 U. S. 111-114.
(b) Iowa's expunction provisions, as carried out in Kennison's case prior to respondent's license applications, did not nullify his conviction for purposes of the federal statute.  Expunction under state law does not alter the legality of the previous conviction, does not open the way to a license despite the conviction, and does not signify that the defendant was innocent of the crime to which he pleaded guilty.  Expunction in Iowa means no more than that the State has provided a means for the trial court not to accord a conviction certain continuing effects under state law.  Pp.  460 U. S. 114-115.
(c) Provisions of the federal gun control laws other than the provisions in question, as well as related federal statutes, support the conclusion that Congress did not intend expunction of a state conviction automatically to remove the firearms disabilities imposed by  922(g)(1) and (h)(1).  Pp.  460 U. S. 115-118.
(d) There is nothing in the legislative history of Title IV or related federal statutes to suggest an opposite intent.  Title IV's purpose to curb crime by keeping firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetency, would be frustrated by a ruling that gave effect to state expunctions.  In the absence of a plain indication to the contrary, it is assumed that Congress did not intend to make the application of Title IV dependent on state law.  Title IV is carefully constructed gun control legislation.  Congress knew the significance and meaning of the language it employed.  Pp.  460 U. S. 118-121.
(e) A rule that would give effect to expunction under varying state statutes would seriously hamper effective enforcement of Title IV.  Pp.  460 U. S. 121-122.

Syllabus 
Prior to 1973, appellant Texas city was a ""general law"" city governed by a commission consisting of a mayor and two commissioners, all serving the same 2-year terms.  These offices were filled in even-numbered years through at-large elections using a ""numbered post"" system whereby the two commission posts were designated by number, and each candidate specified the post for which he or she sought election.  In 1973, appellant became a ""home rule"" city, and adopted a new charter whereby it would be governed by a mayor and four councilmen serving staggered 2-year terms, with the mayor and two councilmen being elected in even-numbered years through at-large elections using the numbered-post system and the other two councilmen being similarly elected in odd-numbered years.  Forty-seven percent of appellant's population are Mexican-American, but, as of 1977, less than 30% of the registered voters were Mexican-American.  A Federal District Court in Texas, in a 1979 suit by the individual appellee and other Mexican-Americans, enjoined further elections under the new plan pending preclearance of electoral changes in the charter under  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  The Attorney General precleared the changes except to the extent that they incorporate at-large elections, the numbered-post system, and staggered terms for councilmen.  Appellant then filed suit under  5 in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking a declaratory judgment that the remaining changes did not have the purpose or effect of denying the voting rights guaranteed by  5.  The District Court compared the new plan to what the old practice would have been without numbered posts on the ground that, under Texas law, appellant as a general-law city was not entitled to use a numbered-post system.  The court held that numbered posts and staggered terms each have the effect of discriminating against protected minorities, particularly in view of the history of racial bloc voting in the city.
Held:
1. Appellant's entire 1973 election plan is subject to preclearance under  5.  Appellant admits that the addition of two seats to its governing body and the introduction of staggered terms are subject to  5.  Appellant also changed the nature of the ""continuing"" seats, since council posts one and two are not identical to the old commission posts one and two.  Moreover, the discriminatory effect of the new seats cannot be determined 
Page 460 U. S. 126
 in isolation from the ""preexisting"" elements of the council.  Similarly, the impact of any of the seats cannot be evaluated without considering the fact that they are all filled in elections using numbered posts.  Pp.  460 U. S. 131-132.
2. The 1973 election plan will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.  Pp.  460 U. S. 132-136.
(a) The proper comparison for purposes of  5 is between the new system and the system actually in effect under the old practice, regardless of what state law might have required.  Section 5 was intended to halt actual retrogression in minority voting strength without regard for the legality under state law of the practices already in effect.  Pp.  460 U. S. 132-133.
(b) Under the principle that  5's purpose is to insure that no changes in voting procedures will be made that would lead to retrogression in minority voting strength, Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, the new system, when compared to the prior practice, does not have the effect of denying the right to vote guaranteed by  5.  Here, where appellant has used numbered posts for many years, effective single-shot voting would be equally impossible under both the old and new systems, and individual races could be highlighted under both systems.  Similarly, the introduction of staggered terms has not reduced the opportunity for single-shot voting or increased the highlighting of individual races.  Although there may have been no improvement in minorities' voting strength, neither has there been any retrogression.  Pp.  460 U. S. 133-136.

No. 81-827
Argued November 8, 1982
Decided February 23, 1983
460 U.S. 150

Syllabus 
Petitioner trade association of retail pharmacists and pharmacies filed an antitrust suit in Federal District Court against respondent pharmaceutical manufacturers, the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama, which operates pharmacies in connection with its hospitals, and a county hospital pharmacy.  Petitioner alleged that respondent manufacturers violated the price-discrimination proscriptions of the Robinson-Patman Act by selling their products to respondent hospital pharmacies at prices lower than those charged petitioners' members for like products, and that respondent pharmacies knowingly induced such lower prices in violation of the Act and sold the drugs to the general public in direct competition with privately owned pharmacies.  The District Court granted respondents' motions to dismiss the complaint, holding that state purchases are beyond the Act's intended reach.  The Court of Appeals affirmed .
Held:  The sale of pharmaceutical products to state and local government hospitals for resale in competition with private pharmacies is not exempt from the Act's proscriptions.  Pp.  460 U. S. 153-171.
(a) The Act, by its terms, does not exempt state purchases, and the statutory language is sufficiently broad to cover governmental bodies.  Thus, the Act's plain language strongly suggests that there is no exemption for state purchases to compete with private enterprise.  Pp.  460 U. S. 154-157.
(b) Such an exemption is not supported by the purposes of the antitrust laws, including the Robinson-Patman Act.  Those laws represent a carefully studied attempt to bring within them every person engaged in business whose activities might restrain or monopolize commercial intercourse among the States.  And the Act's history does not reveal any legislative intention to enable a State, by an unexpressed exemption, to enter private competitive markets with congressionally approved price advantages.  Pp.  460 U. S. 157-162.
(c) Nor is respondents' contention that state purchases are outside the Act's scope clearly supported by subsequent legislative events (particularly the hearings on the Act held in the late 1960's) or by court decisions or the interpretations of commentators and executive officials.  
Page 460 U. S. 151
 Thus, Congress cannot be said to have left untouched a universally held interpretation of the Act.  Pp.  460 U. S. 163-170.
(d) It is not for this Court to indulge in the business of policymaking in the field of antitrust legislation.  The legislative history is replete with references to the economic evil of large organizations purchasing from other large organizations for resale in competition with small, local retailers.  To create an exemption in this case clearly would be contrary to Congress' intent.  Pp.  460 U. S. 170-171.

Syllabus 
A civilian employee of the United States Navy died in the crash of an aircraft operated by the United States Air Force and manufactured by petitioner.  The United States paid death benefits to the employee's survivors under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA).  Thereafter, the employee's administrator filed suit against petitioner in Federal District Court, seeking damages for the employee's wrongful death and for injuries suffered prior to her death.  Petitioner, asserting a right to indemnification under the Federal Tort Claims Act, impleaded the United States as a third-party defendant.  Petitioner settled the administrator's claim and moved for summary judgment in the third-party action.  The Government moved to dismiss the third-party claim on the ground that it was barred by FECA's exclusive liability provision, 5 U.S.C.  8116(c), which prohibits actions against the United States by
""an employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, [or] any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United States . . . because of the [employee's] injury or death.""
The District Court, concluding that  8116(c) did not bar the indemnity claim, granted summary judgment for petitioner.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Section 8116(c) does not bar petitioner's third-party indemnity action against the United States.  Section 8116(c) was intended to govern only the rights of employees, their relatives, and people claiming through or on behalf of them.  Weyerhaeuser S.S. Co. v. United States, 372 U. S. 597.

No. 81-420
Argued October 5, 1982
Decided February 22, 1983
459 U.S. 422

Syllabus 
In an application in a federal court by a state prisoner for a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C.  2254(d) establishes a presumption of correctness for
""a determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue, made by a State court of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding to which the applicant for the writ and the State . . . were parties, evidenced by a written finding, written opinion, or other reliable and adequate written indicia.""
An exception to this presumption occurs where the federal habeas court, on reviewing the state court record, concludes that the state court's factual finding ""is not fairly supported by the record.""  Respondent was convicted of murder at a jury trial in an Ohio court.  At the trial, the prosecution sought to prove a ""specification,"" for purposes of obtaining the death penalty against respondent.  There were admitted into evidence, to be considered only in connection with the specification, a copy of an Illinois indictment, a copy of a so-called ""conviction statement,"" and the transcript of a hearing in an Illinois trial court in which respondent pleaded guilty to charges in the indictment.  Before admitting such evidence, the Ohio trial court conducted a hearing to determine whether respondent's guilty plea to the Illinois charge was knowing and voluntary.  On review of the Illinois records and upon testimony by respondent as to his recollection of the Illinois proceedings, the court held that respondent had intelligently and voluntarily entered his plea of guilty in the Illinois court.  Upholding respondent's murder conviction, the Ohio Court of Appeals held that the specification based on the prior Illinois conviction was adequately proved, and that the trial court did not err in ruling that respondent's guilty plea in the Illinois court was knowing and voluntary, and should be submitted to the jury.  Subsequently, respondent brought a habeas corpus proceeding in Federal District Court, which denied relief.  The United States Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's plea of guilty to the previous Illinois charge was invalid, and that its admission into evidence at the Ohio trial rendered respondent's ensuing murder conviction unconstitutional.  The court, noting that no express finding was made concerning respondent's credibility as a witness, credited his testimony at the Ohio trial court hearing, absent contrary evidence by the State. 
Page 459 U. S. 423

Held:  The admission in the Ohio murder trial of respondent's Illinois conviction based upon a guilty plea did not deprive respondent of any federal right.  Pp. 430-439.
(a) Whether the Court of Appeals' reassessment of the effect of respondent's testimony at the Ohio trial court hearing was undertaken because of the trial court's failure to make express findings as to respondent's credibility or whether the Court of Appeals felt it should assess for itself the weight that such evidence should have been accorded by the Ohio trial court, the Court of Appeals erroneously applied the ""fairly supported by the record"" standard enunciated in  2254(d).  The Court of Appeals' reliance on respondent's testimony and the fact that the State produced no contrary evidence are wide of the mark for purposes of deciding whether factual findings are fairly supported by the record.  Section 2254(d) gives federal habeas courts no license to redetermine credibility of witnesses whose demeanor has been observed by the state trial court but not by them.  Pp.  459 U. S. 432-436.
(b) Respondent must be presumed to have been informed, either by his lawyers or at one of the Illinois presentencing proceedings, of the charges on which he was indicted in Illinois.  Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U. S. 637.  Applying this standard to the factual determinations arising from the Ohio trial court proceedings which were ""fairly supported by the record"" within the meaning of  2254(d), this Court cannot accept the Court of Appeals' conclusion that respondent's guilty plea to the Illinois charge was not voluntary and knowing in the constitutional meaning of those terms.  Pp.  459 U. S. 436-438.
(c) Because respondent's prior conviction was valid, this case is controlled by Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, which is reaffirmed.  The Due Process Clause does not permit the federal courts to engage in a finely tuned review of the wisdom of state evidentiary rules.  The jury in respondent's trial was instructed to consider the prior conviction only in determining whether the specification was proved, and it is a ""crucial assumption"" of the jury trial system that juries will obey their instructions.  Moreover, as recognized by the common law, any unfairness resulting from admitting prior convictions generally is balanced by their probative value.  Pp.  459 U. S. 438-439, n. 6.

No. 81-638
Argued November 8, 1982
Decided February 22, 1983
459 U.S. 460

Syllabus 
Following a riot in the Pennsylvania State Prison where he was an inmate, respondent was removed from his cell and the general prison population and confined to administrative segregation within the prison pending an investigation into his role in the riot.  The next day, respondent received notice of a misconduct charge against him.  Five days after his transfer to administrative segregation, a Hearing Committee reviewed the evidence against respondent, and he acknowledged in writing that he had an opportunity to have his version of the events reported, but no finding of guilt was made.  Subsequently, criminal charges based on the riot were filed against respondent, but were later dropped.  In the meantime, a Review Committee concluded that respondent should remain in administrative segregation as posing a threat to the safety of other inmates and prison officials and to the security of the prison.  Ultimately, the Hearing Committee, based on a second misconduct report and after hearing testimony from a prison guard and respondent, found respondent guilty of the second misconduct charge and ordered him confined to disciplinary segregation for six months, while dropping the earlier misconduct charge.  Respondent sued in Federal District Court, claiming that petitioner prison officials' actions in confining him to administrative segregation violated his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, on the facts, respondent had a protected liberty interest in continuing to reside in the general prison population, which interest was created by the Pennsylvania regulations governing the administration of state prisons; that respondent could not be deprived of this interest without a hearing in compliance with the requirements of Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539; and that, since the court was uncertain whether the Hearing Committee's initial proceeding satisfied such requirements, the case would be remanded to the District Court for a hearing regarding the character of that proceeding.
Held:
1. Prison officials have broad administrative and discretionary authority over the institutions they manage, and lawfully incarcerated persons 
Page 459 U. S. 461
 retain only a narrow range of protected liberty interests.  Administrative segregation is the sort of confinement that inmates should reasonably anticipate receiving at some point in their incarceration, and does not involve an interest independently protected by the Due Process Clause.  But in light of the Pennsylvania statutes and regulations setting forth the procedures for confining an inmate to administrative segregation, respondent did acquire a protected liberty interest in remaining in the general prison population.  Pp.  459 U. S. 466-472.
2. The process afforded respondent satisfied the minimum requirements of the Due Process Clause.  Pp.  459 U. S. 472-477.
(a) In view of the wide-ranging deference accorded prison administrators in adopting and executing policies and practices needed to preserve order and discipline and to maintain security, petitioners were obligated to engage only in an informal, nonadversary review of the information supporting respondent's administrative confinement.  P.  459 U. S. 472.
(b) Under Mathews v. Eldrige, 424 U. S. 319, the private interests at stake in a governmental decision, the governmental interests involved, and the value of procedural requirements are considered in determining what process is due under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Here, respondent's private interest was not of great consequence, but the governmental interests in the safety of the prison guards and other inmates and in isolating respondent pending investigation of the charges against him were of great importance.  Neither of the grounds for confining respondent to administrative segregation involved decisions or judgments that would have been materially assisted by a detailed adversary proceeding.  Pp.  459 U. S. 473-474.
(c) An informal, nonadversary evidentiary review is sufficient both for the decision that an inmate represents a security threat and the decision to confine him to administrative segregation pending completion of an investigation into misconduct charges against him.  In either situation, an inmate must merely receive notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to present his views to the prison official charged with deciding whether to transfer him to administrative segregation.  Measured against these standards, respondent received all the process that was due after being confined to administrative segregation.  Pp.  459 U. S. 476-477.

Here, respondent's private interest was not of great consequence, but the governmental interests in the safety of the prison guards and other inmates and in isolating respondent pending investigation of the charges against him were of great importance.  Neither of the grounds for confining respondent to administrative segregation involved decisions or judgments that would have been materially assisted by a detailed adversary proceeding.  Pp.  459 U. S. 473-474.
(c) An informal, nonadversary evidentiary review is sufficient both for the decision that an inmate represents a security threat and the decision to confine him to administrative segregation pending completion of an investigation into misconduct charges against him.  In either situation, an inmate must merely receive notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to present his views to the prison official charged with deciding whether to transfer him to administrative segregation.  Measured against these standards, respondent received all the process that was due after being confined to administrative segregation.  Pp.  459 U. S. 476-477.

No. 81-298
Argued October 12, 1982

459 U.S. 498

Syllabus 
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides that no otherwise qualified handicapped individual shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.  Respondent Gottfried (respondent) filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requesting it to deny renewal of a public television station's license because the station allegedly (1) had failed to discharge its obligation under the Communications Act of 1934 to ascertain the problems, needs, and interests of the deaf and hearing-impaired population within its service area, and (2) had violated  504.  Respondent filed similar objections to the renewal of seven commercial television station licenses.  Consolidating all eight proceedings, the FCC held that the licensees' efforts to ascertain the special needs of the community were adequate; that the facts alleged by respondent did not give rise to a substantial and material question whether any of the licensees had abused its discretion in its programming; that  504 did not apply to the commercial licensees; and that, while the public television station might be governed by  504, the allegations against that station under  504 were premature unless and until the agency with authority to enforce compliance determined that the station had violated the Rehabilitation Act.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the portion of the FCC's order relating to the commercial stations, but vacated the renewal of the public station's license and remanded for further proceedings.  Because the public station, as a recipient of federal financial assistance, was under a duty to comply with  504, the court, while not holding that the station had violated  504 or that its programming efforts were less satisfactory than the commercial licensees' efforts, held that, nevertheless, a stricter ""public interest"" standard should be applied to a licensee covered by  504 than to a commercial licensee, and that the FCC could not find the service of public stations to be adequate to justify license renewal without at least inquiring into their efforts to meet the programming needs of the hearing impaired. 
Page 459 U. S. 499

Held:  Section 504 does not require the FCC to review a public television station's license renewal application under a different standard than applies to a commercial licensee's renewal application.  Pp.  459 U. S. 508-512.
(a) Congress did not intend the Rehabilitation Act to impose any special enforcement obligation on the FCC.  The FCC is not a funding agency, and has no responsibility for enforcing  504.  Moreover, there is not a word in the Act's legislative history suggesting that the Act was intended to alter the FCC's standard for reviewing the programming decisions of public television licensees.  Pp.  459 U. S. 508-510.
(b) The fact that a public television station has a duty to comply with the Rehabilitation Act does not support the conclusion that the FCC must evaluate the station's service to the handicapped community by a more stringent standard than that applicable to commercial stations.  P.  459 U. S. 511.
(c) Unless and until a differential standard has been promulgated with respect to public television stations as against commercial stations, the FCC acts within its authority when it declines to impose a greater obligation to provide special programming for the hearing impaired on a public licensee than on a commercial licensee.

Syllabus 
Petitioner multiemployer association and respondents (collectively the Union) are parties to collective bargaining agreements governing the terms and conditions of employment in construction-related industries in California.  The Union filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that petitioner and its members, in violation of the antitrust laws, coerced certain third parties and some of petitioner's members to enter into business relationships with nonunion contractors and subcontractors, and thus adversely affected the trade of certain unionized firms, thereby restraining the Union's business activities.  Treble damages were sought under  4 of the Clayton Act, which authorizes recovery of such damages by ""[a]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.""  The District Court dismissed the complaint as insufficient to allege a cause of action for treble damages under  4.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Based on the allegations of the complaint, the Union was not a person injured by reason of a violation of the antitrust laws within the meaning of  4 of the Clayton Act.  Pp.  459 U. S. 526-546.
(a) Even though coercion allegedly directed by petitioner at third parties in order to restrain the trade of ""certain"" contractors and subcontractors may have been unlawful, it does not necessarily follow that the Union is a person injured by reason of a violation of the antitrust laws within the meaning of  4.  Pp.  459 U. S. 526-529.
(b) The question whether the Union may recover for the alleged injury cannot be answered by literal reference to  4's broad language.  Instead, as was required in common law damages litigation in 1890 when  4's predecessor was enacted as  7 of the Sherman Act, the question requires an evaluation of the Union's harm, the petitioner's alleged wrongdoing, and the relationship between them.  Pp.  459 U. S. 529-535.
(c) The Union's allegations of consequential harm resulting from a violation of the antitrust laws, although buttressed by an allegation of intent to harm the Union, are insufficient as a matter of law.  Other relevant factors -- the nature of the alleged injury to the Union, which is 
Page 459 U. S. 520
 neither a consumer nor a competitor in the market in which trade was allegedly restrained, the tenuous and speculative character of the causal relationship between the Union's alleged injury and the alleged restraint, the potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages, and the existence of more direct victims of the alleged conspiracy -- weigh heavily against judicial enforcement of the Union's antitrust claim.

No. 81-1453
Argued December 8, 1982
Decided February 22, 1983
459 U.S. 553

Syllabus 
A South Dakota statute permits a person suspected of driving while intoxicated to refuse to submit to a blood alcohol test, but authorizes revocation of the driver's license of a person so refusing the test and permits such refusal to be used against him at trial.  When respondent was arrested by police officers in South Dakota for driving while intoxicated, the officers asked him to submit to a blood alcohol test and warned him that he could lose his license if he refused, but did not warn him that the refusal could be used against him at trial.  Respondent refused to take the test.  The South Dakota trial court granted respondent's motion to suppress all evidence of his refusal to take the blood alcohol test.  The South Dakota Supreme Court affirmed on the ground that the statute allowing introduction of evidence of the refusal violated the privilege against self-incrimination.
Held:
1. The admission into evidence of a defendant's refusal to submit to a blood alcohol test does not offend his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  A refusal to take such a test, after a police officer has lawfully requested it, is not an act coerced by the officer, and thus is not protected by the privilege against self-incrimination.  The offer of taking the test is clearly legitimate, and becomes no less legitimate when the State offers a second option of refusing the test, with the attendant penalties for making that choice.  Pp.  459 U. S. 558-564.
2. It would not be fundamentally unfair in violation of due process to use respondent's refusal to take the blood alcohol test as evidence of guilt, even though the police failed to warn him that the refusal could be used against him at trial.  Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610, distinguished.  Such failure to warn was not the sort of implicit promise to forgo use of evidence that would unfairly ""trick"" respondent if the evidence were later offered against him at trial.  Pp.  459 U. S. 564-566.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 22, 1983 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 THE CHIEF JUSTICE dissenting: 
 In my view, only the finite limitations of the Court's time preclude our granting review of this case. I would grant certiorari and summarily reverse the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 This case began when the manager of a clothing store in Canton Center, Massachusetts, observed an unfamiliar blue van in the 
Page 459 U.S. 1222, 1223
 rear parking lot, which the store owned. From his vantage point about 15 feet away, the manager saw two men in the van cutting up a suspicious looking substance. He reported his observation to the police. The Canton Police Department dispatched Officer Brown to ""check '[t]wo men inside a van acting suspicious.' "" 386 Mass. 385, 386, 436 N.E.2d 150 (1982). When the officer approached within about 10 feet of the van, he noticed two people in the rear of the van and that the sliding door on the passenger side stood approximately 18-inches ajar. Officer Brown then stuck his head through the door. He observed respondents Podgurski and Collins cutting hashish. Respondents were arrested and the hashish was seized. 
 Respondents were charged with possession of hashish. The trial court granted their motion to suppress the evidence of the hashish and the Commonwealth appealed. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed. It held that Officer Brown had searched the van before viewing the hashish, and that respondents had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the van, even though the door was open. The court apparently thought that Officer Brown should have tried ""to question or communicate with"" petitioners before putting his head inside the door. Id., at 390, 436 N.E.2d 150. It held that Officer Brown had not conducted a ""lawful threshold inquiry"" under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), because he was conducting a ""search."" Ibid. It also thought that there would be no constitutional problem if Officer Brown had looked through the windshield or one of the windows, or had kept his head outside the open door. Id., 386 Mass. at 388, 436 N.E.2d 150. 
 I am not persuaded that the Supreme Judicial Court misconstrued this Court's decisions in finding that respondents had a legitimate expectation of privacy. However, I am concerned that it took too narrow a view of our cases permitting police officers to make brief investigative stops and searches. [459 U.S. 1222, 1224]

Alleging that they were defrauded by misrepresentations in a registration statement and prospectus for certain securities, purchasers of such securities brought a class action in Federal District Court against most of the participants in the offering, seeking recovery under  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), which makes it unlawful for ""any"" person to use ""any"" manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in the purchase or sale of ""any"" security.  The trial judge instructed the jury to determine whether the plaintiffs had proved their cause of action by a preponderance of the evidence, and judgment was entered on the basis of a jury verdict in plaintiffs' favor.  The Court of Appeals held that a cause of action may be maintained under  10(b) for fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions even when, as in this case, that conduct might also be actionable under  11 of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act), which expressly allows purchasers of a registered security to sue certain enumerated parties who play a direct role in a registered offering when false or misleading information is included in a registration statement.  However, the Court of Appeals concluded that a plaintiff seeking recovery under  10(b) of the 1934 Act must prove his case by ""clear and convincing"" evidence, and reversed and remanded on other grounds.
Held:
1. The availability of an express remedy under  11 of the 1933 Act does not preclude defrauded purchasers of registered securities from maintaining an action under  10(b) of the 1934 Act.  Pp.  459 U. S. 380-387.
(a) The two provisions involve distinct causes of action, and were intended to address different types of wrongdoing.  Under  11, a plaintiff need only show a material misstatement or omission in a registration statement to establish a prima facie case.  Such an action must be brought by a purchaser of a registered security, and can only be brought against certain parties.  In contrast,  10(b) is a ""catch-all"" antifraud provision, and requires a purchaser or seller of a security, in order to establish 
Page 459 U. S. 376
 a cause of action, to prove that the defendant acted with scienter.  Pp.  459 U. S. 380-382.
(b) To exempt conduct actionable under  11 from liability under  10(b) would conflict with the basic purpose of the 1933 Act:  to provide greater protection to purchasers of registered securities.  It is hardly a novel proposition that the two Acts prohibit some of the same conduct.  Cf. Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185.  A cumulative construction of the remedies under the Acts is also supported by the fact that, when Congress comprehensively revised the securities laws in 1975, federal courts had consistently recognized an implied private right of action under  10(b) even where express remedies under  11 or other provisions were available.  A cumulative construction of the securities laws also furthers their broad remedial purposes.  Pp.  459 U. S. 382-387.
2. Persons seeking recovery under  10(b) need prove their cause of action by a preponderance of the evidence only, not by clear and convincing evidence.  The preponderance standard has been consistently employed in private actions under the securities laws.  Cf. SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U. S. 344.  Reference to the traditional use of a higher burden of proof in civil fraud actions at common law is unavailing here.  An important purpose of the federal securities statutes was to rectify perceived deficiencies in the available common law protections by establishing higher standards of conduct in the securities industry.  The balance of the parties' interests in this case warrants use of the preponderance standard, which allows both parties to share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion.  While defendants face the risk of opprobrium that may result from a finding of fraudulent conduct, defrauded investors are among the very individuals Congress sought to protect in the securities laws, and if they prove that it is more likely than not that they were defrauded, they should recover.  Pp.  459 U. S. 387-391.

Syllabus 
A Tennessee statute imposes a tax on the net earnings of banks doing business in the State, and defines net earnings to include interest received on obligations of the United States and its instrumentalities and of other States, but not interest earned on obligations of Tennessee and its political subdivisions.  Appellant bank brought an action in a Tennessee state court to recover taxes paid on interest earned on various federal obligations, alleging that the bank tax, as applied to appellant, violated 31 U.S.C.  742 -- which exempts obligations of the United States from state and local taxation except where the taxes are ""nondiscriminatory franchise or other nonproperty taxes in lieu thereof imposed on corporations"" or estate or inheritance taxes -- and thus was unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause.  The trial court granted appellant's motion for a summary judgment.  The Tennessee Supreme Court reversed, holding that the bank tax fell within the exception for ""nondiscriminatory franchise taxes"" set forth in  742.
Held:  The Tennessee bank tax violates the immunity of obligations of the United States from state and local taxation.  The tax cannot be characterized as nondiscriminatory under  742.  It discriminates in favor of securities issued by Tennessee and its political subdivisions and against federal obligations by including in the tax base income from federal obligations while excluding income from otherwise comparable state and local obligations, and thus improperly discriminates against the Federal Government and those with whom it deals.

No. 81-1370
Argued November 9, 1982
Decided January 24, 1983
459 U.S. 400

Syllabus 
In 1975, appellee public utility entered into two intrastate contracts with appellant's predecessor-in-interest to purchase wellhead and residue gas from a certain gas field.  Each contract contains a ""governmental price escalator clause,"" which provides that, if any governmental authority fixes a price for any natural gas that is higher than the contract price, the contract price shall be increased to that level, and a ""price redetermination clause,"" which gives appellant the option to have the contract price redetermined no more than once every two years by averaging the prices being paid under three other gas contracts chosen by the parties.  If the price is increased pursuant to either clause, each contract requires appellee, within specified time periods, to seek from the Kansas Corporation Commission (Commission) approval to pass the increase through to consumers.  If pass-through approval is refused and appellee elects not to pay the increase, appellant has the option to terminate the agreement.  Pursuant to the price redetermination clauses, the parties agreed on a higher price to be effective November 27, 1977, the Commission approved the pass-through of the increase to consumers, and appellee paid the new price through 1978.  Effective December 1, 1978, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 replaced earlier federal price controls for interstate natural gas with gradually increasing price ceilings, including a ceiling for newly discovered or newly produced gas ( 102) and a lower ceiling for categories of gas not otherwise covered by the Act ( 109).  The Act also extended federal price regulation to the intrastate gas market, providing in  105(b)(1) that the ceiling price for intrastate gas shall be the lower of the  102 price and ""the price under the terms of the existing contract, to which such natural gas was subject on [November 9, 1978].""  As authorized by the federal Act, the Kansas Natural Gas Price Protection Act was enacted in May, 1979, imposing price controls on the intrastate gas market with regard to contracts executed before April 20, 1977, and prohibiting consideration either of ceiling prices set by federal authorities or of prices paid in Kansas under other contracts in the application of governmental price escalator and price redetermination clauses.  However, the Kansas Act permits indefinite price escalator clauses to operate after March 1, 1979, to raise the price of ""old"" intrastate gas up to the federal Act's  109 ceiling price.  In November, 1978, 
Page 459 U. S. 401
 appellant notified appellee that gas prices would be escalated to the  102 price pursuant to the governmental price escalator clauses, but appellee, after failing to obtain pass-through approval because of its failure to file a timely application with the Commission, elected not to pay the higher price, and appellant then sought to terminate the contracts.  When appellee contended that the governmental price escalator clauses were not triggered by the federal Act, and that the Kansas Act prohibited their activation, appellant filed suit in a Kansas state court, seeking a declaratory judgment that it had the contractual right to terminate the contracts.  Appellee later rejected appellant's request under the price redetermination clauses for a price increase, to be effective in November, 1979, contending that the Kansas Act had extinguished appellee's obligation to comply with those clauses.  Appellant then filed an amended complaint, alleging that it was entitled to terminate the contracts because of appellee's refusal to redetermine the price.  Appellee counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that the contracts were still in effect.  The trial court entered summary judgment for appellee, holding that the federal Act's imposition of price ceilings on intrastate gas did not trigger the governmental price escalator clauses, and that the Kansas Act did not violate the Contract Clause of the Federal Constitution.  The Kansas Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. The Kansas Act does not impair appellant's contracts with appellee in violation of the Contract Clause, and thus the contract price may be escalated under either escalator clause only to the ceiling under  109 of the federal Act, not to the  102 ceiling.  Pp.  459 U. S. 409-419.
(a) The Contract Clause's prohibition of any state law impairing the obligation of contracts must be accommodated to the State's inherent police power to safeguard the vital interests of its people.  The threshold inquiry is ""whether the state law has, in fact, operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.""  Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U. S. 234,  438 U. S. 244.  If a substantial impairment is found, the State, in justification, must have a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation.  Once such a purpose has been identified, the adjustment of the contracting parties' rights and responsibilities must be based upon reasonable conditions, and must be of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying the legislation's adoption.  Pp.  459 U. S. 410-413.
(b) Here, the Kansas Act has not impaired substantially appellant's contractual rights.  The parties are operating in a heavily regulated industry, and the statement of intent in their contracts made clear that the escalator clauses were designed to guarantee price increases consistent with anticipated regulated increases in the value of appellant's gas, not 
Page 459 U. S. 402
 that appellant expected to receive deregulated prices.  Moreover, the contract provision making any contractual term subject to relevant present and future state and federal law suggests that appellant knew its contractual rights were subject to alteration by state price regulation.  Pp.  459 U. S. 413-416.
(c) To the extent, if any, the Kansas Act impairs appellant's contractual interests, it rests on significant state interests in protecting consumers from the escalation of natural gas prices caused by deregulation, and in correcting the imbalance between the interstate and intrastate markets by permitting the intrastate prices to rise only to the  109 level.   Nor are the means chosen to implement these purposes deficient, particularly in light of the deference to which the Kansas Legislature's judgment is entitled.  Pp.  459 U. S. 416-419.
2. The Kansas Supreme Court did not err in holding that the enactment of  105 of the federal Act did not trigger the governmental price escalator clauses in these contracts so as to entitle appellant to a price increase on December 1, 1978.  As a matter of federal statutory interpretation, the federal Act does not trigger such clauses automatically.  By the language of  105(b)(1), Congress set a ceiling for the operation of contractual provisions; it did not prescribe a price.  And the Kansas Supreme Court's holding that the particular governmental price escalator clauses involved here were insufficient to escalate the gas price is an interpretation of state law to which this Court defers.

 JOHN CUNEO, INC.v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD et alNo. 82-455 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 24, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice POWELL joins, dissenting. 
 In affirming the NLRB's decision in this case, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held, inter alia, that (1) a bargaining order to the employer was an appropriate remedy; (2) the bargaining order could be retroactively applied from the date the employer first denied recognition of the Union; and (3) because of the employer's actions during the strike, what began as an economic strike was converted into an unfair labor practices strike ab initio, justifying reinstatement of striking employees irrespective of whether the employer had hired replacements for the strikers. 681 F.2d 11 (1982). In my opinion, all three of these holdings raise serious and important questions which recur with frequency before the NLRB. Because the NLRB and Court of Appeals, in resolving these questions, have charted new courses in areas previously mapped out only by this Court, I would grant certiorari to review these determinations. 
 Petitioner, located in Chattanooga, Tennessee, manufactures and sells fire protection sprinkler systems. On September 16, 1977, representatives of the Road Sprinkler Fitters Local 
Page 459 U.S. 1178 , 1179
 Union No. 669 presented to the Company President, Bob Splawn, union authorization cards signed by eleven of the Company's fourteen fabrication shop employees. Splawn refused to recognize the Union. On September 21 the eleven employees went on strike; the strike continued until November 14, when seven of the strikers made unconditional offers to return to work. 
 The NLRB determined that the Company committed several unfair labor practices throughout this period in violation of sections 8(a)(1), 8(a)(3), and 8(a)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1), ( 3), (5) (1976). While contested below, these findings of fact are not at issue here. First, on two separate days before the strike, Company officials interrogated a senior employee, Gerald Hall, seeking to ascertain the identities of the employees who signed union authorization cards; at one point Hall was threatened with discharge if he did not cooperate, but soon thereafter Company officials disclaimed a desire to discharge Hall. Second, the Company created the ""impression of surveillance"" by two actions: prior to the strike, a Company supervisor was directed to find out who had signed the union authorization cards; and on two separate days early in the strike, Company officials took photographs of picketing strikers. Third, after the strike was terminated, the Company unnecessarily delayed in reinstating striking employees to available positions. Fourth, when the first two striking employees were reinstated in February of 1978, Splawn told them not to talk about the Union on the job. Fifth, in February of 1978 the Company promulgated a new rule providing that an employee would be discharged if late for work three times; the new rule was discriminatorily applied against the reinstated strikers. 
 The Bargaining Order. In NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 614, 1940 (1969), this Court held that if "" at one point the union had a majority"" and the employer has engaged in unfair labor practices ""to undermine majority strength and impede the election processes,"" then the NLRB can consider [459 U.S. 1178 , 1180]

 JOHN CUNEO, INC.v. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD et alNo. 82-455 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 24, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice POWELL joins, dissenting. 
 In affirming the NLRB's decision in this case, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held, inter alia, that (1) a bargaining order to the employer was an appropriate remedy; (2) the bargaining order could be retroactively applied from the date the employer first denied recognition of the Union; and (3) because of the employer's actions during the strike, what began as an economic strike was converted into an unfair labor practices strike ab initio, justifying reinstatement of striking employees irrespective of whether the employer had hired replacements for the strikers. 681 F.2d 11 (1982). In my opinion, all three of these holdings raise serious and important questions which recur with frequency before the NLRB. Because the NLRB and Court of Appeals, in resolving these questions, have charted new courses in areas previously mapped out only by this Court, I would grant certiorari to review these determinations.

 Union No. 669 presented to the Company President, Bob Splawn, union authorization cards signed by eleven of the Company's fourteen fabrication shop employees. Splawn refused to recognize the Union. On September 21 the eleven employees went on strike; the strike continued until November 14, when seven of the strikers made unconditional offers to return to work. 
 The NLRB determined that the Company committed several unfair labor practices throughout this period in violation of sections 8(a)(1), 8(a)(3), and 8(a)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1), ( 3), (5) (1976). While contested below, these findings of fact are not at issue here. First, on two separate days before the strike, Company officials interrogated a senior employee, Gerald Hall, seeking to ascertain the identities of the employees who signed union authorization cards; at one point Hall was threatened with discharge if he did not cooperate, but soon thereafter Company officials disclaimed a desire to discharge Hall. Second, the Company created the ""impression of surveillance"" by two actions: prior to the strike, a Company supervisor was directed to find out who had signed the union authorization cards; and on two separate days early in the strike, Company officials took photographs of picketing strikers. Third, after the strike was terminated, the Company unnecessarily delayed in reinstating striking employees to available positions. Fourth, when the first two striking employees were reinstated in February of 1978, Splawn told them not to talk about the Union on the job. Fifth, in February of 1978 the Company promulgated a new rule providing that an employee would be discharged if late for work three times; the new rule was discriminatorily applied against the reinstated strikers. 
 The Bargaining Order. In NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 614, 1940 (1969), this Court held that if "" at one point the union had a majority"" and the employer has engaged in unfair labor practices ""to undermine majority strength and impede the election processes,"" then the NLRB can consider [459 U.S. 1178 , 1180]

No. 81-1214
Argued November 10, 1982
Decided January 19, 1983
459 U.S. 359

Syllabus 
A Missouri statute provides that any person who commits any felony under the laws of the State through the use of a dangerous or deadly weapon is also guilty of the crime of armed criminal action punishable by imprisonment for not less than three years, which punishment shall be in addition to any punishment provided by law for the felony.  Another Missouri statute provides that any person convicted of the felony of first-degree robbery by means of a dangerous and deadly weapon shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than five years.  Respondent, as the result of a robbery of a supermarket in which he used a revolver, was convicted in a Missouri state court of both first-degree robbery and armed criminal action, and, pursuant to the statutes, was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 10 years for robbery and 15 years for armed criminal action.  The Missouri Court of Appeals reversed respondent's conviction and sentence for armed criminal action on the ground that his sentence for both robbery and armed criminal action violated the protection against multiple punishments for the same offense provided by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court construed the robbery and armed criminal action statutes as defining the ""same offense"" under the test announced in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, i.e., where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutes, the test for determining whether there are two offenses, or only one, is whether each statute requires proof of a fact which the other does not.
Held:  Respondent's conviction and sentence for both armed criminal action and first-degree robbery in a single trial did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.  459 U. S. 365-369.
(a) With respect to cumulative sentences imposed in a single trial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.  Pp.  459 U. S. 365-368.
(b) Simply because two criminal statutes may be construed to proscribe the same conduct under the Blockburger test does not mean that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes the imposition, in a single trial, of cumulative punishments pursuant to those statutes.  Whalen v. United States, 445 U. S. 684; Albernaz v. United States, 450 U. S. 333.  The 
Page 459 U. S. 360
 rule of statutory construction whereby cumulative punishments are not permitted ""in the absence of a clear indication of contrary legislative intent,"" Whalen, supra, at  445 U. S. 692, is not a constitutional rule requiring courts to negate clearly expressed legislative intent.  Accordingly, where, as here, a legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes, regardless of whether those statutes proscribe the ""same"" conduct under Blockburger, a court's task of statutory construction is at an end, and the prosecution may seek and the trial court or jury may impose cumulative punishment under such statutes in a single trial.

Syllabus 
Respondent union entered into a collective bargaining agreement with respondent contractors' associations and their members prohibiting dealings by the contractors with nonunion dump truck operators.  Petitioner, the owner and operator of a dump truck, who previously had not been a member of a union, joined the union under protest and paid an initiation fee, dues, and a contribution to a fringe benefit plan.  Petitioner and one of respondent contractors' associations then filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming that the agreement violated, inter alia,  8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), which prohibits so-called ""hot cargo"" contracts.  An Administrative Law Judge held that the union and the contractors had violated  8(e) by agreeing not to do business with nonunion owner-operators of dump trucks, and recommended that the Board issue a cease-and-desist order and order the union and the contractors to reimburse the owner-operators who were compelled to join the union for amounts paid as dues, initiation fees, and fringe benefit contributions.  The Board affirmed and adopted the recommended order except for the reimbursement provision, holding that a reimbursement order would not effectuate the remedial policies of the Act.  The Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order in all respects.
Held:  The Board acted within its authority in deciding that a reimbursement order would not effectuate the policies of the Act.  Congress has delegated to the Board the power to determine when those policies would be effectuated by a particular remedy, and the Board could properly conclude that a remedy such as reimbursement should be reserved for especially egregious situations.  There is nothing in the language or structure of the Act that requires the Board to reflexively order ""complete relief"" for every unfair labor practice.  Pp.  459 U. S. 349-352.

 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice POWELL and Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting from the denial of certiorari. 
 Every state in the Union maintains an unemployment compensation system which provides partial wage replacement for the unemployed. The federal government credits employer contributions to state unemployment programs meeting certain federal requirements against the amount owing under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. 3301 et seq. One of the requirements which state plans 
Page 459 U.S. 1150 , 1151
 must meet is that ""no person shall be denied [unemployment] compensation under . . . State law solely on the basis of pregnancy or termination of pregnancy."" 26 U.S.C. 3304(a)(12). The Fourth Circuit, in the opinion below, Brown v. Porcher, 660 F.2d 1001 (1981), held that the South Carolina Unemployment Compensation System did not meet the requirements of 3304(a)(12), and upheld a district court order requiring the South Carolina Employment Security Commission (""the Commission"") to make retroactive payments to claimants that had been denied compensation since January 1, 1978. In so doing, the Fourth Circuit decided three issues that merit this Court's attention. 
 The most important issue now presented for this Court's consideration involves the meaning of 3304(a)(12). South Carolina Code 41-35-120 provides that a person will not be eligible for unemployment benefits ""if the [South Carolina Employment Security] Commission finds that he has left voluntarily without good cause his most recent work."" The Commission has determined that resignation due to pregnancy or to an illness unrelated to the claimant's job makes the claimant ineligible for unemployment benefits . The Fourth Circuit held that 41-35-120, as interpreted, did not satisfy the dictates of 3304(a)(12). It said, ""[r]egardless of how the Commission treats employees with other disabilities, the mandate of [ 3304(a)(12) ] is clear: the Commission cannot deny compensation 'solely on the basis of pregnancy or termination of pregnancy.' "" Brown v. Porcher, supra, at 1004. 
 It is by no means clear, however, that 3304(a)(12) does not simply provide that pregnancy must be treated like all other disabilities-that pregnancy simply cannot be singled out for unfavorable treatment. The Department of Labor adheres to such an interpretation, and thus disagrees with the Fourth Circuit's interpretation of 3304(a)(12). The Department of Labor is responsible for annually determining whether state unemployment compensation programs meet the requirements set out in federal law. 26 U.S.C. [459 U.S. 1150 , 1152]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case.

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 I continue to adhere to my view that the death penalty is unconstitutional in all circumstances, and I would vacate petitioner's death sentence on that basis alone. However, even if I accepted the prevailing view that the death penalty can constitutionally be imposed under certain conditions, I would vacate the death sentence imposed in this case. The trial judge permitted a psychologist who had never examined petitioner to make a prediction as to her future dangerousness that was based in substantial part on hearsay statements that were not in evidence. [Footnote 1] This was the only testimony presented by the prosecution in the sentencing phase of the trial. It is well recognized that predictions of violent behavior are generally unreliable even under the best of circumstances. [Footnote 2] In my view, when this general unreliability is compounded by the obvious risks inherent in relying on hearsay statements that were not made under oath and were not subject to cross-examination, and the person making the prediction has never even examined the individual in question, the State has ""introduce[d] a level of uncertainty and unreliability into the factfinding process that cannot be tolerated in a capital case."" Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 643, 2392 (1980). 
Footnote 1 The psychologist relied on medical and psychiatric reports that he had examined and on out-of-court statements made to him by a guard and by one of petitioner's fellow inmates. 
 Petitioner was 17 at the time of the offense. 
Footnote 2 See, e.g., Cocozza & Steadman, The Failure of Psychiatric Predictions of Dangerousness: 
Clear and Convincing Evidence, 29 Rutgers L.Rev. 1084 (1976) (reviewing the studies on this subject); Report of the Task Force on the Role of Psychology in the Criminal Justice System, 33 Am.Psychologist 1099, 1110 ( 1976) (""the validity of psychological predictions of violent behavior, at least in the sentencing and release situations . . . is extremely poor"").

Murtishaw, 29 Cal.3d 733, 175 Cal.Rptr. 738, 631 P.2d 446 (1981), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1982), the California Supreme Court concluded that predictions of violent conduct are too unreliable to be admissible in capital sentencing proceedings absent a showing of exceptional circumstances supporting the prediction. 175 Cal.Rptr. 758-763, 631 P.2d, at 466-471.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The motion of Florida Public Defenders Association, Inc. for leave to file a brief as amicus curiae is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. Adhering to my views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting from denial of certiorari. I continue to adhere to my view that the death penalty is unconstitutional under all circumstances. I would therefore grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence on this basis alone. However, even if I accepted the prevailing view that the death penalty can constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances, I would grant certiorari in this case to consider whether a trial judge may reject a jury's recommendation of life imprisonment and impose the death sentence based in part on a different jury's recommendation that the defendant's accomplice be sentenced to death. Petitioner Ernest Lee Miller and his step-brother, William Riley Jent, were indicted for first degree murder. Following trials before the same judge but before separate juries, both defendants were found guilty. The trials were followed by hearings at which each jury was directed to consider ""[w]hether sufficient mitigating circumstances exist . . . which outweigh the aggravating circumstances found to exist; and . . . [b]ased on these considerations the defendant should be sentenced to life [ imprisonment] or death."" Fla.Stat.Ann. 921.141(2)(b) and (c). The jury that heard petitioner's case recommended life imprisonment, but in Jent's case the jury recommended a death sentence. Under the Florida capital sentencing procedure, the jury's sentencing decision is only advisory; the actual sentence is 
Page 459 U.S. 1158 , 1159
 determined by the trial judge. Here the judge who conducted both trials sentenced both petitioner and his accomplice Jent. In the case of Jent, the judge accepted the jury's recommendation and imposed a death sentence. 
 In the case of petitioner, the judge was faced with a jury recommendation of life imprisonment. Under Florida law, a sentencing judge can reject such a recommendation only if "" 'the facts suggesting a sentence of death [are] so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ.'

In deciding to impose the death sentence despite the jury's recommendation, the judge relied heavily on the fact that in Jent's case the jury recommended a death sentence: 
 ""The United States Supreme Court has determined that if the death penalty is to be imposed by the states, the United States Constitution demands that it be imposed with regularity, rationality and consistency. 
 ""The jury for the defendant Jent has recommended death and this court finds that the weight of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances demand death sentences for both defendants. Therefore, if the recommendation of the jury for the defendant Miller were followed, that would result in two co-perpetrators who participated equally in a crime having disparate sentences. It would cause a hollow ring in the Florida halls of justice if the sentences in these cases were not to be equalized."" Findings in Support of Sentences 6 ( citations omitted). 
 ""The goal in the law is regularity or uniformity in the application of those available sentences. Now, the Court, our Supreme Court in Florida has also said that . . .

No. 81-525
Argued October 6, 1982
Decided January 11, 1983
459 U.S. 212

Syllabus 
After petitioner employee was discharged by respondent United States Postal Service (USPS) as a result of an altercation with another employee, he filed a grievance with respondent Union as provided by the applicable collective bargaining agreement.  When the Union declined to take his grievance to arbitration, petitioner sued respondents in Federal District Court, claiming that he had been wrongfully discharged and seeking damages and injunctive relief.  Entering judgment on a jury verdict against both respondents, the District Court held that the USPS had discharged petitioner without just cause, and that the Union had handled his grievance in an arbitrary manner.  Accordingly, the court upheld the jury's apportionment of damages between the USPS and the Union.  The Court of Appeals affirmed except for the award of damages against the Union, holding that, because petitioner's compensation was payable only by the USPS, reimbursement for his lost earnings continued to be the USPS's exclusive obligation, and that hence no portion of the deprivations was chargeable to the Union.
Held:  Where the District Court's findings, accepted by the Court of Appeals, established that petitioner's damages were caused initially by the USPS's unlawful discharge and were increased by the Union's breach of its duty of fair representation, apportionment of the damages was required.  Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U. S. 171.  Pp.  459 U. S. 218-230.
(a) The governing principle of Vaca is that, where an employee proves that his employer violated the collective bargaining agreement and that his union breached its duty of fair representation, liability is to be apportioned between the employer and the union according to the damages caused by the fault of each.  To interpret this principle as requiring that an employer be solely liable for damages resulting from a wrongful discharge treats the relationship between the employer and employee, created by the collective bargaining agreement, as if it were a simple contract of hire governed by traditional common law principles.  Such a reading fails to recognize that a collective bargaining agreement is much more than traditional common law employment terminable at will.  Rather, it is an agreement creating relationships and interests under the federal common law of labor policy.  Pp.  459 U. S. 218-220. 
Page 459 U. S. 213

(b) Of paramount importance is the right of the employee, who has been injured by both the employer's and the union's breach, to be made whole.  Even though both the employer and the union have caused the damage suffered by the employee, the union is responsible for the increase in damages resulting from breach of its duty of fair representation having caused the grievance procedure to malfunction, and, as between the two wrongdoers, the union should bear its portion of the damages.  Pp.  459 U. S. 220-224.
(c) When the union, as the employee's exclusive agent, waives arbitration or fails to seek review of an adverse decision, the employer should be in substantially the same position as if the employee had had the right to act on his own behalf and had done so.  In the absence of damages apportionment where the default of both the employer and the union contributes to the employee's injury, incentives to comply with the grievance proceeding would be diminished, and to impose total liability solely on the employer could affect the willingness of employers to agree to arbitration clauses.  To require the union to pay damages does not impose a burden on the union inconsistent with national labor policy, but rather provides an additional incentive for the union to process its members' claims where warranted.  Pp.  459 U. S. 224-228.
(d) Czosek v. O'Mara, 397 U. S. 25, is not inconsistent with Vaca's recognition that each party should bear the damages attributable to its fault.  Pp.  459 U. S. 228-230.

No. 81-825
Argued October 6, 1982
Decided January 11, 1983
459 U.S. 248

Syllabus 
Title 18 U.S.C.  6002 provides that
""no testimony or other information compelled under the order [of a federal court] (or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal case.""
When respondent appeared before a grand jury investigating price-fixing activities in the corrugated container industry, he was granted use immunity pursuant to  6002 for his testimony.  Subsequently, in civil antitrust actions brought in Federal District Court by petitioner purchasers of corrugated containers, respondent appeared, pursuant to a subpoena, for a deposition.  At the deposition, questions were read from the transcript of his immunized grand jury testimony and rephrased to include the transcript answer, and then respondent was asked if he had ""so testif[ied]"" before the grand jury.  He refused to answer each question, asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  Granting petitioners' motion to compel respondent to answer, the District Court held him in contempt when he continued to claim his privilege.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege, since his deposition testimony was not protected under  6002, but could be used against him in a subsequent criminal action.
Held:  A deponent's civil deposition testimony, such as that in question in this case, repeating verbatim or closely tracking his prior immunized testimony, is not, without duly authorized assurance of immunity at the time, immunized testimony within the meaning of  6002, and therefore may not be compelled over a valid assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege.  Pp.  459 U. S. 252-264.
(a) To construe  6002, as petitioners urge, so as to hold that the grant of immunity compelled respondent to give testimony at the civil deposition that repeats verbatim or closely tracks his prior testimony sweeps further than Congress intended and could hinder the Government's enforcement of its criminal laws by turning use immunity into a form of transactional immunity for subjects examined in the immunized proceeding.  Use immunity is intended to immunize and exclude from a subsequent criminal trial only that information to which the Government expressly has surrendered future use.  The purpose of  6002 is to limit the

			"|"Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy
No. 81-825
Argued October 6, 1982
Decided January 11, 1983
459 U.S. 248

Syllabus 
Title 18 U.S.C.  6002 provides that
""no testimony or other information compelled under the order [of a federal court] (or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal case.""
When respondent appeared before a grand jury investigating price-fixing activities in the corrugated container industry, he was granted use immunity pursuant to  6002 for his testimony.  Subsequently, in civil antitrust actions brought in Federal District Court by petitioner purchasers of corrugated containers, respondent appeared, pursuant to a subpoena, for a deposition.  At the deposition, questions were read from the transcript of his immunized grand jury testimony and rephrased to include the transcript answer, and then respondent was asked if he had ""so testif[ied]"" before the grand jury.  He refused to answer each question, asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  Granting petitioners' motion to compel respondent to answer, the District Court held him in contempt when he continued to claim his privilege.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege, since his deposition testimony was not protected under  6002, but could be used against him in a subsequent criminal action.
Held:  A deponent's civil deposition testimony, such as that in question in this case, repeating verbatim or closely tracking his prior immunized testimony, is not, without duly authorized assurance of immunity at the time, immunized testimony within the meaning of  6002, and therefore may not be compelled over a valid assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege.  Pp.  459 U. S. 252-264.
(a) To construe  6002, as petitioners urge, so as to hold that the grant of immunity compelled respondent to give testimony at the civil deposition that repeats verbatim or closely tracks his prior testimony sweeps further than Congress intended and could hinder the Government's enforcement of its criminal laws by turning use immunity into a form of transactional immunity for subjects examined in the immunized proceeding.  Use immunity is intended to immunize and exclude from a subsequent criminal trial only that information to which the Government expressly has surrendered future use.  The purpose of  6002 is to limit the 
Page 459 U. S. 249
 scope of immunity to a constitutionally required level, as well as to limit the use of immunity to those cases in which the Government determines that gaining the witness' testimony outweighs the loss of the opportunity for criminal prosecution of that witness.  Pp.  459 U. S. 255-261.
(b) Petitioners' proposed construction of  6002 also could put the deponent to some risk unless he receives an assurance of immunity or exclusion that the courts cannot properly give.

459 U.S. 297

Syllabus 
Before 1972, coverage under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act) extended only to injuries sustained by workers on the actual ""navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock).""  In 1972, the Act was amended by expanding the ""navigable waters"" situs to include certain adjoining land and by adding a status requirement that employees covered by the Act be ""engaged in maritime employment"" within the meaning of  2(3) of the Act.  In this case, an employee (Churchill) of respondent construction firm was injured while performing his job on the deck of a cargo barge being used in the construction of a sewage treatment plant extending over the Hudson River in New York.  Churchill's claim for compensation under the LHWCA was administratively denied on the ground that he was not ""engaged in maritime employment"" under  2(3).  On Churchill's petition for review, in which the Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (Director) (petitioner here) participated as respondent in support of Churchill, the Court of Appeals held that Churchill was not in ""maritime employment"" because his employment lacked a ""significant relationship to navigation or to commerce on navigable waters.""
Held:
1. Where Churchill is a party respondent under this Court's Rule 19.6 and has filed a brief arguing for his coverage under the Act, there is a justiciable controversy before the Court.  Accordingly, it is unnecessary to consider whether the Director, as the official responsible for administration and enforcement of the Act, has Art. III standing as an aggrieved party to seek review of the decision below.  The Director's petition under 28 U.S.C.  1254(1) brings Churchill before the Court, and he, as the injured employee, has a sufficient interest in the question at issue to give him standing to urge consideration of the merits of the Court of Appeals' decision.  Pp.  459 U. S. 302-305.
2. Churchill, as a marine construction worker injured while performing his job upon actual navigable waters, was ""engaged in maritime employment"" 
Page 459 U. S. 298
 within the meaning of  2(3), and thus was covered by the amended Act.  Pp.  459 U. S. 305-325.
(a) There is no doubt that Churchill would have been covered by the Act before it was amended in 1972.  Pp.  459 U. S. 305-312.
(b) There is nothing in the legislative history or in the 1972 Amendments themselves to indicate that Congress intended to withdraw coverage from employees injured on navigable waters in the course of their employment as that coverage existed before the 1972 Amendments, or that it intended the status language of  2(3) to require that such an employee show that his employment possessed a direct or substantial relation to navigation or commerce in order to be covered.  On the contrary, the legislative history indicates that Congress did not intend to ""exclude employees traditionally covered.""  Moreover, Congress explicitly deleted language from the Act that was found in Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co., 370 U. S. 114, to be responsible for the ""jurisdictional dilemma"" created by the ""maritime but local"" doctrine whereby a maritime worker was often required to make a perilous jurisdictional ""guess"" as to which of the two mutually exclusive compensation schemes, i.e., the federal or the state scheme, was applicable to cover his injury.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 10, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 The Court of Appeals held that the appropriate standard to be applied to petitioner's due process claim was whether, ""[v]iewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the [finding of competence], . . . any rational trier of fact could conclude that the evidence does not predominate in favor of the appellant's claim of incompetence."" While noting that ""[t]his is, admittedly, a close case,"" the appellate court concluded that the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find White competent to stand trial. For the reasons set forth below, I would grant the petition for certiorari in order to determine whether petitioner's constitutional claim should be reconsidered under a less deferential standard that until now has been applicable to such claims on federal habeas review. 
 I  
 On January 12, 1975, petitioner Robert Lee White was indicted in Lubbock County, Tex., on the charge of capital murder. Shortly thereafter, petitioner's competency to stand trial was called into question by his attorneys. On June 28, 1975, the trial court granted defense counsel's motion for a private psychiatric examination and evaluation of the defendant, directing that White be released from jail for testing at the Southwest Center for Psychological and Vocational Testing. On three occasions, the court granted defense counsel's motions for further neurological and psychiatric examinations. On September 3, 1976, the court ordered an examination by a disinterested, qualified expert 
Page 459 U.S. 1118 , 1119
 to determine White's competence to stand trial. [Footnote 1] The appointed psychiatrist reported that White had been psychotic ""for at least seven to eight years."" 
 In January 1977, the court, finding that there was some evidence that White was not competent, impanelled a jury to determine White's competency to stand trial. At the competency hearing, defense counsel called the court-appointed psychiatrist and two psychologists who had also previously examined White. Based upon their diagnostic tests and observations, the experts testified that White was ""chronically psychotic,"" that is, he suffered from schizophrenia of long standing, characterized by hallucinations and an inability to distinguish between reality and fantasy . They also testified that petitioner's IQ of 69-75 indicated ""borderline mental retardation."" The defendant's experts concluded that while he understood the charges against him, White's mental disorders rendered him incompetent to consult with his attorneys. One of the defendant's attorneys gave testimony confirming that White was not able to assist in his defense. 
 The prosecution called two experts, a neurologist and a radiologist, who testified that they found no evidence of organic brain damage, but expressed no view as to White's competence. The prosecution's remaining witnesses, White's jailer and a deputy sheriff, stated that White behaved like other prisoners and appeared to communicate normally with his attorneys. Based primarily upon the testimony of these lay witnesses and his cross-examination of the defense witnesses, the prosecutor urged that the defendant had misled his examiners into believing that he was mentally disturbed. 
 The judge instructed the jury that ""a person is incompetent to stand trial if he does not have sufficient present ability [459 U.S. 1118 , 1120]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 10, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 The issue presented by this case is whether a violation of Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349 (1977), can be remedied by a remand to the original sentencing judge for a limited hearing in which the burden is placed upon the defendant to rebut or explain the information which had not been disclosed to him at the initial sentencing proceeding. 
 I  
 In 1974 petitioner was convicted after a jury trial of the first- degree murder of his ex-wife. In a separate sentencing proceeding a majority of the jury voted to recommend a death sentence. Under the Florida capital sentencing statute the jury's verdict in the sentencing proceeding is only advisory; the actual sentence is determined by the judge. See Fla.Stat.Ann. 921.141 (Supp.1982). In this case the judge found that 
Page 459 U.S. 1128 , 1129
 two statutory aggravating circumstances were applicable. He determined that the defendant had previously been convicted of a felony involving the use of violence to the person, and that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. The judge also found that none of the statutorily enumerated mitigating circumstances were applicable. He concluded that a death sentence should be imposed. 
 On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence in a brief per curiam opinion, with two judges dissenting from the affirmance of the death sentence. 375 So.2d 833 (1977), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 956 (1979). Petitioner sought rehearing in light of Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349 (1977), suggesting that the trial judge, in making his sentencing decision, may have ""considered matters not provided to the jury or defense counsel."" The Florida Supreme Court issued an order directing the trial judge to indicate whether he had in fact relied on undisclosed information. In response the judge stated that he had examined a confidential portion of a presentence report as well as information furnished by the United States Marine Corps concerning the defendant's military record. After receiving this response, the Florida Supreme Court vacated petitioner's death sentence and remanded to the trial judge for resentencing following a hearing concerning the previously undisclosed information. 375 So.2d, at 835. 
 On remand the trial judge denied petitioner's motion to substitute another judge. A hearing was held in the trial court on February 9, 1979. The scope of the hearing was narrowly limited. The judge provided petitioner with the previously undisclosed material and invited him to correct or rebut any misstatements. The presentence report discussed a prior assault committed by petitioner against his first wife and her sister.

 Petitioners, convicted of second-degree burglary while armed, challenge their convictions on the ground that they were denied due process and the right to an impartial jury in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

 foreman of the jury. On the second day of deliberations, Friday, July 23, 1981, the trial judge received a note from members of the jury stating that they ""would like to change the foreperson of the jury due to the fact that the present foreperson seems somewhat unable to preside this morning ."" Lee v. United States, 454 A.2d 770, 772 (D.C.App.1982). That morning, prior to receiving the note, the judge's chambers had received a call indicating that the foreman of the jury would be late. In addition, a marshall suggested to the judge that there might be some question as to whether one of the jurors was intoxicated. 
 The trial judge held a separate voir dire of each member of the jury. The foreman of the jury denied any intoxication and one juror stated that there was no indication that the foreman had been drinking. Nine members of the jury stated that it was their belief that the foreman had been drinking. Their estimation of her degree of intoxication varied from observations that she appeared to be ""a little intoxicated"" to claims that she was flatly ""drunk."" 1 
 At the conclusion of the voir dire the trial court suggested that the petitioners agree to an arrangement whereby the foreman of the jury would be dismissed and the case would be submitted to the remaining 11 jurors. Petitioners rejected that suggestion and proposed instead that the judge declare a mistrial. The trial judge acknowledged that the juror in question was ""somewhat [464 U.S. 972 , 974]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 12, 1983
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 Last Term, this Court summarily reversed a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which ruled that petitioner's 1975 Missouri rape conviction was based on an involuntary statement taken in violation of petitioner's Fifth Amendment rights. Wyrick v. Fields, ___ U.S. ___ (1982), rev'g 682 F.2d 154 (1982). I dissented from that summary reversal because I do not believe this Court should decide unsettled questions of constitutional law without plenary review. Id., at ___. In my dissent, I noted that, even if petitioner's statement were voluntary under the Fifth Amendment, the interrogation that produced petitioner's statement might nevertheless have violated petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Id., at ___ - ___-400. 
Page 464 U.S. 1020 , 1021
 On remand, the Eighth Circuit considered this issue and concluded that petitioner had knowingly and intelligently waived his Sixth Amendment right to have counsel present during the interrogation. Fields v. Wyrick, 706 F.2d 879 (CA8 1983). Because I disagree with the manner in which the Eighth Circuit analyzed petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim, I would grant certiorari and set the case for oral argument. 
 Petitioner, a soldier undergoing basic training in Missouri, was charged with rape. After consulting with counsel, petitioner told his company commander that he wanted to take a polygraph test. Petitioner was under the impression that if he ""passed"" a polygraph test, the charges against him would be dropped, and he would be permitted to graduate from basic training on schedule. 682 F.2d, at 160, n. 10. Petitioner's counsel shared this impression and later testified that he thought ""the polygraph would have merely shown deceit or non-deceit and would have been used for the purposes of a possible pre-trial negotiation."" Id., at 160. Accordingly petitioner's counsel advised him to take the test. 
 Days later when the test was given, petitioner's counsel was not notified. The military officer in charge of the examination simply informed petitioner of his rights to refuse to answer any questions or to have counsel present, and petitioner signed a document 1 waiving those rights. See State v. Fields, 538 S.W.2d 348 (Mo.Ct.App.1976). Throughout the polygraph examination, petitioner professed his innocence. After the examination was over, however, the officer administering the test informed petitioner that the machine revealed ""some deceit"" and asked petitioner for an explanation. The officer did not tell petitioner that the results of polygraph tests were inadmissible in Missouri courts, nor did the officer remind petitioner of his right to have counsel present during this post-examination interrogation. Petitioner then said that he had had consensual sexual relations with the rape victim on the day of the alleged rape. The officer immediately summoned the local chief of police. After receiving a Miranda warning from the police chief, petitioner repeated his statement. At trial, this statement was the heart of the State's successful prosecution. [464 U.S. 1020 , 1022]

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 In Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510 ( 1979), this Court held that a defendant's right to due process is violated when the trial judge, charging the jury on the issue of criminal intent, instructs the jury to presume that each person intends the natural consequences of his act. We left open the possibility that the impermissible effects of such a jury instruction might be ""removed"" by other instructions that are ""rhetorically inconsistent with a conclusive or burden-shifting presumption."" Id., at 518-519, n. 7, n. 7. In each of these cases the trial judge gave an instruction concerning intent that was improperly cast in the form of a mandatory presumption. In each case the Court of Appeals held that the improper instruction was cured by other instructions concerning intent, even though the additional instructions were not rhetorically inconsistent with the improper charge. I would grant certiorari in order to address this misinterpretation of this Court's decision in Sandstrom. 
Page 459 U.S. 1162 , 1163
 In No. 82-5763, petitioner Edwin Rivera was convicted in state court of first-degree manslaughter and misdemeanor possession of a weapon. The trial judge's instruction concerning intent began with the following statement: ""I shall now define intent for you. A person is presumed to intend the natural consequence of his act."" This statement is substantively identical to the instruction in Sandstrom which we held improper because ""a reasonable juror could have given the presumption conclusive or persuasion-shifting effect."" 442 U.S., at 519-57. See id., at 513-54. Accordingly, on collateral review the District Court granted a writ of habeas corpus. 
 The decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversing the District Court cannot be squared with our holding in Sandstrom. The Court of Appeals' conclusion that the charge as a whole was proper rested on the existence of later statements in the charge suggesting that the presumption is permissive, and on boilerplate language concerning the state's burden of proof and the jury's duty to consider all relevant evidence. Conspicuously absent from the lower court's opinion is the conclusion that any of these additional statements were rhetorically inconsistent with the impermissible mandatory presumption language. The reason is clear: the additional instructions reasonably could have been understood by the jury in a manner entirely consistent with the improper mandatory presumption.

 On writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
 The motion of respondents for reconsideration of the Court's order denying their motion to retax costs is denied. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, dissenting. 
 In order to facilitate maintenance and cleaning following the 1979 accident at a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island, petitioner Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved an amendment to the reactor's operating license authorizing the venting of accumulated radioactive gas. Respondents, several individuals who reside near Three Mile Island and an organization opposed to nuclear power, filed an action in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit challenging the Commission's determination hat it could approve the amendment without a hearing. 
 Before the Court of Appeals acted on the case, the venting process was completed. The court eventually held that the case was not moot because the situation was capable of repetition yet evading review. On the merits, the court agreed with respondents that the Commission lacked authority under 189 of the Atomic Energy Act, 42 U.S.C. 2239, to dispense with a hearing before amending a license. 209 U.S.App.D.C. 59, 651 F.2d 780 (1980) (per curiam ). The Commission then proposed to Congress legislation that would authorize similar license amendments without a hearing.

 In January of this year, Congress enacted legislation amending the relevant portion of 189. Act of Jan. 4, 1983, 12(a), 96 Stat. 2067. Petitioners then suggested that this Court vacate and remand the case to the Court of Appeals with directions to dismiss it as moot. On February 22, we adopted an alternative disposition proposed by respondents, vacating the judgment and remanding for consideration of the issue of mootness and for further consideration in light of the new law. 459 U.S . ___. 
 Costs were assessed against respondents in the amount of $2,226 pursuant to this Court's Rule 50.2, which provides: ""In a case of reversal or vacating of any judgment or decree by this Court, costs shall be allowed to appellant or petitioner, unless otherwise ordered by this Court."" Respondents moved to retax costs, asserting that under the circumstances it would be unfair to burden them with petitioners' costs as well as their own. The Court, over the dissent of two Justices, denied the motion on May 2, 1983, ___ U.S. ___, 76 L.Ed.2d ___, and respondents now seek reconsideration of that decision. 
 In again denying respondents' motion to retax costs, the Court fails to exercise the sound discretion contemplated by Rule 50.2. The rationale of Rule 50.2 is that a petitioner who prevails in this Court should be reimbursed for his costs. In essence, the Rule presumes that the petitioner prevails when the lower court's judgment is vacated or reversed, but enables the Court to alter the operation of that presumption when fairness so dictates.

 On writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 
 
The motion of respondents to 
Page 463 U.S. 1226 , 1227
 retax costs is denied. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, dissenting. 
 In 1981, the city of Boston decided to lay off hundreds of firefighters and police officers. By statute, Massachusetts requires that civil service layoffs occur in the order of reverse seniority. Mass.Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 31, 39 (West). Many minority members of Boston's police and fire departments had been hired only recently pursuant to consent decrees by which Boston agreed to increase the proportion of minorities in the departments in order to remedy its past discriminatory hiring practices. As a result, layoffs under the statutory last-hired, first- fired policy would have reduced significantly the minority representation in the two departments. 
 Justice MARSHALL took no part in the consideration or decision of this motion. 
 Respondents obtained an order from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts enjoining Boston from laying off personnel pursuant to the statutory policy to the extent that such layoffs would reduce the percentage of minority police officers and firefighters below the level obtained before the layoffs began. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. 679 F.2d 965 (1982). After the Court of Appeals' decision, Massachusetts enacted legislation providing Boston with new revenues, requiring it to reinstate all police officers and firefighters laid off during the city's fiscal crisis, and securing those persons against future layoffs for fiscal reasons. 1982 Mass.Acts, ch. 190, 25.

 Justice BLACKMUN, dissenting. 
 In 1981, the city of Boston decided to lay off hundreds of firefighters and police officers. By statute, Massachusetts requires that civil service layoffs occur in the order of reverse seniority. Mass.Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 31, 39 (West). Many minority members of Boston's police and fire departments had been hired only recently pursuant to consent decrees by which Boston agreed to increase the proportion of minorities in the departments in order to remedy its past discriminatory hiring practices. As a result, layoffs under the statutory last-hired, first- fired policy would have reduced significantly the minority representation in the two departments. 
 Justice MARSHALL took no part in the consideration or decision of this motion. 
 Respondents obtained an order from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts enjoining Boston from laying off personnel pursuant to the statutory policy to the extent that such layoffs would reduce the percentage of minority police officers and firefighters below the level obtained before the layoffs began. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. 679 F.2d 965 (1982). After the Court of Appeals' decision, Massachusetts enacted legislation providing Boston with new revenues, requiring it to reinstate all police officers and firefighters laid off during the city's fiscal crisis, and securing those persons against future layoffs for fiscal reasons. 1982 Mass.Acts, ch. 190, 25.
