No. 83-912
Argued October 3, 1984
Decided December 10, 1984
469 U.S. 38

Syllabus 
During his trial in Federal District Court on federal drug charges, petitioner moved to preclude the Government from using a prior state conviction to impeach him if he testified.  Petitioner made no commitment to testify if the motion were granted and no proffer as to what his testimony would be.  The District Court denied the motion in limine, ruling that the prior conviction fell within the category of permissible impeachment evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a).  Petitioner did not testify, and the jury returned guilty verdicts.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that since petitioner did not testify, it would not consider petitioner's contention that the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion in limine without making a finding, as required by Rule 609(a)(1), that the probative value of the prior conviction outweighed its prejudicial effect.
Held:  To raise and preserve for review the claim of improper impeachment with a prior conviction, a defendant must testify.  To perform the weighing of the prior conviction's probative value against its prejudicial effect, as required by Rule 609(a)(1), the reviewing court must know the precise nature of the defendant's testimony, which is unknowable when, as here, the defendant does not testify.  Any possible harm flowing from a district court's in limine ruling permitting impeachment by a prior conviction is wholly speculative.  On the record in this case, it is conjectural whether the District Court would have allowed the Government to impeach with the prior conviction.  Moreover, when the defendant does not testify, the reviewing court has no way of knowing whether the Government would have sought so to impeach, and cannot assume that the trial court's adverse ruling motivated the defendant's decision not to testify.  Even if these difficulties could be surmounted, the reviewing court would still face the question of harmless error.  If in limine rulings under Rule 609(a) were reviewable, almost any error would result in automatic reversal, since the reviewing court could not logically term ""harmless"" an error that presumptively kept the defendant from testifying.  Requiring a defendant to testify in order to preserve Rule 609(a) claims enables the reviewing court to determine the impact any erroneous impeachment may have in light of the record as a whole, and 
Page 469 U. S. 39
 tends to discourage making motions to exclude impeachment evidence solely to ""plant"" reversible error in the event of conviction.  Pp.  469 U. S. 41-43.

Syllabus 
Respondent and two cohorts were indicted for bank robbery.  The cohorts pleaded guilty but respondent went to trial.  One of the cohorts, Ehle, agreed to testify against respondent.  Respondent informed the District Court that he would seek to counter Ehle's testimony with that of one Mills, who would testify that, after the robbery, Ehle had admitted to Mills that Ehle intended to implicate respondent falsely, in order to receive favorable treatment from the Government.  The prosecutor in turn disclosed that he intended to discredit Mills' testimony by calling Ehle back to the stand to testify that respondent, Mills, and Ehle were all members of a secret prison gang that was sworn to perjury and self-protection on each member's behalf.  When, upon being cross-examined by the prosecutor, Mills denied knowledge of the prison gang, the prosecutor, as permitted by the District Court, recalled Ehle, who testified that he, respondent, and Mills were members of the prison gang and described the gang and its tenets.  The jury convicted respondent.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Ehle's rebuttal testimony was admitted not just to show that respondent's and Mills' membership in the prison gang might cause Mills to color his testimony, but also to show that, because Mills belonged to the gang, he must be lying on the stand.  The court further held that Ehle's testimony implicated respondent as a member of the gang, but that since respondent did not take the stand, the testimony could not have been offered to impeach him and prejudiced him ""by mere association.""
Held:  The evidence showing Mills' and respondent's membership in the prison gang was sufficiently probative of Mills' possible bias towards respondent to warrant its admission into evidence.  Pp.  469 U. S. 49-56.
(a) While the Federal Rules of Evidence do not by their terms deal with impeachment for ""bias,"" it is clear that the Rules do contemplate such impeachment.  It is permissible to impeach a witness by showing his bias under the Rules just as it was permissible to do so before their adoption.  Here, Ehle's testimony about the prison gang certainly made the existence of Mills' bias towards respondent more probable, and it was thus relevant to support that inference.  A witness' and a party's common membership in an organization, even without proof that the witness or party has personally adopted its tenets, is certainly probative of 
Page 469 U. S. 46
 bias.  Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203, and Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, distinguished.  Pp.  469 U. S. 49-53.
(b) The District Court did not abuse its discretion under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 in admitting Ehle's full description of the prison gang and its tenets, since the type of organization in which a witness and a party share membership may be relevant to show bias.  The attributes of the prison gang bore directly not only on the fact of bias but also on the source and strength of Mills' bias.  Pp.  469 U. S. 53-55.
(c) It was not error under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) -- which allows a cross-examiner to impeach a witness by asking him about specific instances of past conduct, other than crimes covered by Rule 609, which are probative of his veracity -- to cross-examine Mills about the prison gang to show, in addition to Mills' bias, his membership in the gang's past conduct bearing on his veracity.  Nor was it error under Rule 608(b) to admit Ehle's rebuttal testimony concerning the gang.  The proffered testimony with respect to Mills' membership in the gang sufficed to show potential bias in respondent's favor, and such extrinsic evidence is admissible to show bias.  It is true that, because of the gang's tenets that the testimony described, the testimony might also have impeached Mills' veracity directly.  But there is no rule of evidence that provides that testimony admissible for one purpose and inadmissible for another purpose is thereby rendered inadmissible.  Pp.  469 U. S. 55-56.

Syllabus 
Respondent was indicted on a number of counts for violations of the federal narcotics laws.  Count 1 charged her with conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it.  The ""overt acts"" listed in support of this conspiracy included tapped telephone conversations indicating that respondent was helping her husband and son distribute drugs and collect money for drugs sold.  Count 9 charged respondent with possession of a specific quantity of cocaine with intent to distribute it.  Counts 3-6 charged respondent with the compound offenses of using the telephone in ""committing and in causing and facilitating"" the alleged conspiracy and possession, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  843(b).  The jury acquitted respondent of Counts 1, 6, and 9, but convicted her of Counts 3-5.  On appeal, respondent argued that the verdicts were inconsistent, and that therefore she was entitled to reversal of the telephone facilitation convictions.  The Court of Appeals agreed.  It acknowledged the rule of Dunn v. United States, 284 U. S. 390, that a defendant convicted by a jury on one count cannot attack the conviction because it was inconsistent with the verdict of acquittal on another count.  It was of the view, however, that situations where a defendant has been convicted under  843(b) but acquitted of the felony he is charged with facilitating constitute exceptions to the rule, and that in those situations the  843(b) conviction must be reversed.  The court explained that an acquittal on the predicate felony necessarily indicated that there was insufficient evidence to support the telephone facilitation convictions, and mandated acquittal on the telephone facilitation counts as well.
Held:  There is no reason to vacate respondent's telephone facilitation convictions merely because the verdicts cannot rationally be reconciled.  Pp.  469 U. S. 62-69.
(a) The Dunn rule embodies a prudent acknowledgment of a number of factors.  First, inconsistent verdicts -- even verdicts that acquit on a predicate offense while convicting on the compound offense -- should not necessarily be interpreted as a windfall to the Government at the defendant's expense.  It is equally possible that the jury, convinced of guilt, properly reached its conclusion on the compound offense, and then through mistake, compromise, or lenity arrived at an inconsistent conclusion on the lesser offense.  But in such situations the Government has 
Page 469 U. S. 58
 no recourse if it wishes to correct the jury's error.  The fact that the inconsistency may be the result of lenity, coupled with the Government's inability to invoke review, suggests that inconsistent verdicts should not be reviewable at the defendant's behest.  Pp.  469 U. S. 64-66.
(b) A rule that would allow defendants to challenge inconsistent verdicts on the ground that they were not the result of lenity but of some error that worked against the defendants, would be imprudent and unworkable.  It would be based on pure speculation or would require inquiries into the jury's deliberations that courts generally will not undertake.  Pp.  469 U. S. 66-67.
(c) A criminal defendant already is afforded protection against jury irrationality or error by the independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence undertaken by the trial and appellate courts.  P.  469 U. S. 67.
(d) To grant an exception to the Dunn rule where the jury acquits a defendant of a predicate felony but convicts on the compound felony, would threaten to swallow the rule.  And the argument that an acquittal on the predicate offense necessitates a finding of insufficient evidence on the compound felony simply misunderstands the nature of the inconsistent verdict problem, since it necessarily incorrectly assumes that the acquittal was proper.  Pp.  469 U. S. 67-69.
(e) Here, respondent was given the benefit of her acquittal on the conspiracy count, and it is neither irrational nor illogical to require her to accept the burden of conviction on the telephone facilitation counts.  P.  469 U. S. 69.

Syllabus 
For assaulting an undercover Secret Service agent with a loaded pistol, in an attempt to rob him of $1,800 of Government ""flash money"" that the agent was using to buy counterfeit currency from them, petitioners were convicted of violating 18 U.S.C.  2114, which proscribes the assault and robbery of any custodian of ""mail matter or of any money or other property of the United States.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions over petitioners' contention that  2114 is limited to crimes involving the Postal Service.
Held:  The language ""any money or other property of the United States"" in  2114 includes the $1,800 belonging to the United States and entrusted to the Secret Service agent as ""flash money,"" and thus by using a pistol in an effort to rob the agent petitioners fell squarely within the prohibitions of the statute.  Pp.  469 U. S. 73-80.
(a) ""Mail matter,"" ""money,"" and ""other property"" are separated from one another in  2114 by use of the disjunctive ""or.""  This means that the word ""money"" must be given its ordinary, separate meaning and does not mean ""postal money"" or ""money in the custody of postal employees.""  P.  469 U. S. 73.
(b) There is no ambiguity in the language of the statute.  But even if there were, the particular language here does not lend itself to application of the ejusdem generis rule so as to require reading the general terms ""money"" and ""other property"" following ""mail matter"" in a specific, restricted postal context.  The term ""mail matter"" is no more a specific term -- and is probably less specific -- than ""money.""  Pp.  469 U. S. 73-75.
(c) The legislative history shows no intent by Congress to limit the statute to postal crimes.  Pp.  469 U. S. 75-78.
(d) The fact that the Solicitor General in a prior case presenting the identical issue conceded that  2114 only applied to postal crimes, a concession he now states was unwarranted, does not relieve this Court of its responsibility to interpret Congress' intent in enacting  2114.

469 U.S. 91

Syllabus 
Shortly after his arrest for armed robbery, petitioner was taken to an interrogation room and read his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  When asked whether he understood his right to consult with a lawyer and to have a lawyer present during the questioning, he replied:  ""Uh, yeah. I'd like to do that.""  However, rather than terminate the interrogation to meet petitioner's request, the interrogating officers continued the interrogation; ultimately, he made incriminating statements.  Petitioner's motion to suppress the statements was denied by the Illinois trial court, and he was convicted of armed robbery.  The conviction was affirmed by both the Illinois Appellate Court and the Illinois Supreme Court, which held that petitioner's subsequent responses to continued police questioning rendered his initial request for counsel ""ambiguous"" and that the officers therefore were not required to terminate their questioning.
Held:  An accused who, during custodial interrogation, has expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him unless he validly waives his earlier request for the assistance of counsel.  Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477.  Where nothing about a request for counsel or the circumstances leading up to the request renders it ambiguous, all questioning must cease.  An accused's postrequest responses to further interrogation may not be used to cast doubt upon the clarity of his initial request for counsel.  His subsequent statements are relevant only to the entirely distinct question whether he waived the right he had invoked.  Here, there was no ambiguity in petitioner's initial request for counsel.
Certiorari granted; 102 Ill.2d 365, 466 N.E.2d 236, reversed and remanded.

However, rather than terminate the interrogation to meet petitioner's request, the interrogating officers continued the interrogation; ultimately, he made incriminating statements.  Petitioner's motion to suppress the statements was denied by the Illinois trial court, and he was convicted of armed robbery.  The conviction was affirmed by both the Illinois Appellate Court and the Illinois Supreme Court, which held that petitioner's subsequent responses to continued police questioning rendered his initial request for counsel ""ambiguous"" and that the officers therefore were not required to terminate their questioning.
Held:  An accused who, during custodial interrogation, has expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him unless he validly waives his earlier request for the assistance of counsel.  Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477.  Where nothing about a request for counsel or the circumstances leading up to the request renders it ambiguous, all questioning must cease.  An accused's postrequest responses to further interrogation may not be used to cast doubt upon the clarity of his initial request for counsel.  His subsequent statements are relevant only to the entirely distinct question whether he waived the right he had invoked.  Here, there was no ambiguity in petitioner's initial request for counsel.
Certiorari granted; 102 Ill.2d 365, 466 N.E.2d 236, reversed and remanded."|

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 10, 1984
 The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Treating the papers whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for writ of certiorari, certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 There are two facts of consequence in this case: first, at the time the case arose, Hawaii permitted the issue of insanity to be tried by a judge prior to the empaneling of a jury, and second, the defendant, who availed himself of this procedure, was acquitted. These facts raise an issue of substantial importance: may the State, consistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, appeal an acquittal based upon insanity entered prior to the empaneling of a jury. 
 I  
 Rodrigo Rodrigues, a 23-year-old Marine, was indicted on three counts of sodomy and one count of rape. Prior to the empaneling of a jury, Rodrigues' attorney raised the defense of mental disease. Pursuant to Haw. Rev.Stat. 704-408 (1976), the trial court suspended preliminary proceedings, appointed a panel of three psychiatrists to examine the defendant, and proceeded to try the issue of insanity. [Footnote 1] Over the course of 10 days, both the 
Page 469 U.S. 1078 , 1079
 defendant and the State adduced extensive testimony as to the defendant's sanity. Five experts, two of whom served on the panel appointed by the court, testified that the defendant was afflicted with multiple- personality syndrome, a dissociative disorder in which an individual's personality separates into complicated and autonomous subpersonalities. The judge concluded that the defendant was insane and entered an acquittal . The State appealed. The Supreme Court of Hawaii, in a divided opinion, reversed and remanded on the ground that the trial court erred in weighing the evidence as to insanity. [Footnote 2] 

 II  
 This Court has repeatedly stated that a fundamental purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is to protect acquittals based upon the resolution of the factual elements of an offense. [Footnote 3] 

 ""An acquittal is accorded special weight. 'The constitutional protection against double jeopardy unequivocally prohibits a second trial following an acquittal,' for the 'public interest in the finality of criminal judgments is so strong that an acquitted defendant may not be retried even though ' ""the acquittal was based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation."" See Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U.S. 141, 143 [, 672].

 In this case, the Court of Appeals vacated respondent's death sentence because it found that the state prosecutor withheld information that might have been material to the jury's sentencing decision.

 Kendal Ashmore was a horse breeder. On the morning of March 17, 1977, Mrs. Ashmore and her assistant, Kathy Brown, went to meet a man who had expressed an interest in Morgan horses. Phillip Ashmore returned home from work that evening to find that his wife had not returned. He soon received a tele- 
Page 469 U.S. 1090 , 1091
 phone call in which the caller told him that he had abducted Mrs. Ashmore and Brown. The caller demanded $1/2 million in $100 bills, and warned Mr. Ashmore not to tell anyone about the call. Mr. Ashmore called his attorney, who contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 The next day, Mr. Ashmore gathered the ransom money. The caller again telephoned, and told Mr. Ashmore to leave the money at a specified location at a local rodeo arena or his wife would be ""dead."" The caller also told Mr. Ashmore that the Ashmore truck was at 91st Street and Memorial Avenue in Tulsa. This call was traced to respondent's home phone. 
 Mr. Ashmore delivered the money to the predetermined spot at the rodeo grounds. Later that same day, he received a call telling him that the money had not been left in the proper place, that he should pick up the money, and try again the next day. The caller also told Mr. Ashmore that if he did not do exactly as he was told, ""I'm going to send back a big hunk of your old lady in a box to you in the mail. . . ."" This call was traced to a service station phone booth; the respondent's palm print was taken from the receiver handle on the telephone. 
 After the second call, the police set up surveillance of the respondent's home, which was about two miles from the rodeo grounds where the money was to be left. At about 3:20 a.m., the police arrested the respondent and searched his house. The bodies of Mrs. Ashmore and Brown were later found in a shallow grave on property rented by the respondent.

No. 83-1170
Argued October 2, 1984
Decided December 4, 1984
469 U.S. 24

Syllabus 
In connection with a flood control project, the United States filed proceedings in Federal District Court to condemn approximately 50 acres of land owned by respondent city of Duncanville, Tex., that had been used as a sanitary landfill.  The court awarded compensation in the amount of the condemned property's fair market value as determined by the jury, rather than the larger amount fixed by the jury as the reasonable cost to the city of acquiring and developing a substitute facility, which was larger and better than the condemned facility.  The court found no basis for departing from the normal market value standard for determining the amount of compensation, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.
Held:  The Fifth Amendment does not require that the United States pay a public condemnee compensation measured by the cost of acquiring a substitute facility that the condemnee has a duty to acquire, when the market value of the condemned property is ascertainable and when there is no showing of manifest injustice.  Pp.  469 U. S. 29-36.
(a) ""Just compensation"" under the Fifth Amendment normally is to be measured by the market value of the property at the time of the taking, and this case is not one in which an exception is required because fair market value is not ascertainable.  The testimony at trial established a fairly robust market for sanitary landfill properties.  Nor is an award of compensation measured by market value here fundamentally inconsistent with the basic principles of indemnity embodied in the Just Compensation Clause.  Pp.  469 U. S. 29-31.
(b) The text of the Fifth Amendment does not mandate a more favorable rule of compensation for public condemnees than for private parties.  The reference to ""private property"" in the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment encompasses the property of state and local governments when it is condemned by the United States, and under this construction the same principles of just compensation presumptively apply to both private and public condemnees.  P.  469 U. S. 31.
(c) When the dictum in Brown v. United States, 263 U. S. 78 -- which is the source of the ""substitute facilities doctrine"" -- is read in the context of the decision in that case, it lends no support to the suggestion that a distinction should be drawn between public and private condemnees.  
Page 469 U. S. 25
 Nor does it shed any light on the proper measure of compensation in this case.  Brown merely indicates that it would have been constitutionally permissible for the Federal Government to provide the city with a substitute landfill site instead of compensating it in cash.  Pp.  469 U. S. 31-33.
(d) The city's legal obligation to maintain public services that are interrupted by a federal condemnation does not justify a distinction between public and private condemnees for the purpose of measuring ""just compensation.""  The risk that a private condemnee might receive a ""windfall"" if its compensation were measured by the cost of a substitute facility that was never acquired or was later sold or converted to another use is not avoided by the city's obligation to replace the facility.  If the replacement facility is more costly than the condemned facility, it presumably is more valuable, and any increase in the quality of the facility may be as readily characterized as a ""windfall"" as the award of cash proceeds for a substitute facility that is never built.  Moreover, the substitute facilities doctrine, if applied in this case, would diverge from the principle that just compensation must be measured by an objective standard that disregards subjective values which are only of significance to an individual owner.  Pp.  469 U. S. 33-36.

No. 83-6775
Decided November 26, 1984
469 U.S. 17

Syllabus 
Prior to her Louisiana state court trial, petitioner, who was charged with the second-degree murder of her husband, moved to suppress certain evidence discovered during the search of her home, including a pistol found inside a chest of drawers and a suicide note found inside an envelope containing a Christmas card on the top of a chest of drawers.  The search was conducted by several officers responding to a homicide report made by petitioner's daughter.  According to petitioner's daughter, petitioner had shot her husband, taken pills in a suicide attempt, and then, changing her mind, had called her daughter, informed her of the situation, and requested help.  When officers arrived at petitioner's home, the daughter admitted them and directed them to the rooms containing the petitioner and the victim.  The officers transported the petitioner to the hospital and secured the scene.  Thirty-five minutes later, officers from the Sheriff's Office homicide unit arrived at the house and, without first obtaining a warrant, conducted a 2-hour ""general exploratory"" search of the entire house, during which the items in question were found.  The trial court held that the pistol and suicide note were obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and therefore must be suppressed.  The Louisiana Court of Appeal denied the State's application for review, but the Louisiana Supreme Court subsequently held that all of the evidence seized was admissible.
Held:  Although the homicide investigators may have had probable cause to search the premises, for the search to be valid, it must fall within one of the narrow and specifically delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.  Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, rejected the contention that one of the exceptions to the Warrant Clause is a ""murder scene exception.""  The 2-hour general search was a significant intrusion on petitioner's privacy and therefore could only be conducted subject to the constraints -- including the warrant requirement -- of the Fourth Amendment.  Nor did petitioner's attempt to get medical assistance evidence a diminished expectation of privacy in her home so as to legitimate the warrantless search.  Moreover, the evidence at issue was not discovered in plain view while the police were assisting petitioner to the hospital, nor was it discovered during the 
Page 469 U. S. 18
 ""victim-or-suspect"" search that had been completed by the time the investigators arrived.

According to petitioner's daughter, petitioner had shot her husband, taken pills in a suicide attempt, and then, changing her mind, had called her daughter, informed her of the situation, and requested help.  When officers arrived at petitioner's home, the daughter admitted them and directed them to the rooms containing the petitioner and the victim.  The officers transported the petitioner to the hospital and secured the scene.  Thirty-five minutes later, officers from the Sheriff's Office homicide unit arrived at the house and, without first obtaining a warrant, conducted a 2-hour ""general exploratory"" search of the entire house, during which the items in question were found.  The trial court held that the pistol and suicide note were obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and therefore must be suppressed.  The Louisiana Court of Appeal denied the State's application for review, but the Louisiana Supreme Court subsequently held that all of the evidence seized was admissible.
Held:  Although the homicide investigators may have had probable cause to search the premises, for the search to be valid, it must fall within one of the narrow and specifically delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.  Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, rejected the contention that one of the exceptions to the Warrant Clause is a ""murder scene exception.""  The 2-hour general search was a significant intrusion on petitioner's privacy and therefore could only be conducted subject to the constraints -- including the warrant requirement -- of the Fourth Amendment.  Nor did petitioner's attempt to get medical assistance evidence a diminished expectation of privacy in her home so as to legitimate the warrantless search.  Moreover, the evidence at issue was not discovered in plain view while the police were assisting petitioner to the hospital, nor was it discovered during the 
Page 469 U. S. 18
 ""victim-or-suspect"" search that had been completed by the time the investigators arrived.
Certiorari granted; 448 So.2d 666, reversed and remanded."|

 Supreme Court of the United States November 26, 1984 Rehearing Denied Dec. 11, 1984. See 469 U.S. 1099. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The order entered December 13, 1983 staying execution of sentence of death is vacated. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 The petitioner Alpha Otis O'Daniel Stephens has been condemned to death by electrocution. In this second petition for federal habeas relief, Stephens contends, inter alia, that he received the death penalty pursuant to a pattern and practice of racial discrimination in the administration of Georgia's capital sentencing system, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, he points to recently available statistical studies allegedly demonstrating a persistent and pronounced disparity in capital sentencing in Georgia based on the race of the defendant and the race of the victim. Stephens unsuccessfully has sought an evidentiary hearing to prove the accuracy and materiality of these data. 
 The courts below acknowledged that the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has recently held in several cases that the identical evidence proffered by Stephens is sufficient to require an evidentiary hearing under 28 U.S.C. 2254. The Eleventh Circuit in fact is currently considering en banc the very issues presented in Stephens' petition- whether the newly developed studies are reliable, and whether they are material to the constitutionality of Georgia's capital sentencing scheme. Stephens' petition has not been held pending the outcome of this en banc 
Page 469 U.S. 1043 , 1044
 consideration, however, because the courts below have concluded that Stephens has engaged in abuse of the writ. Specifically, they have determined that (1) although the new studies constitute ""newly discovered evidence"" for purposes of permitting relief on a first petition for habeas review, the identical studies do not constitute ""newly discovered evidence"" for purposes of securing relief on a second petition; and (2) Stephens in fact received an ""evidentiary hearing"" at which he failed to make an adequate ""proffer"" of the new studies. 
 Just last December, this Court stayed Stephens' execution pending the Eleventh Circuit's en banc resolution of the discrimination issue ""or until further order of this Court."" 464 U.S. 1027, 1028 (1983). In today's ""further order,"" the Court inexplicably reverses course and decides that the execution may proceed notwithstanding the continued pendency of the discrimination issue before the Eleventh Circuit. To the extent this reversal purports to rest on deference to the lower courts' abuse-of-the-writ findings, I would respectfully submit that those findings fly in the face of the Fifth Amendment, 28 U.S.C. 2254 and its attendant Rules, and well-settled precedent. Specifically, the record before us makes clear that (1) the proffered statistical studies are ""newly discovered evidence"" within the meaning of 2254; and (2) Stephens did not receive the full and fair opportunity to introduce these studies to which he was entitled by law. At the very least, this case presents substantial questions concerning the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine that will recur with ever-increasing frequency. I therefore dissent from the Court's denial of certiorari and its vacation of the stay of execution.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 26, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 This Court has unequivocally stated that a sentencer in a capital case must be permitted to consider, as evidence of mitigation, any aspect of a defendant's character or record, and any circumstances of the offense, that the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death. Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 2964 ( 1978). The issue squarely presented is whether, when a trial judge has prevented the jury from hearing indisputably relevant mitigating evidence, that error creates such an unacceptable risk that the death penalty was inappropriately imposed as to require a reviewing 
Page 469 U.S. 1062 , 1063
 court to remand for resentencing, even if the error was not properly preserved in the trial court. To hold that the fundamental error may be ignored is to penalize a defendant, possibly with his life, for the shortcomings of his attorney. I do not believe such a result comports with the most elemental principles underlying the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. I therefore dissent. 
 I  
 The relevant facts of this case are quite straightforward. The defendant took the stand at the sentencing phase of his trial and testified about certain statutory mitigating factors. Trial counsel then asked: ""Do you know anything else that you wish to tell this jury in mitigation of this offense of which you have been convicted?"" The prosecutor objected to this question, arguing that it was too broad because ""it must follow the statute."" Trial counsel tried to phrase the question differently, and again the objection was sustained. The trial court accepted the prosecution argument that the Florida death penalty statute permitted only evidence of statutory mitigating factors. Since, under this view, all evidence of nonstatutory mitigating factors was inadmissible, the trial judge did not permit the defendant to describe to the jury the mitigating circumstances of his background, and of the offense. 
 There is no dispute that the trial judge violated the mandate of Lockett v. Ohio when he ruled that evidence of nonstatutory mitigating factors was not admissible. However, defendant's trial counsel, who continued as appellate counsel, did not raise this issue either on direct appeal in the state courts, or in the first petition for certiorari filed with this Court. 
 Thereafter the defendant obtained new counsel, who filed a petition for habeas corpus in the Florida Supreme Court, which has original jurisdiction to address claims of ineffective assistance of counsel before that court. In a terse paragraph, the court dismissed the argument that appellate counsel was ineffective. The court ruled that appellate counsel could not be considered incompetent for failure to raise the claim on appeal because he was procedurally precluded from raising it. Under Florida law, the court explained, counsel was required to make a proffer of the attempted testimony after the trial judge excluded it. Thus, the court effectively ruled, there could have been no prejudice from the failure to raise the issue on appeal, since the court would not have addressed it anyway.

No. 83-1367
Decided November 13, 1984

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT COURT
OF APPEAL OF FLORIDA, THIRD DISTRICT
Syllabus 
At a pretrial suppression hearing in a Florida trial court where respondent was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, a county police officer, who had special training and experience in narcotics surveillance and apprehension, testified that he and another plainclothes officer followed respondent and his companions after they behaved in an unusual manner while leaving a ticket counter in the Miami International Airport; that as they proceeded to the concourse from which flights departed, respondent and his companions sighted the officers, and he made strange, evasive movements; that upon confronting respondent, the officer showed his badge, and respondent agreed to join his companions and the other officer at a nearby spot in the public area of the airport and to talk with the officers; that after respondent and one of his companions made conflicting statements in identifying themselves, they were informed that the officers were narcotics agents and were asked for consent to search respondent's luggage; and that respondent ultimately handed over the key, cocaine was found, and he and his companions were arrested.  The court granted respondent's motion to suppress the cocaine, holding that his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments had been violated, and the Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed.
Held:  Because of the public interest in suppressing illegal drug transactions and other serious crimes, a temporary detention for questioning in the case of an airport search even though constituting a ""seizure"" for 
Page 469 U. S. 2
 Fourth Amendment purposes -- may be justified without a showing of ""probable cause"" if there is ""articulable suspicion"" that a person has committed or is about to commit a crime.  Here, respondent's initial contact with the officers, where he was asked to step aside and talk with them, was the sort of consensual encounter that implicates no Fourth Amendment interest.  Assuming, arguendo, that there was a ""seizure"" thereafter, any such seizure was justified by ""articulable suspicion,"" and the trial court erred in concluding otherwise.  Moreover, contrary to the trial court's ruling, the State need not prove that a defendant consenting to a search knew that he had the right to withhold his consent.  Thus, it cannot be determined whether the trial court's holding that the voluntariness of respondent's consent to the luggage search was tainted by the initial stop would have been the same if it had correctly applied the governing Fourth Amendment principles.

 Rehearing Denied Jan. 14, 1985. 
 See 469 U.S. 1181. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 In Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335 ( 1980), this Court held that in order to establish a Sixth Amendment violation, a defendant challenging his attorney's representation of multiple clients must establish that the attorney's performance was affected by an actual conflict of interest, not merely a potential one. In the present case, the Illinois Supreme Court held that Cuyler 's actual- conflict-of-interest standard was limited to multiple-representation situations. 101 Ill.2d 104, 461 N.E.2d 393 (1984). Because that holding is contrary to the results reached by at least six other courts, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. [ Illinois v. Washington 469 U.S. 1022 (1984) ][1022-Continued.] 
 On May 7, 1979, Nathan Bottley was murdered in Chicago. Chicago police suspected Charles Washington, a resident of Chicago Heights, and made inquiries to the Chicago Heights police. As a result of these inquiries, Chicago Heights police officers reinterviewed witnesses to a 1977 murder in Chicago Heights, in which Washington had been a suspect, and arrested Washington for that crime. While Washington was in custody, he was also charged by Chicago police for the Bottley murder. 
 After being indicted for the Bottley murder, Washington filed pretrial motions to quash arrest and suppress identification, contending that his arrest in Chicago Heights had been without probable cause. Washington's attorney at this hearing also served as the city attorney for Chicago Heights, a fact that the State's attorney brought to the attention of the trial court. The defense attorney responded that he had consulted with Washington about the possible conflict of interest inherent in this situation, but that he ""anticipated no Chicago Heights Police Officers to be called"" in connection with the Chicago murder. The court questioned Washington and ascertained that he had no objection to being represented by his defense counsel. 
 Contrary to defense counsel's expectation, the State called a Chicago Heights police officer to establish that there was probable cause for the defendant's arrest in Chicago Heights on the 1977 murder charge. Defense counsel cross-examined the officer and 
Page 469 U.S. 1022 , 1023
 then called another Chicago Heights officer as a rebuttal witness. The trial court denied Washington's motion to quash arrest, basing its holding primarily on the testimony of these two officers. 
 On appeal, Washington argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because of his attorney's conflicting interests. The Illinois Appellate Court reversed the conviction on this ground, and the Illinois Supreme Court agreed. The Illinois Supreme Court adhered to its longstanding view that as a matter of federal constitutional law even a potential conflict of interest required reversal, rejecting the State's contention that Cuyler v. Sullivan required Washington to show that his attorney's performance had been adversely affected by an actual conflict of interest. The State's argument, the court held, overlooked the fact that Cuyler involved multiple representation of defendants. The court focused on Cuyler 's observation that ""a possible conflict inheres in almost every instance of multiple representation,"" so that a presumption that even potential conflict resulted in ineffective assistance ""would preclude multiple representation even in cases where '[a] common defense . . . gives strength against a common attack.' "" 446 U.S., at 348, 100 S. Ct., at 1718, quoting Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 92, 475 (1942) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). 
 Unlike the Illinois Supreme Court, numerous federal courts have failed to discern in Cuyler any limitation to cases involving multiple representation of defendants. See Westbrook v. Zant, 704 F.2d 1487, 1498- 1499 (CA11 1983); United States v. Harris, 701 F.2d 1095, 1099 (CA4 1983 ); United States v. Knight, 680 F.2d 470, 471 (CA6 1982) (per curiam ), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1102 (1983); Ware v. King, 694 F.2d 89, 92 (CA5 1982) (per curiam ), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 930 (1983); Alexander v. Housewright, 667 F.2d 556, 558 (CA8 1981); United States v. Hearst, 638 F.2d 1190, 1193 (CA9 1981). Most of these courts have simply applied Cuyler to non-multiple- representation situations without even considering the possibility that it did not apply. In United States v. Hearst, the Ninth Circuit observed that ""Sullivan's lawyer's conflict was based on multiple representation, whereas Hearst's was based on private financial interests,"" but concluded, without discussion, that this difference, among others, was ""immaterial."" 638 F.2d, at 1193. In Theodore v. New Hampshire, 614 F.2d 817 (CA1 1980), a pre-Cuyler case, the court held that an actual- [469 U.S. 1022 , 1024]

The defense attorney responded that he had consulted with Washington about the possible conflict of interest inherent in this situation, but that he ""anticipated no Chicago Heights Police Officers to be called"" in connection with the Chicago murder. The court questioned Washington and ascertained that he had no objection to being represented by his defense counsel. 
 Contrary to defense counsel's expectation, the State called a Chicago Heights police officer to establish that there was probable cause for the defendant's arrest in Chicago Heights on the 1977 murder charge. Defense counsel cross-examined the officer and 
Page 469 U.S. 1022 , 1023
 then called another Chicago Heights officer as a rebuttal witness. The trial court denied Washington's motion to quash arrest, basing its holding primarily on the testimony of these two officers. 
 On appeal, Washington argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because of his attorney's conflicting interests. The Illinois Appellate Court reversed the conviction on this ground, and the Illinois Supreme Court agreed. The Illinois Supreme Court adhered to its longstanding view that as a matter of federal constitutional law even a potential conflict of interest required reversal, rejecting the State's contention that Cuyler v. Sullivan required Washington to show that his attorney's performance had been adversely affected by an actual conflict of interest. The State's argument, the court held, overlooked the fact that Cuyler involved multiple representation of defendants. The court focused on Cuyler 's observation that ""a possible conflict inheres in almost every instance of multiple representation,"" so that a presumption that even potential conflict resulted in ineffective assistance ""would preclude multiple representation even in cases where '[a] common defense . . . gives strength against a common attack.' "" 446 U.S., at 348, 100 S. Ct., at 1718, quoting Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 92, 475 (1942) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). 
 Unlike the Illinois Supreme Court, numerous federal courts have failed to discern in Cuyler any limitation to cases involving multiple representation of defendants. See Westbrook v. Zant, 704 F.2d 1487, 1498- 1499 (CA11 1983); United States v. Harris, 701 F.2d 1095, 1099 (CA4 1983 ); United States v. Knight, 680 F.2d 470, 471 (CA6 1982) (per curiam ), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1102 (1983); Ware v. King, 694 F.2d 89, 92 (CA5 1982) (per curiam ), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 930 (1983); Alexander v. Housewright, 667 F.2d 556, 558 (CA8 1981); United States v. Hearst, 638 F.2d 1190, 1193 (CA9 1981). Most of these courts have simply applied Cuyler to non-multiple- representation situations without even considering the possibility that it did not apply. In United States v. Hearst, the Ninth Circuit observed that ""Sullivan's lawyer's conflict was based on multiple representation, whereas Hearst's was based on private financial interests,"" but concluded, without discussion, that this difference, among others, was ""immaterial."" 638 F.2d, at 1193. In Theodore v. New Hampshire, 614 F.2d 817 (CA1 1980), a pre-Cuyler case, the court held that an actual- [469 U.S. 1022 , 1024]

 November 13, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Once again this Court is confronted with a challenge to the constitutionality of the Government's use of peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors in a criminal trial because of their race. See Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 221, 836 ( 1965) (""[W]e cannot hold that the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial of equal protection of the laws"").* The continued vitality of Swain is by now a ""distressingly familiar"" issue to this Court. Williams v. Illinois, decided with Dixon v. Illinois and Yates v. Illinois, 466 U.S. 981, 982, 2365 (1984) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); see McCray v. New York, decided with Miller v. Illinois and Perry v. Louisiana, 461 U.S. 961, 963, 103 S. Ct. 2438, 2439 (1983) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Gilliard v. Mississippi, 464 U.S. 867 (1983) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). A majority of the Court has expressed the position that this question merits plenary review. See McCray, supra, 461 U.S., at 961 (opinion of STEVENS, J., joined by 
Page 469 U.S. 1024 , 1025
 BLACKMUN and POWELL, JJ.); id., at 963 (MARSHALL, J., joined by BRENNAN, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). The call to reconsider Swain, from both courts and scholars, continues unabated. It is time for this Court to face up to the issue. 
 Justice MARSHALL has written persuasively concerning the immediate need to reconsider Swain in light of Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968), and Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522 (1975), which found the Sixth Amendment's jury trial guarantees applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. See McCray v. New York, supra, 461 U.S., at 963 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Gilliard v. Mississippi, supra, 464 U.S., at 867 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). I add my voice here simply to make two points. First, however plausible the rationale of Swain may have seemed two decades ago, the justification for shielding peremptory challenges from equal protection scrutiny has not withstood the test of time. Swain thus should be reconsidered for equal protection as well as Sixth Amendment reasons. Second, the admirable intent of three of my colleagues in acknowledging the import of the issue but deferring our review ""to allow the various States to serve as laboratories in which the issue receives further study,"" see McCray, supra, 461 U.S., at 963, 103 S. Ct., at 2439 (opinion of STEVENS, J., joined by BLACKMUN and POWELL, JJ.), has spawned confusion not clarification in the courts below. 
 I  
 Swain is an anomaly, a departure from two fundamental principles of constitutional law. The first is the basic equal protection notion that government officials cannot exclude persons from juries solely because of their race. ""It is well known that prejudices often exist against particular classes in the community, which sway the judgment of jurors, and which, therefore, operate in some cases to deny to persons of those classes the full enjoyment of that protection [a jury of peers] which others enjoy."" Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 308-309 (1880). The second is the basic notion inherent in the ""American tradition of trial by jury"" that ""[j]ury competence is an individual rather than a group or class matter. That fact lies at the very heart of the jury system. To disregard it is to open the door to class distinctions and discrimination which are abhorrent to the democratic ideals of trial by jury.""

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 5, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Kentucky. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 Petitioner is a Negro male who was 51 at the time he was indicted for murder in Franklin County, Ky. He challenged the composition of the grand jury that indicted him on the grounds, inter alia, that women and young adults were substantially and systematically underrepresented on grand juries in Franklin County. Testimony from a statistician concluded that this underrepresentation was statistically significant. Evidence was also presented that the selection system was not facially neutral, for the voter registration list from which grand jurors are selected in the county contains information on the gender, race, and date of birth of the prospective grand jurors. [Footnote 1] 

 Despite petitioner's assertion and his substantiating evidence, the Kentucky Supreme Court refused to consider the merits of this challenge. 665 S.W.2d 304 (1984). Instead, that court held that, because petitioner was a 51-year-old Negro male, he had no standing to challenge the exclusion of women or young adults from grand juries in Franklin County. The court rested its conclusion on the view that challenges to the composition of a grand jury must be rooted in the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment rather than in that Amendment's due process component. Thus, the court below concluded that petitioner himself 
Page 469 U.S. 984 , 985
 had no recourse for challenging the imbalance of the grand jury that indicted him. [Footnote 2] 

 The conclusion of the Kentucky Supreme Court is flatly at odds with the opinion announcing this Court's judgment in Peters v. Kiff, 407 U.S. 493 (1972). That opinion, joined by three Justices, stated: ""[W]hen a grand or petit jury has been selected on an impermissible basis, the existence of a constitutional violation does not depend on the circumstances [i.e., the standing] of the person making the claim . . . . [A] State cannot, consistent with due process, subject a defendant to indictment or trial by a jury that has been selected in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner, in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States."" Id., at 498, 502, 2168 ( emphasis added). This three-Justice opinion therefore concluded that a white male had standing under both the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to bring a racial-discrimination challenge to the state system used to select his grand and petit juries. [Footnote 3] 

 The standing question is particularly important in light of the fact that, as of 1977, at least 22 States had some sort of discretionary system for the selection of grand jurors. J. Van Dyke, Jury Selection Procedures : Our Uncertain Commitment to Representative Panels, Appendix B, pp. 264- 270 (1977).

 November 5, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arizona. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. Even if I felt otherwise, however, I would grant certiorari in this case because the underlying conviction raises grave constitutional issues. 
 I  
 At stake in this case are the limits the Fifth Amendment places on official custodial interrogation of an accused who has invoked the right to assistance of counsel. See Solem v. Stumes, 465 U.S. 638 (1984); Oregon v. Bradshaw, 462 U.S. 1039 (1983); Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477 (1981). Admitting certain incriminating evidence against petitioner James in this case, the 
Page 469 U.S. 990 , 991
 Arizona trial court ignored the principles of Edwards and its progeny. To affirm the trial court, the Arizona Supreme Court applied Edwards and Bradshaw in a way that departs substantially from our intendment in those cases and merits plenary review. Because Arizona plans to execute James if this constitutionally infirm conviction stands, our responsibility to undertake review is clear. 
 II  
 On November 19, 1981, Phoenix police officers arrested James for the murder of Juan Maya. Shortly after the arrest, Officer Davis of the Phoenix force escorted James to a small, windowless room and began an interrogation. Officer Davis read James his Miranda rights and then informed him that he would be charged with first-degree murder. Tr. 5-7 ( Aug. 27, 1982). About 19 minutes into the interrogation, James asked Davis what would happen with respect to the murder charge. Davis responded that if James was found guilty the result would be up to the court. James appears to have perceived this statement as an intimation that capital punishment was possible, because at this point he made his first request for an attorney. Id., at 9-10 (Sept. 3, 1982). Instead of terminating the interrogation, the officer continued to press James to make some kind of a statement; Davis told James he was ""only trying to get the facts of the case and giving [James] the opportunity to tell his side of it too."" Id., at 8-10. According to the subsequent testimony of Officer Davis, James' response was hesitant and uncertain. He first suggested he might be willing to proceed without an attorney but then reversed himself and requested an attorney once again. Ibid. This second request for an attorney prompted Officer Davis to pick up his papers, stand and open the door. As he opened the door he encountered Sergeant Midkiff, the officer supervising this investigation, who was standing just outside. Id., at 10-11. As soon as he saw Officer Davis, Midkiff asked "" is he going to show us where the body is?"" Id., at 44 (Aug. 27, 1982). Midkiff later testified that he stood close to James when asking this question. Midkiff also testified that James ""might have assumed"" the question was intended for him. Id., at 52-53. Officer Davis and James responded to Midkiff's inquiry simultaneously. As Davis told Midkiff that James had invoked his right to counsel, James said ""I'll show you where the body is.""

 The petitioner Ira Borchardt challenges a judgment of the Fifth Circuit affirming his felony conviction for violations of the currency laws. A federal jury sitting in the Northern District of Texas found that Borchardt smuggled large sums of currency out of the country in furtherance of an illegal scheme to purchase and import marihuana from Mexico. Borchardt contends that, 
Page 469 U.S. 937 , 938
 because he already had been convicted of conspiracy-to-import charges by a federal jury sitting in the Southern District of Texas, the Northern District prosecution and conviction for the currency offenses violated his right under the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause not to be tried successively for the same criminal acts. The Government responds that (1) there was no double jeopardy violation; and (2) in any event, Borchardt's Sixth Amendment venue rights precluded the joinder of all charges at a single trial. 
 I believe this case presents an important question whether the second prosecution and conviction impermissibly rest on criminal acts that formed the basis of Borchardt's first conviction. I also believe the case presents an important question whether the Government improperly has exploited Borchardt's venue rights to defeat his right otherwise to be secure from repetitious prosecutions for the same criminal acts. The venue issue, in particular, is a substantial federal question that is likely to recur with frequency. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court's denial of certiorari.

 Borchardt began to conspire with several other individuals in August 1980 to import marihuana from Mexico into the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which is in the Northern District of Texas. Twice that autumn, Borchardt and his co-conspirators surreptitiously flew a total of $126,000 from the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport to Mexico City for the purpose of purchasing marihuana. Borchardt spent much of the next several months in Mexico making preparations to transport the purchases back into the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Between December 1980 and February 1981, he arranged for three airplane flights that carried a total of approximately 2,600 pounds of marihuana. The scheme began to unravel when, during the third flight on February 22, 1981, the airplane encountered bad weather, ran out of fuel, and crash-landed outside the town of Raymondville, which is in the Southern District of Texas. Borchardt, who had remained behind in Mexico, returned to this country and was arrested shortly thereafter. 
 The United States Attorney for the Southern District of Texas obtained an indictment in December 1981. Borchardt was charged with importing marihuana into the Southern District on February 22, 1981, and with constructively possessing marihuana on that date with the intent to distribute it.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Ohio, Cuyahoga County. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted by an Ohio jury of the murder of her husband Willie Moran. She asserted at trial that she had acted in self-defense, as a result of the repeated and brutal beatings she had suffered at her husband's hands. She seeks certiorari 
Page 469 U.S. 948 , 949
 to review the state appellate court's holding that the jury properly was instructed that she had the burden of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence. According to petitioner, the Due Process Clause forbids the State to punish her for murder when the jury that convicted her may well have thought it as likely as not that she acted in self-defense. I would grant certiorari to consider the substantial constitutional question raised by this petition-a question that this Court has labeled as ""colorable"" and ""plausible"" in previous decisions and that has for years divided state courts and lower federal courts. 
 I  
 A.  
 There was substantial testimony at petitioner's trial that her husband-a man of violent temperament who virtually always carried firearms and owned a collection of pistols, rifles, and shotguns-had repeatedly beaten and brutalized her. For example, in one incident, Willie Moran "" had her by the neck, by the throat, and he was hitting"" her with a gun. In another incident, Willie Moran ""hit her and knocked her off the chair and, then, kicked her."" Petitioner's mother testified that earlier in the very week in which the murder occurred she saw Willie Moran ""hit [ petitioner] and knocked her on the floor, and I seen him take his feet and was kicking her."" 
 On May 15, 1981, petitioner and Willie Moran had their last fight. According to petitioner's testimony, Willie Moran had told her that he wanted some money that he thought she had saved. He threatened that if petitioner did not have the money for him by the time he woke up from a nap, he would ""blow [her] damn brains out."" Petitioner, who did not have the money, unsuccessfully called a friend for help. Then, realizing that she had no way of raising the necessary funds, she entered the camper where Willie Moran was sleeping, picked up his gun, and fatally shot him.

 Supreme Court of the United States

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 This petition asks us to consider whether an attorney renders effective assistance of counsel when he forgoes all investigation into his client's only plausible line of defense and defers to his client's wishes on defense strategy, without any regard for the client's knowledge of, or ability to understand, the law, the facts, or the ramifications of the decision. 
 The question could scarcely be more starkly posed. The petitioner here had previously been adjudicated insane at a criminal trial, and his reasoning faculties were therefore highly suspect. Yet appointed counsel accepted his client's initial refusal to rely on the insanity defense, made no independent investigation of his 
Page 469 U.S. 956 , 957
 client's mental or criminal history, learned no facts that would enable him to persuade his client to change his mind, and instead permitted his client to rely on an unsupported alibi that all acknowledged to have been, at best, weak. The lower court approved this course of conduct on the ground that the client was found competent to stand trial and therefore was entitled to have his wishes followed. Because I believe the lower court decision seriously misconstrues the constitutional role of a criminal defense lawyer, I would grant certiorari to review the decision.

 The record demonstrates unequivocally that Gary Alvord has a long history of mental illness. He first entered a mental hospital at age 13. In 1967, he was charged in Michigan with rape and murder; he spent two years in a mental hospital and was then declared competent to stand trial. At a bench trial, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was committed to the custody of the Michigan Department of Mental Health. After escaping from the Ionia State Hospital in Michigan, he traveled to Florida, where he committed the three murders for which he received the death sentence in Florida. 
 Counsel, a part-time public defender, was appointed to represent Alvord after his indictment in 1973. Alvord refused to talk to the lawyer ; instead, it was the prosecutor who told counsel that Alvord had been adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity in Michigan. Counsel moved for a mental examination, and two psychiatrists were directed to conduct the examination. Ultimately, the trial judge ruled that Alvord was competent to stand trial. [Footnote 1] 

 Appointed counsel saw Alvord for about 15 minutes after Alvord was indicted. Counsel's subsequent pretrial contact with his client was primarily at court hearings. According to the Court of Appeals, Alvord's counsel conducted no independent

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 29, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 Posing as a Social Security Administration employee, petitioner Warren Wilkes told a benefit recipient that Social Security overpayments had been made. Wilkes demanded a return of the overpayments, and in this manner repeatedly obtained money. As a result, Wilkes was charged with violating the second clause of 18 U.S.C. 912, which prohibits demanding or obtaining anything of value while impersonating an officer or employee of a United States agency or department.* 
 At the end of the prosecution's case, Wilkes moved to dismiss the indictment for failure to charge intent to defraud in any of the counts. The District Court denied the motion. The judge found that although the indictment did not specifically allege an intent to defraud, it did charge, in the exact terminology of the statute, that petitioner pretended to be an employee of the United States acting under the authority thereof, and that acting as such and in such pretended character he demanded and obtained money from the victim in violation of the law. The jury found Wilkes guilty on all counts. The Third Circuit affirmed, holding that since the intent to defraud language was deleted from the statute in a 1948 revision, such an intent need not be specifically pleaded and 
Page 469 U.S. 964 , 965
 proved. 732 F.2d 1154 (1984). This rule is consistent with the approach of six other Circuits. See United States v. Cord, 654 F.2d 490 (CA7 1981 ); United States v. Robbins, 613 F.2d 688 (CA8 1979); United States v. Rosser, 174 U.S.App.D.C. 79, 528 F.2d 652 (1976); United States v.

Guthrie, 387 F.2d 569 (CA4 1967). 
 The rule in the Fifth Circuit, however, is otherwise. See United States v. Cohen, 631 F.2d 1223 (1980); United States v. Randolph, 460 F.2d 367 (1972); Honea v. United States, 344 F.2d 798 (1965). The Fifth Circuit views congressional deletion of the intent to defraud language as merely an attempt to make statutory wording conform to authoritative judicial construction. As the Fifth Circuit sees it, the legislative history indicates that Congress labored under a misconception over what the prevailing judicial interpretation required. Id., at 802. Thus, intent to defraud is still an element of the offense and must be specifically alleged in the indictment. 
 The statute at issue defines a federal crime, and it should be applied uniformly throughout the United States. Yet, because of conflicting interpretations, defendants in some parts of this country may be punished for violations without proof or pleading of an element required in another judicial circuit. Criminal culpability for violation of federal statutes should turn on uniform law, not geography. I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Circuits.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 In Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 ( 1975), this Court held that a defendant in a state criminal trial has a right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to proceed without counsel if he clearly and unequivocally asks to do so. In this case, the petitioner made a motion to represent himself in which he cited Faretta. According to Faretta, when such a motion is made, the court must assure that the petitioner understands the dangers of his decision, and that the decision is knowing and voluntary, and then rule on the motion. The state trial court, however, did not make such an inquiry and effectively denied the motion. Reviewing the District Court's denial of a petition for habeas corpus, the 
Page 469 U.S. 966 , 967
 Federal Court of Appeals held that the state trial court had not committed reversible error because events subsequent to petitioner's assertion of the right demonstrated that petitioner's initial request was ambiguous. 732 F.2d 803 (CA11 1984). The analysis of the Court of Appeals reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the right guaranteed by Faretta. I, therefore, dissent.

 The facts of this case are not in dispute. Petitioner James David Raulerson was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. His death sentence was stayed by a Federal District Court, 508 F.Supp. 381 ( MD Fla.1980), and a second sentencing hearing was scheduled to be held in state court. Before the second sentencing hearing, petitioner expressed considerable dissatisfaction with his attorney, and the attorney asked the court's permission to withdraw. The court denied the motion. Thereafter, on July 15, 1980, three weeks prior to the second sentencing hearing, Raulerson asked the trial court to permit him to act as co-counsel with his attorney. The court denied his motion. Next, on July 18, petitioner wrote a letter to the trial judge specifically requesting permission to appear pro se: 
 ""Upon calling [court-appointed counsel] Mr. Busch today I am met with cold indifference. . . . 
 ""With these things to your attention I wish to make motions to: 
 
 The state court provided a copy of the letter to counsel and did nothing more. At the start of the sentencing hearing, the trial judge told Raulerson that under Florida law he could appear as co-counsel and that if he ""continues to wish to participate in the representation of himself,"" id., at 6, he would allow him to participate as co-counsel. In other words, the trial judge instructed Raulerson precisely to the contrary of what the law is, indicating that he could not proceed on his own but could proceed as co-counsel. Later in the hearing, the trial judge reversed himself and held that Raulerson could not even participate as co-counsel. Also at the sentencing hearing, counsel asked for a continuance and informed the court that he was not prepared to proceed; at [469 U.S. 966 , 968]

California, 422 U.S. 806 ( 1975), this Court held that a defendant in a state criminal trial has a right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to proceed without counsel if he clearly and unequivocally asks to do so. In this case, the petitioner made a motion to represent himself in which he cited Faretta. According to Faretta, when such a motion is made, the court must assure that the petitioner understands the dangers of his decision, and that the decision is knowing and voluntary, and then rule on the motion. The state trial court, however, did not make such an inquiry and effectively denied the motion. Reviewing the District Court's denial of a petition for habeas corpus, the 
Page 469 U.S. 966 , 967
 Federal Court of Appeals held that the state trial court had not committed reversible error because events subsequent to petitioner's assertion of the right demonstrated that petitioner's initial request was ambiguous. 732 F.2d 803 (CA11 1984). The analysis of the Court of Appeals reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the right guaranteed by Faretta. I, therefore, dissent.

 The facts of this case are not in dispute. Petitioner James David Raulerson was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. His death sentence was stayed by a Federal District Court, 508 F.Supp. 381 ( MD Fla.1980), and a second sentencing hearing was scheduled to be held in state court. Before the second sentencing hearing, petitioner expressed considerable dissatisfaction with his attorney, and the attorney asked the court's permission to withdraw. The court denied the motion. Thereafter, on July 15, 1980, three weeks prior to the second sentencing hearing, Raulerson asked the trial court to permit him to act as co-counsel with his attorney. The court denied his motion. Next, on July 18, petitioner wrote a letter to the trial judge specifically requesting permission to appear pro se: 
 ""Upon calling [court-appointed counsel] Mr. Busch today I am met with cold indifference. . . . 
 ""With these things to your attention I wish to make motions to: 
 
 The state court provided a copy of the letter to counsel and did nothing more. At the start of the sentencing hearing, the trial judge told Raulerson that under Florida law he could appear as co-counsel and that if he ""continues to wish to participate in the representation of himself,"" id., at 6, he would allow him to participate as co-counsel. In other words, the trial judge instructed Raulerson precisely to the contrary of what the law is, indicating that he could not proceed on his own but could proceed as co-counsel. Later in the hearing, the trial judge reversed himself and held that Raulerson could not even participate as co-counsel. Also at the sentencing hearing, counsel asked for a continuance and informed the court that he was not prepared to proceed; at [469 U.S. 966 , 968]

 I would grant certiorari to consider the constitutionality of the Pennsylvania death penalty statute, under which the jury must impose a death sentence upon a finding of one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances. Such a scheme precludes any individualized consideration that "" 'death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case,' "" Lockett v.

North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 305, 2991 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.), virtually eliminates the possibility of a mercy verdict, and absolves the jury from the obligation of taking moral responsibility for its actions.

 Maxwell was convicted of first-degree murder, a crime punishable by death in Pennsylvania. At the sentencing hearing, the

 State presented evidence of two aggravating circumstances. Maxwell did not present any evidence of mitigating circumstances, and the jury failed to find mitigating circumstances. 505 Pa. 152, 477 A.2d 1309 (1984). Maxwell's counsel, however, made a plea for mercy. 
 Under the Pennsylvania death penalty statute, ""the verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance . . . and no mitigating circumstance . . . ."" 42 Pa.Cons. Stat. 9711(c)(1)(iv) (1980) (emphasis added). The trial judge's instruction to the jury paraphrased the language of the statute. 
 In construing the statute, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has stated that where no mitigating circumstances are found, ""one aggravating circumstance alone requires a verdict of death."" Commonwealth v. Beasley, 504 Pa. 485, 500, n. 3, 475 A.2d 730, 738, n. 3 (1984) (emphasis added). Indeed, in considering Maxwell's appeal, that court stated that because Maxwell ""did not introduce any evidence of mitigating circumstances, it became unnecessary to 'weigh' opposing circumstances."" 505 Pa., at 168, 477 A.2d, at 1317-1318.

 I am troubled by Pennsylvania's mechanical imposition of the death penalty. Under the Pennsylvania death penalty statute, once the jury fails to find mitigating circumstances, it is precluded from making any further inquiry. At that point, in returning its verdict-the most serious judgment that our society can render-the jury acts in a merely ministerial capacity. The legislature and the courts have barred independent decisionmaking. 
 The Pennsylvania statute, as interpreted by the State's courts, raises two substantial questions that are worthy of this Court's attention . The first is whether placing such severe constraints on the jury is consistent with the requirement of individualized punishment in capital cases. See Lockett v. Ohio, supra, 438 U.S., at 601. The problem posed by the ""mandatory"" aspect of death penalty schemes in which the jury must return a death sentence without considering the appropriateness of such a sentence was discussed by Justice STEVENS in Smith v. North Carolina, 459 U.S. 1056 ( 1982) (respecting denial of certiorari). In Smith, the jury was required to make three findings: [469 U.S. 971 , 973]

 Robert D. HEINEYv. FLORIDANo. 83-6994 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 15, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I continue to adhere to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); Furman v. 
Page 469 U.S. 920 , 921
 Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 314, 2764 (1972) ( MARSHALL, J., concurring). I therefore dissent from the Court's denial of the petition and would vacate the death sentence here. 
 I  
 I must also write, however, to point out an aspect of the trial judge's sentencing decision that violates indispensable principles contained in the prevailing death penalty jurisprudence of this Court. The trial judge in this case overturned a jury recommendation of life and sentenced the defendant to die, in part out of a belief as to the law that is wholly inconsistent with the constitutional principles of Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104 (1982), and Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978). 
 In reviewing the jury recommendation against death, the sentencing judge explained that he saw no mitigating circumstances, and that he believed the jury had based its recommendation on an ""invalid"" mitigating circumstance stemming from residual feelings of doubt as to guilt. Because he saw this as a legally improper mitigating circumstance he felt little hesitancy in putting their recommendation to the side. Since the sentencing here, the Florida Supreme Court seems to have added its voice in support of the proposition that lingering doubts as to guilt cannot be a ground for mitigating a death sentence. 
 ""A convicted defendant cannot be 'a little bit guilty.' It is unreasonable for a jury to say in one breath that a defendant's guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and, in the next breath, to say someone else may have done it, so we recommend mercy."" Buford v. State, 403 So.2d 943, 953 (1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1164, 102 S. Ct. 1039 (1981). 
 The error of the sentencing judge in this case thus seems to have been enshrined in Florida law. 
 This Court, in Lockett and then more decisively in Eddings, held that any aspect of the case that could rationally support mitigation must be deemed a legally valid basis for mitigation. There is certainly nothing irrational-indeed, there is nothing novel-about the idea of mitigating a death sentence because of lingering doubts as to guilt. It has often been noted that one of the most fearful aspects of the death penalty is its finality. There is simply no possibility of correcting a mistake. The horror of sending an innocent defendant to death is thus qualitatively different from the horror of falsely imprisoning that defendant. The belief that such [469 U.S. 920 , 922]

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice O'CONNOR joins, dissenting. 
 In South Prairie Construction Co. v. Operating Engineers, 425 U.S. 800 (1976) (per curiam ), this Court held that a Federal Court of Appeals did not have jurisdiction to decide the appropriateness of a bargaining unit in the first instance, but should have allowed the National Labor Relations Board to make an initial determination. Because two Courts of Appeals have adopted inconsistent interpretations of South Prairie, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 In South Prairie, a union that represented the employees of one company had filed a complaint with the Board contending that its collective-bargaining agreement should cover the employees of a second company because the two companies actually constituted a ""single employer"" within the National Labor Relations Act. The Board concluded that the two companies were in fact separate employers, and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside this determination. It then went on to reach and decide a second question, which had not been passed on by the Board: whether the employees of the two companies constituted the appropriate unit under 9( b) of the Act for purposes of collective bargaining. Section 9(b) directs the Board to ""decide in each case whether . . . the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining shall be the employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, or subdivision thereof."" 61 Stat. 143, 29 U.S.C. 159( b). We held that the Court of Appeals had erred when it took upon itself the initial determination of this issue: 
 In the present case, the Court of Appeals interpreted this language to mean that a federal court is precluded from deciding the appropriateness of a bargaining unit even when the question has never been presented to the Board. The union in this case had proceeded directly into federal court under 301(a) of the Labor 
Page 469 U.S. 887 , 889
 Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 185(a). It alleged that the company whose employees it represented and another company constituted a ""single employer,"" and sought a declaratory judgment that the second company was bound by the union's collective-bargaining agreement with the first company. The District Court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate this complaint. The Court of Appeals held that South Prairie necessarily implied that ""single employer questions comprise two subsidiary issues"": whether two companies constitute a single employer, and whether the employees form a single or appropriate bargaining unit. 693 F.2d 81, 82 (1982). Section 301 granted district courts jurisdiction to determine the first of these questions, but not the second. The appropriateness of a bargaining unit was a ""representational question reserved in the first instance to the Board."" Id., at 84. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals remanded to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing on the single employer issue only. 
 Two days later, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion in a similar case. Carpenters Local Union No. 1846 v. Pratt-Farnsworth, Inc., 690 F.2d 489 (1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 932 (1983). The Fifth Circuit read South Prairie as being limited to the situation in which two claims are initially presented to the Board and only one of them is decided there. In the Fifth Circuit's view, South Prairie did not preclude a federal court with jurisdiction under 301 from determining whether a bargaining unit is appropriate, where such a determination was necessary to a resolution of the underlying breach-of-contract issue. Because neither party had petitioned the Board to determine the appropriateness of the bargaining unit in Pratt-Farnsworth, the Fifth Circuit remanded the case to the District Court for consideration of the question. The Court of Appeals found support for this disposition in decisions of this Court upholding the jurisdiction of federal courts under 301 even in the face of the Board's exclusive jurisdiction to consider allegations of unfair labor practices. The bargaining unit issue, the Fifth Circuit concluded, was a ""collateral issue"" that was essential to the determination of a breach-of-contract claim under 301. Cf. Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters, 421 U.S. 616, 626, 1837d 418 (1975) (federal courts may decide unfair labor practice questions that emerge as collateral issues under the antitrust laws). 
Page 469 U.S. 887 , 890
 These two decisions are in square conflict. Although the conflict is now limited to two Circuits, these Circuits are very large Circuits indeed, and the issue will surely arise elsewhere. The Eighth Circuit, addressing the narrower question whether a federal court may determine the appropriateness of a bargaining unit under 301 after the Board has made such a determination in a prior administrative proceeding, has read South Prairie broadly, as did the Ninth Circuit in this case. Local Union 204 of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Affiliated With AFL- CIO v. Iowa Electric Light and Power Co., 668 F.2d 413 (1982). The Eighth Circuit drew the line ""between those cases where the district court has jurisdiction under section 301 and those in which it does not"" by "" examining the major issues to be decided as to whether they can be characterized as primarily representational or primarily contractual."" Id., at 419. It characterized the determination of an appropriate bargaining unit as a representational question committed to the jurisdiction of the Board. 
 I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict between the Fifth and Ninth Circuits, and to avert the wider conflict that will likely arise in the wake of these inconsistent decisions.

 Two days later, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion in a similar case. Carpenters Local Union No. 1846 v. Pratt-Farnsworth, Inc., 690 F.2d 489 (1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 932 (1983). The Fifth Circuit read South Prairie as being limited to the situation in which two claims are initially presented to the Board and only one of them is decided there. In the Fifth Circuit's view, South Prairie did not preclude a federal court with jurisdiction under 301 from determining whether a bargaining unit is appropriate, where such a determination was necessary to a resolution of the underlying breach-of-contract issue. Because neither party had petitioned the Board to determine the appropriateness of the bargaining unit in Pratt-Farnsworth, the Fifth Circuit remanded the case to the District Court for consideration of the question. The Court of Appeals found support for this disposition in decisions of this Court upholding the jurisdiction of federal courts under 301 even in the face of the Board's exclusive jurisdiction to consider allegations of unfair labor practices. The bargaining unit issue, the Fifth Circuit concluded, was a ""collateral issue"" that was essential to the determination of a breach-of-contract claim under 301. Cf. Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers & Steamfitters, 421 U.S. 616, 626, 1837d 418 (1975) (federal courts may decide unfair labor practice questions that emerge as collateral issues under the antitrust laws). 
Page 469 U.S. 887 , 890
 These two decisions are in square conflict. Although the conflict is now limited to two Circuits, these Circuits are very large Circuits indeed, and the issue will surely arise elsewhere. The Eighth Circuit, addressing the narrower question whether a federal court may determine the appropriateness of a bargaining unit under 301 after the Board has made such a determination in a prior administrative proceeding, has read South Prairie broadly, as did the Ninth Circuit in this case. Local Union 204 of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Affiliated With AFL- CIO v. Iowa Electric Light and Power Co., 668 F.2d 413 (1982). The Eighth Circuit drew the line ""between those cases where the district court has jurisdiction under section 301 and those in which it does not"" by "" examining the major issues to be decided as to whether they can be characterized as primarily representational or primarily contractual."" Id., at 419. It characterized the determination of an appropriate bargaining unit as a representational question committed to the jurisdiction of the Board. 
 I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict between the Fifth and Ninth Circuits, and to avert the wider conflict that will likely arise in the wake of these inconsistent decisions.

 ROHRER, HIBLER, & REPLOGLE, INC.v. Robert D. PERKINSNo. 83-1759 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 9, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting. 
 In 1977, respondent, Dr. Robert Perkins, signed a contract of employment with petitioner Rohrer, Hibler & Replogle, Inc. The contract provided that the Circuit Court of Cook County, Ill., would have jurisdiction over any disputes that might arise between the parties. In 1983, such a dispute arose, and petitioner filed suit against respondent in the Cook County Circuit Court. Respondent removed the suit to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on grounds of diversity. Arguing that the contract required that the dispute be adjudicated in the Cook County court, petitioner filed a motion to remand to the state court. The District Court denied the motion on the ground that the contractual provision was not a mandatory forum selection clause, and petitioner attempted to appeal the ruling. 
Page 469 U.S. 890 , 891
 The Seventh Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal from the denial of the motion to remand. 728 F.2d 860. The court rejected petitioner's theory that the order was appealable under 28 U.S.C. 1291 because it fell into ""that small class [of orders] which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated."" Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546, 1225 (1949). The court noted that there was no reason to believe that the order would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment. The court also declined to hold the order reviewable under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651, on the ground that a petition for a writ of mandamus may not be used as a substitute for an appeal. Finally, the court held that the order was not reviewable under 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1), which allows appeals from interlocutory orders ""granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions."" Petitioner contended that this provision was applicable by virtue of Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co., 293 U.S. 379 (1935), and Ettelson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 317 U.S. 188 (1942), which hold that a stay issued to allow consideration of an equitable defense is an ""injunction"" for purposes of 1292(a)(1). The Seventh Circuit pointed out, however, that remanding a case to a state court was not the equivalent of issuing a stay; accordingly, the denial of the motion was not appealable under 1292(a)(1). 
 In short, the Seventh Circuit held that a district court's interlocutory order declining to give effect to a contractual forum selection clause is not an appealable order under 28 U.S.C. 1291. This holding appears to place the Seventh Circuit in direct conflict with the Third Circuit, which held a similar order appealable in Coastal Steel Corp. v. Tilghman Wheelabrator Ltd., 709 F.2d 190 (CA), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 938 (1983). In Coastal Steel, the District Court denied defendant's motion to dismiss a contract action on the basis of a contractual provision calling for litigation of any claims under the contract in an English court. The Third Circuit held that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal under either the Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp. exception to 1291's finality requirement, the All Writs Act, or 1292(a)(1) as interpreted in Enelow and Ettelson, supra. [469 U.S. 890 , 892]

 Phillip Nathaniel WILLIFORDv. UNITED STATESNo. 83-6814 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 9, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Phillip Williford was convicted of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1343 and of making a false statement in a loan application, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1014. The original indictment charging him was returned on May 4, 1982. A superseding indictment was filed on August 17, 1982, and a second superseding indictment was filed on April 21, 1983. This final indictment omitted one paragraph describing a fraudulent transaction contained in its predecessor. 
 Petitioner sought a postponement of the scheduled trial date under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. 3161(c)(2). That provision guarantees an adequate time to prepare a defense to the charge by preventing trial commencement until 30 days from the defendant's first appearance, unless the defendant consents in writing to an earlier date. Petitioner argued that 3161(c)(2) precluded commencement of his trial until 30 days elapsed following the return of the last indictment. The District Court disagreed, and petitioner's trial began on May 3, 1983, only 12 days after the final indictment was returned. 
 When an indictment is dismissed on the motion of a defendant, under 18 U.S.C. 3161(d)(1) any reindictment for the same 
Page 469 U.S. 893 , 894
 offense renews the 30-day period of 3161(c)(2). In this case, however, the Fifth Circuit upheld petitioner's conviction, finding that a different rule applies when the prior indictment is dismissed on the motion of the Government: The minimum time limit runs from the original, not superseding, indictment, and any continuance is left to the discretion of the district judge. This holding is consistent with the view of the Seventh Circuit, United States v. Horton, 676 F.2d 1165, 1169 (1982), the Second Circuit, United States v. Todisco, 667 F.2d 255, 260 (1981), and the Eighth Circuit, United States v. Dennis, 625 F.2d 782, 793 (1980). It conflicts, however, with the rule in the Ninth Circuit. In United States v. Harris, 724 F.2d 1452 (1984), the Ninth Circuit held that the 30-day period applies even when the Government obtains an overlapping, superseding indictment. The court explained: 
 Accord, United States v. Arkus, 675 F.2d 245, 247-248 (CA9 1982); see also United States v. Wooten, 688 F.2d 941, 951 (CA4 1982) (""[S]ection 3161(c)(2) . . . guarantee[s] to the criminal defendant the right to a delay of at least 30 days between arraignment and trial in any circumstances""). 
 Section 3161(c) was designed to protect the basic due process right of having adequate time to prepare a defense without allowing defendants to delay their scheduled trials unduly. S.Rep. No. 96-212, p. 32 (1979). There is a direct conflict among the Circuits over how that command will be put into effect. Congress intended the Speedy Trial Act to provide a uniform national rule regarding trial scheduling and delay. Yet, because of the conflicting interpretations of the various Circuits, a defendant's right to a 30-day preparation period after a superseding indictment now depends almost as much on the happenstance of geography as it does on the will of the Legislative Branch. 
 Accordingly, I dissent from the denial of certiorari.

 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
Page 469 U.S. 894 , 895
 
 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I would grant certiorari to consider the constitutionality of the Illinois death penalty statute, which vests in the prosecutor the unlimited and unguided discretion to trigger death sentencing proceedings. Under the statute, a death sentencing proceeding will follow a conviction for a crime punishable by death only ""[w]here requested by the State."" Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 38, 9-1(d) (Supp.1984). If the prosecutor chooses not to request such a proceeding, the defendant cannot be sentenced to death. 
 Yet the prosecutor's decision whether to make this request is not guided by any legislative standard. Thus, the Illinois scheme introduces unbridled discretion at a stage at which ""discretion must be suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action."" Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 189, 2932 (1976) (joint opinion announcing the judgment of the Court). Accordingly, a substantial question is presented as to the constitutionality of the statute. 
 I  
 At the outset, it is important to state clearly what this case is not about. It is not about prosecutorial discretion in an area traditionally committed to such discretion. The discretion at issue here is fundamentally different from the discretion a prosecutor exercises in determining whether to seek an indictment for an offense punishable by death, or to accept a plea of guilty to a lesser included offense. What is at stake, instead, is standardless discretion at the postconviction phase of capital cases-the phase in which this Court has repeatedly emphasized that discretion must be carefully guided. 
 The joint opinion announcing the Court's judgment in Gregg v. Georgia, supra, carefully distinguishes preconviction discretion-which it deems permissible-from postconviction discretion-which, it states, can render a scheme unconstitutional. That opinion makes clear that unguided discretion at the latter stage is impermissible: ""[T]he decision to impose the death sentence on a specific individual who ha[s] been convicted of a capital offense"" must be guided by standards and cannot be imposed on a ""capriciously selected group of offenders.""

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 9, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting. 
 In Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385 (1982), we held that the timely filing of an employment discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC) is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to a suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against a private employer. The time limit on the filing of a charge is therefore subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling. In so holding, we settled a conflict among the Courts of Appeals. This case presents a similar question, against the background of a similar conflict, regarding Title VII suits against the Federal Government. 
Page 469 U.S. 898 , 899
 After being fired by respondent, petitioner filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging racial discrimination. The Commission denied relief, and petitioner then filed suit in Federal District Court. Under 42 U.S.C . 2000e-16(c), the complaint was due within 30 days of petitioner's receipt of notice of the EEOC's final action. The District Court determined that petitioner had missed this deadline and dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 12(b)(1). The Court of Appeals affirmed, stating that ""the time limits for filing Title VII actions against the federal government are jurisdictional."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. The court relied on Sims v. Heckler, 725 F.2d 1143 (CA7 1984), which held that a federal employee's failure to file a timely administrative charge barred a later suit. Sims concluded that considerations of sovereign immunity made the principles underlying Zipes inapplicable when the defendant is the Federal Government. 
 The position of the Seventh Circuit directly conflicts with that of three other Courts of Appeals. See Martinez v. Orr, 738 F.2d 1107 (CA10 1984); Milam v. United States Postal Service, 674 F.2d 860 (CA11 1982); Saltz v. Lehman, 217 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 672 F.2d 207 (1982) (time limit for filing with EEOC). The Ninth Circuit might be added to this list, though its position is unclear. See Cooper v. Bell, 628 F.2d 1208, 1213, and n. 10 (1980); Ross v. United States Postal Service, 696 F.2d 720 (1983); Rice v. Hamilton Air Force Base Commissary, 720 F.2d 1082, 1083-1084, and n. 1 (1983). 
 Whether tolling would be appropriate in this case if the time limit is not jurisdictional was neither argued nor considered below. Because the complaint was dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1), the question of the jurisdictional significance of the 30-day limit is squarely presented. In light of the conflict among the lower courts, I would grant certiorari.

The District Court determined that petitioner had missed this deadline and dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 12(b)(1). The Court of Appeals affirmed, stating that ""the time limits for filing Title VII actions against the federal government are jurisdictional."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. The court relied on Sims v. Heckler, 725 F.2d 1143 (CA7 1984), which held that a federal employee's failure to file a timely administrative charge barred a later suit. Sims concluded that considerations of sovereign immunity made the principles underlying Zipes inapplicable when the defendant is the Federal Government. 
 The position of the Seventh Circuit directly conflicts with that of three other Courts of Appeals. See Martinez v. Orr, 738 F.2d 1107 (CA10 1984); Milam v. United States Postal Service, 674 F.2d 860 (CA11 1982); Saltz v. Lehman, 217 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 672 F.2d 207 (1982) (time limit for filing with EEOC). The Ninth Circuit might be added to this list, though its position is unclear. See Cooper v. Bell, 628 F.2d 1208, 1213, and n. 10 (1980); Ross v. United States Postal Service, 696 F.2d 720 (1983); Rice v. Hamilton Air Force Base Commissary, 720 F.2d 1082, 1083-1084, and n. 1 (1983). 
 Whether tolling would be appropriate in this case if the time limit is not jurisdictional was neither argued nor considered below. Because the complaint was dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1), the question of the jurisdictional significance of the 30-day limit is squarely presented. In light of the conflict among the lower courts, I would grant certiorari.

 Annette Louise STEBBING v. MARYLANDNo. 84-5079 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 9, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Maryland. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 The issue presented by this petition is the constitutionality of the Maryland capital punishment statute, which (1) bars consideration of certain mitigating evidence when the sentencer decides whether to impose a life or death sentence; (2) prevents the sentencer from making an independent determination as to whether death is a proper penalty; and (3) may easily be understood to impose on the defendant the burden of proving that death is not appropriate in his case. Because these three aspects of the Maryland death penalty statute raise profound questions of compliance with this Court's holdings in Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104 (1982), and Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978), I would grant the petition to review the constitutionality of the statute. 
 I  
 In Lockett v. Ohio, Chief Justice BURGER, writing for a plurality of the Court, stated: 
Page 469 U.S. 900 , 901
 considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death."" Id., at 604, 98 S.Ct ., at 2964 (emphasis in original).
 The opinion recognized that ""the imposition of death by public authority is . . . profoundly different from all other penalties,"" and that the sentencer therefore must be free to give ""independent mitigating weight to aspects of the defendant's character and record and to circumstances of the offense proffered in mitigation."" Id., at 605, 98 S. Ct., at 2965. As we later said: ""By holding that the sentencer in capital cases must be permitted to consider any relevant mitigating factor, the rule in Lockett recognizes that a consistency produced by ignoring individual differences is a false consistency."" Eddings v. Oklahoma, supra, 455 U.S., at 112. 
 In Eddings, this Court reaffirmed that a sentencer may not be barred from considering all evidence of mitigating factors when it renders its decision on sentencing. The trial judge there had declined to consider the fact of Eddings' violent background, on which evidence had been introduced, as a mitigating circumstance. In reversing Eddings' death sentence, the Court observed, 
 ""Just as the State may not by statute preclude the sentencer from considering any mitigating factor, neither may the sentencer refuse to consider, as a matter of law, any relevant mitigating evidence. In this instance, it was as if the trial judge had instructed a jury to disregard the mitigating evidence Eddings proffered on his behalf. The sentencer, and the Court of Criminal Appeals on review, may determine the weight to be given relevant mitigating evidence. But they may not give it no weight by excluding such evidence from their consideration."" 455 U.S., at 113-115, 102 S. Ct., at 876-877 (emphasis in original). 
 It therefore is now well established that the Constitution requires that the sentencing body in a capital case not be precluded by statute from considering all relevant mitigating evidence and inferences. Put another way, a jury must be free to conclude that any relevant mitigating evidence amounts to a factor that mitigates the severity of the punishment a defendant ought to suffer. Yet the Maryland statute denies the sentencer the constitutionally required latitude. [469 U.S. 900 , 902]

 October 9, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Virginia. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 I  
 In state habeas corpus proceedings, petitioner argued that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel as evidenced by that counsel's failure to object to an instruction that was inconsistent with the decision this Court announced, one year after petitioner's trial, in Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510 (1979). Petitioner's sole defense at his capital trial for murder was lack of premeditation. The evidence at trial showed that petitioner had consumed a number of beers on the evening of the crime and that, immediately after killing the victim, he telephoned police to report that he ""had killed somebody."" Petitioner accompanied sheriff's 
Page 469 U.S. 908 , 909
 deputies to the victim's house, where he showed them the body. Petitioner was convicted of capital murder on April 7, 1978, and sentenced to death. 
 The instruction at issue, evidently taken from the Virginia form book of jury instructions, was as follows: 
 As the State now concedes, there is no doubt that this instruction violates the Constitution, for in Sandstrom we held that a virtually identical instruction violated due process and the principles against burden shifting we had set forth in Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 95 S. Ct. 1881 (1975), and Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197 (1977). Sandstrom, however, was decided by this Court on June 18, 1979, a little over a year after petitioner's trial . The question presented by this petition is thus whether the failure of petitioner's counsel, in a capital case in which premeditation was the only issue, to make the very same objection that Sandstrom's trial counsel had made several years earlier indicates that petitioner was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel. 
 This question presents the Court with an important opportunity to give content to the generalized standards for constitutionally effective counsel announced last Term in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). With respect to the prejudice prong of Strickland, the fact that the Court has already seen fit to grant a petition for certiorari on the question whether Sandstrom error can ever be harmless indicates that the prejudice issue is worthy of the Court's attention. Franklin v. Francis, 720 F.2d 1206 (CA11 1983) and 723 F.2d 770, cert. granted, 467 U.S. 1225 (1984); 1 see also Connecticut v. Johnson, 460 U.S. 73 (1983) (four-Justice plurality holding that Sandstrom error is never harmless). And with respect to the ineffectiveness component of Strickland -the requirement that counsel's performance not fall below the "" range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases,"" Strickland, supra, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-petitioner has marshaled a strong case.

 Ernest John DOBBERT, Jr. v. Louie L. WAINWRIGHT, Secretary, Florida Department of CorrectionsNo. 84-5378 Supreme Court of the United States September 7, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death presented to Justice POWELL, and by him referred to the Court, is denied. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 The State of Florida intends to electrocute the applicant Ernest John Dobbert, Jr. in several hours. Dobbert seeks a stay of his execution pending the orderly disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. He raises substantial issues concerning the constitutionality of his death sentence and the proper measure of federal deference to state-court factfinding under 28 U.S.C. 2254(d). I would grant Dobbert's application and stay his execution. 
 I  
 Dobbert was convicted in 1974 of the first-degree murder of his 9- year-old daughter Kelly. Although the jury recommended a life sentence by a vote of 10-2, the presiding judge, R. Hudson Olliff, overrode the recommendation and imposed the death sentence. 
 Dobbert's 13-year-old son, John III, testified at trial that he saw Dobbert kick Kelly in the stomach several times on the night before her death and that, on the subsequent evening, he saw Dobbert choke the girl until she stopped breathing. John III was ""the State's key witness"" at trial. Dobbert v. State, 414 So.2d 518, 519 (Fla.1982). There was abundant evidence that Dobbert had committed unspeakably brutal acts toward his children, but John III's testimony was the sole evidence that Dobbert had actually and deliberately strangled Kelly to death. ""While the evidence presented without his testimony was adequate to convict of second-degree murder, young Dobbert's testimony supplied the 
Page 468 U.S. 1231 , 1232
 sole basis for finding premeditation. There is no doubt that Dobbert inflicted injuries that caused the death of his daughter, but only through the trial testimony of young Dobbert is there evidence of his intent to cause that death."" Dobbert v. State, 456 So.2d 424, 431 (1984) (McDonald, J., dissenting in part). 
 In 1982, eight years after his father had been convicted and sentenced to death, John III recanted his trial testimony. His affidavit, set forth in full as an appendix to this opinion, is direct and to the point: ""I did not testify truthfully about the cause of my sister Kelly's death at the trial. . . . My father did not kill Kelly."" John III stated that, in fact, the ""kicking incident"" had occurred two weeks before Kelly's death. With respect to the fatal night, John III now states that he remembers Kelly ""sitting in bed eating some soup. She started vomiting, and then choking on her own vomit and food. My father tried to give her mouth to mouth resuscitation, but it didn't work. Kelly was not killed by my father; she died accidentally, choking on food or vomit."" 
 Why had John III earlier testified that Dobbert choked Kelly to death ? First, at the time of the trial ""I was still deathly afraid of my father after all I'd been through and seen, and wanted to be sure he'd be locked up where I'd be safe from him."" Second, in the time leading up to and following the trial, John III was living at a children's home in Wisconsin where he was undergoing hypnosis and kept ""heavily medicated"" on Thorazine. Finally, ""[a]lthough no one ever said it directly,"" John III "" knew"" that the staff at the children's home ""wanted me to testify that my father killed my sister.

 Dobbert has twice argued in state court that his capital conviction and sentence are unconstitutional in light of John III's perjured testimony. The first time, in connection with his request to file a petition for a writ of error coram nobis, the Supreme Court of Florida held that John III's recantation is not ""new evidence"" and therefore does not deserve judicial attention. Dobbert v. State, 414 So.2d, at 520. The court argued that, because John III had given a statement to the police after Kelly's death which contradicted the testimony he later gave at trial, defense counsel could have cross-examined the boy at trial on the inconsistencies between the earlier statement and his testimony.

 Ernest John DOBBERT, Jr. v. Louie L. WAINWRIGHT, Secretary, Florida Department of CorrectionsNo. 84-5378 Supreme Court of the United States September 7, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death presented to Justice POWELL, and by him referred to the Court, is denied. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 The State of Florida intends to electrocute the applicant Ernest John Dobbert, Jr. in several hours. Dobbert seeks a stay of his execution pending the orderly disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. He raises substantial issues concerning the constitutionality of his death sentence and the proper measure of federal deference to state-court factfinding under 28 U.S.C. 2254(d). I would grant Dobbert's application and stay his execution. 
 I  
 Dobbert was convicted in 1974 of the first-degree murder of his 9- year-old daughter Kelly. Although the jury recommended a life sentence by a vote of 10-2, the presiding judge, R. Hudson Olliff, overrode the recommendation and imposed the death sentence. 
 Dobbert's 13-year-old son, John III, testified at trial that he saw Dobbert kick Kelly in the stomach several times on the night before her death and that, on the subsequent evening, he saw Dobbert choke the girl until she stopped breathing. John III was ""the State's key witness"" at trial. Dobbert v. State, 414 So.2d 518, 519 (Fla.1982). There was abundant evidence that Dobbert had committed unspeakably brutal acts toward his children, but John III's testimony was the sole evidence that Dobbert had actually and deliberately strangled Kelly to death. ""While the evidence presented without his testimony was adequate to convict of second-degree murder, young Dobbert's testimony supplied the 
Page 468 U.S. 1231 , 1232
 sole basis for finding premeditation. There is no doubt that Dobbert inflicted injuries that caused the death of his daughter, but only through the trial testimony of young Dobbert is there evidence of his intent to cause that death."" Dobbert v. State, 456 So.2d 424, 431 (1984) (McDonald, J., dissenting in part). 
 In 1982, eight years after his father had been convicted and sentenced to death, John III recanted his trial testimony. His affidavit, set forth in full as an appendix to this opinion, is direct and to the point: ""I did not testify truthfully about the cause of my sister Kelly's death at the trial. . . . My father did not kill Kelly."" John III stated that, in fact, the ""kicking incident"" had occurred two weeks before Kelly's death. With respect to the fatal night, John III now states that he remembers Kelly ""sitting in bed eating some soup. She started vomiting, and then choking on her own vomit and food. My father tried to give her mouth to mouth resuscitation, but it didn't work. Kelly was not killed by my father; she died accidentally, choking on food or vomit."" 
 Why had John III earlier testified that Dobbert choked Kelly to death ? First, at the time of the trial ""I was still deathly afraid of my father after all I'd been through and seen, and wanted to be sure he'd be locked up where I'd be safe from him."" Second, in the time leading up to and following the trial, John III was living at a children's home in Wisconsin where he was undergoing hypnosis and kept ""heavily medicated"" on Thorazine. Finally, ""[a]lthough no one ever said it directly,"" John III "" knew"" that the staff at the children's home ""wanted me to testify that my father killed my sister. I looked up to these people and wanted desperately to please them-they were good to me and concerned about me in a way I hadn't known for years."" 
 Dobbert has twice argued in state court that his capital conviction and sentence are unconstitutional in light of John III's perjured testimony. The first time, in connection with his request to file a petition for a writ of error coram nobis, the Supreme Court of Florida held that John III's recantation is not ""new evidence"" and therefore does not deserve judicial attention.

Decided July 5, 1984
468 U.S. 796

Syllabus 
Acting on information that petitioners probably were trafficking in cocaine from their apartment, New York Drug Enforcement Task Force agents began a surveillance of petitioners.  Thereafter, upon observing petitioner Colon deliver a bulky package to one Parra at a restaurant parking lot, while petitioner Segura and one Rivudalla-Vidal visited inside the restaurant, the agents followed Parra and Rivudalla-Vidal to their apartment and stopped them.  Parra was found to possess cocaine, and she and Rivudalla-Vidal were immediately arrested.  After being advised of his constitutional rights, Rivudalla-Vidal admitted that he had purchased the cocaine from petitioner Segura and confirmed that petitioner Colon had made the delivery at the restaurant.  Task Force agents were then authorized by an Assistant United States Attorney to arrest petitioners, and were advised that a search warrant for petitioners' apartment probably could not be obtained until the following day, but that the agent should secure the premises to prevent destruction of evidence.  Later that same evening, the agents arrested petitioner Segura in the lobby of petitioners' apartment building, took him to the apartment, knocked on the door, and, when it was opened by petitioner Colon, entered the apartment without requesting or receiving permission.  The agents then conducted a limited security check of the apartment and, in the process, observed, in plain view, various drug paraphernalia.  Petitioner Colon was then arrested, and both petitioners were taken into custody.  Two agents remained in the apartment awaiting the warrant, but, because of ""administrative delay,"" the search warrant was not issued until some 19 hours after the initial entry into the apartment.  In the search pursuant to the warrant, the agents discovered, inter alia, cocaine and records of narcotics transactions.  These items were seized, together with those observed during the security check.  The District Court granted petitioners' pretrial motion to suppress all the seized evidence.  The Court of Appeals held that the evidence discovered in plain view on the initial entry, but not the evidence seized during the warrant search, must be suppressed.  Petitioners were subsequently convicted of violating federal drug laws, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The exclusionary rule reaches not only primary evidence obtained as a direct result of an illegal search or seizure, but also evidence later 
Page 468 U. S. 797
 discovered and found to be derivative of an illegality or ""fruit of the poisonous tree.""  Nardone v. United States, 308 U. S. 338,  308 U. S. 341.

2. Here, there was an independent source for the challenged evidence; the evidence was discovered during a search of petitioners' apartment pursuant to a valid warrant.  The information on which the warrant was secured came from sources wholly unconnected with the initial entry, and was known to the agents well before that entry.  Hence, whether the initial entry was illegal or not is irrelevant to the admissibility of the evidence, and exclusion of the evidence is not warranted as derivative or as ""fruit of the poisonous tree.""

No. 83-276
Argued April 23, 1984

468 U.S. 841

Syllabus 
Section 12(f) of the Military Selective Service Act denies federal financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to male students between the ages of 18 and 26 who fail to register for the draft.  Section 12(f)(2) requires applicants for Title IV assistance to file a statement with their institutions of higher education attesting to their compliance with the Act and implementing regulations.  A Presidential Proclamation requires young men to register for the draft within 30 days of their 18th birthday.  Failure to register within this time is a criminal offense.  The regulations permit late registrants to establish eligibility for Title IV assistance.  Appellee students (hereafter appellees), who have not registered for the draft, brought suits in Federal District Court seeking to enjoin the enforcement of  12(f).  The District Court granted the requested relief, holding that the regulations making late registrants eligible for Title IV aid were inconsistent with the statute, and that  12(f) is an unconstitutional bill of attainder because it singles out an identifiable group that would be ineligible for Title IV aid based on their failure to register.  Alternatively, the District Court held that  12(f) also violated appellees' Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination .
Held:
1. Section 12(f) is not a bill of attainder.  Pp.  468 U. S. 846-856.
(a) A bill of attainder is
""a law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the protections of a judicial trial.""
Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425,  433 U. S. 468. Pp. 846-847.
(b) Section 12(f) does not single out nonregistrants and make them ineligible for Title IV aid based on their past conduct, i.e., failure to register.  The section does not require registration within the time fixed by the Presidential Proclamation, and does not make late registrants ineligible for aid.  The contrary view is inconsistent with 12(f)'s structure and with the legislative history.  Section 12(f) clearly gives nonregistrants 30 days after receiving notice that they are ineligible for Title IV aid to register for the draft and qualify for aid.  The legislative history shows that Congress' purpose in enacting  12(f) was to encourage registration 
Page 468 U. S. 842
 by those who must register, but have not yet done so.  Section 12(f)'s requirements are not irreversible, but can be met readily by either timely or late registration.  Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, and Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, distinguished.  Pp.  468 U. S. 847-851.
(c) Section 12(f) does not inflict punishment within the meaning of the Bill of Attainder Clause.  It imposes none of the burdens historically associated with punishment.  It does not even deprive appellees of Title IV benefits permanently, since it leaves open perpetually the possibility of qualifying for aid.  Pp.  468 U. S. 852-853.
(d) The legislative history shows that  12(f) was intended to further nonpunitive legislative goals.  Conditioning receipt of Title IV aid on draft registration is plainly a rational means to improve compliance with the registration requirements.  Section 12(f) also promotes a fair allocation of scarce federal resources by limiting Title IV aid to those who are willing to meet their responsibilities to the United States by registering for the draft when required to do so.  Pp.  468 U. S. 853-856.
2. Section 12(f) does not violate appellees' Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination.  Since a student who has not registered for the draft is bound to know that he would be denied Title IV aid, he is no sense under any ""compulsion"" to seek that aid, and has no reason to make any statement to anyone as to whether or not he has registered.  As to a late registrant, since the law does not require him to disclose to his educational institution whether or not he registered late, he is not required to disclose any incriminating information in order to become eligible for aid.  The fact that appellees must register late in order to get Title IV aid, and thus reveal to the Selective Service their failure to comply timely with the registration requirements, does not violate appellees' Fifth Amendment rights.  They have not been denied the opportunity to register, and have not been disqualified for financial aid for asserting a constitutional privilege.  Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, distinguished.  Appellees, not having sought to register, have had no occasion to assert their Fifth Amendment privilege when asked to state their dates of birth, nor has the Government refused any request for immunity for their answers or otherwise threatened them with penalties for invoking the privilege.  Under these circumstances, appellees will not be heard to complain that  12(f) violates their Fifth Amendment rights by forcing them to acknowledge during the draft registration process they have avoided that they have registered late.  Pp.  468 U. S. 856-858.
557 F.Supp. 937, reversed.
BURGER, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which WHITE, REHNQUIST, STEVENS, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined, and in Parts I, II-B, III, and IV of which POWELL, J., joined.  POWELL, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, post, p.  468 U. S. 859.  BRENNAN,

The section does not require registration within the time fixed by the Presidential Proclamation, and does not make late registrants ineligible for aid.  The contrary view is inconsistent with 12(f)'s structure and with the legislative history.  Section 12(f) clearly gives nonregistrants 30 days after receiving notice that they are ineligible for Title IV aid to register for the draft and qualify for aid.  The legislative history shows that Congress' purpose in enacting  12(f) was to encourage registration 
Page 468 U. S. 842
 by those who must register, but have not yet done so.  Section 12(f)'s requirements are not irreversible, but can be met readily by either timely or late registration.  Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, and Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, distinguished.  Pp.  468 U. S. 847-851.
(c) Section 12(f) does not inflict punishment within the meaning of the Bill of Attainder Clause.  It imposes none of the burdens historically associated with punishment.  It does not even deprive appellees of Title IV benefits permanently, since it leaves open perpetually the possibility of qualifying for aid.  Pp.  468 U. S. 852-853.
(d) The legislative history shows that  12(f) was intended to further nonpunitive legislative goals.  Conditioning receipt of Title IV aid on draft registration is plainly a rational means to improve compliance with the registration requirements.  Section 12(f) also promotes a fair allocation of scarce federal resources by limiting Title IV aid to those who are willing to meet their responsibilities to the United States by registering for the draft when required to do so.  Pp.  468 U. S. 853-856.
2. Section 12(f) does not violate appellees' Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination.  Since a student who has not registered for the draft is bound to know that he would be denied Title IV aid, he is no sense under any ""compulsion"" to seek that aid, and has no reason to make any statement to anyone as to whether or not he has registered.  As to a late registrant, since the law does not require him to disclose to his educational institution whether or not he registered late, he is not required to disclose any incriminating information in order to become eligible for aid.  The fact that appellees must register late in order to get Title IV aid, and thus reveal to the Selective Service their failure to comply timely with the registration requirements, does not violate appellees' Fifth Amendment rights.  They have not been denied the opportunity to register, and have not been disqualified for financial aid for asserting a constitutional privilege.  Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, distinguished.  Appellees, not having sought to register, have had no occasion to assert their Fifth Amendment privilege when asked to state their dates of birth, nor has the Government refused any request for immunity for their answers or otherwise threatened them with penalties for invoking the privilege.  Under these circumstances, appellees will not be heard to complain that  12(f) violates their Fifth Amendment rights by forcing them to acknowledge during the draft registration process they have avoided that they have registered late.  Pp.  468 U. S. 856-858.

Syllabus 
Respondents' 8-year-old daughter was born with a defect known as spina bifida.  As a result, she suffers from orthopedic and speech impairments and a neurogenic bladder, which prevents her from emptying her bladder voluntarily.  Consequently, she must be catheterized every three or four hours to avoid injury to her kidneys.  To accomplish this, a process known as clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) was prescribed.  This is a simple procedure that can be performed in a few minutes by a layperson with less than an hour's training.  Since petitioner School District received federal funding under the Education of the Handicapped Act it was required to provide the child with ""a free appropriate public education,"" which is defined in the Act to include ""related services,"" which are defined in turn to include
""supportive services (including . . . medical . . . services, except that such medical services shall be for diagnostic and evaluation purposes only) as may be required to assist a handicapped child to benefit from special education.""
Pursuant to the Act, petitioner developed an individualized education program for the child, but the program made no provision for school personnel to administer CIC.  After unsuccessfully pursuing administrative remedies to secure CIC services for the child during school hours, respondents brought an action against petitioner and others in Federal District Court, seeking injunctive relief, damages, and attorney's fees.  Respondents invoked the Education of the Handicapped Act, arguing that CIC is one of the included ""related services"" under the statutory definition, and also invoked  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which forbids a person, by reason of a handicap, to be ""excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under"" any program receiving federal aid.  After its initial denial of relief was reversed by the Court of Appeals, the District Court, on remand, held that CIC was a ""related service"" under the Education of the Handicapped Act, ordered that the child's education program be modified to include provision of CIC during school hours, and awarded compensatory damages against petitioner.  The court further held that respondents had proved a violation of  504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 
Page 468 U. S. 884
 and awarded attorney's fees to respondents under  505 of that Act.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. CIC is a ""related service"" under the Education of the Handicapped Act.  Pp.  468 U. S. 888-895.
(a) CIC services qualify as a ""supportive servic[e] . . . required to assist a handicapped child to benefit from special education"" within the meaning of the Act.  Without CIC services available during the school day, respondents' child cannot attend school and thereby ""benefit from special education.""  Such services are no less related to the effort to educate than are services that enable a child to reach, enter, or exit a school.  Pp.  468 U. S. 890-891.
(b) The provision of CIC is not subject to exclusion as a ""medical service.""  The Department of Education regulations, which are entitled to deference, define ""related services"" for handicapped children to include ""school health services,"" which are defined in turn as ""services provided by a qualified school nurse or other qualified person,"" and define ""medical services"" as ""services provided by a licensed physician.""  This definition of ""medical services"" is a reasonable interpretation of congressional intent to exclude physician's services as such and to impose an obligation to provide school nursing services.  Pp.  468 U. S. 891-895.
2. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act is inapplicable when relief is available under the Education of the Handicapped Act to remedy a denial of educational services, Smith v. Robinson, post, p.  468 U. S. 992, and therefore respondents are not entitled to any relief under  504, including recovery of attorney's fees.  Pp.  468 U. S. 895-896.

No. 82-1771
Argued January 17, 1984
Decided July 5, 1984
468 U.S. 897

Syllabus 
Acting on the basis of information from a confidential informant, officers of the Burbank, Cal., Police Department initiated a drug-trafficking investigation involving surveillance of respondents' activities.  Based on an affidavit summarizing the police officers' observations, Officer Rombach prepared an application for a warrant to search three residences and respondents' automobiles for an extensive list of items.  The application w as reviewed by several Deputy District Attorneys, and a facially valid search warrant was issued by a state court judge.  Ensuing searches produced large quantities of drugs and other evidence.  Respondents were indicted for federal drug offenses, and filed motions to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant.  After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court granted the motions in part, concluding that the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause.  Although recognizing that Officer Rombach had acted in good faith, the court rejected the Government's suggestion that the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule should not apply where evidence is seized in reasonable, good faith reliance on a search warrant.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, also refusing the Government's invitation to recognize a good faith exception to the rule.  The Government's petition for certiorari presented only the question whether a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule should be recognized.
Held:
1. The Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule should not be applied so as to bar the use in the prosecution's case in chief of evidence obtained by officers acting in reasonable reliance on a search warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate but ultimately found to be invalid.  Pp.  468 U. S. 905-925.
(a) An examination of the Fourth Amendment's origin and purposes makes clear that the use of fruits of a past unlawful search or seizure works no new Fourth Amendment wrong.  The question whether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case as a judicially created remedy to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights through its deterrent effect, must be resolved by weighing the costs and benefits of preventing the use in the prosecution's case in chief of inherently trustworthy tangible evidence.  Indiscriminate application of the 
Page 468 U. S. 898
 exclusionary rule -- impeding the criminal justice system's truthfinding function and allowing some guilty defendants to go free -- may well generate disrespect for the law and the administration of justice.  Pp.  468 U. S. 906-908.
(b) Application of the exclusionary rule should continue where a Fourth Amendment violation has been substantial and deliberate, but the balancing approach that has evolved in determining whether the rule should be applied in a variety of contexts -- including criminal trials -- suggests that the rule should be modified to permit the introduction of evidence obtained by officers reasonably relying on a warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate.  Pp.  468 U. S. 908-913.
(c) The deference accorded to a magistrate's finding of probable cause for the issuance of a warrant does not preclude inquiry into the knowing or reckless falsity of the affidavit on which that determination was based, and the courts must also insist that the magistrate purport to perform his neutral and detached function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police.  Moreover, reviewing courts will not defer to a warrant based on an affidavit that does not provide the magistrate with a substantial basis for determining the existence of probable cause.  However, the exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct, rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates.  Admitting evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant while at the same time declaring that the warrant was somehow defective will not reduce judicial officers' professional incentives to comply with the Fourth Amendment, encourage them to repeat their mistakes, or lead to the granting of all colorable warrant requests.  Pp.  468 U. S. 913-917.
(d) Even assuming that the exclusionary rule effectively deters some police misconduct and provides incentives for the law enforcement profession as a whole to conduct itself in accord with the Fourth Amendment, it cannot be expected, and should not be applied, to deter objectively reasonable law enforcement activity.  In the ordinary case, an officer cannot be expected to question the magistrate's probable cause determination or his judgment that the form of the warrant is technically sufficient . Once the warrant issues, there is literally nothing more the policeman can do in seeking to comply with the law, and penalizing the officer for the magistrate's error, rather than his own, cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations.  Pp.  468 U. S. 918-921.
(e) A police officer's reliance on the magistrate's probable cause determination and on the technical sufficiency of the warrant he issues must be objectively reasonable.  Suppression remains an appropriate remedy if the magistrate or judge in issuing a warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false or would have known was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth, or if the 
Page 468 U. S. 899
 issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his detached and neutral judicial role.  Nor would an officer manifest objective good faith in relying on a warrant based on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.  Finally, depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a warrant may be so facially deficient -- i.e., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized -- that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.  Pp.  468 U. S. 922-925.
2. In view of the modification of the exclusionary rule, the Court of Appeals' judgment cannot stand in this case.  Only respondent Leon contended that no reasonably well trained police officer could have believed that there existed probable cause to search his house.  However, the record establishes that the police officers' reliance on the state court judge's determination of probable cause was objectively reasonable.  Pp. 925-926.

No. 82-963
Argued January 17, 1984
Decided July 5, 1984
468 U.S. 981

Syllabus 
On the basis of evidence gathered in the investigation of a homicide in the Roxbury section of Boston, a police detective drafted an affidavit to support an application for an arrest warrant and a search warrant authorizing the search of respondent's residence.  The affidavit stated that the police wished to search for certain described items, including clothing of the victim and a blunt instrument that might have been used on the victim.  The affidavit was reviewed and approved by the District Attorney.  Because it was Sunday, the local court was closed, and the police had a difficult time finding a warrant application form.  The detective finally found a warrant form previously used in another district to search for controlled substances.  After making some changes in the form, the detective presented it and the affidavit to a judge at his residence, informing him that the warrant form might need to be further changed.  Concluding that the affidavit established probable cause to search respondent's residence and telling the detective that the necessary changes in the warrant form would be made, the judge made some changes, but did not change the substantive portion, which continued to authorize a search for controlled substances, nor did he alter the form so as to incorporate the affidavit.  The judge then signed the warrant and returned it and the affidavit to the detective, informing him that the warrant was sufficient authority in form and content to carry out the requested search.  The ensuing search of respondent's residence by the detective and other police officers was limited to the items listed in the affidavit, and several incriminating pieces of evidence were discovered.  Thereafter, respondent was charged with first-degree murder.  At a pretrial suppression hearing, the trial judge ruled that notwithstanding the warrant was defective under the Fourth Amendment in that it did not particularly describe the items to be seized, the incriminating evidence could be admitted because the police had acted in good faith in executing what they reasonably thought was a valid warrant.  At the subsequent trial, respondent was convicted.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that the evidence should have been suppressed.
Held:  Federal law does not require the exclusion of the disputed evidence.  Pp.  468 U. S. 987-991.
(a) The exclusionary rule should not be applied when the officer conducting the search acted in objectively reasonable reliance on a warrant 
Page 468 U. S. 982
 issued by a detached and neutral magistrate that subsequently is determined to be invalid.  United States v. Leon, ante p.  468 U. S. 897.  Pp.  468 U. S. 987-988.
(b) Here, there was an objectively reasonable basis for the officers' mistaken belief that the warrant authorized the search they conducted.  The officers took every step that could reasonably be expected of them.  At the point where the judge returned the affidavit and warrant to the detective, a reasonable police officer would have concluded, as the detective did, that the warrant authorized a search for the materials outlined in the affidavit.  Pp.  468 U. S. 988-989.
(c) A police officer is not required to disbelieve a judge who has just advised him that the warrant he possesses authorizes him to conduct the search he has requested. Pp. 989-990.
(d) An error of constitutional dimensions may have been committed with respect to the issuance of the warrant in this case, but it was the judge, not the police officer, who made the critical mistake.  Suppressing evidence because the judge failed to make all the necessary clerical corrections despite his assurance that such changes would be made will not serve the deterrent function that the exclusionary rule was designed to achieve.

The detective finally found a warrant form previously used in another district to search for controlled substances.  After making some changes in the form, the detective presented it and the affidavit to a judge at his residence, informing him that the warrant form might need to be further changed.  Concluding that the affidavit established probable cause to search respondent's residence and telling the detective that the necessary changes in the warrant form would be made, the judge made some changes, but did not change the substantive portion, which continued to authorize a search for controlled substances, nor did he alter the form so as to incorporate the affidavit.  The judge then signed the warrant and returned it and the affidavit to the detective, informing him that the warrant was sufficient authority in form and content to carry out the requested search.  The ensuing search of respondent's residence by the detective and other police officers was limited to the items listed in the affidavit, and several incriminating pieces of evidence were discovered.  Thereafter, respondent was charged with first-degree murder.  At a pretrial suppression hearing, the trial judge ruled that notwithstanding the warrant was defective under the Fourth Amendment in that it did not particularly describe the items to be seized, the incriminating evidence could be admitted because the police had acted in good faith in executing what they reasonably thought was a valid warrant.  At the subsequent trial, respondent was convicted.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that the evidence should have been suppressed.
Held:  Federal law does not require the exclusion of the disputed evidence.  Pp.  468 U. S. 987-991.
(a) The exclusionary rule should not be applied when the officer conducting the search acted in objectively reasonable reliance on a warrant 
Page 468 U. S. 982
 issued by a detached and neutral magistrate that subsequently is determined to be invalid.  United States v. Leon, ante p.  468 U. S. 897.  Pp.  468 U. S. 987-988.
(b) Here, there was an objectively reasonable basis for the officers' mistaken belief that the warrant authorized the search they conducted.  The officers took every step that could reasonably be expected of them.  At the point where the judge returned the affidavit and warrant to the detective, a reasonable police officer would have concluded, as the detective did, that the warrant authorized a search for the materials outlined in the affidavit.  Pp.  468 U. S. 988-989.
(c) A police officer is not required to disbelieve a judge who has just advised him that the warrant he possesses authorizes him to conduct the search he has requested. Pp. 989-990.
(d) An error of constitutional dimensions may have been committed with respect to the issuance of the warrant in this case, but it was the judge, not the police officer, who made the critical mistake.  Suppressing evidence because the judge failed to make all the necessary clerical corrections despite his assurance that such changes would be made will not serve the deterrent function that the exclusionary rule was designed to achieve.  Pp.  468 U. S. 990-991.

Syllabus 
When the Superintendent of Schools in Cumberland, R.I., informed petitioner parents of petitioner child, who suffers from cerebral palsy and other handicaps, that the School Committee no longer would fund the child's placement in a special educational program, the parents, in addition to appealing the Superintendent's decision to the School Committee and thereafter through the state administrative process, filed an action in Federal District Court against the School Committee and, subsequently, against certain state school officials.  They asserted, at various points in the proceedings, claims for declaratory and injunctive relief based on state law, on the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA), on  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and, with respect to certain federal constitutional claims, on 42 U.S.C.  1983.  The District Court held that the child was entitled, as a matter of state law, to a free appropriate special education paid for by the School Committee, and that it was therefore unnecessary and improper to reach petitioners' federal statutory and constitutional claims.  By agreement between the parties, the court awarded attorney's fees against the School Committee.  Petitioners then requested attorney's fees against the state defendants.  The District Court held that petitioners were entitled to such fees for the hours spent in the state administrative process both before and after the date the state defendants were named as parties, reasoning that, because petitioners were required to exhaust their EHA remedies before asserting their  1983 and  504 claims, they were entitled to fees for those procedures.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, since the action and relief granted fell within the reach of the EHA, which establishes a comprehensive federal-state scheme for the provision of special education to handicapped children but does not provide for attorney's fees, the District Court had to look to 42 U.S.C.  1988 and  505 of the Rehabilitation Act for such fees.  The Court of Appeals concluded that, even if the unaddressed  1983 claims were substantial enough to support federal jurisdiction so as generally to warrant an award of attorney's fees, nevertheless, given the comprehensiveness of the EHA, Congress could not have intended its omission of attorney's fees relief in that statute to 
Page 468 U. S. 993
 be rectified by recourse to  1988.  The court disposed of the Rehabilitation Act basis for attorney's fees for similar reasons.
Held:
1. Petitioners were not entitled to attorney's fees under  1988.  Pp.  468 U. S. 1006-1016.
(a) The fact that petitioners prevailed on their initial claim that the School Committee violated due process by refusing to grant petitioners a full hearing before terminating funding of petitioner child's special education program does not, by itself, entitle petitioners to attorney's fees for the subsequent administrative and judicial proceedings.  That due process claim was entirely separate from the claims made in the subsequent proceedings, and was not sufficiently related to petitioners' ultimate success to support an award of fees for the entire proceeding.  Pp.  468 U. S. 1008-1009.
(b) As to petitioners' claim that the child was being discriminated against on the basis of his handicapped condition, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is apparent that Congress intended the EHA to be the exclusive avenue through which such a claim can be pursued.  The EHA is a comprehensive scheme to aid the States in complying with their constitutional obligations to provide public education for the handicapped.  Allowing a plaintiff to circumvent the EHA's administrative remedies by relying on  1983 as a remedy for a substantial equal protection claim would be inconsistent with that scheme.  Pp.  468 U. S. 1009-1013.
(c) Even if petitioners' due process challenge to the partiality of the state hearing officer who reviewed the School Committee's decision might be maintained as an independent challenge, petitioners are not entitled to attorney's fees for such claim.  That claim had no bearing on the substantive claim, on which petitioners prevailed, that the School Committee, as a matter of state and federal law, was required to pay for petitioner child's education.  Where petitioners presented different claims for different relief, based on different facts and legal theories, and prevailed only on a nonfee claim, they are not entitled to a fee award simply because the other claim was a constitutional claim that could be asserted through  1983.  Pp.  468 U. S. 1013-1016.
2. Nor were petitioners entitled to attorney's fees under  505 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Congress struck a careful balance in the EHA between clarifying and making enforceable the rights of handicapped children to a free appropriate public education and endeavoring to relieve the financial burden imposed on the agencies responsible to guarantee those rights.  It could not have intended a handicapped child to upset that balance by relying on  504 for otherwise unavailable damages or for 
Page 468 U. S. 994
 an award of attorney's fees.  Where, as here, whatever remedy might be provided under  504 -- which prevents discrimination on the basis of a handicap in any program receiving federal financial assistance -- is provided with more clarity and precision under the EHA, a plaintiff may not circumvent or enlarge on the remedies available under the EHA by resort to  504.  Pp.  468 U. S. 1016-1021.

Syllabus 
Respondent Mexican citizens were ordered deported by an Immigration Judge. Respondent Lopez-Mendoza unsuccessfully objected to being summoned to the deportation hearing following his allegedly unlawful arrest by an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) agent, but he did not object to the receipt in evidence of his admission, after the arrest, of illegal entry into this country.  Respondent Sandoval-Sanchez, who also admitted his illegal entry after being arrested by an INS agent, unsuccessfully objected to the evidence of his admission offered at the deportation proceeding, contending that it should have been suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful arrest.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the deportation orders.  The Court of Appeals reversed respondent Sandoval-Sanchez' deportation order, holding that his detention by INS agents violated the Fourth Amendment, that his admission of illegal entry was the product of this detention, and that the exclusionary rule barred its use in a deportation proceeding.  The court vacated respondent Lopez-Mendoza's deportation order and remanded his case to the BIA to determine whether the Fourth Amendment had been violated in the course of his arrest.
Held:
1. A deportation proceeding is a purely civil action to determine a person's eligibility to remain in this country.  The purpose of deportation is not to punish past transgressions, but rather to put an end to a continuing violation of the immigration laws.  Consistent with the civil nature of a deportation proceeding, various protections that apply in the context of a criminal trial do not apply in a deportation hearing.  Pp.  468 U. S. 1038-1039.
2. The ""body"" or identity of a defendant in a criminal or civil proceeding is never itself suppressible as the fruit of an unlawful arrest, even if it is conceded that an unlawful arrest, search, or interrogation occurred.  On this basis alone, the Court of Appeals' decision as to respondent Lopez-Mendoza must be reversed, since he objected only to being summoned to his deportation hearing after an allegedly unlawful arrest, and did not object to the evidence offered against him.  The mere fact of an illegal arrest has no bearing on a subsequent deportation hearing.  Pp.  468 U. S. 1039-1040. 
Page 468 U. S. 1033

3. The exclusionary rule does not apply in a deportation proceeding; hence, the rule does not apply so as to require that respondent Sandoval-Sanchez' admission of illegal entry after his allegedly unlawful arrest be excluded from evidence at his deportation hearing.  Under the balancing test applied in United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433, whereby the likely social benefits of excluding unlawfully obtained evidence are weighed against the likely costs, the balance comes out against applying the exclusionary rule in civil deportation proceedings.  Several factors significantly reduce the likely deterrent value of the rule in such proceedings.  First, regardless of how the arrest of an illegal alien is effected, deportation will still be possible when evidence not derived directly from the arrest is sufficient to support deportation.  Second, based on statistics indicating that over 97.7 percent of illegal aliens agree to voluntary deportation without a formal hearing, every INS agent knows that it is unlikely that any particular arrestee will end up challenging the lawfulness of his arrest in a formal deportation hearing.  Third, the INS has its own comprehensive scheme for deterring Fourth Amendment violations by its agents.  And finally, the deterrent value of the exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings is undermined by the availability of alternative remedies for INS practices that might violate Fourth Amendment rights.  As to the social costs of applying the exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings, they would be high.  In particular, the application of the rule in cases such as respondent Sandoval-Sanchez' would compel the courts to release from custody persons who would then immediately resume their commission of a crime through their continuing, unlawful presence in this country, and would unduly complicate the INS's deliberately simple deportation hearing system.

 BOSTON POLICE PATROLMEN'S ASSOCIATION INC., petitioner,v. Pedro CASTRO et al.No. 83-866.No. 83-885. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 5, 1984. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are granted. The judgment is vacated, and the cases are remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit for further consideration in light of Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561 (1984). 
 Opinion on remand, 749 F.2d 102. 
 Justice MARSHALL took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice STEVENS join, dissenting. 
 The Court today logically applies yesterday's illogic. I cannot disagree with the Court's conclusion that the mootness issue in these cases is similar to some portions of the mootness issue in Firefighters v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561 (1984). I therefore do not dispute that there is reason to think that the decision in Stotts bears on the Court of Appeals' conclusion that these cases are moot. In my view, however, the portions of Stotts relevant to the mootness issue in this case are demonstrably wrong; they depart sharply from our precedents and ignore the jurisdictional limits imposed by the ""case or controversy"" requirements of Article 
Page 468 U.S. 1206 , 1207
 III of the Constitution. The sooner they are forgotten, the earlier that the longstanding principles governing mootness doctrine can be resurrected. The Court of Appeals disposed of these cases in accordance with those principles, and I would let its ruling stand. 
 I 
 The controversy in these cases has remarkable similarity to the controversy in Stotts. It began when the city of Boston announced a plan to conduct a reduction in force as a response to its fiscal difficulties. The proposed reductions included layoffs in the Police and Fire Departments, both of which were operating under consent decrees to remedy past discrimination. Those decrees required the Departments to engage in preferential hiring of members of minority groups in order to raise the representation of minorities in the Departments to the level in the surrounding work force. The proposed layoffs were to be conducted on a "" last-hired, first-fired"" basis, and would have affected many minority persons hired under the consent decree. 
 Minority officers brought suit in federal court to enjoin the layoffs, and the court concluded that seniority-based layoffs would impede its efforts to remedy the past discrimination. Accordingly, the District Court enjoined the Police and Fire Departments from conducting layoffs in a manner that would reduce the percentage of minorities employed in those Departments. Castro v.

 BOSTON POLICE PATROLMEN'S ASSOCIATION INC., petitioner,v. Pedro CASTRO et al.No. 83-866.No. 83-885. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 5, 1984. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are granted. The judgment is vacated, and the cases are remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit for further consideration in light of Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561 (1984). 
 Opinion on remand, 749 F.2d 102. 
 Justice MARSHALL took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice STEVENS join, dissenting. 
 The Court today logically applies yesterday's illogic. I cannot disagree with the Court's conclusion that the mootness issue in these cases is similar to some portions of the mootness issue in Firefighters v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561 (1984). I therefore do not dispute that there is reason to think that the decision in Stotts bears on the Court of Appeals' conclusion that these cases are moot. In my view, however, the portions of Stotts relevant to the mootness issue in this case are demonstrably wrong; they depart sharply from our precedents and ignore the jurisdictional limits imposed by the ""case or controversy"" requirements of Article 
Page 468 U.S. 1206 , 1207
 III of the Constitution. The sooner they are forgotten, the earlier that the longstanding principles governing mootness doctrine can be resurrected. The Court of Appeals disposed of these cases in accordance with those principles, and I would let its ruling stand. 
 I 
 The controversy in these cases has remarkable similarity to the controversy in Stotts. It began when the city of Boston announced a plan to conduct a reduction in force as a response to its fiscal difficulties. The proposed reductions included layoffs in the Police and Fire Departments, both of which were operating under consent decrees to remedy past discrimination. Those decrees required the Departments to engage in preferential hiring of members of minority groups in order to raise the representation of minorities in the Departments to the level in the surrounding work force. The proposed layoffs were to be conducted on a "" last-hired, first-fired"" basis, and would have affected many minority persons hired under the consent decree. 
 Minority officers brought suit in federal court to enjoin the layoffs, and the court concluded that seniority-based layoffs would impede its efforts to remedy the past discrimination. Accordingly, the District Court enjoined the Police and Fire Departments from conducting layoffs in a manner that would reduce the percentage of minorities employed in those Departments. Castro v.

 NEW JERSEY, petitioner,v. T.L.O.No. 83-712. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 5, 1984. 
 This case is restored to the calendar for reargument. In addition to the question presented by the petition for writ of certiorari and previously briefed and argued, the parties are requested to brief and argue the following question: 
 Did the assistant principal violate the Fourth Amendment in opening respondent's purse in the facts and circumstances of this case? 
 Justice BLACKMUN dissents. 

 Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 In its decision in this case, the New Jersey Supreme Court addressed three distinct questions: (1) what is the proper standard for judging the reasonableness of a school official's search of a student's purse; (2) on the facts of this case, did the school official violate that standard; and ( 3) whether the exclusionary rule bars the use in a criminal proceeding of evidence that a school official obtained in violation of that standard. The Supreme Court held (1) that the correct standard is one of reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause; (2) that the standard was violated in this case; and (3) that the evidence obtained as the result of a violation may not be introduced in evidence against TLO in any criminal proceeding, including this delinquency proceeding. 
Page 468 U.S. 1214 , 1215
 New Jersey's petition for certiorari sought review of only the third question. [Footnote 1] The reasons why it did not seek review of either of the other two questions are tolerably clear. There is substantial agreement among appellate courts that the New Jersey Supreme Court applied the correct standard, and it is apparently one that the New Jersey law enforcement authorities favor. As far as the specific facts of the case are concerned, presumably New Jersey believed that this Court is too busy to take a case just for the purpose of reviewing the State Supreme Court's application of this standard to the specific facts of this case. 
 The single question presented to the Court has now been briefed and argued. Evidently unable or unwilling to decide the question presented by the parties, the Court, instead of dismissing the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted, orders reargument directed to the questions that New Jersey decided not to bring here. This is done even though New Jersey agrees with its Supreme Court's resolution of these questions, and has no desire to seek reversal on those grounds. [Footnote 2] Thus, in this nonadversarial context, the Court has decided to plunge into the merits of the Fourth Amendment issues despite the fact that no litigant before it wants the Court's guidance on these questions. Volunteering unwanted advice is rarely a wise course of action. 
 Of late, the Court has acquired a voracious appetite for judicial activism in its Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, at least when it comes to restricting the constitutional rights of the citizen. In United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 905, 3412, and Massachusetts v.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 5, 1984. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice O'CONNOR joins, dissenting. 
 Respondent Hamilton was tried for the crimes of rape and incest, in which he was charged with having had sexual intercourse with his 10-year- old daughter. He was found guilty on both 
Page 468 U.S. 1217 , 1218
 counts and was sentenced to life imprisonment on the rape charge and 10 years on the incest charge, the sentences to be served concurrently. The Supreme Court of Kentucky affirmed his conviction for rape and his sentence of life imprisonment, but reversed his conviction for incest. 659 S.W.2d 201 (1983). That court was of the view that sentencing respondent for two different crimes based on the single act of intercourse with his daughter violated the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy. 
 The Supreme Court of Kentucky believed that the closest analogy to the present case was our decision in Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U.S. 682 (1977), in which we held that petitioner Harris, who had earlier been tried and convicted of the felony murder of a grocery clerk, could not be later tried for the armed robbery of the store which was the predicate offense for the felony-murder prosecution. In the present case, however, it is undisputed that the State defines rape as sexual intercourse with one who is less than 12 years old, Ky.Rev.Stat. 510.040(1)(b)(2) (1975), and defines incest as sexual intercourse with a member of one's family, Ky.Rev.Stat. 530.020 (1975). Thus while both offenses require the element of sexual intercourse, each requires an additional element which the other does not. Although the Kentucky Supreme Court purported to rely on our decision in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), its ruling is directly contrary to this language from Blockburger.

No. 82-1630
Argued December 7, 1983
Decided July 3, 1984*
468 U.S. 517

Syllabus 
Respondent, an inmate at a Virginia penal institution, filed an action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioner, an officer at the institution, alleging that petitioner had conducted an unreasonable ""shakedown"" search of respondent's prison locker and cell and had brought a false charge, under prison disciplinary procedures, of destroying state property against respondent solely to harass him; and that, in violation of respondent's Fourteenth Amendment right not to be deprived of property without due process of law, petitioner had intentionally destroyed certain of respondent's noncontraband personal property during the search.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner, and the Court of Appeals affirmed with regard to the District Court's holding that respondent was not deprived of his property without due process.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the decision in Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U. S. 527 -- holding that a negligent deprivation of a prison inmate's property by state officials does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if an adequate postdeprivation state remedy exists -- should extend also to intentional deprivations of property.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with regard to respondent's claim that the ""shakedown"" search was unreasonable.  The court held that a prisoner has a ""limited privacy right"" in his cell entitling him to protection against searches conducted solely to harass or to humiliate, and that a remand was necessary to determine the purpose of the search here.
Held:
1. A prisoner has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his prison cell entitling him to the protection of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches.  While prisoners enjoy many protections of the Constitution that are not fundamentally inconsistent with imprisonment itself or incompatible with the objectives of incarceration, imprisonment carries with it the circumscription or loss of many rights as being necessary to accommodate the institutional needs and objectives of prison facilities, particularly internal security and safety.  It would be impossible 
Page 468 U. S. 518
 to accomplish the prison objectives of preventing the introduction of weapons, drugs, and other contraband into the premises if inmates retained a right of privacy in their cells.  The unpredictability that attends random searches of cells renders such searches perhaps the most effective weapon of the prison administrator in the fight against the proliferation of weapons, drugs, and other contraband.  A requirement that random searches be conducted pursuant to an established plan would seriously undermine the effectiveness of this weapon.  Pp.  468 U. S. 522-530.
2. There is no merit to respondent's contention that the destruction of his personal property constituted an unreasonable seizure of that property violative of the Fourth Amendment.  Assuming that the Fourth Amendment protects against the destruction of property, in addition to its mere seizure, the same reasons that lead to the conclusion that the Amendment's proscription against unreasonable searches is inapplicable in a prison cell apply with controlling force to seizures.  Prison officials must be free to seize from cells any articles which, in their view, disserve legitimate institutional interests.  P.  468 U. S. 528, n. 8.
3. Even if petitioner intentionally destroyed respondent's personal property during the challenged ""shakedown"" search, the destruction did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since respondent had adequate postdeprivation remedies under Virginia law for any loss suffered.  The decision in Parratt v. Taylor, supra, as to negligent deprivation by a state employee of a prisoner's property -- as well as its rationale that, when deprivations of property are effected through random and unauthorized conduct of a state employee, predeprivation procedures are ""impracticable,"" since the state cannot know when such deprivations will occur -- also applies to intentional deprivations of property.  Both the District Court and, at least implicitly, the Court of Appeals held that several common law remedies were available to respondent under Virginia law, and would provide adequate compensation for his property loss, and there is no reason to question that determination.  The fact that respondent might not be able to recover under state law remedies the full amount which he might receive in a  1983 action is not determinative of the adequacy of the state remedies.  As to respondent's contention that relief under state law was uncertain because a state employee might be entitled to sovereign immunity, the courts below held that respondent's claim would not be barred by sovereign immunity, since, under Virginia law, a state employee may be held liable for his intentional torts.  Pp.  468 U. S. 530-536.

No. 83-173
Argued March 20, 1984
Decided July 3, 1984
468 U.S. 559

Syllabus 
Prior to trial on a federal indictment charging petitioner with mail fraud, he was indicted, tried, and convicted of the unrelated federal offense of knowingly and willfully making false statements in a passport application.  At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge stated that, pursuant to his usual practice, he would not consider the pending mail fraud charge in passing sentence but would consider only prior convictions.  Petitioner was then sentenced to two years' imprisonment, all but six months of which was suspended in favor of three years of probation.  Thereafter, the mail fraud indictment was dismissed, and an information charging petitioner with possession of counterfeit certificates of deposit was substituted.  Petitioner pleaded nolo contendere to that charge before a different District Court Judge, and was sentenced to two years' probation.  Subsequently, the Court of Appeals reversed petitioner's conviction for the passport offense, and petitioner was retried on the charge before the same trial judge and was again convicted.  In imposing a sentence of two years' imprisonment, none of which was suspended, the trial judge explained that he imposed the greater sentence because of petitioner's intervening conviction for possession of counterfeit certificates of deposit.  The judge rejected petitioner's argument that, because the conduct underlying the conviction for possession of counterfeit certificates of deposit occurred prior to petitioner's original sentencing on the passport conviction, he could not, under North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, receive a sentence greater than that received for the original conviction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  After retrial and conviction following a defendant's successful appeal, a sentencing authority may justify an increased sentence by affirmatively identifying relevant conduct or events that occurred subsequent to the original sentencing proceedings.  Pp.  468 U. S. 563-565,  468 U. S. 569-571,  468 U. S. 571-572.
(a) In Pearce, supra, the Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevented increased sentences motivated by vindictive retaliation by the judge after reconviction following a successful appeal, and that, whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear.  Thus, Pearce establishes a rebuttable

 presumption of vindictiveness, not an absolute prohibition against enhancement of sentence.  Pp.  468 U. S. 563-565.
(b) Here, the fact that petitioner in effect received a greater sentence of confinement following retrial than he had originally received was sufficient to engage the presumption of Pearce.  However, the trial judge carefully explained his reasons for imposing the greater sentence, and his consideration of the intervening conviction was manifestly legitimate, amply rebutting any presumption of vindictiveness.

No. 83-173
Argued March 20, 1984
Decided July 3, 1984
468 U.S. 559

Syllabus 
Prior to trial on a federal indictment charging petitioner with mail fraud, he was indicted, tried, and convicted of the unrelated federal offense of knowingly and willfully making false statements in a passport application.  At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge stated that, pursuant to his usual practice, he would not consider the pending mail fraud charge in passing sentence but would consider only prior convictions.  Petitioner was then sentenced to two years' imprisonment, all but six months of which was suspended in favor of three years of probation.  Thereafter, the mail fraud indictment was dismissed, and an information charging petitioner with possession of counterfeit certificates of deposit was substituted.  Petitioner pleaded nolo contendere to that charge before a different District Court Judge, and was sentenced to two years' probation.  Subsequently, the Court of Appeals reversed petitioner's conviction for the passport offense, and petitioner was retried on the charge before the same trial judge and was again convicted.  In imposing a sentence of two years' imprisonment, none of which was suspended, the trial judge explained that he imposed the greater sentence because of petitioner's intervening conviction for possession of counterfeit certificates of deposit.  The judge rejected petitioner's argument that, because the conduct underlying the conviction for possession of counterfeit certificates of deposit occurred prior to petitioner's original sentencing on the passport conviction, he could not, under North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, receive a sentence greater than that received for the original conviction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  After retrial and conviction following a defendant's successful appeal, a sentencing authority may justify an increased sentence by affirmatively identifying relevant conduct or events that occurred subsequent to the original sentencing proceedings.  Pp.  468 U. S. 563-565,  468 U. S. 569-571,  468 U. S. 571-572.

Syllabus 
Respondents, pretrial detainees at the Los Angeles County Central Jail, brought a class action in Federal District Court against the County Sheriff and other officials, challenging, on due process grounds, the jail's policy of denying pretrial detainees contact visits with their spouses, relatives, children, and friends, and the jail's practice of conducting random, irregular ""shakedown"" searches of cells while the detainees were away at meals, recreation, or other activities.  The District Court sustained the challenges, and ordered that low risk detainees incarcerated for more than a month be allowed contact visits, and that all detainees be allowed to watch searches of their cells if they are in the area when the searches are conducted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Where it is alleged that a pretrial detainee has been deprived of liberty without due process, the dispositive inquiry is whether the challenged practice or policy constitutes punishment or is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520.  In considering whether a specific practice or policy is ""reasonably related"" to security interests, courts should play a very limited role, since such considerations are peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of corrections officials.  Id. at  441 U. S. 540-541, n. 23.  Pp.  468 U. S. 583-585.
2. Here, the Central Jail's blanket prohibition on contact visits is an entirely reasonable, nonpunitive response to legitimate security concerns, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment.  Contact visits invite a host of security problems.  They open a detention facility to the introduction of drugs, weapons, and other contraband.  Moreover, to expose to others those detainees who, as is often the case, are awaiting trial for serious, violent offenses or have prior convictions carries with it the risks that the safety of innocent individuals will be jeopardized.  Totally disallowing contact visits is not excessive in relation to the security and other interests at stake.  There are many justifications for denying contact visits entirely, rather than attempting the difficult task of establishing a program of limited visits such as that imposed here.  Nothing in the Constitution requires that detainees be allowed contact visits; responsible, experienced administrators have determined, in their sound 
Page 468 U. S. 577
 discretion, that such visits will jeopardize the security of the facility and other persons.  Pp.  468 U. S. 585-589.
3. The Central Jail's practice of conducting random, irregular ""shakedown"" searches of cells in the absence of the cell occupants is also a reasonable response by the jail officials to legitimate security concerns.  Bell v. Wolfish, supra.  This is also a matter lodged in the sound discretion of those officials.  Pp.  468 U. S. 589-591.

No. 83-724
Argued April 18, 1984
Decided July 3, 1984
468 U.S. 609

Syllabus 
Appellee United States Jaycees is a nonprofit national membership corporation whose objective, as stated in its bylaws, is to pursue such educational and charitable purposes as will promote and foster the growth and development of young men's civic organizations.  The bylaws establish several classes of membership, including individual regular and associate members and local chapters.  Regular membership is limited to young men between the ages of 18 and 35, while associate membership is available to persons ineligible for regular membership, principally women and older men.  An associate member may not vote or hold local or national office.  Two local chapters in Minnesota have been violating the bylaws for several years by admitting women as regular members, and, as a result, have had a number of sanctions imposed on them by appellee, including denying their members eligibility for state or national office.  When these chapters were notified by appellee that revocation of their charters was to be considered, members of both chapters filed discrimination charges with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, alleging that the exclusion of women from full membership violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act (Act), which makes it
""an unfair discriminatory practice . . . [t]o deny any person the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation because of race, color, creed, religion, disability, national origin or sex.""
Before a hearing took place on the state charges, appellee brought suit against appellant state officials to prevent enforcement of the Act, alleging that, by requiring appellee to accept women as regular members, application of the Act would violate the male members' constitutional rights of free speech and association.  Ultimately, a state hearing officer decided against appellee, and the District Court certified to the Minnesota Supreme Court the question whether appellee is ""a place of public accommodation"" within the meaning of the Act.  That court answered the question in the affirmative, and, in the course of its holding, suggested that, unlike appellee, the Kiwanis Club might be sufficiently ""private"" to be outside the Act's scope.  Appellee then amended its federal complaint to claim that the 
Page 468 U. S. 610
 Minnesota Supreme Court's interpretation of the Act rendered it unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  After trial, the District Court entered judgment in appellants' favor.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that application of the Act to appellee's membership policies would produce a ""direct and substantial"" interference with appellee's freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment. and, in the alternative, that the Act was vague as construed and applied, and hence unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:
1. Application of the Act to appellee to compel it to accept women as regular members does not abridge either the male members' freedom of intimate association or their freedom of expressive association.  Pp.  468 U. S. 617-629.
(a) Several features of appellee's organization place it outside the category of highly personal relationships entitled to constitutional protection against unjustified interference by the State.  Local chapters are neither small nor selective, no criteria being employed for judging applicants for membership.  Moreover, many of the activities central to the formation and maintenance of the association of members with one another involve the participation of strangers to that relationship, numerous nonmembers of both genders regularly participating in a substantial portion of the activities.  Accordingly, local chapters lack the distinctive characteristics that might afford constitutional protection to their members' decision to exclude women.  Pp.  468 U. S. 618-622.
(b) Minnesota's compelling interest in eradicating discrimination against its female citizens, an interest unrelated to the suppression of expression, justifies the impact that application of the Act to appellee may have on its male members' freedom of expressive association.  By prohibiting gender discrimination in places of public accommodation, the Act protects the State's citizenry from a number of serious social and personal harms.  Assuring women equal access to the goods, privileges, and advantages of a place of public accommodation clearly furthers compelling state interests.  In applying the Act to appellee, the State has advanced those interests through the least restrictive means of achieving its ends.  There is no basis in the record for concluding that admission of women as full voting members will impede appellee's ability to engage in its constitutionally protected civic, charitable, lobbying, fundraising, and other activities, or to disseminate its preferred views.  In any event, even if enforcement of the Act causes some incidental abridgment of appellee's protected speech, that effect is not greater than necessary to accomplish the State's legitimate purposes.  Pp.  468 U. S. 622-629. 
Page 468 U. S. 611

2. The Act is not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  The due process concerns of the void-for-vagueness doctrine are not seriously implicated by the Act, either on its face or as construed in this case.  The Minnesota Supreme Court's construction of the Act by use of objective criteria typically employed in determining the applicability of antidiscrimination statutes to the membership policies of assertedly private clubs ensures that the Act's reach is readily ascertainable.  The contrast that court drew between appellee and the Kiwanis Club also disposes of appellee's contention that the Act is unconstitutionally overbroad.  That court's articulated willingness to adopt limiting constructions that would exclude private groups from the Act's reach, together with the commonly used and sufficiently precise standards it employed to determine that appellee is not such a group, establishes that the Act, as construed, does not create an unacceptable risk of application to a substantial amount of protected conduct.  Pp. 629-631.

Syllabus 
Title 18 U.S.C.  474 makes it a crime to photograph any obligation or other security of the United States.  But 18 U.S.C.  504(1) permits the printing or publishing of illustrations of any such obligation or other security
""for philatelic, numismatic, educational, historical, or newsworthy purposes in articles, books, journals, newspapers, or albums""
if the illustrations are in black and white and less than three-fourths or more than one and one-half the size of the original and if the negative and plates used in making the illustrations are destroyed after their final authorized use.  Appellee magazine publisher, after being warned that it was violating  474 and 504 by publishing a photographic color reproduction of United States currency on the cover of one of its magazines, brought an action in Federal District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the statutes were unconstitutional on their face and as applied to appellee, and an injunction preventing their enforcement.  The District Court, ruling in appellee's favor, held that the statutes violated the First Amendment.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
539 F.Supp. 1371, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II-A, concluding that  504's purpose requirement is unconstitutional.  It cannot be sustained as a valid time, place, and manner regulation because it discriminates on the basis of content in violation of the First Amendment.  A determination as to the newsworthiness or educational value of a photograph cannot help but be based on the content of the photograph and the message it delivers.  Under  504, one photographic reproduction will be allowed and another disallowed solely because the Government determines that the message in one is newsworthy or educational, but the message in the other is not.  Pp.  468 U. S. 648-649.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, delivered an opinion with respect to Parts II-B, II-C, and II-D, concluding that:
1. The issue of the validity of  504's publication requirement on vagueness or overbreadth grounds cannot properly be addressed.  There is no evidence that appellee has ever, or will ever, have difficulty 
Page 468 U. S. 642
 meeting that requirement, and therefore its validity is of only academic interest to appellee.  And where it is not clear from the record that the requirement will be used to prevent a person from utilizing an otherwise legitimate photograph, appellee publisher cannot claim that the statute is overbroad because it unconstitutionally precludes nonpublishers from making reproductions of currency even though they meet the statute's other requirements.  Pp.  468 U. S. 649-652.
2. The fact that  504's purpose requirement is unconstitutional does not automatically render the statute's entire regulatory scheme invalid.  Whether an unconstitutional provision is severable from the remainder of a statute is largely a question of legislative intent, but the presumption is in favor of severability.  Here, it appears that the policies Congress sought to advance by enacting  504 -- to ease the administrative burden without hindering the Government's efforts to enforce the counterfeiting laws -- can be effectuated even though the purpose requirement is unenforceable.  Pp.  468 U. S. 652-655.
3. Section 504's size and color requirements are valid as reasonable manner regulations that can constitutionally be imposed on those wishing to publish photographic reproductions of currency.  Compliance with these requirements does not prevent appellee from expressing any view on any subject or from using illustrations of currency in expressing these views.  Moreover, the Government does not need to evaluate the nature of the message imparted in order to enforce the requirements, since they restrict only the manner in which the illustrations can be presented.  Such requirements also effectively serve the Government's compelling interest in preventing counterfeiting.  Because the provisions of  474 are of real concern only when  504's requirements are not complied with,  474 is also constitutional.  Pp.  468 U. S. 655-659.
JUSTICE STEVENS, concluding that  504's purpose requirement is constitutional, also concluded that the statute's size and color requirements are permissible methods of minimizing the risk of fraud as well as counterfeiting, and can have only a minimal impact on appellee's ability to communicate effectively.  Pp.  468 U. S. 697-704.

Title 18 U.S.C.  474 makes it a crime to photograph any obligation or other security of the United States.  But 18 U.S.C.  504(1) permits the printing or publishing of illustrations of any such obligation or other security
""for philatelic, numismatic, educational, historical, or newsworthy purposes in articles, books, journals, newspapers, or albums""
if the illustrations are in black and white and less than three-fourths or more than one and one-half the size of the original and if the negative and plates used in making the illustrations are destroyed after their final authorized use.  Appellee magazine publisher, after being warned that it was violating  474 and 504 by publishing a photographic color reproduction of United States currency on the cover of one of its magazines, brought an action in Federal District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the statutes were unconstitutional on their face and as applied to appellee, and an injunction preventing their enforcement.  The District Court, ruling in appellee's favor, held that the statutes violated the First Amendment.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
539 F.Supp. 1371, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II-A, concluding that  504's purpose requirement is unconstitutional.  It cannot be sustained as a valid time, place, and manner regulation because it discriminates on the basis of content in violation of the First Amendment.  A determination as to the newsworthiness or educational value of a photograph cannot help but be based on the content of the photograph and the message it delivers.  Under  504, one photographic reproduction will be allowed and another disallowed solely because the Government determines that the message in one is newsworthy or educational, but the message in the other is not.  Pp.  468 U. S. 648-649.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, delivered an opinion with respect to Parts II-B, II-C, and II-D, concluding that:
1. The issue of the validity of  504's publication requirement on vagueness or overbreadth grounds cannot properly be addressed.  There is no evidence that appellee has ever, or will ever, have difficulty 
Page 468 U. S. 642
 meeting that requirement, and therefore its validity is of only academic interest to appellee.  And where it is not clear from the record that the requirement will be used to prevent a person from utilizing an otherwise legitimate photograph, appellee publisher cannot claim that the statute is overbroad because it unconstitutionally precludes nonpublishers from making reproductions of currency even though they meet the statute's other requirements.  Pp.  468 U. S. 649-652.
2. The fact that  504's purpose requirement is unconstitutional does not automatically render the statute's entire regulatory scheme invalid.  Whether an unconstitutional provision is severable from the remainder of a statute is largely a question of legislative intent, but the presumption is in favor of severability.  Here, it appears that the policies Congress sought to advance by enacting  504 -- to ease the administrative burden without hindering the Government's efforts to enforce the counterfeiting laws -- can be effectuated even though the purpose requirement is unenforceable.  Pp.  468 U. S. 652-655.
3. Section 504's size and color requirements are valid as reasonable manner regulations that can constitutionally be imposed on those wishing to publish photographic reproductions of currency.  Compliance with these requirements does not prevent appellee from expressing any view on any subject or from using illustrations of currency in expressing these views.  Moreover, the Government does not need to evaluate the nature of the message imparted in order to enforce the requirements, since they restrict only the manner in which the illustrations can be presented.  Such requirements also effectively serve the Government's compelling interest in preventing counterfeiting.  Because the provisions of  474 are of real concern only when  504's requirements are not complied with,  474 is also constitutional.  Pp.  468 U. S. 655-659.
JUSTICE STEVENS, concluding that  504's purpose requirement is constitutional, also concluded that the statute's size and color requirements are permissible methods of minimizing the risk of fraud as well as counterfeiting, and can have only a minimal impact on appellee's ability to communicate effectively.  Pp.  468 U. S. 697-704.

Syllabus 
After a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent learned that respondents Karo, Horton, and Harley had ordered 50 gallons of ether from a Government informant, who had told the agent that the ether was to be used to extract cocaine from clothing that had been imported into the United States, the Government obtained a court order authorizing the installation and monitoring of a beeper in one of the cans of ether.  With the informant's consent, DEA agents substituted their own can containing a beeper for one of the cans in the shipment.  Thereafter, agents saw Karo pick up the ether from the informant, followed Karo to his house, and determined by using the beeper that the ether was inside the house, where it was then monitored.  The ether then moved in succession to two other houses, including Horton's, before it was moved first to a locker in one commercial storage facility and then to a locker in another such facility.  Both lockers were rented jointly by Horton and Harley.  Finally, the ether was removed from the second storage facility by respondent Rhodes and an unidentified woman and transported in Horton's truck, first to Rhodes' house and then to a house rented by Horton, Harley, and respondent Steele.  Using the beeper monitor, agents determined that the beeper can was inside the house, and obtained a warrant to search the house based in part on information derived through use of the beeper.  The warrant was executed, and Horton, Harley, Steele, and respondent Roth were arrested, and cocaine was seized.  Respondents were indicted for various offenses relating to the cocaine.  The District Court granted respondents' pretrial motion to suppress the seized evidence on the grounds that the initial warrant to install the beeper was invalid, and that the seizure was the tainted fruit of an unauthorized installation and monitoring of the beeper.  The Government appealed, but did not challenge the invalidation of the initial warrant.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, except with respect to Rhodes, holding that a warrant was required to install the beeper in the can of ether and to monitor it in private dwellings and storage lockers, that the warrant for the search of the house rented by Horton, Harley, and Steele, and the resulting seizure, were tainted by the Government's prior illegal conduct, and that therefore the evidence was properly suppressed as to Horton, Harley, Steele, Roth, and Karo. 
Page 468 U. S. 706

Held:
1. No Fourth Amendment interest of Karo or of any other respondent was infringed by the installation of the beeper.  The informant's consent was sufficient to validate the installation.  And the transfer of the beeper-laden can to Karo was neither a search nor a seizure, since it conveyed no information that Karo wished to keep private and did not interfere with anyone's possessory interest in a meaningful way.  Pp.  468 U. S. 711-713.
2. The monitoring of a beeper in a private residence, a location not opened to visual surveillance, violates the Fourth Amendment rights of those who have a justifiable interest in the privacy of the residence.  Here, if a DEA agent had entered the house in question without a warrant to verify that the ether was in the house, he would have engaged in an unreasonable search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  The result is the same where, without a warrant, the Government surreptitiously uses a beeper to obtain information that it could not have obtained from outside the curtilage of the house.  There is no reason in this case to deviate from the general rule that a search of a house should be conducted pursuant to a warrant.  Pp.  468 U. S. 713-718.
3. The evidence seized in the house in question, however, should not have been suppressed with respect to any of the respondents.  The information that the ether was in the house, verified by use of the beeper without a warrant, would be inadmissible against those respondents with privacy interests in the house, and would invalidate the search warrant, if critical to establishing probable cause.  But because locating, without prior monitoring, the ether in the second storage facility was not an illegal search (use of the beeper not identifying the specific locker in which the ether was located and the locker being identified only by the smell of ether emanating therefrom), and because the ether was seen being loaded into Horton's truck, which then traveled the highways, it is evident that there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment as to anyone with or without standing to complain about monitoring the beeper while it was located in the truck.  United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276.  Under the circumstances, the warrant affidavit, after striking the facts about monitoring the beeper while it was in the searched house, contained sufficient untainted information to furnish probable cause for issuance of the search warrant.

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) denies tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code -- and hence eligibility to receive charitable contributions deductible from income taxes under the Code -- to racially discriminatory private schools, and has established guidelines and procedures for determining whether a particular school is in fact racially nondiscriminatory.  Respondents, parents of black children who were attending public schools in seven States in school districts undergoing desegregation, brought a nationwide class action in Federal District Court against petitioner Government officials (petitioner Allen, the head of a private school identified in the complaint, intervened as a defendant), alleging that the IRS has not adopted sufficient standards and procedures to fulfill its obligation to deny tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools, and has thereby harmed respondents directly and interfered with their children's opportunity to receive an education in desegregated public schools.  Respondents also alleged that many racially segregated private schools were created or expanded in their communities at the time the public schools were undergoing desegregation, and had received tax exemptions despite the IRS policy and guidelines; and that these unlawful tax exemptions harmed respondents in that they constituted tangible financial aid for racially segregated educational institutions and encouraged the organization and expansion of institutions that provided segregated educational opportunities for white students avoiding attendance in the public schools.  Respondents did not allege that their children had ever applied or would ever apply for admission to any private school.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that respondents lacked standing to bring the suit.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Respondents do not have standing to bring this suit.  Pp.  468 U. S. 750-766.
(a) The ""case or controversy"" requirement of Art. III of the Constitution defines with respect to the Judicial Branch the idea of separation of powers on which the Federal Government is founded, and the Art. III 
Page 468 U. S. 738
 doctrine of ""standing"" has a core constitutional component that a plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.  The concepts of standing doctrine present questions that must be answered by reference to the Art. III notion that federal courts may exercise power only in the last resort and as a necessity, and only when adjudication is consistent with a system of separated powers and the dispute is one traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process.  Pp.  468 U. S. 750-752.
(b) Respondents' claim that they are harmed directly by the mere fact of Government financial aid to discriminatory private schools fails because it does not constitute judicially cognizable injury.  Insofar as the claim may be interpreted as one simply to have the Government avoid the alleged violation of law in granting the tax exemptions, an asserted right to have the Government act in accordance with law is not sufficient, standing alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court.  Nor do respondents have standing to litigate their claim based on the stigmatizing injury often caused by racial discrimination.  Such injury accords a basis for standing only to those persons who are personally denied equal treatment by the challenged discriminatory conduct, and respondents do not allege a stigmatic injury suffered as a direct result of having personally been denied equal treatment.  Pp.  468 U. S. 753-756.
(c) Respondents' claim of injury as to their children's diminished ability to receive an education in a racially integrated school because of the federal tax exemptions granted to some racially discriminatory private schools -- though a judicially cognizable injury -- fails because the alleged injury is not fairly traceable to the Government conduct that is challenged as unlawful.  Respondents have not alleged that there were enough racially discriminatory private schools receiving tax exemptions in respondents' communities for withdrawal of those exemptions to make an appreciable difference in public school integration.  Moreover, it is entirely speculative whether withdrawal of a particular school's tax exemption would lead the school to change its policies; whether any given parent of a child attending such a private school would decide to transfer the child to public school as a result of any changes in policy of a private school threatened with loss of tax-exempt status; or whether, in a particular community, a large enough number of school officials and parents would reach decisions that collectively would have a significant impact on the racial composition of the public schools.  To recognize respondents' standing to seek a restructuring of the apparatus established by the Executive Branch to fulfill its legal duties would run afoul of the idea of separation of powers that underlies standing doctrine.  The

 Constitution assigns to the Executive Branch, not to the Judicial Branch, the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.  Pp.  468 U. S. 756-761.

Green, 404 U.S. 997, summarily aff'g Green v. Connally, 330 F.Supp. 115 -- requires a finding of standing here.  Pp.  468 U. S. 761-766.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a white male, was indicted on federal fraud charges.  Prior to trial, he moved for dismissal of the indictment on the ground that there was discrimination in the grand jury selection process in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  At a hearing on the motion to dismiss, petitioner introduced testimony of a statistical social science consultant showing that, for a 7-year period prior to petitioner's indictment, none of the 15 grand juries empaneled had had a Negro or female foreman, and that, of the 15 deputy foremen appointed, only 3 had been Negroes and 6 had been women.  The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, and petitioner was convicted after a jury trial.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Assuming that discrimination entered into the selection of grand jury foremen, such discrimination does not warrant reversal of petitioner's conviction and dismissal of the indictment against him.  Pp.  468 U. S. 342-350.
(a) Discrimination in the selection of grand jury foremen -- as distinguished from discrimination in the selection of the grand jury itself -- does not in any sense threaten the interests of a defendant protected by the Due Process Clause.  Unlike the grand jury itself, the office of grand jury foreman is not a creature of the Constitution, but, instead, was originally instituted by statute for the convenience of the court.  The responsibilities of a federal grand jury foreman are essentially clerical in nature -- administering oaths, maintaining records, and signing indictments.  Given its ministerial nature, the role of foreman is not so significant to the administration of justice that discrimination in the selection of the foreman has any appreciable effect on the defendant's due process right to fundamental fairness.  And so long as the composition of a federal grand jury as a whole serves the defendant's due process interest in assuring that the grand jury includes persons with a range of experiences and perspectives, discrimination in the selection of the foreman does not impinge such interest.  Pp.  468 U. S. 342-346.
(b) An assumption that discrimination in the selection of a grand jury foreman requires the setting aside of a conviction is not warranted here, where a white male is challenging on due process grounds the selection of the foreman of a federal grand jury.  Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545, distinguished.  Pp.  468 U. S. 346-349.

At a hearing on the motion to dismiss, petitioner introduced testimony of a statistical social science consultant showing that, for a 7-year period prior to petitioner's indictment, none of the 15 grand juries empaneled had had a Negro or female foreman, and that, of the 15 deputy foremen appointed, only 3 had been Negroes and 6 had been women.  The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, and petitioner was convicted after a jury trial.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Assuming that discrimination entered into the selection of grand jury foremen, such discrimination does not warrant reversal of petitioner's conviction and dismissal of the indictment against him.  Pp.  468 U. S. 342-350.
(a) Discrimination in the selection of grand jury foremen -- as distinguished from discrimination in the selection of the grand jury itself -- does not in any sense threaten the interests of a defendant protected by the Due Process Clause.  Unlike the grand jury itself, the office of grand jury foreman is not a creature of the Constitution, but, instead, was originally instituted by statute for the convenience of the court.  The responsibilities of a federal grand jury foreman are essentially clerical in nature -- administering oaths, maintaining records, and signing indictments.  Given its ministerial nature, the role of foreman is not so significant to the administration of justice that discrimination in the selection of the foreman has any appreciable effect on the defendant's due process right to fundamental fairness.  And so long as the composition of a federal grand jury as a whole serves the defendant's due process interest in assuring that the grand jury includes persons with a range of experiences and perspectives, discrimination in the selection of the foreman does not impinge such interest.  Pp.  468 U. S. 342-346.
(b) An assumption that discrimination in the selection of a grand jury foreman requires the setting aside of a conviction is not warranted here, where a white male is challenging on due process grounds the selection of the foreman of a federal grand jury.  Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U. S. 545, distinguished.  Pp.  468 U. S. 346-349.

(c) This Court declines petitioner's invitation to embark, pursuant to its supervisory power over the federal courts, upon a course of vacating convictions because of discrimination in the selection of grand jury foremen.  Pp.  468 U. S. 349-350

Syllabus 
The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (Act) established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a nonprofit corporation, to disburse federal funds to noncommercial television and radio stations in support of station operations and educational programming.  Section 399 of the Act forbids any noncommercial educational station that receives a grant from the CPB to ""engage in editorializing.""  Appellees (Pacifica Foundation, a nonprofit corporation that owns and operates several noncommercial educational broadcasting stations that receive grants from the CPB, the League of Women Voters of California, and an individual listener and viewer of public broadcasting) brought an action in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of  399.  The District Court granted summary judgment in appellees' favor, holding that  399 violates the First Amendment.
Held:  Section 399's ban on editorializing violates the First Amendment.  Pp.  468 U. S. 374-402.
(a) Congress, acting pursuant to the Commerce Clause, has power to regulate the use of the broadcast medium.  In the exercise of this power, Congress may seek to assure that the public receives through this medium a balanced presentation of information and views on issues of public importance that otherwise might not be addressed if control of the medium were left entirely in the hands of the owners and operators of broadcasting stations.  At the same time, since broadcasters are engaged in a vital and independent form of communicative activity, the First Amendment must inform and give shape to the manner in which Congress exercises its regulatory power.  Thus, although the broadcasting industry operates under restrictions not imposed upon other media, the thrust of these restrictions has generally been to secure the public's First Amendment interest in receiving a balanced presentation of views on diverse matters of public concern.  As a result, the absolute freedom to advocate one's own positions without also presenting opposing viewpoints -- a freedom enjoyed, for example, by newspaper publishers -- is denied to broadcasters.  Such restrictions have been upheld 
Page 468 U. S. 365
 by this Court only when they were narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest, such as ensuring adequate and balanced coverage of public issues.  Pp.  468 U. S. 374-381.
(b) The restriction imposed by  399 is specifically directed at a form of speech -- the expression of editorial opinions -- that lies at the heart of First Amendment protection, and is defined solely on the basis of the content of the suppressed speech.  Section 399 singles out noncommercial broadcasters and denies them the right to address their chosen audience on matters of public importance.  Pp.  468 U. S. 381-384.
(c) Section 399's broad ban on all editorializing by every station that receives CPB funds far exceeds what is necessary to protect against the risk of governmental interference or to prevent the public from assuming that editorials by public broadcasting stations represent the official view of government.  The ban impermissibly sweeps within it a wide range of speech by wholly private stations on topics that do not take a directly partisan stand or that have nothing whatever to do with federal, state, or local government.  Pp.  468 U. S. 386-395.
(d) The patent overinclusiveness and underinclusiveness of  399's ban also undermines the likelihood of a genuine governmental interest in preventing private groups from propagating their own views via public broadcasting.  Section 399 does not prevent the use of noncommercial stations for the presentation of partisan views on controversial matters; instead, it merely bars a station from specifically labeling such issues as its own or those of its management.  Pp.  468 U. S. 396-399.
(e) Section 399 cannot be justified on the basis of Congress' spending power as simply determining that Congress will not subsidize public broadcasting station editorials.  Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Washington, 461 U. S. 540, distinguished.  Since a noncommercial educational station that receives only 1% of its income from CPB grants is barred absolutely from editorializing, such a station has no way of limiting the use of its federal funds to noneditorial activities, and, more importantly, it is barred from using even private funds to finance its editorial activity.  Pp.  468 U. S. 399-401.

468 U.S. 420

Syllabus 
After observing respondent's car weaving in and out of a highway lane, an officer of the Ohio State Highway Patrol forced respondent to stop and asked him to get out of the car.  Upon noticing that respondent was having difficulty standing, the officer concluded that respondent would be charged with a traffic offense and would not be allowed to leave the scene, but respondent was not told that he would be taken into custody.  When respondent could not perform a field sobriety test without falling, the officer asked him if he had been using intoxicants, and he replied that he had consumed two beers and had smoked marihuana a short time before.  The officer then formally arrested respondent and drove him to a county jail, where a blood test failed to detect any alcohol in respondent's blood.  Questioning was then resumed, and respondent again made incriminating statements, including an admission that he was ""barely"" under the influence of alcohol.  At no point during this sequence was respondent given the warnings prescribed by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  Respondent was charged with the misdemeanor under Ohio law of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, and when the state court denied his motion to exclude the various incriminating statements on the asserted ground that their admission into evidence would violate the Fifth Amendment because respondent had not been informed of his constitutional rights prior to his interrogation, he pleaded ""no contest,"" and was convicted.  After the conviction was affirmed on appeal by the Franklin County Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court denied review, respondent filed an action in Federal District Court for habeas corpus relief.  The District Court dismissed the petition, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Miranda warnings must be given to all individuals prior to custodial interrogation, whether the offense investigated is a felony or a misdemeanor traffic offense, and that respondent's post-arrest statements, at least, were inadmissible.
Held:
1. A person subjected to custodial interrogation is entitled to the benefit of the procedural safeguards enunciated in Miranda, regardless of the nature or severity of the offense of which he is suspected or for which 
Page 468 U. S. 421
 he was arrested.  Thus, respondent's statements made at the station house were inadmissible, since he was ""in custody"" at least as of the moment he was formally arrested and instructed to get into the police car, and since he was not informed of his constitutional rights at that time.  To create an exception to the Miranda rule when the police arrest a person for allegedly committing a misdemeanor traffic offense and then question him without informing him of his constitutional rights would substantially undermine the rule's simplicity and clarity, and would introduce doctrinal complexities, particularly with respect to situations where the police, in conducting custodial interrogations, do not know whether the person has committed a misdemeanor or a felony.  The purposes of the Miranda safeguards as to ensuring that the police do not coerce or trick captive suspects into confessing, relieving the inherently compelling pressures generated by the custodial setting itself, and freeing courts from the task of scrutinizing individual cases to determine, after the fact, whether particular confessions were voluntary, are implicated as much by in-custody questioning of persons suspected of misdemeanors as they are by questioning of persons suspected of felonies.  Pp.  468 U. S. 428-435.
2. The roadside questioning of a motorist detained pursuant to a routine traffic stop does not constitute ""custodial interrogation"" for the purposes of the Miranda rule.  Although an ordinary traffic stop curtails the ""freedom of action"" of the detained motorist and imposes some pressures on the detainee to answer questions, such pressures do not sufficiently impair the detainee's exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination to require that he be warned of his constitutional rights.  A traffic stop is usually brief, and the motorist expects that, while he may be given a citation, in the end, he most likely will be allowed to continue on his way.  Moreover, the typical traffic stop is conducted in public, and the atmosphere surrounding it is substantially less ""police dominated"" than that surrounding the kinds of interrogation at issue in Miranda and subsequent cases in which Miranda has been applied.  However, if a motorist who has been detained pursuant to a traffic stop thereafter is subjected to treatment that renders him ""in custody"" for practical purposes, he is entitled to the full panoply of protections prescribed by Miranda.  In this case, the initial stop of respondent's car, by itself, did not render him ""in custody,"" and respondent has failed to demonstrate that, at any time between the stop and the arrest, he was subjected to restraints comparable to those associated with a formal arrest.  Although the arresting officer apparently decided as soon as respondent stepped out of his car that he would be taken into custody and charged with a traffic offense, the officer never communicated his intention to respondent.  A policeman's unarticulated plan has no bearing on the question whether a suspect was ""in custody"" at a particular time; the 
Page 468 U. S. 422
 only relevant inquiry is how a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood his situation.  Since respondent was not taken into custody for the purposes of Miranda until he was formally arrested, his statements made prior to that point were admissible against him.  Pp.  468 U. S. 435-442.
3. A determination of whether the improper admission of respondent's postarrest statements constituted ""harmless error"" will not be made by this Court for the cumulative reasons that (i) the issue was not presented to the Ohio courts or to the federal courts below, (ii) respondent's admissions made at the scene of the traffic stop and the statements he made at the police station were not identical, and (iii) the procedural posture of the case makes the use of harmless error analysis especially difficult, because respondent, while preserving his objection to the denial of his pretrial motion to exclude the evidence, elected not to contest the prosecution's case against him and thus has not yet had an opportunity to try to impeach the State's evidence or to present evidence of his own.  Pp.  468 U. S. 442-445.
716 F.2d 361, affirmed.

No. 83-5596
Argued April 17, 1984

Syllabus 
At petitioner's trial for first-degree murder, the Florida trial court informed him that it would instruct the jury on lesser included, noncapital offenses if he would waive the statute of limitations, which had expired as to those offenses.  Petitioner refused to waive the statute, and the jury was instructed solely on capital murder.  After the jury returned a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder, a sentencing hearing was conducted before the same jury, a majority of which recommended life imprisonment.  Under Florida law, the jury's sentencing recommendation in a capital case is only advisory, and the trial court must conduct its own weighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances to determine the proper sentence.  If a death sentence is imposed, specified written findings are required.  In this case, the trial court imposed the death sentence and entered its findings in support thereof.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, rejecting petitioner's contention that Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 -- which held that a statute prohibiting lesser included offense instructions in capital cases was unconstitutional -- required reversal because of the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses absent a waiver of the statute of limitations on those offenses.  However, the Florida Supreme Court reversed the death sentence because of the trial judge's consideration of a confidential portion of the presentence investigation report, neither party having received a copy of the confidential portion.  On remand, the trial court again imposed the death penalty after a hearing to allow petitioner to present evidence in response to a new presentence investigation report.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed, holding, inter alia, that there was no constitutional infirmity in the Florida procedure whereby the judge is allowed to override the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment.
Held:
1. On the facts, it was not error for the trial judge to refuse to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses.  Beck v. Alabama, supra, recognized the risk of an unwarranted conviction that is created when the jury is deprived of the ""third option"" of convicting the defendant of a lesser included offense.  Petitioner's general premise that a criminal defendant may not be required to waive a substantive right -- here the right to a statute of limitations -- as a condition for receiving an otherwise constitutionally 
Page 468 U. S. 448
 fair trial does not apply to petitioner's situation.  In Beck, the element found to be essential to a fair trial was not simply a lesser included offense instruction in the abstract, but the enhanced rationality and reliability the existence of the instruction introduced into the jury's deliberations.  Where no lesser included offense exists, a lesser included offense instruction detracts from, rather than enhances, the rationality of the process.  The defendant has the option of waiving the expired statute of limitations on lesser included offenses in order to have the jury instructed on those offenses, or of asserting the statute of limitations.  Pp.  468 U. S. 454-457.
2. There is no constitutional requirement that a jury's recommendation of life imprisonment in a capital case be final, so as to preclude the trial judge from overriding the jury's recommendation and imposing the death sentence.  The fundamental issue in a capital sentencing proceeding is the determination of the appropriate punishment to be imposed on an individual, and the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee a right to a jury determination of that issue.  Nothing in the safeguards against arbitrary and discriminatory application of the death penalty necessitated by the qualitative difference of the penalty requires that the sentence be imposed by a jury.  And the purposes of the death penalty are not frustrated by, or inconsistent with, a scheme in which imposition of the penalty is determined by a judge.  The fact that the majority of jurisdictions with capital sentencing statutes give the life-or-death decision to the jury does not establish that contemporary standards of fairness and decency are offended by the jury override.  The Eighth Amendment is not violated every time a State reaches a conclusion different from a majority of its sisters over how best to administer its criminal laws.  Pp.  468 U. S. 457-465.
3. The determination that there is no constitutional imperative that a jury have the responsibility of deciding whether the death penalty should be imposed also disposes of petitioner's double jeopardy challenge to the jury-override procedure.  If the judge is vested with sole responsibility for imposing the penalty, the jury's advice does not become a judgment simply because it comes from the jury.  P.  468 U. S. 465.
4. Application of the Florida standards allowing a trial court to override a jury's recommendation of a life sentence does not violate the constitutional requirement of reliability in capital sentencing.  There is no indication that the application of the jury-override procedure has resulted in arbitrary or discriminatory application of the death penalty, either in general or in this particular case.  The trial judge here based his decision on the presence of two statutory aggravating circumstances and the absence of any mitigating circumstances.  The Florida Supreme Court reviewed petitioner's sentence and concluded that the death penalty 
Page 468 U. S. 449
 was properly imposed under state law.  Whether or not ""reasonable people"" could differ over the result, there is nothing irrational or arbitrary about the imposition of petitioner's death penalty.  Pp.  468 U. S. 465-467.

Syllabus 
At petitioner's trial for first-degree murder, the Florida trial court informed him that it would instruct the jury on lesser included, noncapital offenses if he would waive the statute of limitations, which had expired as to those offenses.  Petitioner refused to waive the statute, and the jury was instructed solely on capital murder.  After the jury returned a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder, a sentencing hearing was conducted before the same jury, a majority of which recommended life imprisonment.  Under Florida law, the jury's sentencing recommendation in a capital case is only advisory, and the trial court must conduct its own weighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances to determine the proper sentence.  If a death sentence is imposed, specified written findings are required.  In this case, the trial court imposed the death sentence and entered its findings in support thereof.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, rejecting petitioner's contention that Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 -- which held that a statute prohibiting lesser included offense instructions in capital cases was unconstitutional -- required reversal because of the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses absent a waiver of the statute of limitations on those offenses.  However, the Florida Supreme Court reversed the death sentence because of the trial judge's consideration of a confidential portion of the presentence investigation report, neither party having received a copy of the confidential portion.  On remand, the trial court again imposed the death penalty after a hearing to allow petitioner to present evidence in response to a new presentence investigation report.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed, holding, inter alia, that there was no constitutional infirmity in the Florida procedure whereby the judge is allowed to override the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment.
Held:
1. On the facts, it was not error for the trial judge to refuse to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses.  Beck v. Alabama, supra, recognized the risk of an unwarranted conviction that is created when the jury is deprived of the ""third option"" of convicting the defendant of a lesser included offense.  Petitioner's general premise that a criminal defendant may not be required to waive a substantive right -- here the right to a statute of limitations -- as a condition for receiving an otherwise constitutionally 
Page 468 U. S. 448
 fair trial does not apply to petitioner's situation.  In Beck, the element found to be essential to a fair trial was not simply a lesser included offense instruction in the abstract, but the enhanced rationality and reliability the existence of the instruction introduced into the jury's deliberations.  Where no lesser included offense exists, a lesser included offense instruction detracts from, rather than enhances, the rationality of the process.  The defendant has the option of waiving the expired statute of limitations on lesser included offenses in order to have the jury instructed on those offenses, or of asserting the statute of limitations.  Pp.  468 U. S. 454-457.
2. There is no constitutional requirement that a jury's recommendation of life imprisonment in a capital case be final, so as to preclude the trial judge from overriding the jury's recommendation and imposing the death sentence.  The fundamental issue in a capital sentencing proceeding is the determination of the appropriate punishment to be imposed on an individual, and the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee a right to a jury determination of that issue.  Nothing in the safeguards against arbitrary and discriminatory application of the death penalty necessitated by the qualitative difference of the penalty requires that the sentence be imposed by a jury.  And the purposes of the death penalty are not frustrated by, or inconsistent with, a scheme in which imposition of the penalty is determined by a judge.  The fact that the majority of jurisdictions with capital sentencing statutes give the life-or-death decision to the jury does not establish that contemporary standards of fairness and decency are offended by the jury override.  The Eighth Amendment is not violated every time a State reaches a conclusion different from a majority of its sisters over how best to administer its criminal laws.  Pp.  468 U. S. 457-465.
3. The determination that there is no constitutional imperative that a jury have the responsibility of deciding whether the death penalty should be imposed also disposes of petitioner's double jeopardy challenge to the jury-override procedure.  If the judge is vested with sole responsibility for imposing the penalty, the jury's advice does not become a judgment simply because it comes from the jury.  P.  468 U. S. 465.
4. Application of the Florida standards allowing a trial court to override a jury's recommendation of a life sentence does not violate the constitutional requirement of reliability in capital sentencing.  There is no indication that the application of the jury-override procedure has resulted in arbitrary or discriminatory application of the death penalty, either in general or in this particular case.  The trial judge here based his decision on the presence of two statutory aggravating circumstances and the absence of any mitigating circumstances.  The Florida Supreme Court reviewed petitioner's sentence and concluded that the death penalty 
Page 468 U. S. 449
 was properly imposed under state law.  Whether or not ""reasonable people"" could differ over the result, there is nothing irrational or arbitrary about the imposition of petitioner's death penalty.  Pp.  468 U. S. 465-467.

Syllabus 
Section 93 of the New Jersey Casino Control Act requires annual registration of unions representing persons employed in casinos or casino hotels, and provides that a union may be prohibited from receiving dues from such employees and from administering any pension or welfare funds if any union officer is disqualified under the criteria contained in  86 for the licensing of various entities and persons.  Those criteria include convictions for enumerated offenses, or any other offenses indicating that licensure would be inimical to the Act's policy, and association with other criminal offenders.  Appellees, a union whose membership includes persons employed in casino hotels in Atlantic City and the union's president, instituted an action against certain state agencies and officials in Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief after state administrative proceedings had been begun to determine whether certain of the union's officers were disqualified under the criteria of  86.  The court denied appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction against the state proceedings, concluding that appellees were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims, which included a claim that  86 and 93 were preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  The state administrative proceedings resulted in a finding that certain of the union's officials were disqualified under  86, and in an order that, if the officials were not removed from office, the union would be barred from collecting dues from any of its members who were casino hotel employees licensed or registered under the New Jersey Act.  The state agency also concluded that it would be unnecessary to invoke the additional  93 sanction of prohibiting the disqualified officials from administering pension and welfare funds.  Thereafter, the Court of Appeals held, inter 
Page 468 U. S. 492
 alia, that the District Court erred in refusing to grant the preliminary injunction, and that  93, insofar as it authorizes disqualification of elected union officials, is preempted by  7 of the NLRA.
Held:
1. The so-called ""local interests"" exception to the preemption doctrine does not apply if the state law regulates conduct that is actually protected by federal law.  Where, as here, the issue is one of an asserted substantive conflict with a federal enactment, then the relative importance to the State of its law is not material, since the federal law must prevail by direct operation of the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  468 U. S. 500-503.
2. Section 93 of the New Jersey Act, to the extent that it regulates the qualifications of casino industry union officials, does not actually conflict with  7 of the NLRA -- which neither contains explicit preemptive language nor otherwise indicates a congressional intent to usurp the entire field of labor-management relations -- and thus is not preempted by  7.  Although the 1945 decision in Hill v. Florida, 325 U. S. 538, interpreted  7's express guarantee of the right of employees to choose their bargaining representative as also conferring an unfettered right on employees to choose the officials of their bargaining representative, Congress has subsequently disclaimed any intent to preempt all state regulation which touches upon the specific right of employees to decide which individuals will serve as officials of their bargaining representatives.  Specifically,  504(a) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 generally prohibits persons convicted of specified crimes from serving as union officers, and  603(a) of that Act is an express disclaimer of preemption of state laws regulating union officials' responsibilities except where such preemption is expressly provided.  Moreover, in approving a compact between New York and New Jersey, Congress implicitly approved New York's restrictions (similar to those involved here) on unions representing waterfront employees, which restrictions were upheld against a preemption challenge based on  7 of the NLRA in De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U. S. 144.  Thus, Congress apparently has concluded that, at least where the States are confronted with the public evils of crime, corruption, and racketeering, more stringent state regulation of the qualifications of union officials is not incompatible with the national labor policy as embodied in  7.  Pp.  468 U. S. 503-510.
3. The issue whether the dues collection sanction authorized by  93 of the New Jersey Act to effect the removal of disqualified union officials abridges the employees' separate rights under  7 of the NLRA to organize, and thus is preempted, cannot be decided now, because of the procedural posture of this litigation.  Appellees' factual allegations as to this issue were never addressed by the courts below.  On remand, the 
Page 468 U. S. 493
 District Court should make the requisite findings of fact to determine whether imposition of the dues collection ban will so incapacitate appellee union as to prevent it from performing its functions as the employees' chosen bargaining agent.  Also, the issue of the validity of  93's second sanction -- prohibition of a union's administration of its pension or welfare funds cannot be decided now, despite the Court of Appeals' holding that the sanction is expressly preempted by provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  Because the state agency never imposed this sanction on appellee union, no concrete application of state law is presented, and the issue is hence not ripe for review.  Pp.  468 U. S. 510-512.

Syllabus 
Hawaii imposes a 20% excise tax on sales of liquor at wholesale.  But to encourage the development of the Hawaiian liquor industry, okolehao, a brandy distilled from the root of an indigenous shrub of Hawaii, and fruit wine manufactured in the State are exempted from the tax.  Appellant liquor wholesalers, who sell to retailers at the wholesale price plus the tax, brought an action in the Hawaii Tax Appeal Court seeking a refund of taxes paid under protest and alleging that the tax is unconstitutional because it violates, inter alia, the Commerce Clause.  The court rejected this constitutional claim, and the Hawaii Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the tax did not illegally discriminate against interstate commerce because the incidence of the tax is on the wholesalers, and the ultimate burden is borne by consumers in Hawaii.
Held:
1. Appellants have standing to challenge the tax in this Court.  Although they may pass the tax on to their customers, they are liable for it, and must return it to the State whether or not their customers pay their bills.  Moreover, even if the tax is passed on, it increases the price as compared to the exempted beverages, and appellants are entitled to litigate whether the tax has had an adverse competitive impact on their business.  P.  468 U. S. 267.
2. The tax exemption for okolehao and fruit wine violates the Commerce Clause, because it has both the purpose and effect of discriminating in favor of local products.  Pp.  468 U. S. 268-273.
(a) Neither the fact that sales of the exempted beverages constitute only a small part of the total liquor sales in Hawaii nor the fact that the exempted beverages do not present a ""competitive threat"" to other liquors is dispositive of the question whether competition exists between the exempt beverages and foreign beverages, but only goes to the extent of such competition.  On the facts, it cannot be said that no competition exists.  Pp.  468 U. S. 268-269.
(b) As long as there is some competition between the exempt beverages and nonexempt products from outside the State, there is a discriminatory effect.  The Commerce Clause limits the manner in which a State may legitimately compete for interstate trade, for in the process of competition, no State may discriminatorily tax products manufactured in any other State.  Here, it cannot properly be concluded that there was no 
Page 468 U. S. 264
 improper discrimination against interstate commerce merely because the burden of the tax was borne by consumers in Hawaii.  Nor does the propriety of economic protectionism hinge upon characterizing the industry in question as ""thriving"" or ""struggling.""  And it is irrelevant to the Commerce Clause inquiry that the legislature's motivation was the desire to aid the makers of the locally produced beverages, rather than to harm out-of-state producers.  Pp.  468 U. S. 270-273.
3. The tax exemption is not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment.  The exemption violates a central tenet of the Commerce Clause, but is not supported by any clear concern of that Amendment in combating the evils of an unrestricted traffic in liquor.  The central purpose of the Amendment was not to empower States to favor local liquor industry by erecting barriers to competition.  Pp.  468 U. S. 274-276.
4. This Court will not address the issues of whether, despite the unconstitutionality of the tax, appellants are entitled to tax refunds because the economic burden of the tax was passed on to their customers.  These issues were not addressed by the state courts, federal constitutional issues may be intertwined with issues of state law, and resolution of the issues may necessitate more of a record than so far has been made.

Syllabus 
In 1982, the National Park Service issued a permit to respondent Community for Creative Non-Violence (CCNV) to conduct a demonstration in Lafayette Park and the Mall, which are National Parks in the heart of Washington, D.C.  The purpose of the demonstration was to call attention to the plight of the homeless, and the permit authorized the erection of two symbolic tent cities.  However, the Park Service, relying on its regulations -- particularly one that permits ""camping"" (defined as including sleeping activities) only in designated campgrounds, no campgrounds having ever been designated in Lafayette Park or the Mall -- denied CCNV's request that demonstrators be permitted to sleep in the symbolic tents.  CCNV and the individual respondents then filed an action in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that application of the regulations to prevent sleeping in the tents violated the First Amendment.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the Park Service, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The challenged application of the Park Service regulations does not violate the First Amendment.  Pp.  468 U. S. 293-299.
(a) Assuming that overnight sleeping in connection with the demonstration is expressive conduct protected to some extent by the First Amendment, the regulation forbidding sleeping meets the requirements for a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction of expression, whether oral, written, or symbolized by conduct.  The regulation is neutral with regard to the message presented, and leaves open ample alternative methods of communicating the intended message concerning the plight of the homeless.  Moreover, the regulation narrowly focuses on the Government's substantial interest in maintaining the parks in the heart of the Capital in an attractive and intact condition, readily available to the millions of people who wish to see and enjoy them by their presence.  To permit camping would be totally inimical to these purposes.  The validity of the regulation need not be judged solely by reference to the demonstration at hand, and none of its provisions are unrelated to the ends that it was designed to serve.  Pp.  468 U. S. 293-298.
(b) Similarly, the challenged regulation is also sustainable as meeting the standards for a valid regulation of expressive conduct.  Aside from 
Page 468 U. S. 289
 its impact on speech, a rule against camping or overnight sleeping in public pars is not beyond the constitutional power of the Government to enforce.  And as noted above, there is a substantial Government interest, unrelated to suppression of expression, in conserving park property that is served by the proscription of sleeping.  Pp.  468 U.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was indicted on three counts of federal narcotics violations.  At his trial, the jury acquitted him on one count but was unable to agree on the others.  The District Court declared a mistrial as to the remaining counts and scheduled a retrial.  Petitioner then moved to bar a retrial, claiming that it would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal from that ruling for lack of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1291.
Held:
1. Petitioner raised a colorable double jeopardy claim appealable under 28 U.S.C.  1291.  While consideration of this claim would require the Court of Appeals to canvas the sufficiency of the evidence at the first trial, this fact alone does not prevent the District Court's order denying the claim from being appealable.  Pp.  468 U. S. 320-322.
2. On the merits, however, regardless of the sufficiency of the evidence at his first trial, petitioner has no valid double jeopardy claim.  The protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause, by its terms, applies only if there has been some event, such as an acquittal, that terminates the original jeopardy.  Neither the failure of the jury to reach a verdict nor a trial court's declaration of a mistrial following a hung jury is an event that terminates the original jeopardy.  Like the defendant, the Government is entitled to resolution of the case by the jury.  Pp.  468 U. S. 322-326.

of the Federal Reserve System
No. 82-1766
Argued March 21, 1984
Decided June 28, 1984
468 U.S. 137

Syllabus 
Section 16 of the Banking Act of 1933 (Act), commonly known as the Glass-Steagall Act, prohibits commercial banks from underwriting ""securities or stock,"" and  21 prohibits them from marketing ""stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or other securities.""  When Bankers Trust Co., a state commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, began serving as agent for several of its corporate customers and marketing their commercial paper, petitioners (a national securities industry trade association and a dealer in commercial paper) petitioned the Federal Reserve Board for a ruling that such activities were unlawful under  16 and 21.  Taking the position that, if a particular kind of financial instrument evidences a transaction that is more functionally similar to a traditional commercial banking operation than to an investment transaction, then the instrument should not be viewed as a ""security"" for purposes of the Act, the Board concluded that commercial paper more closely resembles a commercial hank loan than an investment transaction, and that it is not a ""security"" or ""note"" within the meaning of the Act, and hence falls outside its proscriptions.  The District Court disagreed, but the Court of Appeals deferred to the Board's interpretation and reversed the District Court's judgment.
Held:  Because commercial paper falls within the plain language of the Act, and because the inclusion of commercial paper within the terms of the Act is fully consistent with its purposes, commercial paper is a ""security"" under the Act, and therefore is subject to its proscriptions.  Pp.  468 U. S. 142-160.
(a) Although the Board's interpretation of the Act is entitled to substantial deference, this case presents considerations that counsel against giving full deference to that interpretation.  The Board at the administrative level took the position that commercial paper was not a ""security"" within the meaning of the Act, and that therefore it was unnecessary to examine the dangers that the Act was intended to eliminate, but before this Court, the Board insisted that Bankers Trust's activities involved none of such dangers.  Post hoc rationalizations by counsel for agency action are entitled to little deference.  Pp.  468 U. S. 142-144. 
Page 468 U. S. 138

(b) In enacting the Act, Congress' worries about commercial-bank involvement in investment bank activities reflected two general concerns.  The first of these concerns was that a commercial bank might experience large losses from investing its funds in speculative securities.  In addition to this concern, however, Congress focused on the conflicts of interest that arise when a commercial bank goes beyond the business of acting as a fiduciary or managing agent and develops a pecuniary interest in marketing securities.  The Act's design reflects the congressional perception that some commercial and investment banking activities are fundamentally incompatible, and justify a strong prophylaxis.  Pp.  468 U. S. 144-148.
(c) There is nothing in the language of either  16 or  21 to suggest a narrow reading of the word ""securities,"" i.e., that, because the word appears in a phrase that includes ""stocks, bonds, [and] debentures,"" the Act's prohibitions apply only to ""notes [and] other securities"" that resemble the enumerated instruments.  To the contrary, the breadth of the term ""securities"" is implicit in the fact that the antecedent language encompasses not only equity securities, but also securities representing debt.  While the Act does not define the terms ""notes"" or ""other securities,"" there is considerable evidence, particularly with respect to other Acts enacted at the same time that do define ""security"" to include commercial paper, to indicate that the ordinary meaning of the terms ""securities"" and ""notes"" as used in the Act encompasses commercial paper.  The Board's interpretation effectively converts a portion of the Act's broad prohibitions into a system of administrative regulation, since, by concluding that commercial paper is not covered by the Act, the Board in effect has obtained authority to regulate the marketing of commercial paper under its general supervisory power over member banks.  Pp.  468 U. S. 148-154.
(d) By focusing entirely on the nature of the financial instrument and ignoring the bank's role in the transaction, the Board's ""functional analysis"" misapprehends Congress' concerns with commercial bank involvement in marketing securities.  The facts that commercial paper is relatively low risk, that commercial banks traditionally have acquired commercial paper for their own accounts, or that commercial paper is sold largely to ""sophisticated"" investors, do not justify the Board's interpretation of the Act.  There is little evidence to suggest that Congress intended the Act's prohibitions on underwriting to depend on the safety of particular securities.  The authority to discount commercial paper is very different from the authority to underwrite it, and the Act admits of no exception to the prohibition on commercial bank underwriting according to the particular investment expertise of the customer.  Pp.  468 U. S. 154-160.

Syllabus 
To avoid conflicts of interest, an order of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (Department) required that proposed outside employment of members of the Florida Highway Patrol be approved by the Department.  Appellee, a Highway Patrol employee, originally received permission in 1977 to accept part-time employment with a County Sheriff's Office, but the permission was later revoked.  When appellee refused to quit his part-time job, the Director of the Highway Patrol, in 1977, ordered that appellee's employment with the Patrol be terminated.  While appellee's administrative appeal was pending, he and the Department settled the dispute, and he was reinstated.  But friction between appellee and his superiors continued, and he resigned in 1979 after he was suspended from the Patrol.  Appellee then filed the present suit against appellants, certain present and former officials of the Department and the Highway Patrol, seeking relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983.  He requested a declaration that appellants in 1977 had violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discharging him without a formal pretermination or a prompt post-termination hearing, and he sought an award of money damages.  Granting the requested relief, the court ultimately held that appellants had forfeited their qualified immunity from suit under  1983 because, even though appellee's due process rights were not ""clearly established"" at the time of his discharge in 1977, appellants had not followed administrative regulations in discharging appellee.  The court concluded that therefore appellants' belief in the legality of their conduct was unreasonable, and they were not entitled to qualified immunity.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  A plaintiff who seeks damages for violation of constitutional or statutory rights may overcome the defendant official's qualified immunity only by showing that those rights were clearly established at the time of the conduct at issue.  Appellee made no such showing.  Whether an official may prevail in his qualified immunity defense depends upon the objective reasonableness of his conduct as measured by reference to clearly established law.  No other circumstances are relevant to the issue of qualified immunity.  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800.   468 U. S. 190-197. 
Page 468 U. S. 184

(a) As the District Court recognized, there was authoritative precedent in the Circuit that the constitutional right of a state employee to a pretermination or a prompt post-termination hearing was not well established at the time of the conduct in question.  Nor was it unreasonable, under Fourteenth Amendment due process principles, for the Department to conclude that appellee had been provided with the fundamentals of due process.  Thus, the District Court correctly held that appellee demonstrated no violation of his clearly established constitutional rights.  Pp.  468 U. S. 191-193.
(b) Appellants did not forfeit their qualified immunity from suit for violation of federal constitutional rights merely because they failed to comply with a clear state regulation.  Appellee contended that an official's violation of a clear state statute or regulation, although not itself actionable under  1983, should deprive the official of qualified immunity from damages for violation of other statutory or constitutional provisions.  If such view were adopted, it would disrupt the proper balance between the interests in vindication of citizens' constitutional rights and in public officials' effective performance of their duties.  Nor would it always be fair, or sound policy, to demand official compliance with a statute or regulation on pain of money damages.  Officials are subject to a plethora of rules, often so voluminous, ambiguous, and contradictory, and in such flux that officials can comply with them only selectively.  In these circumstances, officials should not err always on the side of caution.  Pp. 468 U. S. 193-196.

Syllabus 
BankAmerica Corp. (BAC), a bank holding company, applied to the Federal Reserve Board (Board) for approval under  4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) to acquire a nonbanking affiliate corporation (Schwab) engaged in retail securities brokerage.  Section 4(c)(8) authorizes bank holding companies, with prior Board approval, to acquire stock in other companies that are engaged in nonbanking activities that the Board determines are ""so closely related to banking . . . as to be a proper incident thereto.""  Petitioner, a national trade association of securities brokers, opposed BAC's application and participated in the administrative hearings.  The Board authorized BAC to acquire Schwab, holding that a securities business, such as Schwab, that is essentially confined to the purchase and sale of securities for the account of third parties, without providing investment advice to the purchaser or seller, is ""closely related"" to banking within the meaning of  4(c)(8).  The Board also concluded that the acquisition would not violate  20 of the Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibits a bank (BAC's banking subsidiary here) from being affiliated with companies ""engaged principally in the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution"" of securities.  On petitioner's application for judicial review, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Board's order.
Held:  The Board has authority under  4(c)(8) of the BHC Act to authorize a bank holding company to acquire a nonbanking affiliate engaged principally in retail securities brokerage.  Pp.  468 U. S. 214-221.
(a) The Board's determination that a securities brokerage business that is essentially limited to the purchase and sale of securities for the account of customers, and without provision of investment advice to purchaser or seller, is ""closely related"" to banking, is consistent with the language and policies of the BHC Act.  There is no express requirement in  4(c)(8) that a proposed activity must facilitate other banking operations before it may be found to be ""closely related"" to banking.  The record substantially supports the Board's factual findings that Schwab's brokerage services were very similar to the types of services that are 
Page 468 U. S. 208
 generally provided by banks, and that banks are particularly well equipped to provide such services.  Pp.  468 U. S. 214-216.
(b) The Board's determination that a bank holding company's acquisition of such a brokerage business as Schwab's is not prohibited by  20 of the Glass-Steagall Act is reasonable, and supported by the statute's plain language and legislative history, and deserves the deference normally accorded the Board's construction of the banking laws.  The term ""public sale"" in  20 should be read to refer to the underwriting activity described by the terms that surround it, and to exclude the type of retail brokerage business in which Schwab principally was engaged.  This reading of the statute is further supported by the Board's similar longstanding interpretation of identical language found in another provision of the Glass-Steagall Act.  Moreover, the legislative history demonstrates that Congress enacted  20 to prohibit the affiliation of commercial banks with entities that are engaged principally in activities such as underwriting.  None of the hazards of underwriting is implicated by Schwab's brokerage activities.  Pp.  468 U. S. 216-221.
716 F.2d 92, affirmed.

 generally provided by banks, and that banks are particularly well equipped to provide such services.  Pp.  468 U. S. 214-216.
(b) The Board's determination that a bank holding company's acquisition of such a brokerage business as Schwab's is not prohibited by  20 of the Glass-Steagall Act is reasonable, and supported by the statute's plain language and legislative history, and deserves the deference normally accorded the Board's construction of the banking laws.  The term ""public sale"" in  20 should be read to refer to the underwriting activity described by the terms that surround it, and to exclude the type of retail brokerage business in which Schwab principally was engaged.  This reading of the statute is further supported by the Board's similar longstanding interpretation of identical language found in another provision of the Glass-Steagall Act.  Moreover, the legislative history demonstrates that Congress enacted  20 to prohibit the affiliation of commercial banks with entities that are engaged principally in activities such as underwriting.  None of the hazards of underwriting is implicated by Schwab's brokerage activities.  Pp.  468 U. S. 216-221.

Syllabus 
Treasury Department Regulation 201(b), first promulgated in 1963 as part of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, prohibits any transaction involving property in which Cuba, or any national thereof, has ""any interest of any nature whatsoever, direct or indirect.""  Regulation 560, which was added to the Regulations in 1977, embodied a general license permitting, for the most part, travel-related economic transactions with Cuba, thus exempting such transactions from Regulation 201(b)'s broad prohibition.  But in 1982, Regulation 560 was amended to curtail such general license by permitting only certain types of travel, such as official visits, news gathering, and visits to close relatives, and excluding general tourist and business travel.  At the time Regulation 201(b) was promulgated,  5(b) of the Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA) gave the President broad authority to impose comprehensive embargoes on foreign countries as one means of dealing with both peacetime emergencies and times of war.  The Cuban Assets Control Regulations constitute such an embargo.  Section 5(b) was amended in 1977 to limit the President's power under the TWEA to times of war, but at the same time, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) was enacted to cover the President's exercise of emergency economic powers in response to peacetime crises,  203 of that Act granting essentially the same authorities to the President as those in  5(b) of TWEA.  However, rather than requiring the President to declare a new national emergency in order to continue existing economic embargoes, such as that against Cuba, Congress enacted a grandfather clause providing that, notwithstanding the amendment to TWEA, the ""authorities conferred upon the President"" by  5(b), which were being exercised with respect to a country on July 1, 1977, as a result of a national emergency declared by the President before such date, ""may continue to be exercised.""  Respondents, American citizens who are inhibited from traveling to Cuba by Regulation 201(b), brought an action in Federal District Court, challenging the 1982 amendment to Regulation 560 and seeking a preliminary injunction against its enforcement.  The District Court refused to issue the injunction on the ground that respondents had not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.  The Court of 
Page 468 U. S. 223
 Appeals, holding that the challenged amendment lacked statutory authority, vacated the District Court's order and remanded with instructions to issue the injunction.
Held:
1. The grandfathered authorities of  5(b) of TWEA provide an adequate statutory basis for the challenged 1982 amendment to Regulation 560.  Pp.  468 U. S. 232-240.
(a) The language of the grandfather clause, read in conjunction with  5(b), supports the conclusion that, in the relevant sense, the ""authority"" to regulate all property transactions with Cuba, including travel-related transactions, was being exercised on July 1, 1977, and was, therefore preserved.  Since the authority to regulate travel-related transactions was among the ""authorities conferred upon the President"" by  5(b) that were ""being exercised"" with respect to Cuba on July 1, 1977, it follows from a natural reading of the grandfather clause that the authority to regulate such transactions ""may continue to be exercised"" with respect to Cuba after that date.  And since the President's authority under  5(b) to regulate by means of licenses includes the authority to ""prevent or prohibit"" as well as the authority to ""direct and compel,"" it also follows that the grandfather clause constitutes adequate statutory authority for the 1982 amendment of Regulation 560, the practical effect of which was to prevent travel to Cuba.  Pp.  468 U. S. 232-236.
(b) Neither the legislative history of the grandfather clause nor its purpose of keeping IEEPA and the amendments to TWEA from being too controversial supports the view that Congress meant to grandfather only those restrictions actually in place on July 1, 1977.  Eliminating the President's authority to modify existing licenses in response to heightened tensions with Cuba would have sparked just the sort of controversy the grandfather clause was designed to avoid.  Pp.  468 U. S. 236-240.
2. The restrictions on travel-related transactions with Cuba imposed by the 1982 amendment to Regulation 560 do not violate the freedom to travel protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Cf. Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S. 1.  Given the traditional deference to executive judgment in the realm of foreign policy, there is an adequate basis under the Due Process Clause to sustain the President's decision to curtail, by restricting travel, the flow of hard currency to Cuba that could be used in support of Cuban adventurism.

468 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
In 1969, respondent was convicted of first-degree murder in a North Carolina state court and sentenced to life imprisonment.  At trial, he had claimed lack of malice and self-defense, and, in accordance with well-settled North Carolina law, the trial judge instructed the jury that respondent had the burden of proving each of these defenses.  Although respondent appealed his conviction on several grounds, he did not challenge the constitutionality of this instruction.  In 1975, Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, struck down, as violative of due process, the requirement that the defendant bear the burden of proving lack of malice.  In 1977, Hankerson v. North Carolina, 432 U. S. 233, held that Mullaney was to have retroactive application.  Subsequently, after exhausting his state remedies, respondent brought a habeas corpus proceeding in Federal District Court under 28 U.S.C.  2254, challenging the jury instruction, but the court held that habeas relief was barred because respondent had failed to raise the issue on appeal as required by North Carolina law.  The Court of Appeals summarily affirmed, but this Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, and United States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152, both of which addressed the standard for procedural bars under  2254 whereby a state prisoner may not obtain federal habeas corpus relief absent a showing of ""cause and actual prejudice,"" when a procedural default bars litigation of a constitutional claim in state court.  On remand, the Court 
Page 468 U. S. 2
 of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent had satisfied the ""cause"" requirement because the Mullaney issue was so novel at the time of his state appeal that his attorney could not reasonably be expected to have raised it.  And the State conceded the existence of ""prejudice.""
Held:  Respondent had ""cause"" for failing to raise the Mullaney issue on appeal from his conviction.  Pp.  468 U. S. 9-20.
(a) Where, as in this case, a defendant has failed to abide by a State's procedural rule requiring the exercise of legal expertise and judgment, the competing concerns implicated by the exercise of a federal court's habeas corpus power -- on the one hand, Congress' interest in providing a federal forum for the vindication of state prisoners' constitutional rights and, on the other hand, the State's interest in the integrity of its rules and proceedings and the finality of its judgment -- have come to be embodied in the ""cause and prejudice"" requirement.  Pp.  468 U. S. 9-11.
(b) Where a constitutional claim is so novel that its legal basis is not reasonably available to counsel, a defendant has cause for his failure to raise the claim in accordance with applicable state procedures.  Pp.  468 U. S. 12-16.
(c) Here, the Mullaney issue was sufficiently novel at the time of respondent's appeal to excuse his attorney's failure to raise it at that time.

Syllabus 
Following an accident in which he lost control of his car and collided with a pickup truck, killing a passenger in the truck, respondent was charged with four misdemeanors -- reckless driving, driving while his license was revoked, driving on the wrong side of the road, and driving while intoxicated.  Upon being convicted of these charges in a Mississippi Justice of the Peace Court, he appealed, and the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for a trial de novo.  While the appeal was pending, he was indicted for manslaughter based on the same accident, and was convicted.  The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed, refusing respondent leave to pursue state postconviction remedies.  Respondent then brought a habeas corpus action in Federal District Court, which adopted a Magistrate's report holding that the manslaughter prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, and that substitution of a felony charge covering the conduct for which respondent had been convicted of the misdemeanors violated the Due Process Clause.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying solely on the double jeopardy ground.
Held:
1. The prosecution of respondent for manslaughter, following his invocation of his statutory right to appeal his misdemeanor convictions, was unconstitutional as a violation of due process.  Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S. 21.  The fact that the proceedings before the Justice of the Peace were the county prosecutor's responsibility, whereas the felony indictment was obtained by the District Attorney, who was then involved in the manslaughter trial, may not make inappropriate the presumption of unconstitutional vindictiveness arising from obtaining that indictment.  That presumption does not hinge on the continued involvement of a particular individual.  In any event, here the county prosecutor was the State's sole representative at the arraignment on the felony indictment and, as required by statute, assisted at the manslaughter trial.  Pp. 30-32.
2. Although the Court of Appeals and the petition for certiorari addressed only the double jeopardy issue, this Court, without deciding that issue, will decide the due process issue and not remand it to the Court of Appeals, where it was argued in both courts below, the State's opposition

Syllabus 
Respondents filed an action in a Maryland state court against petitioner officers of the state college where respondents were employed, claiming employment discrimination in violation of, inter alia, 42 U.S.C.  1981, 1983, 1985, and 1986 (Civil Rights Acts).  Petitioners removed the action to Federal District Court. Because the Civil Rights Acts contain no statute of limitations, the District Court borrowed a 6-month limitations period from a Maryland statute that establishes a procedure for administrative resolution of employment discrimination complaints, and granted petitioners' motion to dismiss the action because the complaint had been filed more than six months after respondents' causes of action had accrued.  The Court of Appeals found the 6-month period inappropriate, and, applying Maryland's 3-year statute of limitations for all civil actions for which a statutory limitation period is not otherwise provided, held that the action was not time-barred.
Held:  While federal courts properly turn to state law for statutes of limitations in actions under the Civil Rights Acts, borrowing the limitations period from an administrative employment discrimination statute was inappropriate.  Both the practical differences between litigation and an administrative proceeding and the divergence in the objectives of the federal causes of action and the state administrative procedure lead to this conclusion.  On the one hand, the practical difficulties facing an aggrieved person in an action under the Civil Rights Acts involve such matters as recognizing the constitutional dimensions of the claimed injury, obtaining counsel or preparing to proceed pro se, establishing the amount of damages, and preparing legal documents.  On the other hand, the sole responsibility of an aggrieved person who invokes the state administrative remedies is to make, sign, and file a complaint with the Human Relations Commission, which then has the burden of investigating and developing the case.  And the goals of the Civil Rights Acts to compensate persons whose civil rights have been violated and to prevent the abuse of state power are far different from the goals of the state administrative employment procedure.  The administrative scheme, including the short statute of limitations, encourages prompt identification, conciliation, and private settlement of employment disputes through the State Commission's intervention.

Syllabus 
Title 18 U.S.C.  1001 provides that
""[w]hoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully . . . makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements . . . shall be fined. . . .""
Respondent was convicted in Federal District Court of violating  1001 on the basis of false statements he furnished his defense contractor employer in connection with a Department of Defense security questionnaire.  At trial, respondent admitted having actual knowledge of the falsity of the statements, but requested a jury instruction requiring the Government to prove not only that he had actual knowledge of the falsity but also that he had actual knowledge that the statements were made in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency.  The District Court rejected this request and instead, over respondent's objection, instructed the jury that the Government must prove that respondent ""knew or should have known"" that the information was to be submitted to a federal agency.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court erred in failing to give respondent's requested instruction.
Held:  Both the plain language and legislative history of  1001 establish that proof of actual knowledge of federal agency jurisdiction is not required to obtain a conviction under the statute.  Pp.  468 U. S. 68-75.
(a) Any natural reading of  1001 establishes that the terms ""knowingly and willfully"" modify only the making of ""false, fictitious or fraudulent statements,"" and not the predicate circumstance that those statements be made in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency.  Once this is clear, there is no basis for requiring proof that the defendant had actual knowledge of federal agency jurisdiction.  Pp.  468 U. S. 68-70.
(b) The legislative history supports the plain language of the statute.  That Congress, when it amended the statute in 1934 and 1948, did not include any requirement that the prohibited conduct be undertaken with specific intent to deceive the Government, or with actual knowledge that false statements were made in a matter within federal agency jurisdiction, provides convincing evidence that the statute does not require actual knowledge of federal involvement.  Nor is there any support in the legislative history that the term ""knowingly and willfully"" modifies 
Page 468 U. S. 64
 the phrase ""in any matter within the jurisdiction of [a federal] agency.""  Pp.  468 U. S. 70-74.
(c) Respondent's argument that, absent proof of actual knowledge of federal agency jurisdiction,  1001 becomes a ""trap for the unwary,"" imposing criminal sanctions on innocent conduct, is not sufficient to overcome the express statutory language of  1001, and does not authorize this Court to amend the statute in a manner unintended by Congress.

Syllabus 
Section 4(a) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act) provides that ""[e]very employer shall be liable for and shall secure the payment to his employees"" of compensation payable under the Act, and further provides that,
""[i]n the case of an employer who is a subcontractor, the contractor shall be liable for and shall secure the payment of such compensation to employees of the subcontractor unless the subcontractor has secured such payment.""
Section 5(a) provides that the liability of an ""employer"" prescribed in  4 shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of ""such employer"" to the employee, except that, if an ""employer"" fails to secure payment of compensation as required by the Act, an injured employee may elect to claim compensation under the Act or to maintain an action at law or in admiralty for damages.  Petitioner, a general contractor governed by the Act and responsible for construction of a rapid transit system (Metro) for the District of Columbia and surrounding metropolitan area, purchased a comprehensive ""wrap-up"" workers' compensation insurance policy to cover all employees of subcontractors engaged in the construction of Metro.  Respondents, employees of subcontractors who had not secured their own workers' compensation insurance, after having obtained compensation awards from petitioner's insurer for work-related injuries, each brought a tort action against petitioner in Federal District Court to supplement such awards.  The court in each case awarded summary judgment to petitioner, holding that, by purchasing workers' compensation insurance for the employees of its subcontractors, petitioner had earned  5(a)'s immunity from tort suits brought for work-related injuries.  In a consolidated appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed, taking the view that  5(a)'s grant of immunity applies to a general contractor only if the contractor secures compensation after the subcontractor fails to do so.  The court therefore concluded that, since petitioner unilaterally purchased the ""wrap-up"" policy, and thus preempted its subcontractors, it was not entitled to  5(a)'s immunity.
Held:
1. Section 5(a)'s grant of immunity extends to general contractors.  While  5(a) speaks in terms of an ""employer"" and a general contractor 
Page 467 U. S. 926
 does not act as an employer of a subcontractor's employees, there is ample evidence in the use of the term ""employer"" elsewhere in the LHWCA to infer that Congress intended the term to include general contractors as well as direct employers.  This is particularly so with respect to  5(a), inasmuch as granting tort immunity to contractors who comply with  4(a) is consistent with the quid pro quo underlying workers' compensation statutes, whereby, in return for the guarantee of compensation, the employees surrender common law remedies against their employers for work-related injuries, while the employer, as a reward for securing compensation, is granted immunity from employee tort suits.  Pp.  467 U. S. 933-936.
2. A general contractor qualifies for  5(a) immunity as long as it does not fail to meet its obligations to secure compensation for subcontractor employees under  4(a).  Section 4(a) simply places on general contractors a contingent obligation to secure compensation whenever a subcontractor has failed to do so.  This is the most natural reading of  4(a).  Moreover, this reading furthers the underlying policy of the LHWCA to ensure that workers are not deprived of compensation coverage, and saves courts from the onerous task of determining when subcontractors have defaulted on their own statutory obligations.  Pp.  467 U. S. 936-940.
3. Based on the above interpretations of  4(a) and 5(a), petitioner was entitled to immunity from respondents' tort actions.  Far from failing to secure payment of compensation as required by the LHWCA, petitioner acted above and beyond its statutory obligation by purchasing the ""wrap-up"" insurance on behalf of all its subcontractors.

467 U.S. 947

Syllabus 
A Maryland statute prohibits a charitable organization, in connection with any fundraising activity, from paying expenses of more than 25% of the amount raised, but authorizes a waiver of this limitation where it would effectively prevent the organization from raising contributions.  Respondent is a professional fundraiser whose Maryland customers include various chapters of the Fraternal Order of Police, at least one of whom was reluctant to contract with respondent because of the statute's percentage limitation.  Respondent brought suit in a Maryland Circuit Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that it regularly charges an FOP chapter in excess of the 25% limitation, that petitioner Secretary of State had informed it that, if it refused to comply with the statute, it would be prosecuted, and that the statute violated its right to free speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Without addressing petitioner's argument that respondent lacked standing to assert its claims, the Circuit Court upheld the statute, and the Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed.  The Maryland Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent had standing to challenge the statute's facial validity, that the statute was unconstitutional, and that its flaws were not remedied by the waiver provision.
Held:
1. Respondent has standing to challenge the statute.  Not only does respondent satisfy the ""case"" or ""controversy"" requirement of Art. III, because it has suffered both threatened and actual injury as a result of the statute, but there also is no prudential reason against allowing respondent to challenge the statute.  Where the claim is that the statute is overly broad in violation of the First Amendment, the Court has allowed a party to assert the rights of another without regard to the ability of the other to assert his own claim. T he activity sought to be protected is at the heart of the business relationship between respondent and its customers, and respondent's interests in challenging the statute are completely consistent with the First Amendment interests of the charities it represents.  Petitioner's concern that respondent should not have standing to challenge the statute as overbroad because it has not demonstrated that the statute's overbreadth is ""substantial,"" is more properly 
Page 467 U. S. 948
 reserved for the determination of respondent's challenge on the merits.  Pp.  467 U. S. 954-959.
2. Regardless of the waiver provision, the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad, its percentage restriction on charitable solicitation being an unconstitutional limitation on protected First Amendment solicitation activity.  Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620.  Pp.  467 U. S. 959-970.
(a) The waiver provision does not save the statute.  Charitable organizations whose high solicitation and administrative costs are due to information dissemination, discussion, and advocacy of public issues, rather than to fraud, remain barred by the statute from carrying on those protected First Amendment activities.  Pp.  467 U. S. 962-964.
(b) This is not a ""substantial overbreadth"" case where the plaintiff must demonstrate that the statute ""as applied"" to him is unconstitutional.  Here there is no core of easily identifiable and constitutionally proscribable conduct that the statute prohibits.  The statute cannot distinguish organizations that have high fundraising costs not due to protected First Amendment activities from those that have high costs due to protected activity.  The flaw in the statute is not simply that it includes some impermissible applications, but that, in all its applications, it operates on a fundamentally mistaken premise that high solicitation costs are an accurate measure of fraud.  Where, as here, a statute imposes a direct restriction on protected First Amendment activity, and where the statute's defect is that the means chosen to accomplish the State's objectives are too imprecise, so that, in all its applications, the statute creates an unnecessary risk of chilling free speech, the statute is properly subject to facial attack.  Pp. 964-968.
(c) Whether the statute regulates before- or after-the-fact is immaterial.  Whether the charity is prevented from engaging in protected First Amendment activity by lack of a solicitation permit or by knowledge that its fundraising activity is illegal if it cannot satisfy the percentage limitation, the chill on the protected activity is the same.  The facts that the statute restricts only fundraising expenses, and not other expenses, and that a charity may elect whether to be bound by its fundraising percentage for the prior year or to apply the 25% limitation on a campaign-by-campaign basis, do nothing to alter the fact that the significant fundraising activity protected by the First Amendment is barred by the percentage limitation.  And the fact that the statute regulates all charitable fundraising, and not just door-to-door solicitation, does not remedy the fact that the statute promotes the State's interests only peripherally.  Pp. 968-970.

Syllabus 
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use data submitted by an applicant for registration of a covered product (hereinafter pesticide) in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant, and to disclose publicly some of the submitted data.  Under the data-consideration provisions of  3, as amended in 1978, applicants now are granted a 10-year period of exclusive use for data on new active ingredients contained in pesticides registered after September 30, 1978, while all other data submitted after December 31, 1969, may be cited and considered in support of another application for 15 years after the original submission if the applicant offers to compensate the original submitter.  If the parties cannot agree on the amount of compensation, either may initiate a binding arbitration proceeding, and if an original submitter refuses to participate in negotiations or arbitration, he forfeits his claim for compensation.  Data that do not qualify for either the 10-year period of exclusive use or the 15-year period of compensation may be considered by EPA without limitation.  Section 10, as amended in 1978, authorizes, in general, public disclosure of all health, safety, and environmental data even though it may result in disclosure of trade secrets.  Appellee, a company headquartered in Missouri, is an inventor, producer, and seller of pesticides, and invests substantial sums in developing active ingredients for pesticides and in producing end-use products that combine such ingredients with inert ingredients.  Appellee brought suit in Federal District Court for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging, inter alia, that the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA effected a ""taking"" of property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and that the data-consideration provisions violated the Amendment because they effected a taking of property for a private, rather than a public, purpose.  The District Court held that the challenged provisions of FIFRA are unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined EPA from implementing or enforcing those provisions. 
Page 467 U. S. 987

Held:
1. To the extent that appellee has an interest in its health, safety, and environmental data cognizable as a trade secret property right under Missouri law, that property right is protected by the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Despite their intangible nature, trade secrets have many of the characteristics of more traditional forms of property.  Moreover, this Court has found other kinds of intangible interests to be property for purposes of the Clause.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1000-1004.
2. EPA's consideration or disclosure of data submitted by appellee prior to October 22, 1972, or after September 30, 1978, does not effect a taking, but EPA's consideration or disclosure of certain health, safety, and environmental data constituting a trade secret under state law and submitted by appellee between those two dates may constitute a taking under certain conditions.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1004-1014.
(a) A factor for consideration in determining whether a governmental action short of acquisition or destruction of property has gone beyond proper ""regulation"" and effects a ""taking"" is whether the action interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations.  With respect to any health, safety, and environmental data that appellee submitted to EPA after the effective date of the 1978 FIFRA amendments (October 1, 1978), appellee could not have had a reasonable, investment-backed expectation that EPA would keep the data confidential beyond the limits prescribed in the amended statute itself.  As long as appellee is aware of the conditions under which the data are submitted, and the conditions are rationally related to a legitimate Government interest, a voluntary submission of data in exchange for the economic advantages of a registration can hardly be called a taking.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1005-1008.
(b) Prior to its amendment in 1972 (effective October 22, 1972), FIFRA was silent with respect to EPA's authorized use and disclosure of data submitted to it in connection with an application for registration.  Although the Trade Secrets Act provides a criminal penalty for a Government employee who discloses, in a manner not authorized by law, any trade secret information revealed to him during the course of his official duties, it is not a guarantee of confidentiality to submitters of data, and, absent an express promise, appellee had no reasonable, investment-backed expectation that its information submitted to EPA before October 22, 1972, would remain inviolate in the EPA's hands.  The possibility was substantial that the Federal Government at some future time would find disclosure to be in the public interest.  A fortiori, the Trade Secrets Act, which penalizes only unauthorized disclosure, cannot be construed as any sort of assurance against internal agency 
Page 467 U. S. 988
 use of submitted data during consideration of the application of a subsequent applicant for registration.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1008-1010.
(c) However, under the statutory scheme in effect between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978, a submitter was given an opportunity to protect its trade secrets from disclosure by designating them as trade secrets at the time of submission.  The explicit governmental guarantee to registration applicants of confidentiality and exclusive use with respect to trade secrets during this period formed the basis of a reasonable investment-backed expectation.  If EPA, consistent with current provisions of FIFRA, were now to disclose such trade secret data or consider those data in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant in a manner not authorized by the version of FIFRA in effect between 1972 and 1978, its actions would frustrate appellee's reasonable investment-backed expectation.  If, however, arbitration pursuant to FIFRA were to yield just compensation for the loss in the market value of appellee's trade secret data suffered because of EPA's consideration of the data in connection with another application (no arbitration having yet occurred), then appellee would have no claim against the Government for a taking.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1010-1014.
3. Any taking of private property that may occur in connection with EPA's use of data submitted to it by appellee between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978, is a taking for a ""public use,"" rather than for a ""private use,"" even though subsequent applicants may be the most direct beneficiaries.  So long as a taking has a conceivable public character, the means by which it will be attained is for Congress to determine.  Congress believed that the data-consideration provisions would eliminate costly duplication of research and streamline the registration process, making new end-use products available to consumers more quickly.  Such a procompetitive purpose is within Congress' police power.  With regard to FIFRA's data-disclosure provisions, the optimum amount of disclosure to assure the public that a product is safe and effective is to be determined by Congress, not the courts.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1014-1016.
4. A Tucker Act remedy is available to provide appellee with just compensation for any taking of property that may occur as a result of FIFRA's data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions, and thus the District Court erred in enjoining EPA from acting under those provisions.  Neither FIFRA nor its legislative history discusses the interaction between FIFRA and the Tucker Act, and inferring a withdrawal of Tucker Act jurisdiction would amount to a disfavored partial repeal by implication of the Tucker Act.  FIFRA's provision that an original submitter of data forfeits his right to compensation from a later submitter for the use of the original submitter's data if he fails to participate in, or comply with the terms of, a negotiated or arbitrated 
Page 467 U. S. 989
 compensation settlement merely requires a claimant to first seek satisfaction through FIFRA's procedure before asserting a Tucker Act claim.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1016-1019.
5. Because the Tucker Act is available as a remedy for any uncompensated taking appellee may suffer as a result of the operation of the challenged provisions of FIFRA, appellee's challenges to the constitutionality of the arbitration and compensation scheme of FIFRA are not ripe for resolution.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1019-1020.

No. 83-196
Argued February 27, 1984
Decided June 26, 1984
467 U.S. 986

Syllabus 
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use data submitted by an applicant for registration of a covered product (hereinafter pesticide) in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant, and to disclose publicly some of the submitted data.  Under the data-consideration provisions of  3, as amended in 1978, applicants now are granted a 10-year period of exclusive use for data on new active ingredients contained in pesticides registered after September 30, 1978, while all other data submitted after December 31, 1969, may be cited and considered in support of another application for 15 years after the original submission if the applicant offers to compensate the original submitter.  If the parties cannot agree on the amount of compensation, either may initiate a binding arbitration proceeding, and if an original submitter refuses to participate in negotiations or arbitration, he forfeits his claim for compensation.  Data that do not qualify for either the 10-year period of exclusive use or the 15-year period of compensation may be considered by EPA without limitation.  Section 10, as amended in 1978, authorizes, in general, public disclosure of all health, safety, and environmental data even though it may result in disclosure of trade secrets.  Appellee, a company headquartered in Missouri, is an inventor, producer, and seller of pesticides, and invests substantial sums in developing active ingredients for pesticides and in producing end-use products that combine such ingredients with inert ingredients.  Appellee brought suit in Federal District Court for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging, inter alia, that the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA effected a ""taking"" of property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and that the data-consideration provisions violated the Amendment because they effected a taking of property for a private, rather than a public, purpose.  The District Court held that the challenged provisions of FIFRA are unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined EPA from implementing or enforcing those provisions. 
Page 467 U. S. 987

Held:
1. To the extent that appellee has an interest in its health, safety, and environmental data cognizable as a trade secret property right under Missouri law, that property right is protected by the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Despite their intangible nature, trade secrets have many of the characteristics of more traditional forms of property.  Moreover, this Court has found other kinds of intangible interests to be property for purposes of the Clause.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1000-1004.
2. EPA's consideration or disclosure of data submitted by appellee prior to October 22, 1972, or after September 30, 1978, does not effect a taking, but EPA's consideration or disclosure of certain health, safety, and environmental data constituting a trade secret under state law and submitted by appellee between those two dates may constitute a taking under certain conditions.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1004-1014.
(a) A factor for consideration in determining whether a governmental action short of acquisition or destruction of property has gone beyond proper ""regulation"" and effects a ""taking"" is whether the action interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations.  With respect to any health, safety, and environmental data that appellee submitted to EPA after the effective date of the 1978 FIFRA amendments (October 1, 1978), appellee could not have had a reasonable, investment-backed expectation that EPA would keep the data confidential beyond the limits prescribed in the amended statute itself.  As long as appellee is aware of the conditions under which the data are submitted, and the conditions are rationally related to a legitimate Government interest, a voluntary submission of data in exchange for the economic advantages of a registration can hardly be called a taking.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1005-1008.
(b) Prior to its amendment in 1972 (effective October 22, 1972), FIFRA was silent with respect to EPA's authorized use and disclosure of data submitted to it in connection with an application for registration.  Although the Trade Secrets Act provides a criminal penalty for a Government employee who discloses, in a manner not authorized by law, any trade secret information revealed to him during the course of his official duties, it is not a guarantee of confidentiality to submitters of data, and, absent an express promise, appellee had no reasonable, investment-backed expectation that its information submitted to EPA before October 22, 1972, would remain inviolate in the EPA's hands.  The possibility was substantial that the Federal Government at some future time would find disclosure to be in the public interest.  A fortiori, the Trade Secrets Act, which penalizes only unauthorized disclosure, cannot be construed as any sort of assurance against internal agency

 use of submitted data during consideration of the application of a subsequent applicant for registration.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1008-1010.
(c) However, under the statutory scheme in effect between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978, a submitter was given an opportunity to protect its trade secrets from disclosure by designating them as trade secrets at the time of submission.  The explicit governmental guarantee to registration applicants of confidentiality and exclusive use with respect to trade secrets during this period formed the basis of a reasonable investment-backed expectation.  If EPA, consistent with current provisions of FIFRA, were now to disclose such trade secret data or consider those data in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant in a manner not authorized by the version of FIFRA in effect between 1972 and 1978, its actions would frustrate appellee's reasonable investment-backed expectation.  If, however, arbitration pursuant to FIFRA were to yield just compensation for the loss in the market value of appellee's trade secret data suffered because of EPA's consideration of the data in connection with another application (no arbitration having yet occurred), then appellee would have no claim against the Government for a taking.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1010-1014.
3. Any taking of private property that may occur in connection with EPA's use of data submitted to it by appellee between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978, is a taking for a ""public use,"" rather than for a ""private use,"" even though subsequent applicants may be the most direct beneficiaries.

Syllabus 
After a jury trial in a Pennsylvania state court in 1966, respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and rape, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.  However, on direct appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the police had violated respondent's constitutional rights in securing confessions that had been admitted in evidence, and remanded the case for a new trial.  Before and during an extensive voir dire examination of potential jurors at the second trial in 1970, respondent moved for a change of venue, arguing that publicity concerning the case had resulted in dissemination of prejudicial information that could not be eradicated from the potential jurors' minds.  The trial court denied the motions, and respondent was convicted again of first-degree murder.  He was resentenced to life imprisonment, and the trial court denied a motion for a new trial, finding that practically no publicity had been given to the case between the two trials, that little public interest was shown during the second trial, and that the jury was without bias.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and the trial court's findings.  Respondent then sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, claiming that his conviction had been obtained in violation of his right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to a fair trial by an impartial jury.  Upholding the state trial court's view that the jury was impartial, the District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  Relying primarily on Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, the court found that pretrial publicity had made a fair trial impossible in the county.
Held:
1. The voir dire testimony and the record of publicity do not reveal the kind of ""wave of public passion"" that would have made a fair trial unlikely by the empaneled jury as a whole.  Although Irvin v. Dowd, supra, held that adverse publicity can create such a presumption of prejudice in a community that the jurors' claims that they can be impartial should not be believed, it also recognized that the trial court's findings of impartiality may be overturned only for ""manifest error.""  In this case, the extensive adverse publicity and the community's sense of outrage were at their height prior to respondent's first trial.  The record shows that prejudicial publicity was greatly diminished and community sentiment 
Page 467 U. S. 1026
 ment had softened when the jury for the second trial was selected four years later.  Thus the trial court did not commit manifest error in finding that the jury as a whole was impartial.  Potential jurors who had retained fixed opinions as to respondent's guilt were disqualified, and the fact that the great majority of veniremen ""remembered the case,"" without more, is essentially irrelevant.  The relevant question is whether the jurors at respondent's second trial had such fixed opinions that they could not judge impartially respondent's guilt.  The passage of time between the first and second trials clearly rebutted any presumption of partiality or prejudice that existed at the time of the initial trial.  Pp.  467 U. S. 1031-1035.
2. There is no merit in respondent's argument that one of the selected jurors, as well as the two alternates, had been erroneously seated over his challenges for cause.  The ambiguity in the testimony of the cited jurors was insufficient to overcome the presumption of correctness, under 28 U.S.C.  2254(d), owed to the trial court's findings.  The question of an individual juror's partiality is plainly one of historical fact, and there is fair support in the record for the state courts' conclusion that the jurors here would be impartial.

Syllabus 
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 impose certain requirements on States that have not achieved the national air quality standards established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to earlier legislation, including the requirement that such ""nonattainment"" States establish a permit program regulating ""new or modified major stationary sources"" of air pollution.  Generally, a permit may not be issued for such sources unless stringent conditions are met.  EPA regulations promulgated in 1981 to implement the permit requirement allow a State to adopt a plantwide definition of the term ""stationary source,"" under which an existing plant that contains several pollution-emitting devices may install or modify one piece of equipment without meeting the permit conditions if the alteration will not increase the total emissions from the plant, thus allowing a State to treat all of the pollution-emitting devices within the same industrial grouping as though they were encased within a single ""bubble.""  Respondents filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals, which set aside the regulations embodying the ""bubble concept"" as contrary to law.  Although recognizing that the amended Clean Air Act does not explicitly define what Congress envisioned as a ""stationary source"" to which the permit program should apply, and that the issue was not squarely addressed in the legislative history, the court concluded that, in view of the purpose of the nonattainment program to improve, rather than merely maintain, air quality, a plantwide definition was ""inappropriate,"" while stating it was mandatory in programs designed to maintain existing air quality.
Held:  The EPA's plantwide definition is a permissible construction of the statutory term ""stationary source.""  Pp.  467 U. S. 842-866.
(a) With regard to judicial review of an agency's construction of the statute which it administers, if Congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue, the question for the court is whether the 
Page 467 U. S. 838
 agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.  Pp.  467 U. S. 842-845.
(b) Examination of the legislation and its history supports the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Congress did not have a specific intention as to the applicability of the ""bubble concept"" in these cases.  Pp.  467 U. S. 845-851.
(c) The legislative history of the portion of the 1977 Amendments dealing with nonattainment areas plainly discloses that, in the permit program, Congress sought to accommodate the conflict between the economic interest in permitting capital improvements to continue and the environmental interest in improving air quality.  Pp.  467 U. S. 851-853.
(d) Prior to the 1977 Amendments, the EPA had used a plantwide definition of the term ""source,"" but in 1980, the EPA ultimately adopted a regulation that, in essence, applied the basic reasoning of the Court of Appeals here, precluding use of the ""bubble concept"" in nonattainment States' programs designed to enhance air quality.  However, when a new administration took office in 1981, the EPA, in promulgating the regulations involved here, reevaluated the various arguments that had been advanced in connection with the proper definition of the term ""source"" and concluded that the term should be given the plantwide definition in nonattainment areas.  Pp.  467 U. S. 853-859.
(e) Parsing the general terms in the text of the amended Clean Air Act -- particularly the provisions of  302(j) and 111(a)(3) pertaining to the definition of ""source"" -- does not reveal any actual intent of Congress as to the issue in these cases.  To the extent any congressional ""intent"" can be discerned from the statutory language, it would appear that the listing of overlapping, illustrative terms was intended to enlarge, rather than to confine, the scope of the EPA's power to regulate particular sources in order to effectuate the policies of the Clean Air Act.  Similarly, the legislative history is consistent with the view that the EPA should have broad discretion in implementing the policies of the 1977 Amendments.  The plantwide definition is fully consistent with the policy of allowing reasonable economic growth, and the EPA has advanced a reasonable explanation for its conclusion that the regulations serve environmental objectives as well.  The fact that the EPA has from time to time changed its interpretation of the term ""source"" does not lead to the conclusion that no deference should be accorded the EPA's interpretation of the statute.  An agency, to engage in informed rulemaking, must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis.  Policy arguments concerning the ""bubble concept"" should be addressed to legislators or administrators, not to judges.  The EPA's interpretation of the statute here represents a reasonable accommodation of manifestly competing interests, and is entitled to deference.  Pp.  467 U. S. 859-866.

(d) Prior to the 1977 Amendments, the EPA had used a plantwide definition of the term ""source,"" but in 1980, the EPA ultimately adopted a regulation that, in essence, applied the basic reasoning of the Court of Appeals here, precluding use of the ""bubble concept"" in nonattainment States' programs designed to enhance air quality.  However, when a new administration took office in 1981, the EPA, in promulgating the regulations involved here, reevaluated the various arguments that had been advanced in connection with the proper definition of the term ""source"" and concluded that the term should be given the plantwide definition in nonattainment areas.  Pp.  467 U. S. 853-859.
(e) Parsing the general terms in the text of the amended Clean Air Act -- particularly the provisions of  302(j) and 111(a)(3) pertaining to the definition of ""source"" -- does not reveal any actual intent of Congress as to the issue in these cases.  To the extent any congressional ""intent"" can be discerned from the statutory language, it would appear that the listing of overlapping, illustrative terms was intended to enlarge, rather than to confine, the scope of the EPA's power to regulate particular sources in order to effectuate the policies of the Clean Air Act.  Similarly, the legislative history is consistent with the view that the EPA should have broad discretion in implementing the policies of the 1977 Amendments.  The plantwide definition is fully consistent with the policy of allowing reasonable economic growth, and the EPA has advanced a reasonable explanation for its conclusion that the regulations serve environmental objectives as well.  The fact that the EPA has from time to time changed its interpretation of the term ""source"" does not lead to the conclusion that no deference should be accorded the EPA's interpretation of the statute.  An agency, to engage in informed rulemaking, must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis.  Policy arguments concerning the ""bubble concept"" should be addressed to legislators or administrators, not to judges.  The EPA's interpretation of the statute here represents a reasonable accommodation of manifestly competing interests, and is entitled to deference.  Pp.  467 U. S. 859-866.

No. 83-185
Argued March 19, 1984
Decided June 25, 1984
467 U.S. 867

Syllabus 
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brought an action in Federal District Court against respondent Federal Reserve Bank, alleging that one of respondent's branches (the Bank) violated  703(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by engaging in employment discrimination based on race during a specified time period.  Subsequently, four of the Bank's employees (the Cooper petitioners) were allowed to intervene as plaintiffs, and they alleged that the Bank's employment practices violated 42 U.S.C.  1981, as well as Title VII, and that they could adequately represent a class of black employees against whom the Bank had discriminated.  The District Court then certified the class pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and (3), and ordered that notice be given to the class members.  Among the recipients of the notice were the Baxter petitioners.  At the trial, both the Cooper petitioners and the Baxter petitioners testified, and the District Court held that the Bank had engaged in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination with respect to employees in certain specified pay grades, but not with respect to employees above those grades, and found that the Bank had discriminated against two of the Cooper petitioners, but not against the others.  Thereafter, the Baxter petitioners moved to intervene, but the District Court denied the motion on the ground, as to one petitioner, that since she was a member of the class to which relief had been ordered, her rights would be protected in the later relief stage of the proceedings, and, as to the other petitioners, on the ground that they were employed in jobs above the specified grades for which relief would be granted.  These latter Baxter petitioners then filed a separate action against the Bank in the District Court, alleging that each of them had been denied a promotion because of their race in violation of 42 U.S.C.  1981.  The District Court denied the Bank's motion to dismiss but certified its order for interlocutory appeal, which was then consolidated with the Bank's pending appeal in the class action.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the merits in the class action, holding that there was insufficient evidence to establish a pattern or practice of racial discrimination in the specified grades, and that none of the Cooper petitioners had been discriminated against.  The court further held that, under 
Page 467 U. S. 868
 the doctrine of res judicata, the judgment in the class action precluded the Baxter petitioners from maintaining their individual claims against the Bank.
Held:  The Baxter petitioners are not precluded from maintaining their separate action against the Bank.  While the Court of Appeals was correct in generally concluding that the Baxter petitioners, as members of the class represented in the class action, were bound by the adverse judgment in that action, the court erred on the preclusive effect it attached to that judgment.  The judgment bars the class members from bringing another class action against the Bank alleging a pattern or practice of racial discrimination for the same time period, and precludes the class members in any other litigation with the Bank from relitigating the question whether the Bank engaged in such a pattern or practice of racial discrimination during that same time period.  But the judgment is not dispositive of the individual claims of the Baxter petitioners.  Assuming that they establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the Bank will be required to articulate a legitimate reason for each of the challenged employment decisions, and, if it meets that burden, the ultimate question regarding motivation in the Baxter petitioners' individual cases will be resolved by the District Court.  Permitting the Baxter petitioners to bring a separate action will not frustrate the purposes of Rule 23.  To deny such permission would be tantamount to requiring that every class member be permitted to intervene to litigate the merits of his individual claim.  Moreover, whether the issues framed by the named parties should be expanded to encompass the individual claims of additional class members is a matter that should be decided in the first instance by the District Court.  Nothing in Rule 23 requires that the District Court make a finding with respect to each and every matter on which there is testimony in a class action.  Rule 23's purpose in providing a mechanism for the expeditious decision of common questions might be defeated by an attempt to decide a host of individual claims before any common question relating to liability has been resolved adversely to the defendant.

|467 u.s. 883|"Sure-Tan, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board
No. 82-945
Argued December 6, 1983
Decided June 25, 1984
467 U.S. 883

Syllabus 
A certain union was elected as the collective bargaining representative of employees of petitioners, two small firms that constitute a single integrated employer for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  Petitioners then filed objections to the election with the National Labor Relations Board (Board), asserting that six of the seven eligible voters were illegal aliens.  After being notified that their objections were overruled, petitioners' president sent a letter to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) asking that it check into the status of a number of petitioners' employees.  As a result of the INS's investigation, five employees voluntarily left the country to avoid deportation.  Subsequently, the Board held that petitioners had committed an unfair labor practice, in violation of  8(a)(3) of the NLRA, by reporting their employees, known to be undocumented aliens, to the INS in retaliation for the employees' union activities.  Concluding that petitioners' conduct constituted a ""constructive discharge"" of the employees, the Board entered a cease-and-desist order, and directed the ""conventional remedy of reinstatement with backpay,"" thereby leaving until subsequent compliance proceedings the determination whether the employees had in fact been available for work so as not to toll petitioners' backpay liability.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order as modified by the court to require that petitioners' reinstatement offers to the employees be left open for a period of four years to allow them a reasonable time to make arrangements for legal reentry, and that the offers be written in Spanish and delivered so as to allow for verification of receipt.  Although recognizing that the employees would not be entitled to backpay for the period when they were not legally entitled to be present and employed in the United States, the court decided that it would serve the NLRA's policies to set a minimum amount of backpay that petitioners must pay in any event, and suggested that the Board consider whether six months' backpay would be an appropriate amount.  The Board accepted the suggestion, and its final order, approved by the court, included the minimum award of six months' backpay. 
Page 467 U. S. 884

Held:
1. The Board's interpretation of the NLRA as applying to unfair labor practices committed against undocumented aliens is reasonable, and thus will be upheld.  Pp.  467 U. S. 891-894.
(a) The NLRA's terms -- defining ""employee"" to include ""any employee,"" and not listing undocumented aliens among the few groups of specifically exempted workers -- fully support the Board's interpretation.  Similarly, extending the NLRA's coverage to undocumented aliens is consistent with its purpose of encouraging and protecting the collective bargaining process.  Pp.  467 U. S. 891-892.
(b) There is no conflict between application of the NLRA to undocumented aliens and the mandate of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which does not make the employment relationship between an employer and an undocumented alien unlawful.  Enforcement of the NLRA with respect to undocumented alien employees is compatible with the INA's purpose in restricting immigration so as to preserve jobs for American workers, since, if there is no advantage as to wages and employment conditions in preferring illegal alien workers, any incentive for employers to hire illegal aliens is lessened.  In turn, if the demand for undocumented aliens declines, there may then be fewer incentives for aliens themselves to enter in violation of the federal immigration laws.  Pp.  467 U. S. 892-894.
2. The Court of Appeals properly held that petitioners committed an unfair labor practice under  8(a)(3) of the NLRA by constructively discharging their undocumented alien employees through reporting the employees to the INS in retaliation for participating in union activities.  There is no merit in petitioners' contention that, although they acted with ""anti-union animus,"" nevertheless their conduct did not force the undocumented alien workers' departure from the country, and that the employees' status as illegal aliens instead was the ""proximate cause"" of their departure.  The evidence showed that the letter of petitioners' president to the INS was the sole cause of the investigation that resulted in the employees' departure, and that the president foresaw precisely this result.  Although the reporting of any violation of the criminal laws ordinarily should be encouraged, not penalized, the Board's view that  8(a)(3) is violated only when the evidence establishes that the reporting of the presence of an illegal alien employee is in retaliation for the employee's protected union activity is consistent with the policies of both the INA and the NLRA.  Nor is there merit in petitioners' claim that their request for enforcement of the federal immigration laws was an aspect of their First Amendment right ""to petition the Government for a redress of grievances,"" and therefore could not be burdened under the guise of enforcing the NLRA.  Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U. S. 731, distinguished.  Pp.  467 U. S. 894-898. 
Page 467 U. S. 885

3. The Court of Appeals erred in its modification of the Board's remedial order.  Pp.  467 U. S. 898-906.
(a) By directing the Board to impose a minimum backpay award without regard to the employees' actual economic losses or legal availability for work, the court exceeded its limited authority of review under the NLRA, and also effectively compelled the Board to take action that does not lie within the Board's powers.  A backpay remedy must be tailored to expunge only actual, not speculative, consequences of an unfair labor practice.  The probable unavailability of the Act's more effective remedies in light of the practical workings of the immigration laws cannot justify the judicial arrogation of remedial authority not fairly encompassed within the NLRA.  Pp.  467 U. S. 898-905.
(b) The Court of Appeals also exceeded its limited authority of judicial review by modifying the Board's order so as to require petitioners to draft the reinstatement offers in Spanish and to ensure verification of receipt.  Such matters call for the Board's superior expertise and long experience in handling specific details of remedial relief, and if the court believed that the Board had erred in failing to impose such requirements, the appropriate course was to remand to the Board for reconsideration.  The court's requirement that the reinstatement offers be held open for four years is vulnerable to similar attack.  Pp.  467 U. S. 905-906.

No. 82-1988
Argued February 22, 1984
Decided June 25, 1984
467 U.S. 914

Syllabus 
Petitioner Tower, the Douglas County, Ore., Public Defender, represented respondent at a state robbery trial that resulted in respondent's conviction, and petitioner Babcock, the Oregon State Public Defender, represented respondent in his unsuccessful appeal from this and at least one other conviction.  Subsequently, respondent filed in state court a petition for postconviction relief, seeking to have his conviction set aside on the ground that petitioners had conspired with various state officials, including the trial and appellate court judges and the former Attorney General, to secure respondent's conviction.  On the following day, respondent filed the instant action against petitioners in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, seeking only to recover punitive damages on the basis of factual allegations that were identical to those made in the state court petition.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss the  1983 action, holding that public defenders are absolutely immune from  1983 liability, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for trial.  Prior to the Court of Appeals' decision, the state court proceedings came to trial and resulted in a finding that there had been no conspiracy to convict respondent.
Held:
1. Respondent's complaint adequately alleges conduct ""under color of "" state law for purposes of  1983, in view of the conspiracy allegations.  Although appointed counsel in a state criminal prosecution does not act ""under color of "" state law in the normal course of conducting the defense, Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, an otherwise private person acts ""under color of"" state law when engaged in a conspiracy with state officials to deprive another of federal rights, Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U. S. 24. Pp. 919-920.
2. State public defenders are not immune from liability under  1983 for intentional misconduct by virtue of alleged conspiratorial action with state officials that deprives their clients of federal rights.  For purposes of  1983, immunities are predicated upon a considered inquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevant official at common law and the interests behind it.  No immunity for public defenders, as such, existed at common law in 1871, when  1983's predecessor was enacted, because there was no such office in existence at that time.  Although a 
Page 467 U. S. 915
 public defender has a reasonably close ""cousin"" in the English barrister, and although barristers enjoyed in the 19th century and still enjoy a broad immunity from liability for negligent misconduct, nevertheless barristers have never enjoyed immunity from liability for intentional misconduct.  In this country, the public defender's only 19th-century counterpart was a privately retained lawyer, and such a lawyer would not have enjoyed immunity from tort liability for intentional misconduct such as that allegedly involved here.  Nor is immunity warranted on the asserted ground that public defenders have responsibilities similar to those of a judge or prosecutor, and should enjoy similar immunities in order, ultimately, not to impair the State's attempt to meet its constitutional obligation to furnish criminal defendants with effective counsel, and in order to prevent inundation of the federal courts with frivolous lawsuits.  It is for Congress to determine whether  1983 litigation has become too burdensome to state or federal institutions and, if so, what remedial action is appropriate.  Pp.  467 U. S. 920-923.
3. It is open to the District Court on remand to consider whether respondent is now collaterally estopped in this action by the state court's finding that the alleged conspiracy never occurred.  Pp.  467 U. S. 923-924.

Page 467 U. S. 915
 public defender has a reasonably close ""cousin"" in the English barrister, and although barristers enjoyed in the 19th century and still enjoy a broad immunity from liability for negligent misconduct, nevertheless barristers have never enjoyed immunity from liability for intentional misconduct.  In this country, the public defender's only 19th-century counterpart was a privately retained lawyer, and such a lawyer would not have enjoyed immunity from tort liability for intentional misconduct such as that allegedly involved here.  Nor is immunity warranted on the asserted ground that public defenders have responsibilities similar to those of a judge or prosecutor, and should enjoy similar immunities in order, ultimately, not to impair the State's attempt to meet its constitutional obligation to furnish criminal defendants with effective counsel, and in order to prevent inundation of the federal courts with frivolous lawsuits.  It is for Congress to determine whether  1983 litigation has become too burdensome to state or federal institutions and, if so, what remedial action is appropriate.  Pp.  467 U. S. 920-923.
3. It is open to the District Court on remand to consider whether respondent is now collaterally estopped in this action by the state court's finding that the alleged conspiracy never occurred.  Pp.  467 U. S. 923-924.

 Luis GARCIAv. ILLINOIS.No. 83-5933. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 25, 1984. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was charged with committing a variety of crimes with an accomplice, including four murders. He was convicted, sentenced to death, and his conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Illinois. 97 Ill.2d 58, 73 Ill.Dec. 414, 454 N.E.2d 274 (1983). 
 According to the Supreme Court of Illinois, the jurors were instructed that they could return guilty verdicts on the charges against petitioner ""if they found that [he] had actually committed the crimes, or, alternatively, if they found that he was legally responsible for the conduct of the perpetrator under the Illinois accountability statute."" Id., at 83, 73 Ill.Dec., at 424, 454 N.E.2d, at 284.a1 The Illinois Supreme Court concluded that the general verdict returned by the jury failed ""to reveal whether the jury found him guilty of actually killing anyone or whether he was convicted on the basis of accountability."" Id., at 84, 73 Ill.Dec., at 424, 454 N.E.2d, at 284. The Illinois Supreme Court held, however, that ""[e]ven if we were to assume that [petitioner's] murder convictions rested in part or completely on a theory of accountability, the imposition of the death sentence under the circumstances present here was permissible."" Ibid. The death sentence would be permissible because, in the eyes of the Illinois Supreme Court, ""the uncontroverted evidence presented at trial concerning [petitioner's] conduct . . . clearly demonstrates that [petitioner] intended that lethal force would be employed."" Id., at 85, 73 Ill.Dec., at 425, 424 N.E.2d, at 285. [ Garcia v. Illinois 467 U.S. 1260 (1984) ][1260-Continued.] 
 The Illinois Supreme Court was compelled to make this finding in order to preserve the State's imposition of the death penalty upon petitioner. The compulsion derived from this Court's decision in Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782 (1982). In Enmund this Court recognized ""[s]ociety's rejection of the death penalty for accomplice liability in felony murders,"" id., at 794, by holding that the Eighth Amendment as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits States from imposing the death penalty in the absence of a finding that a participant in a felony murder 
Page 467 U.S. 1260 , 1261
 either killed, or attempted to kill, or intended that a killing take place or that lethal force be employed. Id., at 797. Here, the jury made no explicit finding that petitioner engaged in the conduct or possessed the intent which, under Enmund, is required for a valid death sentence. Rather, the Illinois Supreme Court supplied this finding. 
 The action taken by the Illinois Supreme Court contradicts this Court's insistence, articulated in Enmund, that capital punishment be tailored to a defendant's own personal responsibility and moral guilt. That tailoring was forsaken here when the jury returned a general verdict that failed to reveal whether petitioner had been convicted for murders he had actually committed himself or whether he had been convicted solely on the basis of his vicarious responsibility for the crimes of his accomplice. The ""remedy"" the Illinois Supreme Court created to address the ambiguity of the jury's verdict-setting itself up as a finder of fact on the issue of intent-contravenes a related tenet of this Court's death penalty jurisprudence: that the uniquely harsh consequence entailed by capital punishment demands the greatest possible exactitude in the factfinding process. See, e.g., Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625d 392 (1980); Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420d 398 (1980). The ruling of the Illinois Supreme Court mocks this standard by attempting to derive from a cold paper record a subtle factual determination best left in the hands of juries or trial courts that have had the opportunity to view witness demeanor and other delicate nuances that cannot be captured by written transcripts. Confronted with ""a level of uncertainty [in] the factfinding process that cannot be tolerated in a capital case,"" Beck v. Alabama, supra, 447 U.S., at 643, this Court should either vacate petitioner's sentence and remand with instructions that he be resentenced in a fashion that excludes the imposition of capital punishment or grant certiorari and give plenary consideration to petitioner's claim. I therefore respectfully dissent.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 25, 1984. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 A grand jury in Harris County, Tex., indicted petitioner for the sexual assault of a white woman. Petitioner, a Negro with no 
Page 467 U.S. 1261 , 1262
 previous criminal record, denied the charge and maintained that he was at home at the time of the crime. There were no witnesses to the assault, and no physical evidence linking petitioner to the offense. From the nature of the State's case, it was clear that petitioner's fate would turn on whether the jury accepted the identification of the white victim or believed the sworn denial of a Negro defendant. After an extensive voir dire and for-cause challenges, eight Negroes were left in the jury panel. The prosecution then used eight peremptory challenges to remove these Negroes. With its two remaining peremptories, the prosecution removed the two members of the venire with Hispanic surnames. Over defense counsel's objection, an all-white jury proceeded to convict petitioner of the offense charged. Petitioner was sentenced to 12 years in the Texas Department of Corrections. 
 This petition presents what I consider to be a prima facie violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Petitioner's defense rested entirely on the jury's assessment of the credibility of two witnesses, one Negro and one white. Under these circumstances, when the prosecution challenges every Negro member of the venire, the inescapable implication is that the prosecutor proceeded on the assumption that Negro jurors would be more likely than white jurors to believe a Negro defendant's version of the facts. In Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S., 522, 528, 696 (1975), the wrurt held that criminal defendants are entitled to a jury drawn from a ""representative cross section of the community."" When the prosecution employs its peremptory challenges to remove from jury participation all Negro jurors, the right guaranteed in Taylor is denied just as effectively as it would be had Negroes not been included on the jury rolls in the first place. 
 Over the past year, I have repeatedly urged my colleagues to grant certiorari in similar cases in which state prosecutors have blatantly employed peremptory challenges to remove Negro jurors. See Williams v. Illinois, 466 U.S. 981 (1984) (MARSHALL, J ., dissenting); Gilliard v. Mississippi, 464 U.S. 867, 78 L. Ed.2d 179 (1983) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); McCray v. New York, 461 U.S. 961, 963, 2439 (1983) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). The Court, however, remains satisfied that Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202 (1965), adequately protects criminal defendants against prosecutorial misuse of peremptory challenges. As the facts of this case reveal, the Court's reliance on Swain is grossly misplaced. If Swain protects anyone, it is the prosecution. [467 U.S. 1261 , 1263]

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the convictions were affirmed but the sentences were reversed due to an improper argument the prosecution made to the jury at the sentencing hearing. 277 S.C. 126, 284 S.E.2d 221 (1981). On remand, petitioners were again sentenced to death. They challenge that sentence on the ground that the trial court erred by allowing the jury to view the site of the murder without the presence of either the defense or the prosecution attorneys and also by making no arrangements to record what transpired at the jury- viewing. Petitioners claim that the trial court's action denied them their right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to effective assistance of counsel. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 ( 1963). 
 In rejecting petitioners' claim, the Supreme Court of South Carolina principally relied upon Snyder v.

Snyder, however, is inapposite to the case at bar. First, Snyder involved whether a defendant had the right to be present at an on-site inspection by a jury. Here, the issue is whether a defendant had the right to have his attorney present at such a viewing.

|467 u.s. 752|"Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.
No. 82-1260
Argued December 5, 1983
Decided June 19, 1984
467 U.S. 752

Syllabus 
Petitioner Copperweld Corp. purchased petitioner Regal Tube Co., a manufacturer of steel tubing, from Lear Siegler, Inc., which had operated Regal as an unincorporated division, and which, under the sale agreement, was bound not to compete with Regal for five years.  Copperweld then transferred Regal's assets to a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary.  Shortly before Copperweld acquired Regal, David Grohne, who previously had been an officer of Regal, became an officer of Lear Siegler, and, while continuing to work for Lear Siegler, formed respondent corporation to compete with Regal.  Respondent then gave Yoder Co. a purchase order for a tubing mill, but Yoder voided the order when it received a letter from Copperweld warning that Copperweld would be greatly concerned if Grohne contemplated competing with Regal, and promising to take the necessary steps to protect Copperweld's rights under the noncompetition agreement with Lear Siegler.  Respondent then arranged to have a mill supplied by another company.  Thereafter, respondent filed an action in Federal District Court against petitioners and Yoder.  The jury found, inter alia, that petitioners had conspired to violate  1 of the Sherman Act, but that Yoder was not part of the conspiracy, and awarded treble damages against petitioners.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Noting that the exoneration of Yoder from antitrust liability left a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary as the only parties to the  1 conspiracy, the court questioned the wisdom of subjecting an ""intra-enterprise"" conspiracy to antitrust liability, but held that such liability was appropriate ""when there is enough separation between the two entities to make treating them as two independent actors sensible,"" and that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Regal was more like a separate corporate entity than a mere service arm of the parent.
Held:  Petitioner Copperweld and its wholly owned subsidiary, petitioner Regal, are incapable of conspiring with each other for purposes of 1 of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  467 U. S. 759-777.
(a) While this Court has previously seemed to acquiesce in the ""intra-enterprise conspiracy"" doctrine, which provides that  1 liability is not 
Page 467 U. S. 753
 foreclosed merely because a parent and its subsidiary are subject to common ownership, the Court has never explored or analyzed in detail the justifications for such a rule.  Pp.  467 U. S. 759-766.
(b) Section 1 of the Sherman Act, in contrast to  2, reaches unreasonable restraints of trade effected by a ""contract, combination . . . or conspiracy"" between separate entities, and does not reach conduct that is ""wholly unilateral.""  Pp.  467 U. S. 767-769.
(c) The coordinated activity of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary must be viewed as that of a single enterprise for purposes of  1 of the Sherman Act.  A parent and its wholly owned subsidiary have a complete unity of interest.  Their objectives are common, not disparate, and their general corporate objectives are guided or determined not by two separate corporate consciousnesses, but one.  With or without a formal ""agreement,"" the subsidiary acts for the parent's benefit.  If the parent and subsidiary ""agree"" to a course of action, there is no sudden joining of economic resources that had previously served different interests, and there is no justification for  1 scrutiny.  In reality, the parent and subsidiary always have a ""unity of purpose or a common design.""  The ""intra-enterprise conspiracy"" doctrine relies on artificial distinctions, looking to the form of an enterprise's structure and ignoring the reality.  Antitrust liability should not depend on whether a corporate subunit is organized as an unincorporated division or a wholly owned subsidiary.  Here, nothing in the record indicates any meaningful difference between Regal's operations as an unincorporated division of Lear Siegler and its later operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Copperweld.  Pp.  467 U. S. 771-774.
(d) The appropriate inquiry in this case is not whether the coordinated conduct of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary may ever have anticompetitive effects or whether the term ""conspiracy"" will bear a literal construction that includes a parent and its subsidiaries, but rather whether the logic underlying Congress' decision to exempt unilateral conduct from scrutiny under  1 of the Sherman Act similarly excludes the conduct of a parent and subsidiary.  It can only be concluded that the coordinated behavior of a parent and subsidiary falls outside the reach of  1.  Any anticompetitive activities of corporations and their wholly owned subsidiaries meriting antitrust remedies may be policed adequately without resort to an ""intra-enterprise conspiracy"" doctrine.  A corporation's initial acquisition of control is always subject to scrutiny under  1 of the Sherman Act and  7 of the Clayton Act, and thereafter the enterprise is subject to  2 of the Sherman Act and  5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.  Pp.  467 U. S. 774-777.

Respondent then gave Yoder Co. a purchase order for a tubing mill, but Yoder voided the order when it received a letter from Copperweld warning that Copperweld would be greatly concerned if Grohne contemplated competing with Regal, and promising to take the necessary steps to protect Copperweld's rights under the noncompetition agreement with Lear Siegler.  Respondent then arranged to have a mill supplied by another company.  Thereafter, respondent filed an action in Federal District Court against petitioners and Yoder.  The jury found, inter alia, that petitioners had conspired to violate  1 of the Sherman Act, but that Yoder was not part of the conspiracy, and awarded treble damages against petitioners.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Noting that the exoneration of Yoder from antitrust liability left a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary as the only parties to the  1 conspiracy, the court questioned the wisdom of subjecting an ""intra-enterprise"" conspiracy to antitrust liability, but held that such liability was appropriate ""when there is enough separation between the two entities to make treating them as two independent actors sensible,"" and that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Regal was more like a separate corporate entity than a mere service arm of the parent.
Held:  Petitioner Copperweld and its wholly owned subsidiary, petitioner Regal, are incapable of conspiring with each other for purposes of 1 of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  467 U. S. 759-777.
(a) While this Court has previously seemed to acquiesce in the ""intra-enterprise conspiracy"" doctrine, which provides that  1 liability is not 
Page 467 U. S. 753
 foreclosed merely because a parent and its subsidiary are subject to common ownership, the Court has never explored or analyzed in detail the justifications for such a rule.  Pp.  467 U. S. 759-766.
(b) Section 1 of the Sherman Act, in contrast to  2, reaches unreasonable restraints of trade effected by a ""contract, combination . . . or conspiracy"" between separate entities, and does not reach conduct that is ""wholly unilateral.""  Pp.  467 U. S. 767-769.
(c) The coordinated activity of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary must be viewed as that of a single enterprise for purposes of  1 of the Sherman Act.  A parent and its wholly owned subsidiary have a complete unity of interest.  Their objectives are common, not disparate, and their general corporate objectives are guided or determined not by two separate corporate consciousnesses, but one.  With or without a formal ""agreement,"" the subsidiary acts for the parent's benefit.  If the parent and subsidiary ""agree"" to a course of action, there is no sudden joining of economic resources that had previously served different interests, and there is no justification for  1 scrutiny.  In reality, the parent and subsidiary always have a ""unity of purpose or a common design.""  The ""intra-enterprise conspiracy"" doctrine relies on artificial distinctions, looking to the form of an enterprise's structure and ignoring the reality.  Antitrust liability should not depend on whether a corporate subunit is organized as an unincorporated division or a wholly owned subsidiary.  Here, nothing in the record indicates any meaningful difference between Regal's operations as an unincorporated division of Lear Siegler and its later operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Copperweld.  Pp.  467 U. S. 771-774.
(d) The appropriate inquiry in this case is not whether the coordinated conduct of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary may ever have anticompetitive effects or whether the term ""conspiracy"" will bear a literal construction that includes a parent and its subsidiaries, but rather whether the logic underlying Congress' decision to exempt unilateral conduct from scrutiny under  1 of the Sherman Act similarly excludes the conduct of a parent and subsidiary.  It can only be concluded that the coordinated behavior of a parent and subsidiary falls outside the reach of  1.  Any anticompetitive activities of corporations and their wholly owned subsidiaries meriting antitrust remedies may be policed adequately without resort to an ""intra-enterprise conspiracy"" doctrine.  A corporation's initial acquisition of control is always subject to scrutiny under  1 of the Sherman Act and  7 of the Clayton Act, and thereafter the enterprise is subject to  2 of the Sherman Act and  5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.  Pp.  467 U. S. 774-777.

Syllabus 
The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 directs the Secretary of Transportation to promote safety in air transportation by promulgating reasonable rules and regulations governing the inspection, servicing, and overhaul of civil aircraft.  The Secretary, in her discretion, may prescribe the manner in which such inspection, servicing, and overhaul shall be made.  In the exercise of this discretion, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as the Secretary's designee, has devised a system of compliance review that involves certification of aircraft design and manufacture.  Under this certification process, the duty to ensure that an aircraft conforms to FAA safety regulations lies with the manufacturer and operator, while the FAA retains responsibility for policing compliance.  Thus, the manufacturer is required to develop the plans and specifications and perform the inspections and tests necessary to establish that an aircraft design comports with the regulations; the FAA then reviews the data by conducting a ""spot check"" of the manufacturer's work.  Part of the FAA compliance procedure involves certification, whereby the FAA, if it finds that a proposed new type of aircraft comports with minimum safety standards, signifies its approval by issuing a type certificate.  If an already certificated aircraft's design undergoes a major change, the FAA, if it approves the change, issues a supplemental type certificate.  In No. 82-1349, a Boeing 707 commercial jet aircraft owned by respondent airline was flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris when a fire broke out in one of the aft lavatories producing thick black smoke throughout the cabin.  Despite a successful effort to land the plane, most of the passengers on board died from asphyxiation or the effects of toxic gases produced by the fire, and most of the plane's fuselage was consumed by the post-impact fire.  Respondent airline's action against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (Act or FTCA) seeking damages for the destroyed aircraft and a wrongful death action by respondent families and representatives of the deceased passengers under the Act were consolidated in the Federal District Court.  Respondents alleged that 
Page 467 U. S. 798
 the Civil Aeronautics Agency, the FAA's predecessor, was negligent in issuing a type certificate for the Boeing 707 because the lavatory trash receptacle did not satisfy applicable safety regulations.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the United States on the ground, inter alia, that recovery against the United States was barred by 28 U.S.C.  2680(a), which provides that the Act shall not apply to claims
""based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused""
(discretionary function exception).  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding, inter alia, that the discretionary function exception did not apply.  In No. 82-1350, an aircraft owned by respondent Dowdle and used in an air taxi service caught fire in midair in the forward baggage compartment, crashed, and burned, killing all the occupants.  Respondent Dowdle filed an action under the FTCA for property damage and respondent insurance companies also filed an action under the Act seeking reimbursement for moneys paid for liability coverage on Dowdle's behalf.  Respondents claimed that the Government was negligent in issuing a supplemental type certificate for the installation of a gasoline-burning cabin heater in the airplane that did not comply with the applicable FAA regulations.  The District Court in California, upon finding that the crash resulted from defective installation of the heater, entered judgment for respondents under the California ""Good Samaritan"" rule, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The actions are barred by the discretionary function exception of the FTCA.  Pp.  467 U. S. 807-821.
(a) It is the nature of the conduct, rather than the status of the actor, that governs whether the discretionary function exception applies in a given case.  Moreover, the legislative history discloses that such exception was plainly intended to encompass the discretionary acts of the Government acting in its role as a regulator of the conduct of private individuals.  Congress wished to prevent ""second-guessing"" of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social, economic, and political policy through the medium of an action in tort.  Pp.  467 U. S. 807-814.
(b) Here, the discretionary function exception precludes a tort action based upon the FAA's conduct in certificating the aircraft in question for use in commercial aviation.  The FAA's implementation of a mechanism for compliance review is plainly discretionary activity of the ""nature and quality"" protected by  2680(a).  Judicial intervention, through private tort suits, in the FAA's decision to utilize a ""spot-checking"" program as the best way to accommodate the goal of air transportation safety and the reality of finite agency resources would require the courts to ""second-guess"" the political, social, and economic judgments of an agency 
Page 467 U. S. 799
 exercising its regulatory function.  It was precisely this sort of judicial intervention that the discretionary function exception was designed to prevent.  It follows that the acts of FAA employees in exercising the ""spot-check"" program are also protected by that exception, because respondents alleged only that the FAA failed to check particular items in the course of its review.  Moreover, the risks encountered by these inspectors were encountered for the advancement of a governmental purpose and pursuant to a specific grant of authority.  Pp.  467 U. S. 814-820.

Syllabus 
When respondent, an Air Force Colonel, was stationed in Alaska, the Finance Office of his base received by certified mail a writ of garnishment, accompanied by a copy of a judgment against respondent that had been issued by an Alabama state court in a divorce proceeding.  The writ directed the Air Force to withhold $4,100 of respondent's pay to satisfy sums due under the judgment for alimony and child support.  Upon being notified of the writ, respondent told the Finance Office that the Alabama court's order was void because the court had no jurisdiction over him.  Nevertheless, the Finance Office honored the writ and paid $4,100 to the Alabama court, deducting that amount from respondent's pay.  Subsequently, respondent brought an action against the United States in the Court of Claims to recover the amount that had been withheld from his pay.  The Government submitted as a complete defense 42 U.S.C.  659(f), which provides, in connection with  659(a), making federal employees, including members of the Armed Services, subject to legal process to enforce their child support and alimony payment obligations, that
""[n]either the United States, any disbursing officer, nor governmental entity shall be liable with respect to any payment made from moneys due or payable from the United States to any individual pursuant to legal process regular on its face,""
if such payment is made in accordance with the statute and the implementing regulations.  The Court of Claims held that the writ of garnishment was not ""legal process"" within the meaning of  659(f) because the definition of that term in 42 U.S.C.  662(e) requires that it be issued by a ""court of competent jurisdiction,"" that the Alabama court was not such a court, because it did not have personal jurisdiction over respondent, and that therefore respondent was entitled to recover the amount claimed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, when an obligor notifies the Government that the court issuing the garnishment order does not have personal jurisdiction over him, the order does not constitute ""legal process regular on its face"" within the meaning of  659(f).
Held:  The Government cannot be held liable for honoring a writ of garnishment, such as the one in question here, which is ""regular on its face"" and has been issued by a court with subject matter jurisdiction to issue such orders.  Pp.  467 U. S. 827-836. 
Page 467 U. S. 823

(a) The words ""legal process"" in  659(f) must be read in light of the immediately following phrase -- ""regular on its face.""  That phrase makes it clear that the term ""legal process"" does not require the issuing court to have personal jurisdiction.  The plain language of  659(f) cannot be escaped simply because the obligor may have provided some information casting doubt on the issuing court's jurisdiction over him.  An inquiry into that court's jurisdiction over the obligor cannot be squared with that plain language, which requires the recipient of the writ to act on the basis of the ""face"" of the process.  Pp.  467 U. S. 827-829.
(b) The legislative history shows that Congress did not contemplate the kind of inquiry into personal jurisdiction that the Court of Appeals' holding would require.  That history, as well as the plain language of  659(a), also indicates that Congress intended the Government to receive the same treatment as a private employer with respect to garnishment orders, whereby, in the great majority of jurisdictions in the United States, an employer, upon complying with a garnishment order, is discharged of liability to the judgment debtor to the extent of the payment made.  Moreover, burdening the garnishment process with inquiry into the issuing court's jurisdiction over the debtor would only frustrate the fundamental purpose of  659 of remedying the plight of persons left destitute because they had no speedy and efficacious means of ensuring that their child support and alimony would be paid.  Pp.  467 U. S. 829-834.
(c) Controlling weight must be given to the implementing regulations that expressly provide that, when the Government receives legal process which, on its face, appears to conform to the laws of the jurisdiction from which it was issued, the Government is not required to ascertain whether the issuing authority had obtained personal jurisdiction over the obligor.  These regulations cannot possibly be considered ""clearly inconsistent"" with the statute or ""arbitrary,"" and they further the congressional intent to facilitate speedy enforcement of garnishment orders and to minimize the burden on the Government.

Decided June 18, 1984
467 U.S. 691

Syllabus 
Although Oklahoma does not prohibit the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages within the State, it prohibits, in general, the advertising of such beverages.  In 1980, the Oklahoma Attorney General determined that the State's advertising ban prohibited cable television systems operating in Oklahoma from retransmitting out-of-state signals containing alcoholic beverage commercials, particularly wine commercials.  Petitioners, operators of cable television systems in Oklahoma -- who, with other such operators, had been warned by respondent Director of the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Board that they would be criminally prosecuted if they carried out-of-state wine advertisements -- filed suit in Federal District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that Oklahoma's policy violated various provisions of the Federal Constitution, including the Supremacy Clause and the First Amendment.  Granting summary judgment for petitioners, the court held, inter alia, that the State's advertising ban was an unconstitutional restriction on petitioners' right to engage in protected commercial speech.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. Even though the Court of Appeals did not address it, this Court will address the question whether the Oklahoma ban as applied here so conflicts with federal regulation of cable television systems that it is preempted, since the conflict between Oklahoma and federal law was plainly raised in petitioners' complaint, it was acknowledged by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals, the District Court made findings on all factual issues necessary to resolve the question, and the parties briefed and argued the question pursuant to this Court's order.  Pp.  467 U. S. 697-698.
2. Application of Oklahoma's alcoholic beverages advertising ban to out-of-state signals carried by cable operators in Oklahoma is preempted by federal law.  Federal regulations have no less preemptive effect than federal statutes, and here the power delegated to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the Communications Act of 
Page 467 U. S. 692
 1934 plainly includes authority to regulate cable television systems in order to ensure achievement of the FCC's statutory responsibilities.  Pp.  467 U. S. 698-711.
(a) The FCC has for the past 20 years unambiguously expressed its intent to preempt state or local regulation of any type of signal carried by cable television systems.  Although Oklahoma may, under current FCC rules, regulate such local aspects of cable systems as franchisee selection and construction oversight, nevertheless, by requiring cable television operators to delete commercial advertising contained in signals carried pursuant to federal authority, the State has clearly exceeded its limited jurisdiction and has interfered with a regulatory area that the FCC has explicitly preempted.  Pp.  467 U. S. 700-705.
(b) Oklahoma's advertising ban also conflicts with specific FCC regulations requiring that certain cable television operators, such as petitioners, carry signals from broadcast stations located nearby in other States, and that such signals be carried in full, including any commercial advertisements.  Similarly, Oklahoma's ban conflicts with FCC rulings permitting and encouraging cable television systems to import more distant out-of-state broadcast signals, which, under FCC regulations, must also be carried in full.  Enforcement of Oklahoma's ban also would affect nonbroadcast cable services, a source of cable programming over which the FCC has explicitly asserted exclusive jurisdiction.  Moreover, it would be a prohibitively burdensome task for a cable operator to monitor each signal it receives and delete every wine commercial, and thus enforcement of Oklahoma's ban might deprive the public of the wide variety of programming options that cable systems make possible.  Such a result is wholly at odds with the FCC's regulatory goal of making available the benefits of cable communications on a nationwide basis.  Pp.  467 U. S. 705-709.
(c) Congress -- through the Copyright Revision Act of 1976 -- has also acted to facilitate the cable industry's ability to distribute broadcast programming on a national basis.  The Act establishes a program of compulsory copyright licensing that permits a cable operator to retransmit distant broadcast signals upon payment of royalty fees to a central fund, but requires that the operator refrain from deleting commercial advertising from the signals.  Oklahoma's deletion requirement forces cable operators to lose the protections of compulsory licensing, or to abandon their importation of broadcast signals covered by the Act.  Such a loss of viewing options would thwart the policy identified by both Congress and the FCC of facilitating and encouraging the importation of distant broadcast signals.  Pp.  467 U. S. 709-711.
3. The Twenty-first Amendment does not save Oklahoma's advertising ban from preemption.  The States enjoy broad power under  2 
Page 467 U. S. 693
 of that Amendment to regulate the importation and use of intoxicating liquor within their borders, but when a State does not attempt directly to regulate the sale or use of liquor, a conflicting exercise of federal authority may prevail.  In such a case, the central question is whether the interests implicated by a state regulation are so closely related to the powers reserved by the Amendment that the regulation may prevail, even though its requirements directly conflict with express federal policies.  Resolution of this question requires a pragmatic effort to harmonize state and federal powers within the context of the issues and interests at stake.  Here, Oklahoma's interest in discouraging consumption of intoxicating liquor is limited, since the State's ban is directed only at occasional wine commercials appearing on out-of-state signals carried by cable operators, while the State permits advertisements for all alcoholic beverages carried in newspapers and other publications printed outside Oklahoma but sold in the State.  The State's interest is not of the same stature as the FCC's interest in ensuring widespread availability of diverse cable services throughout the United States.  Pp.  467 U. S. 711-716.

Although Oklahoma does not prohibit the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages within the State, it prohibits, in general, the advertising of such beverages.  In 1980, the Oklahoma Attorney General determined that the State's advertising ban prohibited cable television systems operating in Oklahoma from retransmitting out-of-state signals containing alcoholic beverage commercials, particularly wine commercials.  Petitioners, operators of cable television systems in Oklahoma -- who, with other such operators, had been warned by respondent Director of the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Board that they would be criminally prosecuted if they carried out-of-state wine advertisements -- filed suit in Federal District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that Oklahoma's policy violated various provisions of the Federal Constitution, including the Supremacy Clause and the First Amendment.  Granting summary judgment for petitioners, the court held, inter alia, that the State's advertising ban was an unconstitutional restriction on petitioners' right to engage in protected commercial speech.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. Even though the Court of Appeals did not address it, this Court will address the question whether the Oklahoma ban as applied here so conflicts with federal regulation of cable television systems that it is preempted, since the conflict between Oklahoma and federal law was plainly raised in petitioners' complaint, it was acknowledged by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals, the District Court made findings on all factual issues necessary to resolve the question, and the parties briefed and argued the question pursuant to this Court's order.  Pp.  467 U. S. 697-698.
2. Application of Oklahoma's alcoholic beverages advertising ban to out-of-state signals carried by cable operators in Oklahoma is preempted by federal law.  Federal regulations have no less preemptive effect than federal statutes, and here the power delegated to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the Communications Act of 
Page 467 U. S. 692
 1934 plainly includes authority to regulate cable television systems in order to ensure achievement of the FCC's statutory responsibilities.  Pp.  467 U. S. 698-711.
(a) The FCC has for the past 20 years unambiguously expressed its intent to preempt state or local regulation of any type of signal carried by cable television systems.  Although Oklahoma may, under current FCC rules, regulate such local aspects of cable systems as franchisee selection and construction oversight, nevertheless, by requiring cable television operators to delete commercial advertising contained in signals carried pursuant to federal authority, the State has clearly exceeded its limited jurisdiction and has interfered with a regulatory area that the FCC has explicitly preempted.  Pp.  467 U. S. 700-705.
(b) Oklahoma's advertising ban also conflicts with specific FCC regulations requiring that certain cable television operators, such as petitioners, carry signals from broadcast stations located nearby in other States, and that such signals be carried in full, including any commercial advertisements.  Similarly, Oklahoma's ban conflicts with FCC rulings permitting and encouraging cable television systems to import more distant out-of-state broadcast signals, which, under FCC regulations, must also be carried in full.  Enforcement of Oklahoma's ban also would affect nonbroadcast cable services, a source of cable programming over which the FCC has explicitly asserted exclusive jurisdiction.  Moreover, it would be a prohibitively burdensome task for a cable operator to monitor each signal it receives and delete every wine commercial, and thus enforcement of Oklahoma's ban might deprive the public of the wide variety of programming options that cable systems make possible.  Such a result is wholly at odds with the FCC's regulatory goal of making available the benefits of cable communications on a nationwide basis.  Pp.  467 U. S. 705-709.
(c) Congress -- through the Copyright Revision Act of 1976 -- has also acted to facilitate the cable industry's ability to distribute broadcast programming on a national basis.  The Act establishes a program of compulsory copyright licensing that permits a cable operator to retransmit distant broadcast signals upon payment of royalty fees to a central fund, but requires that the operator refrain from deleting commercial advertising from the signals.  Oklahoma's deletion requirement forces cable operators to lose the protections of compulsory licensing, or to abandon their importation of broadcast signals covered by the Act.  Such a loss of viewing options would thwart the policy identified by both Congress and the FCC of facilitating and encouraging the importation of distant broadcast signals.  Pp.  467 U. S. 709-711.
3. The Twenty-first Amendment does not save Oklahoma's advertising ban from preemption.  The States enjoy broad power under  2 
Page 467 U. S. 693
 of that Amendment to regulate the importation and use of intoxicating liquor within their borders, but when a State does not attempt directly to regulate the sale or use of liquor, a conflicting exercise of federal authority may prevail.  In such a case, the central question is whether the interests implicated by a state regulation are so closely related to the powers reserved by the Amendment that the regulation may prevail, even though its requirements directly conflict with express federal policies.  Resolution of this question requires a pragmatic effort to harmonize state and federal powers within the context of the issues and interests at stake.  Here, Oklahoma's interest in discouraging consumption of intoxicating liquor is limited, since the State's ban is directed only at occasional wine commercials appearing on out-of-state signals carried by cable operators, while the State permits advertisements for all alcoholic beverages carried in newspapers and other publications printed outside Oklahoma but sold in the State.  The State's interest is not of the same stature as the FCC's interest in ensuring widespread availability of diverse cable services throughout the United States.  Pp.  467 U. S. 711-716.

Syllabus 
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), enacted in 1974, created a pension plan termination insurance program whereby the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a wholly owned Government corporation, collects insurance premiums from covered private retirement pension plans and provides benefits to participants if their plan terminates with insufficient assets to support its guaranteed benefits.  For multiemployer pension plans, the PBGC's payment of guaranteed benefits was not to become mandatory until January 1, 1978.  During the intervening period, the PBGC had discretionary authority to pay benefits upon the termination of such plans.  If the PBGC exercised its discretion to pay such benefits, employers who had contributed to the plan during the five years preceding its termination were liable to PBGC in amounts proportional to their share of the plan's contributions during that period.  As the mandatory coverage date approached, Congress became concerned that a significant number of multiemployer pension plans were experiencing extreme financial hardship that would result in termination of numerous plans, forcing the PBGC to assume obligations in excess of its capacity.  Ultimately, after deferring the mandatory coverage until August 1, 1980, and extensively debating the issue of withdrawal liability in 1979 and 1980, Congress enacted the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (MPPAA), requiring an employer withdrawing from a multiemployer pension plan to pay a fixed and certain debt to the plan amounting to the employer's proportionate share of the plan's ""unfunded vested benefits.""  These withdrawal liability provisions were made to take effect approximately five months before the statute was enacted into law.  When appellee building and construction firm, within this 5-month period, withdrew from a multiemployer pension plan that it had been contributing to under collective bargaining agreements with a labor union, the pension plan notified appellee that it had incurred a withdrawal liability and demanded 
Page 467 U. S. 718
 payment.  Appellee then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the pension plan and the PBGC and claiming, inter alia, that the retroactive application of the MPPAA violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The District Court rejected this claim and granted summary judgment in favor of the pension plan and the PBGC.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that retroactive application of withdrawal liability violated the Due Process Clause because employers had reasonably relied on the contingent withdrawal liability provisions included in ERISA prior to passage of the MPPAA, and because the equities generally favored appellee over the pension plan.
Held:  Application of the withdrawal liability provisions of the MPPAA during the 5-month period prior to the statute's enactment does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  467 U. S. 728-734.
(a) The burden of showing that retroactive legislation complies with due process is met by showing that retroactive application of the legislation is justified by a rational legislative purpose.  Here, it was rational for Congress to conclude that the MPPAA's purposes could be more fully effectuated if its withdrawal liability provisions were applied retroactively.  One of the primary problems that Congress identified under ERISA was that the statute encouraged employer withdrawals from multiemployer pension plans, and Congress was properly concerned that employers would have an even greater incentive to withdraw if they knew that legislation to impose more burdensome liability on withdrawing employers was being considered.  Congress therefore utilized retroactive application of the statute to prevent employers from taking advantage of the lengthy legislative process and withdrawing while Congress debated necessary revisions in the statute.  Pp.  467 U. S. 728-731.
(b) It is doubtful that retroactive application of the MPPAA would be invalid under the Due Process Clause even if it was suddenly enacted without any period of deliberate consideration.  But even assuming that advance notice of retroactive legislation is constitutionally compelled, employers had ample notice of the withdrawal liability imposed by the MPPAA.  Not only did ERISA impose contingent liability, but the various legislative proposals debated by Congress before the MPPAA was enacted uniformly included retroactive effective dates.  Pp.  467 U. S. 731-732.
(c) The principles embodied in the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause have never been held coextensive with prohibitions existing against state impairments of preexisting contracts.  Rather, the limitations imposed on States by the Contract Clause have been contrasted with the less searching standards imposed on economic legislation by the Due Process Clauses.  Pp.  467 U. S. 732-733. 
Page 467 U. S. 719

(d) Unlike the statute invalidated in Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S. 330, which required employers to finance pensions for former employees who had already been fully compensated while employed, the MPPAA merely requires a withdrawing employer to compensate a pension plan for benefits that have already vested with the employees at the time of the employer's withdrawal.

Syllabus 
During its nonpublic investigation into possible violations of the federal securities laws involving respondents, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued subpoenas to certain of the respondents for the production of financial records.  Ultimately, respondents filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the SEC's investigation and to prevent compliance with some of the subpoenas.  After the District Court dismissed the claims for injunctive relief, the SEC issued subpoenas to third parties.  Respondents then renewed their requests to the District Court for injunctive relief and sought notice of the third-party subpoenas.  The court denied the requested relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed with respect to the District Court's denial of respondents' request for notice of subpoenas issued to third parties.
Held:  The SEC is not required to notify the ""targets"" of nonpublic investigations into possible violations of the securities laws when the SEC issues subpoenas to third parties.  The SEC has discretion to determine when such notice would be appropriate and when it would not.  Pp.  467 U. S. 741-751.
(a) Notice to ""targets"" is not required by any constitutional provision.  When a federal administrative agency, without notifying a person under investigation, uses its subpoena power to gather evidence adverse to him, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not implicated, because an administrative investigation adjudicates no legal rights, and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is not offended, since it does not come into play until the initiation of criminal proceedings.  Nor may a person inculpated by materials sought by a subpoena issued to a third party seek shelter in the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment, since the subpoena does not ""compel"" anyone other than the person to whom it is directed to be a witness against himself.  Finally, respondents cannot contend that notice of subpoenas issued to third parties is necessary to enable a ""target"" to prevent a search or seizure of his papers violative of the Fourth Amendment; when a person communicates information to a third party, even on the understanding that the communication is confidential, he cannot object if the third party 
Page 467 U. S. 736
 conveys that information or records thereof to law enforcement authorities.  Pp.  467 U. S. 742-743.
(b) The language and structure of the statutes administered by the SEC, particularly the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, do not support the imposition of a duty on the SEC to notify a ""target"" of an investigation when it issues a subpoena to a third party.  The provisions vesting the SEC with the power to conduct investigations and to issue and seek enforcement of subpoenas are expansive, and no provision expressly obliges the SEC to notify ""targets"" when subpoenas are issued to third parties.  Congress intended to vest the SEC with considerable discretion in determining when and how to investigate possible statutory violations, and there is no evidence that Congress expected the Commission to adopt any particular procedure for notifying ""targets"" when it sought information from third parties.  The fact that Congress recently has imposed a carefully limited obligation on the SEC under the Right to Financial Privacy Act to notify bank customers of administrative subpoenas issued to banks reinforces the conclusion that Congress assumed that the SEC was not and would not be subject to a general obligation to notify ""targets"" whenever it issued administrative subpoenas.  Pp.  467 U. S. 743-747.
(c) Nor is a notice requirement justified on the ground, asserted by respondents, that a ""target"" has a substantive right to insist that administrative subpoenas issued to third parties meet the standards set forth in United States v. Powell, 379 U. S. 48, and that, to enable the ""target"" to enforce this right by intervening in SEC enforcement actions against the subpoena recipients or by restraining the recipients' voluntary compliance, the ""target"" must be notified of the subpoenas.  Even assuming, arguendo, that a ""target"" has such substantive and procedural rights, pragmatic considerations counsel against reinforcing those rights with a notice requirement.  Administration of a notice requirement would be highly burdensome for both the SEC and the courts, particularly with regard to identification of the persons and organizations that should be considered ""targets"" of investigations.  Moreover, the imposition of a notice requirement would substantially increase the ability of ""targets"" who have something to hide to impede legitimate SEC investigations by discouraging subpoena recipients from complying, or by destroying or altering documents, intimidating witnesses, or transferring securities or funds so that they could not be reached by the Government.

Syllabus 
Title I of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA) provides a ""Bill of Rights"" for labor union members, including various protections for members involved in union elections.  Section 102 provides that any person whose Title I rights have been violated may bring an action in federal district court ""for such relief (including injunctions) as may be appropriate.""  Title IV of the Act provides an elaborate post-election procedure aimed at protecting union democracy through free and democratic elections.  Section 402 provides that, if the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), upon complaint by a union member, finds probable cause to believe that a violation of Title IV election proceedings has occurred, he shall bring an action against the union in federal district court to set aside the election and to order a new election under the supervision of the Secretary.  Section 403 provides that the remedy prescribed by Title IV for challenging an election already conducted shall be exclusive.  Petitioner union, in preparation for an election scheduled for the last two months of 1980, held a meeting to nominate candidates for its executive board.  Admission to the meeting was restricted to those union members who could produce a computerized receipt showing that their union dues had been paid.  One of the respondents was among those members who were prohibited from entering the meeting for not possessing such a receipt.  There was also a disagreement at the meeting as to the office for which another respondent had been nominated.  These respondents and other respondent union members then filed a protest with the union, but it was denied.  Election ballots were thereafter distributed with instructions that they be returned by mail so as to arrive in a designated post office box by 9 a.m. on December 13, 1980, at which time they were to be counted.  On December 1, 1980, after the ballots had been distributed, respondents filed an action in Federal District Court, alleging that the union and petitioner union officers had violated Title I, and seeking a preliminary injunction.  On December 12, the court issued a temporary restraining order halting the election.  This was followed by several months of negotiations between the parties and hearings before the court.  Ultimately, holding that Title I remedies 
Page 467 U. S. 527
 were not foreclosed when Title I violations occurred during the course of an election and rejecting petitioners' argument that respondents' exclusive remedy was to file a complaint with the Secretary under Title IV, the court issued a preliminary injunction and an order declaring the interrupted election invalid, setting forth detailed procedures to be followed during a new election, and appointing outside arbitrators to supervise implementation of the procedures.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court overstepped the bounds of ""appropriate"" relief under Title I when it enjoined an ongoing union election and ordered that a new election be held pursuant to procedures imposed by the court.  Pp.  467 U. S. 535-551.
(a) While  102, standing by itself, suggests that individual union members may properly maintain a Title I suit whenever rights guaranteed by that Title have been violated, that section explicitly limits relief that may be ordered by a district court to that which is ""appropriate"" to any given situation.  Moreover, while Title IV protects many of the same rights as does Title I,  402 of Title IV sets up an exclusive method for protecting Title IV rights, and under this method, individuals are not permitted to block or delay union elections by filing suits for violation of Title IV.  Pp.  467 U. S. 536-540.
(b) Whether suits alleging violations of Title I may properly be maintained during the course of a union election depends upon the appropriateness of the remedy required to eliminate the claimed violations.  In the absence of legislative history suggesting that Congress intended to require or allow courts to preempt the Secretary's expertise and supervise their own elections, and given the clear congressional preference expressed in Title IV for supervision of new elections by the Secretary, the conclusion is compelled that Congress did not consider court supervision of union elections to be an ""appropriate"" remedy for a Title I suit filed during the course of an election.  Thus, if the remedy sought is invalidation of an election already being conducted and court supervision of a new election, union members must utilize the remedies provided by Title IV.  For less intrusive remedies sought during an election, however, a district court retains authority to order appropriate relief under Title I.  Pp.  467 U. S. 540-550.
(c) The District Court's order here directly interfered with the Secretary's exclusive responsibilities for supervising new elections, and was inconsistent with the basic objectives of the LMRDA enforcement scheme.  Pp.  467 U. S. 550-551.

There was also a disagreement at the meeting as to the office for which another respondent had been nominated.  These respondents and other respondent union members then filed a protest with the union, but it was denied.  Election ballots were thereafter distributed with instructions that they be returned by mail so as to arrive in a designated post office box by 9 a.m. on December 13, 1980, at which time they were to be counted.  On December 1, 1980, after the ballots had been distributed, respondents filed an action in Federal District Court, alleging that the union and petitioner union officers had violated Title I, and seeking a preliminary injunction.  On December 12, the court issued a temporary restraining order halting the election.  This was followed by several months of negotiations between the parties and hearings before the court.  Ultimately, holding that Title I remedies 
Page 467 U. S. 527
 were not foreclosed when Title I violations occurred during the course of an election and rejecting petitioners' argument that respondents' exclusive remedy was to file a complaint with the Secretary under Title IV, the court issued a preliminary injunction and an order declaring the interrupted election invalid, setting forth detailed procedures to be followed during a new election, and appointing outside arbitrators to supervise implementation of the procedures.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court overstepped the bounds of ""appropriate"" relief under Title I when it enjoined an ongoing union election and ordered that a new election be held pursuant to procedures imposed by the court.  Pp.  467 U. S. 535-551.
(a) While  102, standing by itself, suggests that individual union members may properly maintain a Title I suit whenever rights guaranteed by that Title have been violated, that section explicitly limits relief that may be ordered by a district court to that which is ""appropriate"" to any given situation.  Moreover, while Title IV protects many of the same rights as does Title I,  402 of Title IV sets up an exclusive method for protecting Title IV rights, and under this method, individuals are not permitted to block or delay union elections by filing suits for violation of Title IV.  Pp.  467 U. S. 536-540.
(b) Whether suits alleging violations of Title I may properly be maintained during the course of a union election depends upon the appropriateness of the remedy required to eliminate the claimed violations.  In the absence of legislative history suggesting that Congress intended to require or allow courts to preempt the Secretary's expertise and supervise their own elections, and given the clear congressional preference expressed in Title IV for supervision of new elections by the Secretary, the conclusion is compelled that Congress did not consider court supervision of union elections to be an ""appropriate"" remedy for a Title I suit filed during the course of an election.  Thus, if the remedy sought is invalidation of an election already being conducted and court supervision of a new election, union members must utilize the remedies provided by Title IV.  For less intrusive remedies sought during an election, however, a district court retains authority to order appropriate relief under Title I.  Pp.  467 U. S. 540-550.
(c) The District Court's order here directly interfered with the Secretary's exclusive responsibilities for supervising new elections, and was inconsistent with the basic objectives of the LMRDA enforcement scheme.  Pp.  467 U. S. 550-551.

Syllabus 
Respondent Stotts, a black member of petitioner Memphis, Tenn., Fire Department, filed a class action in Federal District Court charging that the Department and certain city officials were engaged in a pattern or practice of making hiring and promotion decisions on the basis of race in violation of, inter alia, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  This action was consolidated with an action filed by respondent Jones, also a black member of the Department, who claimed that he had been denied a promotion because of his race.  Thereafter, a consent decree was entered with the stated purpose of remedying the Department's hiring and promotion practices with respect to blacks.  Subsequently, when the city announced that projected budget deficits required a reduction of city employees, the District Court entered an order preliminarily enjoining the Department from following its seniority system in determining who would be laid off as a result of the budgetary shortfall, since the proposed layoffs would have a racially discriminatory effect and the seniority system was not a bona fide one.  A modified layoff plan, aimed at protecting black employees so as to comply with the court's order, was then presented and approved, and layoffs pursuant to this plan were carried out.  This resulted in white employees with more seniority than black employees being laid off when the otherwise applicable seniority system would have called for the layoff of black employees with less seniority.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, although the District Court was wrong in holding that the seniority system was not bona fide, it had acted properly in modifying the consent decree.
Held:
1. These cases are not rendered moot by the facts that the preliminary injunction purportedly applied only to 1981 layoffs, that all white employees laid off as a result of the injunction were restored to duty only one month after their layoff, and that others who were demoted have been offered back their old positions.  First, the injunction is still in force, and, unless set aside, must be complied with in connection with any 
Page 467 U. S. 562
 future layoffs.  Second, even if the injunction applied only to the 1981 layoffs, the predicate for it was the ruling that the consent decree must be modified to provide that the layoffs were not to reduce the percentage of black employees, and the lower courts' rulings that the seniority system must be disregarded for the purpose of achieving the mandated result remain undisturbed.  Accordingly, the inquiry is not merely whether the injunction is still in effect, but whether the mandated modification of the consent decree continues to have an impact on the parties such that the cases remain alive.  Respondents have failed to convince this Court that the modification and the pro tanto invalidation of the seniority system are of no real concern to the city because it will never again contemplate layoffs that, if carried out in accordance with the seniority system, would violate the modified decree.  Finally, the judgment below will have a continuing effect on management of the Fire Department with respect to making whole the white employees who were laid off and thereby lost a month's pay and seniority, or who were demoted and thereby may have backpay claims.  Unless that judgment is reversed, the layoffs and demotions were in accordance with the law.  The fact that not much money and seniority are involved does not determine mootness.  Pp.  467 U. S. 568-572.
2. The District Court's preliminary injunction cannot be justified either as an effort to enforce the consent decree or as a valid modification thereof.  Pp.  467 U. S. 572-583.
(a) The injunction does not merely enforce the agreement of the parties as reflected in the consent decree.  The scope of a consent decree must be discerned within its four corners.  Here, the consent decree makes no mention of layoffs or demotions, nor is there any suggestion of an intention to depart from the existing seniority system or from the Department's arrangement with the union.  It therefore cannot be said that the decree's express terms contemplated that such an injunction would be entered.  Nor is the injunction proper as carrying out the stated purpose of the decree.  The remedy outlined in the decree did not include the displacement of white employees with seniority over blacks, and cannot reasonably be construed to exceed the bounds of remedies that are appropriate under Title VII.  Title VII protects bona fide seniority systems, and it is inappropriate to deny an innocent employee the benefits of his seniority in order to provide a remedy in a pattern-or-practice suit such as this.  Moreover, since neither the union nor the white employees were parties to the suit when the consent decree was entered, the entry of such decree cannot be said to indicate any agreement by them to any of its terms.  Pp.  467 U. S. 573-576.
(b) The theory that the strong policy favoring voluntary settlement of Title VII actions permits consent decrees that encroach on seniority 
Page 467 U. S. 563
 systems does not justify the preliminary injunction as a legitimate modification of the consent decree.  That theory has no application when there is no ""settlement"" with respect to the disputed issue, such as here, where the consent decree neither awarded competitive seniority to the minority employees nor purported to depart from the existing seniority system.  Nor can the injunction be so justified on the basis that, if the allegations in the complaint had been proved, the District Court could have entered an order overriding the seniority provisions.  This approach overstates a trial court's authority to disregard a seniority system in fashioning a remedy after a plaintiff has proved that an employer has followed a pattern or practice having a discriminatory effect on black employees.  Here, there was no finding that any of the blacks protected from layoff had been a victim of discrimination nor any award of competitive seniority to any of them.  The Court of Appeals' holding that the District Court's order modifying the consent decree was permissible as a valid Title VII remedial order ignores not only the ruling in Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, that a court can award competitive seniority only when the beneficiary of the award has actually been a victim of illegal discrimination, but also the policy behind  706(g) of Title VII of providing make-whole relief only to such victims.  And there is no merit to the argument that the District Court ordered no more than that which the city could have done by way of adopting an affirmative action program, since the city took no such action, and the modification of the decree was imposed over its objection.  Pp.  467 U. S. 576-583.

Syllabus 
The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act (Act) regulate the process by which rail carriers may abandon unprofitable lines and provide a mechanism for shippers to obtain continued service by purchasing lines or subsidizing their operation.  Title 49 U.S.C.  10905 governs the procedures to be followed when a person seeks to prevent an abandonment by purchasing the carrier's lines or by subsidizing the carrier's service.  Appellee rail carrier filed an application with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) seeking to abandon an unprofitable 44-mile line between a town in Iowa and a town in Minnesota.  Several shippers in Minnesota opposed the abandonment of a 19.2-mile segment of the line in Minnesota.  After an Administrative Law Judge ruled that appellee was entitled to abandon the entire line, the Minnesota shippers offered to subsidize operation of the 19.2-mile segment.  But the shippers were dissatisfied with the price for subsidizing continued operation of the segment as determined by the ICC after the parties could not agree on the terms, and withdrew their offer.  The ICC then granted appellee a certificate of abandonment for the entire line.  In the meantime, appellee had contracted with the State of Iowa and various Iowa shippers to improve certain trackage in Iowa and, for this purpose, to use track from the abandoned line.  The Minnesota shippers then formed appellant rail carrier (appellant), planning to use its authority under a Minnesota statute to condemn the 9.2-mile segment.  Appellant thereafter filed suit in a Minnesota state court and obtained a temporary restraining order preventing appellee from removing track from that segment.  Appellee removed the suit to Federal District Court and moved to dissolve the restraining order on the ground that the Staggers Rail Act amendments to the Act preempted the Minnesota condemnation statute.  The District Court awarded summary judgment to appellee and dissolved the restraining order, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the Minnesota statute was preempted because it constituted an obstacle to the accomplishment of the congressional purpose behind the federal abandonment procedure. 
Page 467 U. S. 623

Held:  Appellant's proposed application of the Minnesota condemnation statute is not preempted by the Staggers Rail Act amendments to the Act.  Pp.  467 U. S. 627-637.
(a) The underlying rationale of  10905 represents a continuation of Congress' efforts to accommodate the conflicting interests of railroads that desire to unburden themselves quickly of unprofitable lines and shippers that are dependent upon continued rail service.  Under prior law, carriers could negotiate with offerors in bad faith while waiting for the then-6-month negotiating period to elapse, thereby either extracting excessive prices from desperate shippers or abandoning their lines without agreeing on a purchase or subsidy.  To counteract such bad-faith negotiating,  10905 binds a carrier to the purchase or subsidy price determined by the ICC if the offeror and carrier cannot themselves come to terms.  On the other hand, to reduce the costly delays associated with shipper opposition to proposed abandonments,  10905 reduces the period required for resolving negotiations over offers from 6 months to 110 days.  In contrast to the complicated structure of the Act, the Minnesota statute in question is simply a straightforward application of a State's power of eminent domain.  Pp.  467 U. S. 627-631.
(b) Federal regulation of railroad abandonments is not so pervasive as to make reasonable any inference that Congress left no room for state action on the subject.  Congress has not ""unmistakably ordained"" that States may not exercise their traditional eminent domain power over abandoned railroad property; nothing in the Act expressly refers to federal preemption with respect to the disposition of such property.  Nor is there any indication that the subject matter of abandoned railroads is the sort that ""permits no other conclusion"" but that it is governed by federal and not state law.  As indicated by the ICC's own interpretation of its regulatory authority, which interpretation is entitled to considerable deference, issuing a certificate of abandonment, as a general proposition, terminates the ICC's jurisdiction, so that there is no merit to appellee's argument that the abandoned line in question cannot be properly viewed as ordinary real property because the line, even after abandonment, remains under the ICC's jurisdiction.  Pp.  467 U. S. 632-634.
(c) The application of the Minnesota condemnation statute in the circumstances of this case would not obstruct the accomplishment of  10905's purpose of abbreviating the period during which a carrier is obligated to furnish financially burdensome service it seeks to escape through abandonment.  State condemnation proceedings do not interfere with that purpose insofar as they follow abandonment.  After the ICC has authorized abandonment, the carrier is relieved of the obligation to furnish rail service, and nothing in  10905 indicates a federal 
Page 467 U. S. 624
 interest in affording special protection to a carrier after that point.  Nor would allowing appellant to bring condemnation proceedings after abandonment contravene the Act's overall purpose of making the railroad industry more efficient and productive.  While the exercise of state condemnation authority would prevent appellee from removing property from the Minnesota segment in question and shifting it to higher-value uses elsewhere, and while the ICC has recognized opportunity costs as one factor to be considered in deciding whether to authorize abandonment, it does not follow that state condemnation authority thereby frustrates the federal abandonment scheme.  Section 10905 is expressly designed to allow an offeror to force a carrier to forgo abandonment in favor of continued operation through subsidization or purchase, regardless of the opportunity costs entailed by the inability to shift its assets to higher-value uses.  Alleviating the carrier's burden does not alter the economic reality that opportunity costs continue to be incurred; it merely shifts the incidence of those costs.  In light of Congress' imposition of solutions that subordinate opportunity costs to other considerations, state condemnation authority is not preempted merely because it may frustrate the economically optimal use of rail assets.  Moreover, application of the Minnesota law here would not interfere with  10905's valuation procedure by allowing appellant to relitigate the price the ICC determined for the purchase or subsidy of appellee's lines.  The purpose of the federal valuation scheme was to prevent carriers from frustrating bona fide subsidy or purchase offers through bad-faith negotiations, not to impose a blanket prohibition of all post-abandonment efforts to obtain abandoned railroad property.  Pp.  467 U. S. 634-636.

Syllabus 
West Virginia imposes a gross receipts tax on businesses selling tangible property at wholesale.  Local manufacturers are exempt from the tax, but are subject to a higher manufacturing tax.  Appellant is an Ohio corporation that manufactures and sells steel products and conducted business in West Virginia.  It challenged the wholesale tax on the ground, inter alia, that the tax discriminated against interstate commerce because of the exemption granted to local manufacturers.  Appellee State Tax Commissioner rejected the challenge.  The Circuit Court reversed on other grounds, but in turn was reversed by the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.
Held:  The wholesale gross receipts tax unconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce.  Pp.  467 U. S. 642-646.
(a) Under the Commerce Clause, a State may not tax a transaction or incident more heavily when it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirely within the State.  On its face, the wholesale tax has just that effect, since whether a wholesaler is subject to the tax depends upon whether it conducts manufacturing in the State or out of it.  P.  467 U. S. 642.
(b) The wholesale tax cannot be deemed a ""compensating tax.""  Manufacturing and wholesaling are not ""substantially equivalent events"" such that the higher manufacturing tax can be said to compensate for the lighter burden placed on wholesalers from out of State by the wholesale tax.  Pp.  467 U. S. 642-643.
(c) Moreover, when the two taxes are considered together, discrimination against interstate commerce persists, since, if Ohio or any other State imposes a like tax on its manufacturers, then appellant and others from out of State will pay both a manufacturing tax and a wholesale tax, while West Virginia sellers will pay only the manufacturing tax.  Appellant need not prove actual discriminatory impact on it by pointing to a State that imposes a manufacturing tax that results in a total burden higher than that imposed on in-state manufacturers.  Any other rule would mean that the constitutionality of West Virginia's tax laws would depend on the shifting complexities of the 49 other States' tax laws, and that the validity of the taxes imposed on each taxpayer would depend on

No. 83-297
Argued April 17, 1984
Decided June 12, 1984
467 U.S. 638

Syllabus 
West Virginia imposes a gross receipts tax on businesses selling tangible property at wholesale.  Local manufacturers are exempt from the tax, but are subject to a higher manufacturing tax.  Appellant is an Ohio corporation that manufactures and sells steel products and conducted business in West Virginia.  It challenged the wholesale tax on the ground, inter alia, that the tax discriminated against interstate commerce because of the exemption granted to local manufacturers.  Appellee State Tax Commissioner rejected the challenge.  The Circuit Court reversed on other grounds, but in turn was reversed by the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.
Held:  The wholesale gross receipts tax unconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce.  Pp.  467 U. S. 642-646.
(a) Under the Commerce Clause, a State may not tax a transaction or incident more heavily when it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirely within the State.  On its face, the wholesale tax has just that effect, since whether a wholesaler is subject to the tax depends upon whether it conducts manufacturing in the State or out of it.  P.  467 U. S. 642.
(b) The wholesale tax cannot be deemed a ""compensating tax.""  Manufacturing and wholesaling are not ""substantially equivalent events"" such that the higher manufacturing tax can be said to compensate for the lighter burden placed on wholesalers from out of State by the wholesale tax.  Pp.  467 U. S. 642-643.
(c) Moreover, when the two taxes are considered together, discrimination against interstate commerce persists, since, if Ohio or any other State imposes a like tax on its manufacturers, then appellant and others from out of State will pay both a manufacturing tax and a wholesale tax, while West Virginia sellers will pay only the manufacturing tax.

Syllabus 
Respondent was charged in a New York state court with criminal possession of a weapon.  The record showed that a woman approached two police officers who were on road patrol, told them that she had just been raped, described her assailant, and told them that the man had just entered a nearby supermarket and was carrying a gun.  While one of the officers radioed for assistance, the other (Officer Kraft) entered the store and spotted respondent, who matched the description given by the woman.  Respondent ran toward the rear of the store, and Officer Kraft pursued him with a drawn gun, but lost sight of him for several seconds.  Upon regaining sight of respondent, Officer Kraft ordered him to stop and put his hands over his head; frisked him and discovered that he was wearing an empty shoulder holster; and, after handcuffing him, asked him where the gun was.  Respondent nodded toward some empty cartons and responded that ""the gun is over there.""  Officer Kraft then retrieved the gun from one of the cartons, formally arrested respondent, and read him his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  Respondent indicated that he would answer questions without an attorney being present and admitted that he owned the gun and had purchased it in Florida.  The trial court excluded respondent's initial statement and the gun because the respondent had not yet been given the Miranda warnings, and also excluded respondent's other statements as evidence tainted by the Miranda violation.  Both the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the exclusion of respondent's initial statement and the gun because of Officer Kraft's failure to read respondent his Miranda rights before attempting to locate the weapon.  Accordingly, it also erred in affirming the exclusion of respondent's subsequent statements as illegal fruits of the Miranda violation.  This case presents a situation where concern for public safety must be paramount to adherence to the literal language of the prophylactic rules enunciated in Miranda.  Pp.  467 U. S. 653-660.
(a) Although respondent was in police custody when he made his statements and the facts come within the ambit of Miranda, nevertheless, on these facts, there is a ""public safety"" exception to the requirement that Miranda warnings be given before a suspect's answers may be admitted 
Page 467 U. S. 650
 into evidence, and the availability of that exception does not depend upon the motivation of the individual officers involved.  The doctrinal underpinnings of Miranda do not require that it be applied in all its rigor to a situation in which police officers ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety.  In this case, so long as the gun was concealed somewhere in the supermarket, it posed more than one danger to the public safety:  an accomplice might make use of it, or a customer or employee might later come upon it.  Pp.  467 U. S. 655-657.
(b) Procedural safeguards that deter a suspect from responding, and increase the possibility of fewer convictions, were deemed acceptable in Miranda in order to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.  However, if Miranda warnings had deterred responses to Officer Kraft's question about the whereabouts of the gun, the cost would have been something more than merely the failure to obtain evidence useful in convicting respondent.  An answer was needed to insure that future danger to the public did not result from the concealment of the gun in a public area.  P.  467 U. S. 657.
(c) The narrow exception to the Miranda rule recognized here will to some degree lessen the desirable clarity of that rule.  However, the exception will not be difficult for police officers to apply, because, in each case, it will be circumscribed by the exigency which justifies it.  Police officers can and will distinguish almost instinctively between questions necessary to secure their own safety or the safety of the public and questions designed solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect.

467 U.S. 431

Syllabus 
Following the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl in Des Moines, Iowa, respondent was arrested and arraigned in Davenport, Iowa.  The police informed respondent's counsel that they would drive respondent back to Des Moines without questioning him, but during the trip one of the officers began a conversation with respondent that ultimately resulted in his making incriminating statements and directing the officers to the child's body.  A systematic search of the area that was being conducted with the aid of 200 volunteers, and that had been initiated before respondent made the incriminating statements, was terminated when respondent guided police to the body.  Before trial in an Iowa state court for first-degree murder, the court denied respondent's motion to suppress evidence of the body and all related evidence, including the body's condition as shown by an autopsy, respondent having contended that such evidence was the fruit of his illegally obtained statements made during the automobile ride.  Respondent was convicted, and the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed, but later federal court habeas corpus proceedings ultimately resulted in this Court's holding that the police had obtained respondent's incriminating statements through interrogation in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387.  However, it was noted that, even though the statements could not be admitted at a second trial, evidence of the body's location and condition might be admissible on the theory that the body would have been discovered even if the incriminating statements had not been elicited from respondent.  Id. at  430 U. S. 407, n. 12.  At respondent's second state court trial, his incriminating statements were not offered in evidence, nor did the prosecution seek to show that respondent had directed the police to the child's body.  However, evidence concerning the body's location and condition was admitted, the court having concluded that the State had proved that, if the search had continued, the body would have been discovered within a short time in essentially the same condition as it was actually found.  Respondent was again convicted of first-degree murder, and the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed.  In subsequent habeas corpus proceedings, the Federal District Court, denying relief, also concluded that the body inevitably would have been found.  However, the 
Page 467 U. S. 432
 Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, even assuming that there is an inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule -- the State had not met the exception's requirement that it be proved that the police did not act in bad faith.
Held:  The evidence pertaining to the discovery and condition of the victim's body was properly admitted at respondent's second trial on the ground that it would ultimately or inevitably have been discovered even if no violation of any constitutional provision had taken place.  Pp.  467 U. S. 440-450.
(a) The core rationale for extending the exclusionary rule to evidence that is the fruit of unlawful police conduct is that such course is needed to deter police from violations of constitutional and statutory protections notwithstanding the high social cost of letting obviously guilty persons go unpunished.  On this rationale, the prosecution is not to be put in a better position than it would have been in if no illegality had transpired.  By contrast, the independent source doctrine -- allowing admission of evidence that has been discovered by means wholly independent of any constitutional violation -- rests on the rationale that society's interest in deterring unlawful police conduct and the public interest in having juries receive all probative evidence of a crime are properly balanced by putting the police in the same, not a worse, position that they would have been in if no police error or misconduct had occurred.  Although the independent source doctrine does not apply here, its rationale is wholly consistent with, and justifies adoption of, the ultimate or inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule.  If the prosecution can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the information ultimately or inevitably would have been discovered by lawful means -- here the volunteers' search -- then the deterrence rationale has so little basis that the evidence should be received.  Pp.  467 U. S. 441-444.
(b) Under the inevitable discovery exception, the prosecution is not required to prove the absence of bad faith, since such a requirement would result in withholding from juries relevant and undoubted truth that would have been available to police absent any unlawful police activity.  This would put the police in a worse position than they would have been in if no unlawful conduct had transpired, and would fail to take into account the enormous societal cost of excluding truth in the search for truth in the administration of justice.  Significant disincentives to obtaining evidence illegally -- including the possibility of departmental discipline and civil liability -- lessen the likelihood that the ultimate or inevitable discovery exception will promote police misconduct.  Pp.  467 U. S. 445-446.
(c) There is no merit to respondent's contention that, because he did not waive his right to the assistance of counsel, and because the Sixth Amendment exclusionary rule is designed to protect the right to a fair 
Page 467 U. S. 433
 trial, competing values may not be balanced in deciding whether the challenged evidence was properly admitted.  Exclusion of physical evidence that would inevitably have been discovered adds nothing to either the integrity or fairness of a criminal trial.  Nor would suppression ensure fairness on the theory that it tends to safeguard the adversary system of justice.  Pp.  467 U. S. 446-448.
(d) The record here supports the finding that the search party ultimately or inevitably would have discovered the victim's body.  The evidence clearly shows that the searchers were approaching the actual location of the body, that the search would have been resumed had respondent not led the police to the body, and that the body inevitably would have been found.

v. Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Board
No. 82-1577
Argued March 19, 1984
Decided June 11, 1984
467 U.S. 461

Syllabus 
The federal Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 (AFPA) was enacted to enable individual farmers and other producers of agricultural commodities to join together voluntarily in cooperative associations in order to protect their marketing and bargaining position as against large and powerful agricultural processors.  The AFPA makes it unlawful for ""handlers"" defined to include both processors and producers' associations -- to coerce any producer ""in the exercise of his right to join . . . or to refrain from joining"" a producers' association, 7 U.S.C.  2303(a), or to coerce any producer to enter into or terminate a marketing contract with a producers' association or a contract with a handler,  2303(e).  The Michigan Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act (Michigan Act) includes the same prohibitions as the AFPA, but goes beyond it by establishing a state-administered system by which producers' associations are organized and certified as exclusive bargaining agents for all producers of a particular commodity.  Under this system, if an association's membership constitutes more than 50% of the producers of a particular commodity and its members' production accounts for more than 50% of the commodity's total production, the association may be accredited as the exclusive bargaining agent for all producers of that commodity.  Upon accreditation of the association, all producers of the commodity, regardless of whether they have chosen to become members of the association, must pay a service fee to the association, and must abide by the contracts the association negotiates with processors.  The Michigan Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Association (MACMA), a producers' association accredited under the Michigan Act, is the sole sales and bargaining representative for asparagus producers in the State.  After the MACMA had negotiated contracts on behalf of Michigan asparagus growers to sell the asparagus crop for a certain year, appellant asparagus growers and association of asparagus processors sued MACMA in state court seeking a declaratory judgment that the provisions of the Michigan Act requiring service fees and mandatory adherence to an association-negotiated contract are preempted by the AFPA.  The Michigan Supreme Court rejected appellants' claim, holding that the 
Page 467 U. S. 462
 AFPA prohibited only processor misconduct, whereas the challenged provisions of the Michigan Act regulated producers' activities.
Held:  The challenged provisions of the Michigan Act are preempted by the AFPA.  Pp.  467 U. S. 469-478.
(a) This is a case where the basis for preemption is that Congress, while not displacing state regulation entirely, has preempted state law to the extent that it conflicts with federal law and ""stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.""  Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,  312 U. S. 67.  Pp.  467 U. S. 469-470.
(b) The AFPA's theme of voluntariness is carried through to the provisions defining the prohibited practices.  By defining the term ""handler"" to include producers' associations as well as processors, the AFPA prohibits interference by the former to the same extent that it prohibits interference by the latter.  Just as the AFPA forbids processors to interfere in a producer's decision to become or remain affiliated with an association, it also forbids a producers' association to interfere in that decision by coercing producers to belong to, or participate in a marketing contract with, the association.  Pp.  467 U. S. 470-471.
(c) Congress' intent to shield producers from coercion by both processors and producers' associations is confirmed by the AFPA's legislative history, which reveals that the question of the producer's free choice was a central focus of congressional attention during passage of the Act.  Despite the fact that the Michigan Act and the AFPA share the goal of augmenting the producer's bargaining power, the Michigan Act conflicts with the AFPA by establishing ""accredited"" associations that wield the power to coerce producers to sell their products according to terms established by the association, and to force producers to pay a service fee for the privilege.  Pp.  467 U. S. 471-477.
(d) The Michigan Act empowers producers' associations to do precisely what the AFPA forbids them to do.

v. Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Board
No. 82-1577
Argued March 19, 1984
Decided June 11, 1984
467 U.S. 461

Syllabus 
The federal Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 (AFPA) was enacted to enable individual farmers and other producers of agricultural commodities to join together voluntarily in cooperative associations in order to protect their marketing and bargaining position as against large and powerful agricultural processors.  The AFPA makes it unlawful for ""handlers"" defined to include both processors and producers' associations -- to coerce any producer ""in the exercise of his right to join . . . or to refrain from joining"" a producers' association, 7 U.S.C.  2303(a), or to coerce any producer to enter into or terminate a marketing contract with a producers' association or a contract with a handler,  2303(e).  The Michigan Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Act (Michigan Act) includes the same prohibitions as the AFPA, but goes beyond it by establishing a state-administered system by which producers' associations are organized and certified as exclusive bargaining agents for all producers of a particular commodity.  Under this system, if an association's membership constitutes more than 50% of the producers of a particular commodity and its members' production accounts for more than 50% of the commodity's total production, the association may be accredited as the exclusive bargaining agent for all producers of that commodity.  Upon accreditation of the association, all producers of the commodity, regardless of whether they have chosen to become members of the association, must pay a service fee to the association, and must abide by the contracts the association negotiates with processors.  The Michigan Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Association (MACMA), a producers' association accredited under the Michigan Act, is the sole sales and bargaining representative for asparagus producers in the State.  After the MACMA had negotiated contracts on behalf of Michigan asparagus growers to sell the asparagus crop for a certain year, appellant asparagus growers and association of asparagus processors sued MACMA in state court seeking a declaratory judgment that the provisions of the Michigan Act requiring service fees and mandatory adherence to an association-negotiated contract are preempted by the AFPA.  The Michigan Supreme Court rejected appellants' claim, holding that the 
Page 467 U. S. 462
 AFPA prohibited only processor misconduct, whereas the challenged provisions of the Michigan Act regulated producers' activities.
Held:  The challenged provisions of the Michigan Act are preempted by the AFPA.  Pp.  467 U. S. 469-478.
(a) This is a case where the basis for preemption is that Congress, while not displacing state regulation entirely, has preempted state law to the extent that it conflicts with federal law and ""stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.""  Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,  312 U. S. 67.  Pp.  467 U. S. 469-470.
(b) The AFPA's theme of voluntariness is carried through to the provisions defining the prohibited practices.  By defining the term ""handler"" to include producers' associations as well as processors, the AFPA prohibits interference by the former to the same extent that it prohibits interference by the latter.  Just as the AFPA forbids processors to interfere in a producer's decision to become or remain affiliated with an association, it also forbids a producers' association to interfere in that decision by coercing producers to belong to, or participate in a marketing contract with, the association.  Pp.  467 U. S. 470-471.
(c) Congress' intent to shield producers from coercion by both processors and producers' associations is confirmed by the AFPA's legislative history, which reveals that the question of the producer's free choice was a central focus of congressional attention during passage of the Act.  Despite the fact that the Michigan Act and the AFPA share the goal of augmenting the producer's bargaining power, the Michigan Act conflicts with the AFPA by establishing ""accredited"" associations that wield the power to coerce producers to sell their products according to terms established by the association, and to force producers to pay a service fee for the privilege.  Pp.  467 U. S. 471-477.
(d) The Michigan Act empowers producers' associations to do precisely what the AFPA forbids them to do.  In effect, an association accredited under the Michigan Act may coerce a producer to enter into a marketing contract with a producers' association -- a clear violation of  2303(c).  In addition, although the Michigan Act does not compel a producer to join an association, it binds him to the association's marketing contracts, forces him to pay fees to the association, and precludes him from marketing his goods himself, and thus, in practical effect, imposes on the producer the same incidents of association membership with which Congress was concerned in enacting  2303(a).

No. 83-305
Argued April 18, 1984
Decided June 11, 1984
467 U.S. 479

Syllabus 
When stopped in unrelated incidents on suspicion of drunken driving on California highways, each respondent submitted to a Intoxilyzer (breath analysis) test and registered a blood-alcohol concentration high enough to be presumed to be intoxicated under California law.  Although it was technically feasible to preserve samples of respondents' breath, the arresting officers, as was their ordinary practice, did not do so.  Respondents were then all charged with driving while intoxicated.  Prior to trial, the Municipal Court denied each respondent's motion to suppress the Intoxilyzer test results on the ground that the arresting officers had failed to preserve samples of respondents' breath that the respondents claim would have enabled them to impeach the incriminating test results.  Ultimately, in consolidated proceedings, the California Court of Appeal ruled in respondents' favor, concluding that due process demanded that the arresting officers preserve the breath samples.
Held:  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require that law enforcement agencies preserve breath samples in order to introduce the results of breath analysis tests at trial, and thus, here, the State's failure to preserve breath samples for respondents did not constitute a violation of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.  467 U. S. 485-491.
(a) To the extent that respondents' breath samples came into the California authorities' possession, it was for the limited purpose of providing raw data to the Intoxilyzer.  The evidence to be presented at trial was not the breath itself, but rather the Intoxilyzer results obtained from the breath samples.  The authorities did not destroy the breath samples in a calculated effort to circumvent the due process requirement of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, and its progeny that the State disclose to criminal defendants material evidence in its possession, but in failing to preserve the samples, the authorities acted in good faith and in accord with their normal practice.  Pp.  467 U. S. 485-488.
(b) More importantly, California's policy of not preserving breath samples is without constitutional defect.  The constitutional duty of the States to preserve evidence is limited to evidence that might be expected to play a role in the suspect's defense.  The evidence must possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before it was destroyed, and must also be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain 
Page 467 U. S. 480
 comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.  Neither of these conditions was met on the facts of this case.  Pp.  467 U. S. 488-490.

Syllabus 
As a result of a killing and a theft of property, respondent was indicted by an Ohio grand jury on one count each of murder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated robbery, and grand theft.  At his arraignment, the trial court, over the State's objection, accepted respondent's guilty pleas to involuntary manslaughter and grand theft, and then granted respondent's motion to dismiss the remaining charges, to which he had pleaded not guilty, on the ground that their further prosecution was barred by the double jeopardy prohibitions of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the State from continuing its prosecution of respondent on the murder and aggravated robbery charges.  Pp.  467 U. S. 497-502.
(a) This case does not concern the double jeopardy protection against multiple punishments for the same offense.  That protection is designed to ensure that the sentencing discretion of courts is confined to the limits established by the legislature.  Here, the trial court's dismissal of the more serious charges did more than simply prevent the imposition of cumulative punishments; it halted completely the proceedings that ultimately would have led to a verdict of guilt or innocence on these charges.  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the State from prosecuting respondent for such multiple offenses in a single prosecution.  Pp.  467 U. S. 497-500.
(b) Nor would further prosecution of the dismissed counts violate the double jeopardy prohibition against multiple prosecutions.  No interest of respondent protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated by continuing prosecution on these counts.  Respondent only offered to resolve part of the charges brought against him, while the State objected to disposing of any of the counts against respondent without a trial.  He has not been exposed to conviction on these counts, nor has the State had the opportunity to marshal its evidence and resources more than once or to hone its presentation of its case through a trial.  Moreover, the acceptance of a guilty plea on the lesser included offenses while the charges on the greater offenses remain pending has none of the implications of an ""implied acquittal"" that results from a guilty verdict on lesser included offenses rendered by a jury charged to consider both greater and lesser included offenses.  Notwithstanding the trial court's acceptance of respondent's guilty pleas, respondent should not be entitled to use the

Syllabus 
After respondent was convicted in an Arkansas state court on charges of burglary, assault, and murder, the Arkansas Supreme Court set aside the murder conviction, and plea negotiations ensued.  A deputy prosecutor proposed to respondent's attorney that, in exchange for a guilty plea to a charge of accessory after a felony murder, the prosecutor would recommend a 21-year sentence to be served concurrently with the concurrent burglary and assault sentences.  However, when defense counsel called the prosecutor three days later and communicated respondent's acceptance of the offer, the prosecutor told counsel that a mistake had been made, and withdrew the offer.  He proposed instead that, in exchange for a guilty plea, he would recommend a 21-year sentence to be served consecutively to the other sentences.  Respondent rejected the new offer, but after a mistrial was declared, he ultimately accepted the prosecutor's second offer, and the trial judge imposed a 21-year sentence to be served consecutively to the previous sentences.  After exhausting state remedies, respondent sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court with respect to his guilty plea.  The court dismissed the petition, holding that respondent had understood the consequences of his guilty plea, that he had received effective assistance of counsel, and that, because it was not established that he had detrimentally relied on the prosecutor's first proposed plea agreement, respondent had no right to enforce it.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that ""fairness"" precluded the prosecution's withdrawal of the plea proposal once accepted by respondent.
Held:  Respondent's acceptance of the prosecutor's first proposed plea bargain did not create a constitutional right to have the bargain specifically enforced, and he may not successfully attack his subsequent guilty plea.  Plea agreements are consistent with the requirements that guilty pleas be made voluntarily and intelligently.  If a defendant was not fairly apprised of its consequences, his guilty plea can be challenged under the Due Process Clause.  And when the prosecution breaches its promise with respect to an executed plea agreement, the defendant pleads guilty on a false premise, and hence his conviction cannot stand.  However, 
Page 467 U. S. 505
 respondent's plea was in no sense induced by the prosecutor's withdrawn offer, and it rested on no unfulfilled promise; he knew the prosecution would recommend a 21-year consecutive sentence.  Thus, because it did not impair the voluntariness or intelligence of his guilty plea, respondent's inability to enforce the prosecutor's first offer is without constitutional significance.  Neither is the question whether the prosecutor was negligent or otherwise culpable in first making and then withdrawing his offer relevant.  Cf. Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S. 257.  Pp.  467 U. S. 507-511.

After determining that four employees of appellee United States Postal Service were delinquent in their payment of state income taxes, appellant Franchise Tax Board of California served process on appellee ordering it to withhold the delinquent amounts from the employees' wages pursuant to a provision of the California Revenue and Taxation Code.  When appellee refused to comply, appellant filed an action in Federal District Court, alleging that appellee was liable under the Code for failing to honor the orders.  The District Court entered summary judgment for appellee, holding that 5 U.S.C.  5517, which authorized the agreement that California and the United States had made regarding the withholding of state income taxes from federal employees' pay applied only to withholding of anticipated tax liabilities, and not to delinquent liabilities.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting appellant's argument that 39 U.S.C.  401(1), which provides that appellee may ""sue and be sued in its official name,"" had waived any sovereign immunity that appellee might possess.

(a) Not only must this Court liberally construe the sue-and-be-sued clause of  401(1), but it also must presume that appellee's liability is the same as that of any other business.  FHA v. Burr, 309 U. S. 242.  No showing has been made to overcome that presumption.  Since an order to withhold cannot issue unless appellee owes the employee wages, appellee is nothing but a stakeholder; the order has the same effect on its ability to operate efficiently as it does that of any other employer subject to the California statute.

(b) It would be illogical to conclude that Congress differentiated between process issued by an administrative agency such as appellant and that of a court, for even if a court issued the order to withhold, neither appellee nor its employees would be in a materially different position.  In operation and effect, appellant's orders to withhold are identical to a court judgment, since they give rise to a binding obligation to pay the

Neither appellee nor its employees would obtain any additional protections from a requirement that such orders be issued by a court, since the liability cannot be contested until after the tax has been paid and a refund action brought.  Moreover, to construe  401(1) to require the issuance of judicial process before appellee need honor an order to withhold would create unwarranted disruption of the State's delinquent tax collection process, while simultaneously depriving the orders of some of their efficacy.

 Without explanation, the Court holds today that we lack appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1252 to review a judgment of a Federal District Court holding an entire Act of Congress unconstitutional as long as the party seeking review merely purports to challenge only the remedy ordered by the District Court even though the remedy sought on appeal would necessarily require a reversal of the District Court holding that the Act is unconstitutional.a1 The practical effect of this holding is that by merely addressing a challenge only to the remedy provided by the District Court, a direct appeal to this Court from a decision of a Federal District Court holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional can be frustrated. Notwithstanding the burdens on the Court-which have more than doubled in three decades-I am unwilling to say on the basis of the scant information before us that Congress 
Page 467 U.S. 1232 , 1233
 intended our appellate jurisdiction under 1252 to be so easily circumvented. Because of the significance of not only the jurisdictional but the underlying substantive issues presented by this appeal, I would set the case for argument, and postpone resolution of the jurisdictional question until argument on the merits. 
 A brief recitation of the procedural history of this case is necessary to put the Court's holding in perspective. In 1963, Congress passed 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. 6(d), known as the Equal Pay Act. The Act vested enforcement authority for the Equal Pay Act in the Secretary of Labor. However, in 1978, as part of an overall effort to centralize authority for enforcement of the various sex discrimination statutes, the Secretary's enforcement authority was transferred to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, 3 CFR 321 (1979). The Reorganization Plan was implemented pursuant to the Reorganization Act of 1977, 5 U.S.C. 901 et seq., which conferred on the President authority to reorganize Executive departments and agencies subject to certain specified congressional limitations. The Reorganization Act required the President to transmit any proposed reorganization plan to both Houses of Congress. 903. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 906(a), any plan submitted by the President became ""effective"" at the end of 60 days of continuous session of the Congress unless during that time either House passed a resolution of disapproval or its equivalent. 
 Reorganization Plan No. 1 was submitted to both Houses of Congress as required by the Reorganization Act. The House roundly rejected a resolution of disapproval. H.R.Res. 1049, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978); 124 Cong.Rec. 11336-11337 (1978). Although a resolution of disapproval was not brought to a vote in the Senate, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs unanimously recommended against passage of a resolution of disapproval. S.Res. 404, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978); S.Rep. No. 95-750, pp. 6, 10 (1978). Because neither House of Congress vetoed the Reorganization Plan, the Plan and the transfer of enforcement authority to appellant, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, became effective.

467 U.S. 354

Syllabus 
The Motor Carrier Act of 1980, in 49 U.S.C.  10706(b)(3), established specific guidelines to which motor carrier rate bureaus must conform if they are to receive antitrust immunity.  In 1980, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) issued an interpretative ruling explaining how it planned to implement these guidelines, and proposing a new remedy to enforce rate bureau agreements whereby the ICC would retroactively reject effective tariffs that had been submitted in substantial violation of such agreements.  Alarmed by the prospect of overcharge liability that would result from such retroactive rejection of tariffs, respondents, a group of motor carrier rate bureaus, petitioned the Court of Appeals to review the ICC's new remedy.  The Court of Appeals held that the ICC lacked the power to reject effective tariffs.
Held:  The proposed new remedy lies within the ICC's discretionary authority, and the ICC does not exceed its authority by nullifying effective tariffs submitted in substantial violation of rate bureau agreements.  Pp.  467 U. S. 359-371.
(a) Title 49 U.S.C.  10762(e), which authorizes the ICC to reject a motor carrier tariff if it violates the statutory requirements for publishing and filing tariffs or an implementing regulation, does not confer on the ICC the broad power to nullify effective tariffs retroactively.  This is indicated by  10762(e)'s language and the structure of the ICC's remedial authority under the Interstate Commerce Act.  Pp.  467 U. S. 361-364.
(b) The ICC, however, may elaborate upon its express statutory remedies when necessary to achieve specific statutory goals.  In this case, retroactive rejection of rate bureau tariffs is a justifiable adjunct to the ICC's express  10762(e) rejection authority, and to the extent there is an elaboration of that authority, it is necessary to ensure compliance with rate bureau agreements.  The rejection of effective tariffs submitted in substantial violation of such agreements simply extends the ICC's express rejection authority so that it may adequately supervise those agreements to see that they comply with the  10706(b)(3) guidelines.  The legislative history of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 makes it clear that, beyond the bounds of antitrust immunity granted in  10706, Congress 
Page 467 U. S. 355
 wanted the forces of competition to determine motor carrier tariffs, and intended that the ICC play a key role in holding carriers to the  10706(b)(3) guidelines.  And the remedy in question is a means of policing rate bureau agreements sufficiently direct and close to the ICC's statutory mandate to warrant approval of the remedy.  Pp.  467 U. S. 364-371.

Syllabus 
Since enactment of the Bonneville Project Act of 1937 (Project Act), the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has marketed low-cost hydroelectric power generated by a series of dams along the Columbia River.  BPA sells two types of power:  ""firm"" power (energy that BPA expects to produce under predictable streamflow conditions) and ""nonfirm"" power (energy that is in excess of firm power and is provided only when such excess exists).  BPA's customers include three groups:  (1) ""public bodies and cooperatives,"" which include public utilities and which are ""preference"" customers to whom BPA is required to give priority over nonpreference customers; (2) private, investor-owned utilities (I0Us); and (3) direct-service industrial customers (DSIs), which purchase power directly from BPA instead of through a utility.  IOUs and DSIs are ""nonpreference"" customers.  As demand for power increased to exceed BPA's generating capability, Congress moved to avert a customer struggle for BPA power by enacting in 1980 the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Regional Act).  Section 5(a) of that Act requires all power sales under the Act to be subject to the preference and priority provisions of the Project Act.  Section 5(d)(1)(B) requires BPA to offer each existing DSI customer a new contract that provides ""an amount of power"" equivalent to that to which such customer was entitled under its existing 1975 contract.  Section 10(c) provides that the Act does not ""alter, diminish, abridge, or otherwise affect"" federal laws by which the public utilities are entitled to preference.  Pursuant to the Regional Act, the Administrator of BPA offered new contracts to DSI customers for the same amount of power specified by the existing 1975 contracts, but, based upon his interpretation of the statute and its legislative history, concluded that terms of the power sales need not be the same as they had been under the 1975 contracts.  Those contracts had provided that a portion of the power supplied to DSIs could be interrupted ""at any time,"" thus making that portion subject to the preference provisions of the Project Act and enabling preference utilities to interrupt it whenever they wanted nonfirm power.  The Administrator concluded that such a provision in the new contracts would conflict with the 
Page 467 U. S. 381
 directive of  5(d)(1)(A) of the Regional Act that sales to DSIs should provide a portion of the Administrator's reserves for firm power loads.  Accordingly, the new contracts allowed power interruption only to protect BPA's firm power obligations, thus reducing the amount of nonfirm power available to preference utilities.  Respondent preference utilities challenged the new contracts by a petition for review in the Court of Appeals, claiming that those contracts violated the preference accorded to nonfirm power under the 1975 contracts, that  5(a) and 10(e) of the Regional Act required that DSI power be interruptible under the new contracts on the same terms as it was under the 1975 contracts, and that the conditions in the new contracts provided DSIs with a greater ""amount of power"" than the 1975 contracts, in violation of  5(d)(1)(B) of the Regional Act.  The Court of Appeals agreed, and found the Administrator's interpretation of the Regional Act unreasonable.
Held:
1. Giving the Administrator's interpretation of the Regional Act the deference it is due, his interpretation is a fully reasonable one, particularly in the absence of any statutory provision affirmatively indicating the contrary.  It is reasonable to conclude that the statutory directive that the new contracts be for the same ""amount of power"" as the 1975 contracts requires simply that the new contracts involve the same number of kilowatts, and, contrary to respondents' argument, does not preclude curtailing the situations in which power can be interrupted.  Nor is there any merit to respondents' argument that the terms of the new contracts conflict with  5(a) of the Regional Act.  While that section preserves the priority and preference provisions of the Project Act, that preference system merely determines the priority of different customers when the Administrator receives ""conflicting or competing"" applications for power that he is authorized to allocate.  The new contracts offered to the DSIs are not part of such an administrative allocation of power; the power sold pursuant to those contracts is allocated directly by statute.  The Project Act's preference provisions, as incorporated in the Regional Act, therefore simply do not apply to the contracts that the latter Act requires BPA to offer.  Pp.  467 U. S. 389-395.
2. The legislative history of the Regional Act confirms the Administrator's interpretation.  That history shows that Congress paid specific attention to power sales to DSIs, and consulted BPA on the relationship between those sales and the Act's broader purposes.  There is no indication that Congress intended the new DSI contracts to have provisions governing interruptibility that were the same as in the 1975 contracts.  Pp.  467 U. S. 396-398.
3. Because the Regional Act does not comprehensively establish the terms on which power is to be supplied to DSIs under the new contracts, 
Page 467 U. S. 382
 the Administrator has broad discretion to negotiate them.  Sales to DSIs under that Act are intricately related to the ""exchange"" program established by the Act to reduce the disparity existing under the Project Act whereby consumers served by public utilities enjoyed much cheaper power than consumers served by IOUs.  Pp.  467 U. S. 398-400.

Syllabus 
After he was ordered to surrender for deportation, respondent alien in 1977 moved to reopen the deportation proceedings, seeking relief under  243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA), which then authorized the Attorney General to withhold deportation of an alien upon a finding that the alien ""would be subject to persecution"" in the country to which he would be deported.  The Immigration Judge denied the motion without a hearing, and was upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which held that respondent had not met his burden of showing that there was a clear probability of persecution.  Respondent did not appeal this decision.  Subsequently, in 1981, after receiving another notice to surrender for deportation, respondent filed a second motion to reopen, again seeking relief under  243(h), which in the meantime had been amended by the Refugee Act of 1980 -- in conformity with the language of Article 33 of the 1968 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees that had been acceded to by the United States -- to provide that the Attorney General shall not deport an alien if the Attorney General determines that the alien's ""life or freedom would be threatened"" in the country to which he would be deported.  This motion was also denied without a hearing under the same standard of proof as was applied in the previous denial.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that respondent no longer had the burden of showing ""a clear probability of persecution,"" but instead could avoid deportation by showing a ""well-founded fear of persecution,"" the latter language being contained in a definition of the term ""refugee"" adopted by the United Nations Protocol.  The court concluded that the Refugee Act of 1980 so changed the standard of proof, and that respondent's showing entitled him to a hearing under the new standard.
Held:  An alien must establish a clear probability of persecution to avoid deportation under  243(h).  Pp.  467 U. S. 413-430.
(a) At least before 1968, it was clear that an alien was required to demonstrate a ""clear probability of persecution"" or a ""likelihood of persecution"" to be eligible for withholding of deportation under  243(h).  Relief under  243(h) was not, however, available to aliens at the border seeking refuge in the United States due to persecution.  They could 
Page 467 U. S. 408
 seek admission only under  203(a)(7) of the INA, and were required to establish a good reason to fear persecution.  The legislative history of the United States' accession to the United Nations Protocol discloses that the President and Senate believed that the Protocol was consistent with existing law.  While the Protocol was the source of some controversy with respect to the standard of proof for  243(h) claims for withholding of deportation, the accession to the Protocol did not appear to raise any questions concerning the standard to be applied for  203(a)(7) requests for admission, the ""good reason to fear persecution"" language being employed in such cases.  Pp.  467 U. S. 414-420.
(b) While the text of  243(h), as amended in 1980, does not specify how great a possibility of persecution must exist to qualify an alien for withholding of deportation, to the extent a standard can be inferred from the bare language, it appears that a likelihood of persecution is required.  The section provides for a withholding of deportation only if the alien's life or freedom ""would"" be threatened, not if he ""might"" or ""could"" be subject to persecution.  Respondent is seeking relief under  243(h), not under provisions which, as amended by the Refugee Act, employ the ""well-founded fear"" standard that now appears in  201(a)(42)(A) of the INA and that was adopted from the United Nations Protocol's definition of ""refugee.""  Section 243(h) does not refer to  201(a)(42)(A).  Hence, there is no textual basis in the statute for concluding that the well-founded-fear-of-persecution standard is relevant to the withholding of deportation under  243(h).  The 1980 amendment of  243(h) was recognized by Congress as a mere conforming amendment, added ""for the sake of clarity,"" and was plainly not intended to change the standard for withholding deportation.  There is no support in either  243(h)'s language, the structure of the amended INA, or the legislative history for the Court of Appeals' conclusion that every alien who qualifies as a ""refugee"" under the statutory definition is also entitled to a withholding of deportation under  243(h).  The Court of Appeals granted respondent relief based on its understanding of a standard which, even if properly understood, does not entitle an alien to withholding of deportation under  243(h).  Pp.  467 U. S. 421-430.

			"|"Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Stevic
No. 82-973
Argued December 6, 1983
Decided June 5, 1984
467 U.S. 407

Syllabus 
After he was ordered to surrender for deportation, respondent alien in 1977 moved to reopen the deportation proceedings, seeking relief under  243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA), which then authorized the Attorney General to withhold deportation of an alien upon a finding that the alien ""would be subject to persecution"" in the country to which he would be deported.  The Immigration Judge denied the motion without a hearing, and was upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which held that respondent had not met his burden of showing that there was a clear probability of persecution.  Respondent did not appeal this decision.  Subsequently, in 1981, after receiving another notice to surrender for deportation, respondent filed a second motion to reopen, again seeking relief under  243(h), which in the meantime had been amended by the Refugee Act of 1980 -- in conformity with the language of Article 33 of the 1968 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees that had been acceded to by the United States -- to provide that the Attorney General shall not deport an alien if the Attorney General determines that the alien's ""life or freedom would be threatened"" in the country to which he would be deported.  This motion was also denied without a hearing under the same standard of proof as was applied in the previous denial.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that respondent no longer had the burden of showing ""a clear probability of persecution,"" but instead could avoid deportation by showing a ""well-founded fear of persecution,"" the latter language being contained in a definition of the term ""refugee"" adopted by the United Nations Protocol.  The court concluded that the Refugee Act of 1980 so changed the standard of proof, and that respondent's showing entitled him to a hearing under the new standard.
Held:  An alien must establish a clear probability of persecution to avoid deportation under  243(h).  Pp.  467 U. S. 413-430.
(a) At least before 1968, it was clear that an alien was required to demonstrate a ""clear probability of persecution"" or a ""likelihood of persecution"" to be eligible for withholding of deportation under  243(h).  Relief under  243(h) was not, however, available to aliens at the border seeking refuge in the United States due to persecution.  They could 
Page 467 U. S. 408
 seek admission only under  203(a)(7) of the INA, and were required to establish a good reason to fear persecution.  The legislative history of the United States' accession to the United Nations Protocol discloses that the President and Senate believed that the Protocol was consistent with existing law.  While the Protocol was the source of some controversy with respect to the standard of proof for  243(h) claims for withholding of deportation, the accession to the Protocol did not appear to raise any questions concerning the standard to be applied for  203(a)(7) requests for admission, the ""good reason to fear persecution"" language being employed in such cases.  Pp.  467 U. S. 414-420.
(b) While the text of  243(h), as amended in 1980, does not specify how great a possibility of persecution must exist to qualify an alien for withholding of deportation, to the extent a standard can be inferred from the bare language, it appears that a likelihood of persecution is required.  The section provides for a withholding of deportation only if the alien's life or freedom ""would"" be threatened, not if he ""might"" or ""could"" be subject to persecution.  Respondent is seeking relief under  243(h), not under provisions which, as amended by the Refugee Act, employ the ""well-founded fear"" standard that now appears in  201(a)(42)(A) of the INA and that was adopted from the United Nations Protocol's definition of ""refugee.""  Section 243(h) does not refer to  201(a)(42)(A).  Hence, there is no textual basis in the statute for concluding that the well-founded-fear-of-persecution standard is relevant to the withholding of deportation under  243(h).  The 1980 amendment of  243(h) was recognized by Congress as a mere conforming amendment, added ""for the sake of clarity,"" and was plainly not intended to change the standard for withholding deportation.  There is no support in either  243(h)'s language, the structure of the amended INA, or the legislative history for the Court of Appeals' conclusion that every alien who qualifies as a ""refugee"" under the statutory definition is also entitled to a withholding of deportation under  243(h).  The Court of Appeals granted respondent relief based on its understanding of a standard which, even if properly understood, does not entitle an alien to withholding of deportation under  243(h).  Pp.  467 U. S. 421-430.

467 U.S. 253

Syllabus 
Section 320.5(3)(b) of the New York Family Court Act authorizes pretrial detention of an accused juvenile delinquent based on a finding that there is a ""serious risk"" that the juvenile ""may before the return date commit an act which if committed by an adult would constitute a crime.""  Appellees, juveniles who had been detained under  320.5(3)(b), brought a habeas corpus class action in Federal District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that  320.5(3)(b) violates, inter alia, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court struck down the statute as permitting detention without due process and ordered the release of all class members.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, since the vast majority of juveniles detained under the statute either have their cases dismissed before an adjudication of delinquency or are released after adjudication, the statute is administered, not for preventive purposes, but to impose punishment for unadjudicated criminal acts, and that therefore the statute is unconstitutional as to all juveniles.
Held:  Section 320.5(3)(b) is not invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  467 U. S. 263-281.
(a) Preventive detention under the statute serves the legitimate state objective, held in common with every State, of protecting both the juvenile and society from the hazards of pretrial crime.  That objective is compatible with the ""fundamental fairness"" demanded by the Due Process Clause in juvenile proceedings, and the terms and condition of confinement under  320.5(3)(b) are compatible with that objective.  Pretrial detention need not be considered punishment merely because a juvenile is subsequently discharged subject to conditions or put on probation.  And even when a case is terminated prior to factfinding, it does not follow that the decision to detain the juvenile pursuant to  320.5(3)(b) amounts to a due process violation.  Pp.  467 U. S. 264-274. 
Page 467 U. S. 254

(b) The procedural safeguards afforded by the Family Court Act to juveniles detained under  320.5(3)(b) prior to factfinding provide sufficient protection against erroneous and unnecessary deprivations of liberty.  Notice, a hearing, and a statement of facts and reasons are given to the juvenile prior to any detention, and a formal probable cause hearing is then held within a short time thereafter, if the factfinding hearing is not itself scheduled within three days.  There is no merit to the argument that the risk of erroneous and unnecessary detention is too high despite these procedures because the standard for detention is fatally vague.  From a legal point of view, there is nothing inherently unattainable about a prediction of future criminal conduct.  Such a prediction is an experienced one based on a host of variables that cannot be readily codified.  Moreover, the post-detention procedures -- habeas corpus review, appeals, and motions for reconsideration -- provide a sufficient mechanism for correcting on a case-by-case basis any erroneous detention.

No. 80, Orig.
Argued January 9, 1984
Decided June 4, 1984
467 U.S. 310

Syllabus 
In this original action, Colorado seeks an equitable apportionment of the waters of the Vermejo River, which originates in Colorado and flows into New Mexico.  Historically, all of the river's waters have been used exclusively by farm and industrial users in New Mexico.  After a trial at which both States presented extensive evidence, the Special Master recommended that Colorado be allowed to divert 4,000 acre-feet of water per year.  His recommendation rested on the grounds that New Mexico could compensate for some or all of the proposed Colorado diversion through reasonable water conservation measures, and that the injury, if any, to New Mexico would be outweighed by the benefit to Colorado from the diversion.  In considering New Mexico's exceptions to the Master's report, this Court held, inter alia, that the Master properly did not focus exclusively on the priority of uses along the river, and that other factors -- such as waste, availability of reasonable conservation measures, and the balance of benefit and harm from diversion -- could be considered in the apportionment calculus.  459 U. S. 176.  The case was remanded to the Master for additional specific findings to assist the Court in assessing whether the river's waters could reasonably be made available for diversion and in balancing the benefit and harm from diversion.  On the basis of the evidence previously received, the Master then developed additional factual findings and reaffirmed his original recommendation.  New Mexico again filed exceptions to the Master's report.
Held:
1. In this action for equitable apportionment, Colorado's proof is to be judged by a clear and convincing evidence standard.  Requiring Colorado to present such evidence in support of its proposed diversion is necessary to appropriately balance the unique interests involved in water rights disputes between sovereigns.  The standard reflects this Court's long-held view that a proposed diverter should bear most, though not all, of the risks of erroneous decision.  In addition, the standard accommodates society's competing interests in increasing the stability of property rights and in putting resources to their most efficient uses.  Pp.  467 U. S. 315-317.
2. Colorado has not met its burden of proving that a diversion should be permitted.  Pp.  467 U. S. 317-323.
(a) Colorado has not demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that reasonable conservation measures could compensate for 
Page 467 U. S. 311
 some or all of the proposed diversion.  For example, though Colorado alleged that New Mexico could improve its administration of water supplies, it did not point to specific measures New Mexico could take to conserve water.  Society's interest in minimizing erroneous decisions in equitable apportionment cases requires that hard facts, not suppositions or opinions, be the basis for interstate diversions.  Moreover, there is no evidence that Colorado has undertaken reasonable steps to minimize the amount of the diversion that will be required.  Pp.  467 U. S. 317-321.
(b) Nor has Colorado sustained its burden of showing that any injury to New Mexico would be outweighed by the benefits to Colorado from the proposed diversion.  Colorado has not committed itself to any specific long-term use for which future benefits can be studied and predicted.  By contrast, New Mexico has attempted to identify the harms that would result from the proposed diversion.  Asking for absolute precision in forecasts about the benefits and harms of a diversion would be unrealistic, but a State proposing a diversion must conceive and implement some type of long-range planning and analysis of the diversion it proposes, thereby reducing the uncertainties with which equitable apportionment judgments are made.  Pp.  467 U. S. 321-323.
(c) The mere fact that the Vermejo River originates in Colorado does not automatically entitle Colorado to a share of the river's waters.  Equitable apportionment of appropriated water rights turns on the benefits, harms, and efficiencies of competing uses, and thus the source of the river's waters is essentially irrelevant to the adjudication of these sovereigns' competing claims.  P.  467 U. S. 323.
Exceptions sustained and case dismissed.

Syllabus 
To bring destabilizing competition among dairy farmers under control, the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (Act) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) to issue milk market orders setting the minimum prices that handlers (those who process dairy products) must pay to producers (dairy farmers) for their milk products.  Pursuant to this authority, the Secretary issued market orders under which handlers are required to pay for ""reconstituted milk"" (milk manufactured by mixing milk powder with water) the minimum price for Class II milk (raw milk used to produce such products as dry milk powder), rather than the higher price covering Class I milk (raw milk processed and bottled for fluid consumption).  The orders assume that handlers will use the reconstituted milk to manufacture surplus milk products, but for any portion of reconstituted milk not so used, handlers must make a ""compensatory payment"" equal to the difference between Class I and Class II milk product prices.  Respondents -- three individual consumers of fluid dairy products, a handler regulated by the market orders, and a nonprofit organization -- brought suit in Federal District Court, contending that the compensatory payment requirement makes reconstituted milk uneconomical for handlers to process.  The District Court held, inter alia, that the consumers had no standing to challenge the orders.  The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that the consumers had suffered injury-in-fact, their injuries were redressable, and they were within the zone of interests protected by the Act, and that the Act's structure and purposes did not reveal the type of ""clear and convincing evidence of congressional intent needed to overcome the presumption in favor of judicial review.""
Held:  The individual consumers may not obtain judicial review of the milk market orders in question.  Pp.  467 U. S. 345-353.
(a) It is clear from the structure of the Act that Congress intended that judicial review of market orders ordinarily be confined to suits by handlers in accordance with the provisions of the Act expressly entitling them to such review in a federal district court after exhausting their administrative remedies.  Allowing consumers to sue the Secretary would severely disrupt the Act's complex and delicate administrative scheme.  Pp.  467 U. S. 345-348.

(b) The presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action does not control in cases such as this one, where the congressional intent to preclude consumer suits is ""fairly discernible"" in the detail of the legislative scheme.

468 U.S. 85

Syllabus 
In 1981, petitioner National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) adopted a plan for the televising of college football games of its member institutions for the 1982-1985 seasons.  The plan recites that it is intended to reduce the adverse effect of live television upon football game attendance.  The plan limits the total amount of televised intercollegiate football games and the number of games that any one college may televise, and no member of the NCAA is permitted to make any sale of television rights except in accordance with the plan.  The NCAA has separate agreements with the two carrying networks, the American Broadcasting Cos. and the Columbia Broadcasting System, granting each network the right to telecast the live ""exposures"" described in the plan.  Each network agreed to pay a specified ""minimum aggregate compensation"" to the participating NCAA members, and was authorized to negotiate directly with the members for the right to televise their games.  Respondent Universities, in addition to being NCAA members, are members of the College Football Association (CFA), which was originally organized to promote the interests of major football-playing colleges within the NCAA structure, but whose members eventually claimed that they should have a greater voice in the formulation of football television policy than they had in the NCAA.  The CFA accordingly negotiated a contract with the National Broadcasting Co. that would have allowed a more liberal number of television appearances for each college and would have increased the revenues realized by CFA members.  In response, the NCAA announced that it would take disciplinary action against any CFA member that complied with the CFA-NBC contract.  Respondents then commenced an action in Federal District Court, which, after an extended trial, held that the controls exercised by the NCAA over the televising of college football games violated  1 of the Sherman Act, and accordingly granted injunctive relief.  The court found that competition in the relevant market -- defined as ""live college football television"" -- had been restrained in three ways:  (1) the NCAA fixed the price for particular telecasts; (2) its exclusive network contracts were tantamount to a group boycott of all other potential broadcasters 
Page 468 U. S. 86
 and its threat of sanctions against its members constituted a threatened boycott of potential competitors; and (3) its plan placed an artificial limit on the production of televised college football.  The Court of Appeals agreed that the Sherman Act had been violated, holding that the NCAA's television plan constituted illegal per se price-fixing, and that, even if it were not per se illegal, its anticompetitive limitation on price and output was not offset by any procompetitive justifications sufficient to save the plan, even when the totality of the circumstances was examined.
Held:  The NCAA's television plan violates  1 of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  468 U. S. 98-120.
(a) While the plan constitutes horizontal price-fixing and output limitation, restraints that ordinarily would be held ""illegal per se,"" it would be inappropriate to apply a per se rule in this case where it involves an industry in which horizontal restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all.  The NCAA and its members market competition itself -- contests between competing institutions.  Thus, despite the fact that restraints on the ability of NCAA members to compete in terms of price and output are involved, a fair evaluation of their competitive character requires consideration, under the Rule of Reason, of the NCAA's justifications for the restraints.

Under the Rule of Reason, these hallmarks of anticompetitive behavior place upon the NCAA a heavy burden of establishing an affirmative defense that competitively justifies this apparent deviation from the operations of a free market.  The NCAA's argument that its television plan can have no significant anticompetitive effect, since it has no market power, must be rejected.  As a matter of law, the absence of proof of market power does not justify a naked restriction on price or output, and, as a factual matter, it is evident from the record that the NCAA does possess market power.

The television plan is not even arguably tailored to serve such an interest.  It does not regulate the amount of money that any college may spend on its football program or the way the colleges may use their football program revenues, but simply imposes a restriction on one source of revenue that is more important to some colleges than to others.  There is no evidence that such restriction produces any greater measure of equality throughout the NCAA than would a restriction on alumni donations, tuition rates, or any other revenue-producing activity.  Moreover, the District Court's well-supported finding that many more games would be televised in a free market than under the NCAA plan is a compelling demonstration that the plan's controls do not serve any legitimate procompetitive purpose.

of the University of Oklahoma
No. 83-271
Argued March 20, 1984
Decided June 2, 1984
468 U.S. 85

Syllabus 
In 1981, petitioner National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) adopted a plan for the televising of college football games of its member institutions for the 1982-1985 seasons.  The plan recites that it is intended to reduce the adverse effect of live television upon football game attendance.  The plan limits the total amount of televised intercollegiate football games and the number of games that any one college may televise, and no member of the NCAA is permitted to make any sale of television rights except in accordance with the plan.  The NCAA has separate agreements with the two carrying networks, the American Broadcasting Cos. and the Columbia Broadcasting System, granting each network the right to telecast the live ""exposures"" described in the plan.  Each network agreed to pay a specified ""minimum aggregate compensation"" to the participating NCAA members, and was authorized to negotiate directly with the members for the right to televise their games.  Respondent Universities, in addition to being NCAA members, are members of the College Football Association (CFA), which was originally organized to promote the interests of major football-playing colleges within the NCAA structure, but whose members eventually claimed that they should have a greater voice in the formulation of football television policy than they had in the NCAA.  The CFA accordingly negotiated a contract with the National Broadcasting Co. that would have allowed a more liberal number of television appearances for each college and would have increased the revenues realized by CFA members.  In response, the NCAA announced that it would take disciplinary action against any CFA member that complied with the CFA-NBC contract.  Respondents then commenced an action in Federal District Court, which, after an extended trial, held that the controls exercised by the NCAA over the televising of college football games violated  1 of the Sherman Act, and accordingly granted injunctive relief.  The court found that competition in the relevant market -- defined as ""live college football television"" -- had been restrained in three ways:  (1) the NCAA fixed the price for particular telecasts; (2) its exclusive network contracts were tantamount to a group boycott of all other potential broadcasters 
Page 468 U. S. 86
 and its threat of sanctions against its members constituted a threatened boycott of potential competitors; and (3) its plan placed an artificial limit on the production of televised college football.  The Court of Appeals agreed that the Sherman Act had been violated, holding that the NCAA's television plan constituted illegal per se price-fixing, and that, even if it were not per se illegal, its anticompetitive limitation on price and output was not offset by any procompetitive justifications sufficient to save the plan, even when the totality of the circumstances was examined.
Held:  The NCAA's television plan violates  1 of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  468 U. S. 98-120.
(a) While the plan constitutes horizontal price-fixing and output limitation, restraints that ordinarily would be held ""illegal per se,"" it would be inappropriate to apply a per se rule in this case where it involves an industry in which horizontal restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all.  The NCAA and its members market competition itself -- contests between competing institutions.  Thus, despite the fact that restraints on the ability of NCAA members to compete in terms of price and output are involved, a fair evaluation of their competitive character requires consideration, under the Rule of Reason, of the NCAA's justifications for the restraints.  But an analysis under the Rule of Reason does not change the ultimate focus of the inquiry, which is whether or not the challenged restraints enhance competition.  Pp.  468 U. S. 98-104.
(b) The NCAA television plan, on its face, constitutes a restraint upon the operation of a free market, and the District Court's findings establish that the plan has operated to raise price and reduce output, both of which are unresponsive to consumer preference.  Under the Rule of Reason, these hallmarks of anticompetitive behavior place upon the NCAA a heavy burden of establishing an affirmative defense that competitively justifies this apparent deviation from the operations of a free market.  The NCAA's argument that its television plan can have no significant anticompetitive effect, since it has no market power, must be rejected.  As a matter of law, the absence of proof of market power does not justify a naked restriction on price or output, and, as a factual matter, it is evident from the record that the NCAA does possess market power.  Pp.  468 U. S. 104-113.
(c) The record does not support the NCAA's proffered justification for its television plan that it constitutes a cooperative ""joint venture"" which assists in the marketing of broadcast rights, and hence is procompetitive.  The District Court's contrary findings undermine such a justification.  Pp.  468 U. S. 113-115.

No. 83-630
Argued March 28, 1984
Decided May 30, 1984
467 U.S. 216

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a resident alien, applied to the Texas Secretary of State to become a notary public, who under Texas law authenticates written instruments, administers oaths, and takes out-of-court depositions.  Petitioner's application was denied because he failed to satisfy the requirement of a Texas statute (Article 5949(2)) that a notary public be a United States citizen.  After an unsuccessful administrative appeal, petitioner (and another individual) brought suit in Federal District Court, claiming that Article 5949(2) violated the Federal Constitution.  The District Court ruled in petitioner's favor, concluding that the citizenship requirement, reviewed under a strict scrutiny standard, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the proper standard for review was the rational relationship test, and that Article 5949(2) satisfied that test.
Held:  Article 5949(2) violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  467 U. S. 219-228.
(a) As a general matter, a state law that discriminates on the basis of alienage can be sustained only if it can withstand strict judicial scrutiny.  In order to withstand strict scrutiny, the law must advance a compelling state interest by the least restrictive means available.  The ""political function"" exception to the strict scrutiny rule applies to laws that exclude aliens from positions intimately related to the process of democratic self-government.  Under this exception, the standard of review is lowered when evaluating the validity of exclusions that entrust only to citizens important elective and nonelective positions whose operations go to the heart of representative government.  Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U. S. 634; Cabell v. Chavez-Salido, 454 U. S. 432.  Pp.  467 U. S. 219-222.
(b) The ""political function"" exception is inapplicable to Article 5949(2).  Notaries public do not fall within the category of officials who perform functions that go to the heart of representative government merely because they are designated as public officers by the Texas Constitution.  The dispositive factor is the actual function of a position, not its source.  The focus of the inquiry is whether the position is such that the officeholder will necessarily exercise broad discretionary power over the formulation or execution of public policies importantly affecting the citizen population.  Although there is a critical need for a notary's duties to be 
Page 467 U. S. 217
 carried out correctly and with integrity, those duties are essentially clerical and ministerial.  Texas notaries are not invested with policymaking responsibility or broad discretion in the execution of public policy that requires the routine exercise of authority over individuals.  Cf. In re Griffiths, 413 U. S. 717.  Pp.  467 U. S. 222-227.
(c) Article 5949(2) does not meet the applicable strict scrutiny standard of judicial review.  To satisfy such standard, the State must show that the statute furthers a compelling state interest by the least restrictive means practically available.  With regard to the State's asserted interest in ensuring that notaries are familiar with Texas law, there is nothing in the record indicating that resident aliens, as a class, are so incapable of familiarizing themselves with Texas law as to justify the State's absolute and class-wide exclusion.  Furthermore, if the State's concern were truly ""compelling,"" one would expect the State to give some sort of test actually measuring a person's familiarity with the law.  The State, however, administers no such test.  Similarly inadequate is the State's purported interest in ensuring the availability of notaries' testimony years after their acts.  The State failed to advance a factual showing that the unavailability of notaries' testimony presents a real, as opposed to a merely speculative, problem to the State.  Pp.  467 U. S. 227-228.

||"Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff
No. 83-141
Argued March 26, 1984
Decided May 30, 1984*
467 U.S. 229

Syllabus 
To reduce the perceived social and economic evils of a land oligopoly traceable to the early high chiefs of the Hawaiian Islands, the Hawaii Legislature enacted the Land Reform Act of 1967 (Act), which created a land condemnation scheme whereby title in real property is taken from lessors and transferred to lessees in order to reduce the concentration of land ownership.  Under the Act, lessees living on single-family residential lots within tracts at least five acres in size are entitled to ask appellant Hawaii Housing Authority (HHA) to condemn the property on which they live.  When appropriate applications by lessees are filed, the Act authorizes HHA to hold a public hearing to determine whether the State's acquisition of the tract will ""effectuate the public purposes"" of the Act.  If HHA determines that these public purposes will be served, it is authorized to designate some or all of the lots in the tract for acquisition.  It then acquires, at prices set by a condemnation trial or by negotiation between lessors and lessees, the former fee owners' ""right, title, and interest"" in the land, and may then sell the land titles to the applicant lessees.  After HHA had held a public hearing on the proposed acquisition of appellees' lands and had found that such acquisition would effectuate the Act's public purposes, it directed appellees to negotiate with certain lessees concerning the sale of the designated properties.  When these negotiations failed, HHA ordered appellees to submit to compulsory arbitration as provided by the Act.  Rather than comply with this order, appellees filed suit in Federal District Court, asking that the Act be declared unconstitutional and that its enforcement be enjoined.  The court temporarily restrained the State from proceeding against appellees' estates, but subsequently, while holding the compulsory arbitration and compensation formulae provisions of the Act unconstitutional, refused to issue a preliminary injunction and ultimately granted partial summary judgment to HHA and private appellants who had intervened, holding 
Page 467 U. S. 230
 the remainder of the Act constitutional under the Public Use Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.  After deciding that the District Court had properly not abstained from exercising its jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Act violates the ""public use"" requirement of the Fifth Amendment.
Held:
1. The District Court was not required to abstain from exercising its jurisdiction.  Pp.  467 U. S. 236-239.
(a) Abstention under Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496, is unnecessary.  Pullman abstention is limited to uncertain questions of state law, and here there is no uncertain question of state law, since the Act unambiguously provides that the power to condemn is ""for a public use and purpose.""  Thus, the question, uncomplicated by ambiguous language, is whether the Act, on its face, is unconstitutional.  Pp.  467 U. S. 236-237.
(b) Nor is abstention required under Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37.  Younger abstention is required only when state court proceedings are initiated before any proceedings of substance on the merits have occurred in federal court.  Here, state judicial proceedings had not been initiated at the time proceedings of substance took place in the District Court, the District Court having issued a preliminary injunction before HHA filed its first state eminent domain suit in state court.  And the fact that HHA's administrative proceedings occurred before the federal suit was filed did not require abstention, since the Act clearly states that those proceedings are not part of, or are not themselves, a judicial proceeding.  Pp.  467 U. S. 237-239.
2. The Act does not violate the ""public use"" requirement of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  467 U. S. 239-244.
(a) That requirement is coterminous with the scope of a sovereign's police powers.  This Court will not substitute its judgment for a legislature's judgment as to what constitutes ""public use"" unless the use is palpably without reasonable foundation.  Where the exercise of the eminent domain power is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose, a compensated taking is not prohibited by the Public Use Clause.  Here, regulating oligopoly and the evils associated with it is a classic exercise of a State's police powers, and redistribution of fees simple to reduce such evils is a rational exercise of the eminent domain power.  Pp.  467 U. S. 239-243.
(b) The mere fact that property taken outright by eminent domain is transferred in the first instance to private beneficiaries does not condemn that taking as having only a private purpose.  Government does not itself have to use property to legitimate the taking; it is only the taking's purpose, and not its mechanics, that must pass scrutiny under 
Page 467 U. S. 231
 the Public Use Clause.  And the fact that a state legislature, and not Congress, made the public use determination does not mean that judicial deference is less appropriate.  Pp.  467 U. S. 243-244.

To reduce the perceived social and economic evils of a land oligopoly traceable to the early high chiefs of the Hawaiian Islands, the Hawaii Legislature enacted the Land Reform Act of 1967 (Act), which created a land condemnation scheme whereby title in real property is taken from lessors and transferred to lessees in order to reduce the concentration of land ownership.  Under the Act, lessees living on single-family residential lots within tracts at least five acres in size are entitled to ask appellant Hawaii Housing Authority (HHA) to condemn the property on which they live.  When appropriate applications by lessees are filed, the Act authorizes HHA to hold a public hearing to determine whether the State's acquisition of the tract will ""effectuate the public purposes"" of the Act.  If HHA determines that these public purposes will be served, it is authorized to designate some or all of the lots in the tract for acquisition.  It then acquires, at prices set by a condemnation trial or by negotiation between lessors and lessees, the former fee owners' ""right, title, and interest"" in the land, and may then sell the land titles to the applicant lessees.  After HHA had held a public hearing on the proposed acquisition of appellees' lands and had found that such acquisition would effectuate the Act's public purposes, it directed appellees to negotiate with certain lessees concerning the sale of the designated properties.  When these negotiations failed, HHA ordered appellees to submit to compulsory arbitration as provided by the Act.  Rather than comply with this order, appellees filed suit in Federal District Court, asking that the Act be declared unconstitutional and that its enforcement be enjoined.  The court temporarily restrained the State from proceeding against appellees' estates, but subsequently, while holding the compulsory arbitration and compensation formulae provisions of the Act unconstitutional, refused to issue a preliminary injunction and ultimately granted partial summary judgment to HHA and private appellants who had intervened, holding 
Page 467 U. S. 230
 the remainder of the Act constitutional under the Public Use Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.  After deciding that the District Court had properly not abstained from exercising its jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Act violates the ""public use"" requirement of the Fifth Amendment.
Held:
1. The District Court was not required to abstain from exercising its jurisdiction.  Pp.  467 U. S. 236-239.
(a) Abstention under Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496, is unnecessary.  Pullman abstention is limited to uncertain questions of state law, and here there is no uncertain question of state law, since the Act unambiguously provides that the power to condemn is ""for a public use and purpose.""  Thus, the question, uncomplicated by ambiguous language, is whether the Act, on its face, is unconstitutional.  Pp.  467 U. S. 236-237.
(b) Nor is abstention required under Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37.  Younger abstention is required only when state court proceedings are initiated before any proceedings of substance on the merits have occurred in federal court.  Here, state judicial proceedings had not been initiated at the time proceedings of substance took place in the District Court, the District Court having issued a preliminary injunction before HHA filed its first state eminent domain suit in state court.  And the fact that HHA's administrative proceedings occurred before the federal suit was filed did not require abstention, since the Act clearly states that those proceedings are not part of, or are not themselves, a judicial proceeding.  Pp.  467 U. S. 237-239.
2. The Act does not violate the ""public use"" requirement of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  467 U. S. 239-244.
(a) That requirement is coterminous with the scope of a sovereign's police powers.  This Court will not substitute its judgment for a legislature's judgment as to what constitutes ""public use"" unless the use is palpably without reasonable foundation.  Where the exercise of the eminent domain power is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose, a compensated taking is not prohibited by the Public Use Clause.  Here, regulating oligopoly and the evils associated with it is a classic exercise of a State's police powers, and redistribution of fees simple to reduce such evils is a rational exercise of the eminent domain power.  Pp.  467 U. S. 239-243.
(b) The mere fact that property taken outright by eminent domain is transferred in the first instance to private beneficiaries does not condemn that taking as having only a private purpose.  Government does not itself have to use property to legitimate the taking; it is only the taking's purpose, and not its mechanics, that must pass scrutiny under 
Page 467 U. S. 231
 the Public Use Clause.  And the fact that a state legislature, and not Congress, made the public use determination does not mean that judicial deference is less appropriate.  Pp.  467 U. S. 243-244.

No. 82-629
Argued November 29, 1983
Decided May 29, 1984
467 U.S. 138

Syllabus 
The North Dakota statute (Chapter 27-19) governing the Indian civil jurisdiction of the state courts provides that jurisdiction shall extend ""over all civil causes of action which arise on an Indian reservation upon acceptance by Indian citizens.""  North Dakota's Enabling Act provides that all Indian land ""shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of Congress.""  Petitioner Indian Tribe, which had not accepted state civil jurisdiction under Chapter 27-19, employed respondent Wold Engineering (hereafter respondent) to design and build a water supply system on petitioner's reservation in North Dakota.  When the project was completed, it did not perform to petitioner's satisfaction, and petitioner sued respondent in a North Dakota state court for negligence and breach of contract.  At the time suit was filed, petitioner's tribal court did not have jurisdiction over a claim by an Indian against a non-Indian in the absence of an agreement by the parties.  Although the subject matter of petitioner's complaint was within the general scope of the state court's jurisdiction, that court granted respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over any claim arising in Indian country, including a claim by an Indian against a non-Indian.  The North Dakota Supreme Court affirmed.  Interpreting Chapter 27-19 to disclaim state court jurisdiction over a claim against a non-Indian by an Indian tribe that had not accepted jurisdiction under the statute, the court determined that the North Dakota Legislature had disclaimed jurisdiction pursuant to the federal statute (Pub.L. 280) governing state jurisdiction over Indian country and that such disclaimer, because it had been authorized by Pub.L. 280, did not violate either the North Dakota or Federal Constitution.  The court rejected petitioner's argument that the jurisdiction that it had recognized in Vermillion v. Spotted Elk, 85 N.W.2d 432 wherein it was held that the existing jurisdictional disclaimers in the State's Enabling Act and Constitution foreclosed civil jurisdiction over Indian country only in cases involving interests in Indian lands themselves -- had not been extinguished altogether, and that the North Dakota courts possessed ""residuary jurisdiction"" over a claim by an Indian against a non-Indian following the enactment of Pub.L. 280 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which amended 
Page 467 U. S. 139
 Pub.L. 280 to require that all subsequent assertions of jurisdiction be preceded by tribal consent.  The court also rejected petitioner's argument that to prohibit a suit such as petitioner's would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and deny petitioner equal access to the courts in violation of the North Dakota Constitution.
Held:
1. No federal law or policy required the North Dakota courts to forgo in this case the jurisdiction recognized in Vermillion, supra.  Pp.  467 U. S. 147-151.
(a) The exercise of state court jurisdiction in this case would not interfere with the right of tribal Indians to govern themselves under their own laws.  As a general matter, tribal self-government is not impeded when a State allows an Indian to seek relief against a non-Indian concerning a claim arising in Indian country.  The exercise of state jurisdiction is particularly compatible with tribal autonomy when, as here, the suit is brought by the tribe itself and the tribal court lacked jurisdiction over the claim at the time the suit was instituted.  Pp.  467 U. S. 147-149.
(b) Nor would the exercise of state jurisdiction here be inconsistent with the federal and tribal interests reflected in North Dakota's Enabling Act or in Pub.L. 280.  The legislative record suggests only that the Enabling Act's phrase ""absolute [congressional] jurisdiction and control"" was meant to foreclose state regulation and taxation of Indians and their lands, not that Indians were to be prohibited from entering state courts to pursue judicial remedies against non-Indians.  Public Law 280 does not either require North Dakota to disclaim the basic jurisdiction recognized in Vermillion or authorize it to do so.  Nothing in Pub.L. 280's language or legislative history indicates that it was meant to divest States of preexisting and otherwise lawfully assumed jurisdiction.  Pp.  467 U. S. 149-151.
2. Where it is uncertain whether the North Dakota Supreme Court's interpretation of Chapter 27-19 rested on a misconception of federal law, its judgment will be vacated, and the case will be remanded to that court for reconsideration of the state law question.  Pp.  467 U. S. 151-158.
(a) The court's incorrect assumption that Pub.L. 280 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968 either authorized North Dakota to disclaim jurisdiction or affirmatively forbade the exercise of jurisdiction absent tribal consent appears to have been the sole basis relied upon by the court to avoid holding the jurisdictional disclaimer unconstitutional as applied in this case.  Pp.  467 U. S. 154-155.
(b) The manner in which the court rejected the availability of ""residuary jurisdiction"" leaves open the possibility that, despite the court's references to state law, it regarded federal law as an affirmative 
Page 467 U. S. 140
 bar to the exercise of jurisdiction here and interpreted state law to avoid a perceived conflict.  Pp.  467 U. S. 155-157.
(c) The conclusion that the North Dakota Supreme Court's state law decision may have rested on federal law is buttressed by prudential considerations.  If that court is not given an opportunity to reconsider its conclusions with the proper understanding of federal law, this Court, contrary to the fundamental rule that it will not reach constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them, will be required to decide whether North Dakota has denied petitioner equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  467 U. S. 157-158.

Syllabus 
Respondent, a Federal Government employee injured in an automobile accident in Pennsylvania while on official business, received payment from the Government under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) for his medical expenses and lost wages.  Under FECA, the Government is not liable for losses such as pain and suffering.  Respondent subsequently instituted a tort action in a Pennsylvania state court against the driver of the other automobile.  Such an action is generally limited under the Pennsylvania No-fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act to recovery for noneconomic losses like pain and suffering.  After respondent eventually settled the case for a sum that represented compensation for noneconomic losses alone, the United States sought to be reimbursed for its FECA payments out of the settlement, asserting that it was entitled to reimbursement pursuant to the provision of FECA (5 U.S.C. 8132) prescribing that, whenever a federal employee suffers injury or death compensable under FECA ""under circumstances creating a legal liability in a person other than the United States to pay damages,"" and the employee or his beneficiaries receive ""money or other property in satisfaction of that liability as the result of suit or settlement,"" they ""shall refund to the United States the amount of compensation paid by the United States.""  Respondent declined to pay over the requested sum and commenced an action in Federal District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Government's right of reimbursement under  8132 was confined to recovery out of damages awards or settlements for economic losses of the sort covered by FECA, and that an award or settlement confined to noneconomic losses like pain and suffering was immune from recovery under  8132.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the United States, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Section 8132 entitles the United States to be reimbursed for FECA compensation out of any damages award or settlement made in satisfaction of third-party liability for personal injury or death, regardless of whether the award or settlement is for losses other than medical expenses and lost wages.  On its face, the statute does not confine the United States to the rights of a subrogee with respect to the specific classes of expenses paid by it to injured employees under FECA; instead, it expressly creates a general right of reimbursement that obtains 
Page 467 U. S. 168
 without regard to whether the employee's third-party recovery includes losses that are excluded from FECA coverage.  This reading of  8132 is reinforced by the parallel terms of  8131, which governs the right of the United States itself to prosecute an employee's third-party action.  And nothing in FECA's legislative history establishes that  8132 means something less than what it says.  While no-fault automobile insurance statutes were not in existence when FECA was enacted in 1916, the possibility that third-party recoveries might encompass compensation for pain and suffering was well known, and Congress has not subsequently acted to restrict the types of third-party recoveries from which the United States may obtain reimbursement.

467 U.S. 180

Syllabus 
Four of the respondents, who were all inmates in a federal prison, were placed in administrative detention in individual cells during the investigation of the 1978 murder of a fellow inmate.  They remained in administrative detention without appointed counsel for approximately 19 months before their indictment on federal criminal charges and their arraignment in Federal District Court, when counsel was appointed for them.  The District Court denied their motion to dismiss the indictment on the asserted ground that their administrative confinement without appointed counsel violated their Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and they were ultimately convicted of murder.  The other two respondents were placed in administrative detention without appointed counsel for approximately eight months during the investigation of a 1979 murder of another inmate.  Counsel was appointed for them and they were released from administrative detention when they were arraigned on a federal indictment.  They were also ultimately convicted of murder over their contention that the preindictment administrative confinement violated their Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  On consolidated appeals, the Court of Appeals reversed.  Although recognizing that a plurality of this Court had concluded in Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches only when formal judicial proceedings are initiated against an individual by way of indictment, information, arraignment, or preliminary hearing, the Court of Appeals noted that Kirby was not a prison case, and concluded that an indigent inmate who is the subject of a felony investigation and who is isolated in administrative detention for more than 90 days must be afforded counsel after 90 days or else be released back into the prison population.
Held:  Respondents were not constitutionally entitled to the appointment of counsel while they were in administrative segregation and before any adversary judicial proceedings had been initiated against them.  Pp.  467 U. S. 187-192.
(a) The right to counsel attaches only at or after the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings against the defendant.  Cf. Kirby v. Illinois, supra, at  406 U. S. 688-689.  This interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is consistent not only with the literal language of the 
Page 467 U. S. 181
 Amendment, which requires the existence of both a ""criminal prosecutio[n]"" and an ""accused,"" but also with the purposes that the right to counsel serves, including assuring aid at trial and at ""critical"" pretrial proceedings when the accused is confronted with the intricacies of criminal law or with the expert advocacy of the public prosecutor, or both.  Pp.  467 U. S. 187-189.
(b) The Court of Appeals' analogy to Sixth Amendment speedy trial cases -- which hold that that Sixth Amendment right may attach as early as the time of arrest -- is inapt.  The speedy trial right and the right to counsel protect different interests, and any analogy between an arrest and an inmate's administrative detention pending investigation is not relevant to a proper determination of when the right to counsel attaches.  Pp.  467 U. S. 189-190.
(c) The Court of Appeals' holding also confuses the purpose of the right to counsel with purposes that are served by the Fifth Amendment due process guarantee and the statutes of limitations applicable to the particular crime being investigated.  The court was concerned with affording protection against the possibility that the Government might delay the initiation of formal charges while it developed its case against the isolated and unaided inmate, during which time physical evidence might deteriorate, witnesses' memories might dim, and alibi witnesses might be transferred to other facilities.  Such concerns, while legitimate ones, do not implicate the right to counsel.  Providing a defendant with a preindictment private investigator is not a purpose of the right to counsel.  Pp.  467 U. S. 191-192.

Four of the respondents, who were all inmates in a federal prison, were placed in administrative detention in individual cells during the investigation of the 1978 murder of a fellow inmate.  They remained in administrative detention without appointed counsel for approximately 19 months before their indictment on federal criminal charges and their arraignment in Federal District Court, when counsel was appointed for them.  The District Court denied their motion to dismiss the indictment on the asserted ground that their administrative confinement without appointed counsel violated their Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and they were ultimately convicted of murder.  The other two respondents were placed in administrative detention without appointed counsel for approximately eight months during the investigation of a 1979 murder of another inmate.  Counsel was appointed for them and they were released from administrative detention when they were arraigned on a federal indictment.  They were also ultimately convicted of murder over their contention that the preindictment administrative confinement violated their Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  On consolidated appeals, the Court of Appeals reversed.  Although recognizing that a plurality of this Court had concluded in Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches only when formal judicial proceedings are initiated against an individual by way of indictment, information, arraignment, or preliminary hearing, the Court of Appeals noted that Kirby was not a prison case, and concluded that an indigent inmate who is the subject of a felony investigation and who is isolated in administrative detention for more than 90 days must be afforded counsel after 90 days or else be released back into the prison population.
Held:  Respondents were not constitutionally entitled to the appointment of counsel while they were in administrative segregation and before any adversary judicial proceedings had been initiated against them.  Pp.  467 U. S. 187-192.
(a) The right to counsel attaches only at or after the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings against the defendant.  Cf. Kirby v. Illinois, supra, at  406 U. S. 688-689.  This interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is consistent not only with the literal language of the 
Page 467 U. S. 181
 Amendment, which requires the existence of both a ""criminal prosecutio[n]"" and an ""accused,"" but also with the purposes that the right to counsel serves, including assuring aid at trial and at ""critical"" pretrial proceedings when the accused is confronted with the intricacies of criminal law or with the expert advocacy of the public prosecutor, or both.  Pp.  467 U. S. 187-189.
(b) The Court of Appeals' analogy to Sixth Amendment speedy trial cases -- which hold that that Sixth Amendment right may attach as early as the time of arrest -- is inapt.  The speedy trial right and the right to counsel protect different interests, and any analogy between an arrest and an inmate's administrative detention pending investigation is not relevant to a proper determination of when the right to counsel attaches.  Pp.  467 U. S. 189-190.
(c) The Court of Appeals' holding also confuses the purpose of the right to counsel with purposes that are served by the Fifth Amendment due process guarantee and the statutes of limitations applicable to the particular crime being investigated.  The court was concerned with affording protection against the possibility that the Government might delay the initiation of formal charges while it developed its case against the isolated and unaided inmate, during which time physical evidence might deteriorate, witnesses' memories might dim, and alibi witnesses might be transferred to other facilities.  Such concerns, while legitimate ones, do not implicate the right to counsel.  Providing a defendant with a preindictment private investigator is not a purpose of the right to counsel.  Pp.  467 U. S. 191-192.

Syllabus 
Arizona's statutory capital sentencing scheme provides that, after a murder conviction, the trial judge, with no jury, must conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine whether death is the appropriate sentence.  The judge must choose between two options:  death or life imprisonment without possibility of parole for 25 years.  The death sentence may not be imposed unless at least one statutory aggravating circumstance is present, but must be imposed if there is one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.  The judge must make findings with respect to each of the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the sentencing hearing involves the submission of evidence and the presentation of argument, the State having the burden of proving the existence of aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.  After a jury convicted respondent of armed robbery and first-degree murder, the trial judge conducted the required sentencing hearing and ultimately found that no aggravating or mitigating circumstances were present.  He ruled, contrary to the State's contention, that the statutory aggravating circumstance relating to killing for pecuniary gain applied only to murders for hire, and did not apply to all murders committed in order to obtain money, such as murders committed during a robbery.  Accordingly, respondent was sentenced on his murder conviction to life imprisonment without possibility of parole for 25 years, but he was also sentenced to 21 years' imprisonment for armed robbery, with the sentences to run consecutively.  Respondent appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court, challenging the imposition of the consecutive sentences, and the State filed a cross-appeal, contending that the trial court had committed an error of law in interpreting the ""pecuniary gain"" aggravating circumstance to apply only to contract killings.  Rejecting respondent's challenge to his sentence and ruling for the State on its cross-appeal, the court set aside the life sentence and remanded for redetermination of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and for resentencing on the murder conviction.  On remand, the trial court held a new sentencing hearing; rejected respondent's argument that imposing the death penalty would violate Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430; found that the ""pecuniary gain"" aggravating circumstance was present and that there was no mitigating 
Page 467 U. S. 204
 circumstance sufficient to call for leniency; and sentenced respondent to death.  On respondent's mandatory appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court held that, under Bullington, respondent's death sentence violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and ordered that the sentence be reduced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole for 25 years.
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits Arizona from sentencing respondent to death.  This case is controlled by Bullington, which held that the Double Jeopardy Clause applied to Missouri's capital sentencing proceeding -- barring imposition of the death penalty upon reconviction after an initial conviction, set aside on appeal, had resulted in rejection of the death sentence -- because that proceeding was comparable to a trial on the issue of guilt and the initial sentence of life imprisonment in effect acquitted the defendant of the death penalty.  The capital sentencing proceeding in Arizona shares the characteristics of the Missouri proceeding that made it resemble a trial for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Thus, respondent's initial life sentence constitutes an acquittal of the death penalty, and the State cannot now sentence respondent to death on his conviction for first-degree murder.  Although the trial court initially relied on a misconstruction of the statute defining the ""pecuniary gain"" aggravating circumstance, reliance on an error of law does not change the double jeopardy effects of a judgment that amounts to an acquittal on the merits of the issue in the sentencing proceeding -- whether death was the appropriate punishment for respondent's offense.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a woman lawyer, was employed in 1972 as an associate with respondent law firm, a general partnership, but her employment was terminated in 1979 after respondent decided not to invite her to become a partner.  Petitioner filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming that respondent had discriminated against her on the basis of her sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  After the Commission issued a notice of right to sue, petitioner brought this action in Federal District Court under Title VII.  Her complaint included allegations that respondent used the possibility of ultimate partnership as a recruiting device to induce her and other young lawyers to become associates at the firm; that respondent represented that advancement to partnership after five or six years was ""a matter of course"" for associates who received satisfactory evaluations, and that associates would be considered for partnership ""on a fair and equal basis""; that she relied on these representations when she accepted employment with respondent; that respondent's promise to consider her on a ""fair and equal basis"" created a binding employment contract; and that respondent discriminated against her on the basis of her sex when it failed to invite her to become a partner.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that Title VII was inapplicable to the selection of partners by a partnership, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Petitioner's complaint states a claim cognizable under Title VII, and she therefore is entitled to her day in court to prove her allegations.  Pp.  467 U. S. 73-79.
(a) Once a contractual employment relationship is established, the provisions of Title VII attach, forbidding unlawful discrimination as to the ""terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,"" which clearly include benefits that are part of the employment contract.  If the evidence at trial establishes petitioner's allegation that the parties contracted to have her considered for partnership, that promise clearly was a term, condition, or privilege of her employment.  Independent of the alleged contract, Title VII would then bind respondent to consider petitioner for partnership as the statute provides, i.e., without regard to her sex.  Moreover, an employer may provide its employees with benefits that it 
Page 467 U. S. 70
 is under no obligation to furnish by any express or implied contract.  Such a benefit, though not a contractual right of employment, may qualify as a ""privilege"" of employment under Title VII that may not be granted or withheld in a discriminatory fashion.  Pp.  467 U. S. 73-76.
(b) Even if respondent is correct in its assertion that a partnership invitation is not itself an offer of employment, Title VII would nonetheless apply.  The benefit a plaintiff is denied need not be employment to fall within Title VII's protection; it need only be a term, condition, or privilege of employment.  It is also of no consequence that employment as an associate necessarily ends upon elevation to partnership; a benefit need not accrue before a person's employment is completed to be a term, condition, or privilege of that employment relationship.  Nor does the statute or its legislative history support a per se exemption of partnership decisions from scrutiny.  And respondent has not shown how application of Title VII in this case would infringe its constitutional rights of expression or association.  Moreover,

Pursuant to an Alaska statute, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources published a notice that it would sell certain timber from state lands under a contract requiring ""primary manufacture"" (partial processing) of the timber within Alaska before the successful bidder could ship it outside of the State.  Petitioner, an Alaska corporation engaged in the business of purchasing timber and shipping the logs into foreign commerce, does not operate a mill in Alaska and customarily sells unprocessed logs.  When it learned that the primary manufacture requirement was to be imposed on the sale of state-owned timber involved here, petitioner filed an action in Federal District Court seeking an injunction on the ground that the requirement violated the negative implications of the Commerce Clause under which States may not enact laws imposing substantial burdens on interstate and foreign commerce unless authorized by Congress.  The District Court agreed and issued an injunction, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  That court found it unnecessary to reach the question whether, standing alone, the requirement would violate the Commerce Clause, because it found implicit congressional authorization in the federal policy of imposing a primary manufacture requirement on timber taken from federal land in Alaska.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.

JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that Congress has authorized Alaska's primary manufacture requirement.  Although there is a clearly delineated federal policy, endorsed by Congress, imposing primary manufacture requirements as to timber taken from federal lands in Alaska for export from the United States or for shipment to other States, in order for a state regulation to be removed from the reach of the dormant Commerce Clause as being authorized by Congress, congressional intent must be unmistakably clear.  The requirement that Congress affirmatively contemplate otherwise invalid state legislation is mandated by the policies underlying dormant Commerce

The fact that Alaska's policy appears to be consistent with federal policy -- or even that state policy furthers the goals that Congress had in mind -- is an insufficient indicium of congressional intent.

Syllabus 
The Social Security Act (Act) and implementing regulations provide a four-step process for the administrative review and adjudication of disputed disability benefit claims under Title II of the Act.  First, a state agency determines whether the claimant has a disability and the date it began or ceased.  Second, if the claimant is dissatisfied with that determination, he may request a de novo reconsideration, and in some cases a full evidentiary hearing.  Third, if the claimant receives an adverse reconsideration determination, he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing and de novo review by an administrative law judge.  Finally, if the claimant is dissatisfied with the administrative law judge's decision, he may appeal to the Appeals Council of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Respondents brought an action in Federal District Court on behalf of a statewide class of claimants in Vermont, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from delays encountered in steps two and three that allegedly violated their right under 42 U.S.C.  405(b) (1976 ed., Supp. V) to a hearing within a reasonable time.  Holding that delays of more than 90 days in making reconsideration determinations, and delays of more than 90 days in granting a hearing request, were unreasonable and violated claimants' statutory rights, the District Court issued an injunction in favor of the statewide class requiring the Secretary of HHS in the future to issue reconsideration determinations within 90 days of requests for reconsideration, to conduct hearings within 90 days of requests for hearings, and to pay interim benefits to any claimant who did not receive a reconsideration determination or hearing within 180 days of the request for reconsideration or who did not receive a hearing within 90 days of the hearing request.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court's injunction constituted an unwarranted judicial intrusion into the pervasively regulated area of claims adjudication under Title II.  The legislative history shows that Congress, in striking the balance between the need for timely disability determinations and the need to ensure the accuracy and consistency of such determinations in the face of heavy workloads and limited agency resources, has concluded that mandatory deadlines for adjudication of disputed disability 
Page 467 U. S. 105
 claims are inconsistent with the Act's primary objectives.  In light of Congress' continuing concern that mandatory deadlines would subordinate quality to timeliness, and its recent efforts to ensure the quality of agency determinations, it hardly could have been contemplated that courts should have authority to impose judicially the very deadlines Congress repeatedly has rejected.

Holding that delays of more than 90 days in making reconsideration determinations, and delays of more than 90 days in granting a hearing request, were unreasonable and violated claimants' statutory rights, the District Court issued an injunction in favor of the statewide class requiring the Secretary of HHS in the future to issue reconsideration determinations within 90 days of requests for reconsideration, to conduct hearings within 90 days of requests for hearings, and to pay interim benefits to any claimant who did not receive a reconsideration determination or hearing within 180 days of the request for reconsideration or who did not receive a hearing within 90 days of the hearing request.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court's injunction constituted an unwarranted judicial intrusion into the pervasively regulated area of claims adjudication under Title II.  The legislative history shows that Congress, in striking the balance between the need for timely disability determinations and the need to ensure the accuracy and consistency of such determinations in the face of heavy workloads and limited agency resources, has concluded that mandatory deadlines for adjudication of disputed disability 
Page 467 U. S. 105
 claims are inconsistent with the Act's primary objectives.  In light of Congress' continuing concern that mandatory deadlines would subordinate quality to timeliness, and its recent efforts to ensure the quality of agency determinations, it hardly could have been contemplated that courts should have authority to impose judicially the very deadlines Congress repeatedly has rejected.

Syllabus 
Petitioner manufacturer of forest products owns substantial timberland in Texas.  On August 21, 1978, after negotiations to acquire over 2,000 acres of this land for a national preserve had broken down, the United States filed a ""straight condemnation"" complaint under 40 U.S.C.  257.  Shortly thereafter, the United States filed a notice of lis pendens, notifying the public of the institution of the proceeding.  The District Court referred the matter to a special commission to ascertain the compensation due petitioner.  Trial before the commission began on March 6, 1979, and after hearing competing testimony as to the fair market value of the land, the commission entered a report recommending compensation in the amount of $2,331,202.  The District Court entered judgment awarding petitioner compensation for that amount, plus 6% interest for the period from the date the complaint was filed to the date the Government deposited the adjudicated value of the land with the court.  On March 26, 1982, the United States deposited the amount of the judgment in the District Court's registry, and, on that same date, acquired title to the land.  The Court of Appeals reversed the award of interest to petitioner, holding that the date of the taking should be deemed the date on which the compensation award was paid, and that, hence, no interest was due on that award.  The court also ruled that the commission inadequately explained its valuation of the land, and accordingly remanded the case to the District Court for further findings regarding the value.

Held:
1. The taking of petitioner's land occurred on March 26, 1982, and because the award was paid on that date, no interest was due thereon.  Pp.  467 U. S. 9-16.
(a) That the date of taking in ""straight condemnation"" proceedings must be deemed the date on which the United States tenders payment to the landowner is amply supported by this Court's prior decisions and by indications of congressional intent derived from the structure of the pertinent statutory scheme and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 71A.  Rule 71A(i) permits the United States to dismiss a condemnation suit at any time before compensation has been determined and paid, unless the United States has previously acquired title or taken possession.  The Government's capacity in this fashion to withdraw from the proceeding would be difficult to explain if a taking were effectuated prior to tendering of payment.  And the option given to the Government in 40 U.S.C.  258a of peremptorily appropriating land prior to final judgment would have been superfluous if a taking occurred upon the filing of a complaint in a  257 suit.  Pp.  467 U. S. 11-13.
(b) Prior to payment of the condemnation award in this case, there was no interference with petitioner's property interests severe enough to give rise to a taking entitling petitioner to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.  Until title passed to the United States, petitioner was free to make whatever use of its property it pleased.  The Government never forbade petitioner to cut trees on the land or develop it in some other way.  Nor did the Government abridge petitioner's right to sell the land.  While the initiation of condemnation proceedings, publicized by the lis pendens notice, may have reduced the selling price of the land, impairment of the market value of property incident to otherwise legitimate governmental action ordinarily does not result in a taking, and did not do so here.  Pp.  467 U. S. 13-16.
2. Petitioner's constitutional entitlement to the value of its land on the date of the taking can be accommodated by allowing petitioner, on remand, to present evidence pertaining to change in the market value of the property during the substantial delay between the date of valuation and the date the Government tendered payment.  Other condemnees who find themselves in petitioner's position may avail themselves of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), which empowers a district court, upon motion of a party, to withdraw or amend a final judgment for ""any . . . reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.""

No. 82-1721
Argued February 21, 1984
Decided May 21, 1984
467 U.S. 20

Syllabus 
Respondent Rhinehart is the spiritual leader of a religious group, respondent Aquarian Foundation.  In recent years, petitioner newspaper companies published several stories about Rhinehart and the Foundation.  A damages action for alleged defamation and invasions of privacy was brought in a Washington state court by respondents (who also include certain members of the Foundation) against petitioners (who also include the authors of the articles and their spouses).  During the course of extensive discovery, respondents refused to disclose certain information, including the identity of the Foundation's donors and members.  Pursuant to state discovery Rules modeled on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the trial court issued an order compelling respondents to identify all donors who made contributions during the five years preceding the date of the complaint, along with the amounts donated.  The court also required respondents to divulge enough membership information to substantiate any claims of diminished membership.  However, pursuant to the State's Rule 26(c), the court also issued a protective order prohibiting petitioners from publishing, disseminating, or using the information in any way except where necessary to prepare for and try the case.  In seeking the protective order, respondents had submitted affidavits of several Foundation members averring that public release of the information would adversely affect Foundation membership and income and would subject its members to harassment and reprisals.  By its terms, the protective order did not apply to information gained by means other than the discovery process.  The Washington Supreme Court affirmed both the production order and the protective order, concluding that even if the latter order was assumed to constitute a prior restraint of free expression, the trial court had not violated its discretion in issuing the order.
Held:  The protective order issued in this case does not offend the First Amendment.  Pp.  467 U. S. 29-37.
(a) In addressing the First Amendment question presented here, it is necessary to consider whether the ""practice in question [furthers] an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression"" and whether
""the limitation of First Amendment 
Page 467 U. S. 21

(b) Judicial limitations on a party's ability to disseminate information discovered in advance of trial implicates the First Amendment rights of the restricted party to a far lesser extent than would restraints on dissemination of information in other contexts.  Rules authorizing discovery are a matter of legislative grace.  A litigant has no First Amendment right of access to information made available only for purposes of trying his suit.  Furthermore, restraints placed on discovered information are not a restriction on a traditionally public source of information.  Pp.  467 U. S. 32-34.
(c) Rule 26(c) furthers a substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression.  Liberal pretrial discovery under the State's Rules has a significant potential for abuse.  There is an opportunity for litigants to obtain -- incidentally or purposefully -- information that not only is irrelevant but, if publicly released, could be damaging to reputation and privacy.  The prevention of such abuse is sufficient justification for the authorization of protective orders.  Pp.  467 U. S. 34-36.
(d) The provision for protective orders in the Washington Rules -- conferring broad discretion on the trial court -- requires, in itself, no heightened First Amendment scrutiny.  The unique character of the discovery process requires that the trial court have substantial latitude to fashion protective orders.  P.  467 U. S. 36.
(e) In this case, the trial court entered the protective order upon a showing that constituted good cause as required by Rule 26(c).  Also, the order is limited to the context of pretrial civil discovery, and does not restrict dissemination if the information is obtained from other sources.  It is sufficient for purposes of this Court's decision that the highest court in the State found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision to issue a protective order pursuant to a constitutional state law.

Syllabus 
After court-authorized wiretaps of telephones by Georgia police revealed a large lottery operation, the police executed search warrants at numerous locations, including petitioners' homes. Petitioners and others were then indicted for violating the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and other state gambling statutes.  Prior to trial, petitioners moved to suppress the wiretaps and evidence seized during the searches.  The State moved to close the suppression hearing to the public, alleging that unnecessary ""publication"" of information obtained under the wiretaps would render the information inadmissible as evidence, and that the wiretap evidence would ""involve"" the privacy interests of some persons who were indicted but were not then on trial, and some who were not then indicted.  The trial court agreed, finding that, insofar as the wiretap evidence related to alleged offenders not then on trial, the evidence would be tainted, and could not be used in future prosecutions.  Accordingly, over petitioners' objections, the court ordered the suppression hearing closed to all persons other than witnesses, court personnel, the parties, and the lawyers.  The suppression hearing lasted seven days, but less than 2 1/2 hours were devoted to playing the tapes of the intercepted telephone conversations, and few of them mentioned or involved parties not then before the court.  The case was then tried before a jury in open court, and petitioners were acquitted under the RICO Act but convicted under the other statutes.  The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. Under the Sixth Amendment, any closure of a suppression hearing over the objections of the accused must meet the following tests:  the party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced; the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest; the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the hearing; and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.  Cf. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of California, 464 U. S. 501.  Pp.  467 U. S. 44-47.
2. Under the above tests, the closure of the entire suppression hearing here plainly was unjustified.  The State's proffer was not specific as 
Page 467 U. S. 40
 to whose privacy interests might be infringed if the hearing were open to the public, what portions of the wiretap tapes might infringe those interests, and what portion of the evidence consisted of the tapes.  As a result, the trial court's findings were broad and general, and did not purport to justify closure of the entire hearing.  And the court did not consider alternatives to immediate closure of the hearing.  Pp.  467 U. S. 48-49.
3. The case is remanded to the state courts to decide what portions, if any, of a new suppression hearing may be closed to the public in light of conditions at the time of that hearing.  A new trial need be held only if a new, public suppression hearing results in the suppression of material evidence not suppressed at the first trial or in some other material change in the positions of the parties.

No. 83-56
Argued February 27, 1984
Decided May 21, 1984
467 U.S. 51

Syllabus 
Under the Medicare program, providers of health care services are reimbursed for the reasonable cost of services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries and are required to submit annual cost reports which are audited to determine actual costs.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) may reopen any reimbursement determination within a 3-year period and make appropriate adjustments.  Respondent nonprofit corporation (hereafter respondent), pursuant to its contract to provide home health care services under the Medicare program, received reimbursement through a fiscal intermediary, Travelers Insurance Cos. (Travelers).  Respondent also received a federal grant under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), which authorized the use of federal funds to provide training and job opportunities for economically disadvantaged persons.  This made it possible for respondent to take on additional personnel and to expand its home health care services.  A regulation to prevent double reimbursement of providers' costs indicated that grants received by a provider to pay special operating costs must be subtracted from the reasonable costs for which the provider may be reimbursed under the Medicare program.  Respondent asked Travelers whether the salaries of its CETA-funded employees who provided services to Medicare patients were reimbursable as reasonable costs under Medicare, and was orally advised by Travelers' Medicare manager that the CETA funds were ""seed money"" as defined in the Provider Reimbursement Manual to mean ""[g]rants designated for the development of new health care agencies or for expansion of services of established agencies,"" and that therefore, even though the CETA employees' salaries constituted specific operating costs paid by a federal grant, they were reimbursable under the Medicare program.  Relying on this advice, respondent included costs for which it was receiving CETA reimbursement in its cost reports for fiscal years 1975, 1976, and 1977, and received reimbursement for those sums.  Eventually, however, Travelers, as it should have done previously, referred respondent's inquiry to the Department of Health and Human Services, and was formally advised that the CETA funds were not ""seed money,"" and thus had 
Page 467 U. S. 52
 to be subtracted from respondent's Medicare reimbursement.  Travelers then reopened respondent's cost reports for the years in question and recomputed the reimbursable costs, determining that respondent had been overpaid $71,480.  When Travelers demanded repayment of this amount, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court, but, after it had obtained temporary injunctive relief, the parties stipulated that the suit would be stayed pending administrative review.  Thereafter, while rejecting the position that CETA funds were ""seed money,"" the Provider Reimbursement Review Board found that the Secretary's right to recoup the 1975 overpayment was barred because Travelers had not given respondent a written notice of reopening within the 3-year limitation period, and accordingly reduced the amount in dispute.  Respondent then filed another suit in the District Court seeking review of this determination.  Consolidating the two suits, the court ruled in the Secretary's favor, rejecting respondent's claim that the Secretary ought to be estopped to deny that the CETA funds were ""seed money"" because of the representations of the Secretary's agent, Travelers.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Government may be estopped by the ""affirmative misconduct"" of its agents and that Travelers' erroneous advice, coupled with its failure to refer the question to the Secretary, constituted such misconduct.
Held:  The Government is not estopped from recovering the funds in question from respondent, since respondent has not demonstrated that the traditional elements of an estoppel are present with respect to either its change in position or its reliance on Travelers' advice.  Pp.  467 U. S. 59-66.
(a) The consequences of the Government's misconduct were not entirely adverse, since respondent did receive an immediate benefit as a result of the double reimbursement.  Its detriment is the inability to retain money that it should never have received in the first place.  Thus, this is not a case in which respondent has lost any legal right or suffered any adverse change in its status.  Respondent cannot claim any right to expand its services to levels greater than those it would have provided had the error never occurred.  Curtailment of operation does not justify an estoppel when the expansion of respondent's operation was achieved through unlawful access to federal funds.  Respondent cannot raise an estoppel without proving that it would be significantly worse off than if it had never obtained the CETA funds in question.  Pp.  467 U. S. 61-63.
(b) The regulations governing the cost reimbursement provisions of Medicare should and did put respondent on ample notice of the care with which its cost reports must be prepared, and the care which would be taken to review them within the relevant 3-year period.

			"|"Heckler v. Community Health Services
No. 83-56
Argued February 27, 1984
Decided May 21, 1984
467 U.S. 51

Syllabus 
Under the Medicare program, providers of health care services are reimbursed for the reasonable cost of services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries and are required to submit annual cost reports which are audited to determine actual costs.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) may reopen any reimbursement determination within a 3-year period and make appropriate adjustments.  Respondent nonprofit corporation (hereafter respondent), pursuant to its contract to provide home health care services under the Medicare program, received reimbursement through a fiscal intermediary, Travelers Insurance Cos. (Travelers).  Respondent also received a federal grant under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), which authorized the use of federal funds to provide training and job opportunities for economically disadvantaged persons.  This made it possible for respondent to take on additional personnel and to expand its home health care services.  A regulation to prevent double reimbursement of providers' costs indicated that grants received by a provider to pay special operating costs must be subtracted from the reasonable costs for which the provider may be reimbursed under the Medicare program.  Respondent asked Travelers whether the salaries of its CETA-funded employees who provided services to Medicare patients were reimbursable as reasonable costs under Medicare, and was orally advised by Travelers' Medicare manager that the CETA funds were ""seed money"" as defined in the Provider Reimbursement Manual to mean ""[g]rants designated for the development of new health care agencies or for expansion of services of established agencies,"" and that therefore, even though the CETA employees' salaries constituted specific operating costs paid by a federal grant, they were reimbursable under the Medicare program.  Relying on this advice, respondent included costs for which it was receiving CETA reimbursement in its cost reports for fiscal years 1975, 1976, and 1977, and received reimbursement for those sums.  Eventually, however, Travelers, as it should have done previously, referred respondent's inquiry to the Department of Health and Human Services, and was formally advised that the CETA funds were not ""seed money,"" and thus had 
Page 467 U. S. 52
 to be subtracted from respondent's Medicare reimbursement.  Travelers then reopened respondent's cost reports for the years in question and recomputed the reimbursable costs, determining that respondent had been overpaid $71,480.  When Travelers demanded repayment of this amount, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court, but, after it had obtained temporary injunctive relief, the parties stipulated that the suit would be stayed pending administrative review.  Thereafter, while rejecting the position that CETA funds were ""seed money,"" the Provider Reimbursement Review Board found that the Secretary's right to recoup the 1975 overpayment was barred because Travelers had not given respondent a written notice of reopening within the 3-year limitation period, and accordingly reduced the amount in dispute.  Respondent then filed another suit in the District Court seeking review of this determination.  Consolidating the two suits, the court ruled in the Secretary's favor, rejecting respondent's claim that the Secretary ought to be estopped to deny that the CETA funds were ""seed money"" because of the representations of the Secretary's agent, Travelers.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Government may be estopped by the ""affirmative misconduct"" of its agents and that Travelers' erroneous advice, coupled with its failure to refer the question to the Secretary, constituted such misconduct.
Held:  The Government is not estopped from recovering the funds in question from respondent, since respondent has not demonstrated that the traditional elements of an estoppel are present with respect to either its change in position or its reliance on Travelers' advice.  Pp.  467 U. S. 59-66.
(a) The consequences of the Government's misconduct were not entirely adverse, since respondent did receive an immediate benefit as a result of the double reimbursement.  Its detriment is the inability to retain money that it should never have received in the first place.  Thus, this is not a case in which respondent has lost any legal right or suffered any adverse change in its status.  Respondent cannot claim any right to expand its services to levels greater than those it would have provided had the error never occurred.  Curtailment of operation does not justify an estoppel when the expansion of respondent's operation was achieved through unlawful access to federal funds.  Respondent cannot raise an estoppel without proving that it would be significantly worse off than if it had never obtained the CETA funds in question.  Pp.  467 U. S. 61-63.
(b) The regulations governing the cost reimbursement provisions of Medicare should and did put respondent on ample notice of the care with which its cost reports must be prepared, and the care which would be taken to review them within the relevant 3-year period.  Yet respondent prepared those reports on the basis of an oral policy judgment by an official who, it should have known, was not in the business of making

Syllabus 
An application to stay the Court of Appeals' judgment affirming the District Court's grant of habeas corpus relief to respondent Ohio prisoner -- who was convicted of murder in 1979 and who, under the Court of Appeals' ruling, is entitled to a new trial and to release pending retrial -- is granted pending disposition of applicant's petition for a writ of certiorari.  Petitioner concedes that certain statements made by respondent to a police officer and introduced at respondent's trial were elicited in violation of Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, which was decided after respondent's conviction but before it became final.  The Court of Appeals concluded that Edwards should be applied retroactively to respondent's case.  Because petitioner's petition presents an open question, and because this Court's subsequent decision in Solem v. Stumes, 465 U. S. 638, makes highly doubtful the correctness of the Court of Appeals' decision, it is likely that four Justices will vote to grant certiorari.  This Court will likely either reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment or vacate the judgment and remand the case for reconsideration in light of Solem.  Finally, the ""stay equities"" balance in applicant's favor.

Syllabus 
On the night of April 24, 1978, a witness observed a car that was being driven erratically and that eventually swerved off the road, coming to a stop in a field without causing damage to any person or property.  Ignoring the witness' suggestion that he wait for assistance in removing his car, the driver walked away from the scene.  The police arrived a few minutes later, and were told by the witness that the driver was either very inebriated or very sick.  After checking the car's registration, the police, without obtaining a warrant, proceeded to the petitioner's nearby home, arriving at about 9 p.m.  They gained entry when petitioner's stepdaughter answered the door, and found petitioner lying naked in bed.  Petitioner was then arrested for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant in violation of a Wisconsin statute which provided that a first offense was a noncriminal violation subject to a civil forfeiture proceeding for a maximum fine of $200.  Petitioner was taken to the police station, where he refused to submit to a breathanalysis test.  Pursuant to Wisconsin statutes, which subjected an arrestee who refused to take the test to the risk of a 60-day revocation of driving privileges, petitioner requested a court hearing to determine whether his refusal was reasonable.  Under Wisconsin law, a refusal to take a breath test was reasonable if the underlying arrest was not lawful.  The trial court, ultimately concluding that petitioner's arrest was lawful and that his refusal to take the breath test was therefore unreasonable, issued an order suspending petitioner's license.  The Wisconsin Court of Appeals vacated the order, concluding that the warrantless arrest of petitioner in his home violated the Fourth Amendment because the State, although demonstrating probable cause to arrest, had not established the existence of exigent circumstances.  The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed.
Held:  The warrantless, nighttime entry of petitioner's home to arrest him for a civil, nonjailable traffic offense, was prohibited by the special protection afforded the individual in his home by the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  466 U. S. 748-754.
(a) Before government agents may invade the sanctity of the home, the government must demonstrate exigent circumstances that overcome the presumption of unreasonableness that attaches to all warrantless home entries.  An important factor to be considered when determining 
Page 466 U. S. 741
 whether any exigency exists is the gravity of the underlying offense for which the arrest is being made.  Moreover, although no exigency is created simply because there is probable cause to believe that a serious crime has been committed, application of the exigent circumstances exception in the context of a home entry should rarely be sanctioned when there is probable cause to believe that only a minor offense has been committed.  Pp.  466 U. S. 748-753.
(b) Petitioner's warrantless arrest in the privacy of his own bedroom for a noncriminal traffic offense cannot be justified on the basis of the ""hot pursuit"" doctrine, because there was no immediate or continuous pursuit of the petitioner from the scene of a crime, or on the basis of a threat to public safety, because petitioner had already arrived home and had abandoned his car at the scene of the accident.  Nor can the arrest be justified as necessary to preserve evidence of petitioner's blood alcohol level.  Even assuming that the underlying facts would support a finding of this exigent circumstance, given the fact that the State had chosen to classify the first offense for driving while intoxicated as a noncriminal, civil forfeiture offense for which no imprisonment was possible, a warrantless home arrest cannot be upheld simply because evidence of the petitioner's blood alcohol level might have dissipated while the police obtained a warrant.

Section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act (FPA) authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Commission to issue licenses for the construction, operation, and maintenance of hydroelectric project works located on the public lands and reservations of the United States, including lands held in trust for Indians.  The section contains a proviso that such licenses shall be issued ""within any reservation"" only after a finding by the Commission that the license will not interfere or be inconsistent with the purpose for which the reservation was created or acquired, and
""shall be subject to and contain such conditions as the Secretary of the department under whose supervision such reservation falls shall deem necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of such reservations.""
Section 8 of the Mission Indian Relief Act of 1891 (MIRA), pursuant to which six reservations were established for respondent Indian Bands (respondents), provides that any United States citizen, firm, or corporation may contract with the Bands for the right to construct a flume, ditch, canal, pipe, or other appliances for the conveyance of water over, across, or through their reservations, which contract shall not be valid unless approved by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) under such conditions as he may see fit to impose.  When the original license covering hydroelectric facilities located on or near the six reservations, including a canal that crosses respondent La Jolla, Rincon, and San Pasqual Bands' reservations, was about to expire, petitioner Escondido Mutual Water Co. (Mutual) and petitioner city of Escondido filed an application with the Commission for a new license.  Thereafter the Secretary requested that the Commission recommend federal takeover of the project, and respondents applied for a nonpower license.  After hearings on the competing applications, an Administrative Law Judge concluded that the project was not subject to the Commission's licensing jurisdiction.  The Commission reversed and granted a license to Mutual, Escondido, and petitioner Vista Irrigation District, which had been using the canal in question.  The Court of Appeals in turn reversed the Commission, holding, contrary to the Commission, (1) that  4(e) of the FPA required the Commission to accept without modification any license conditions recommended by the Secretary; (2) that the Commission was required to satisfy its  4(e) obligations with respect to all six of the reservations, 
Page 466 U. S. 766
 and not just the three through which the canal passes; and (3) that  8 of the MIRA required the licensees to obtain right-of-way permits from respondent La Jolla, Rincon, and San Pasqual Bands before using the license facilities located on their reservations.
Held:
1. The plain command of  4(e) of the FPA requires the Commission to accept without modification conditions that the Secretary deems necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of the reservations.  Nothing in the legislative history or statutory scheme is inconsistent with this plain command.  Pp.  466 U. S. 772-779.
2. But the Commission must make its ""no inconsistency or interference"" findings and include the Secretary's conditions in the license only with respect to projects located ""within"" the geographical boundaries of a federal reservation.  It is clear that Congress concluded that reservations were not entitled to the protection of  4(e)'s proviso unless some of the licensed works were actually within the reservation.  Thus, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the Commission's  4(e) obligation to accept the Secretary's conditions and to make such findings applied to the three reservations on which no licensed facilities were located.  Pp.  466 U. S. 780-78.
3. Section 8 of the MIRA does not require licensees to obtain respondents' consent before they operate licensed facilities located on reservation lands.  While  8 gave respondents authority to determine whether to grant rights-of-way for water projects, that authority did not include the power to override Congress' subsequent decision in enacting the FPA that all lands, including tribal land, could, upon compliance with the FPA, be utilized to facilitate licensed hydroelectric projects.

|466 u.s. 789|"Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v.
Taxpayers for Vincent
No. 82-975
Argued October 12, 1983
Decided May 15, 1984
466 U.S. 789

Syllabus 
Section 28.04 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code prohibits the posting of signs on public property.  Appellee Taxpayers for Vincent, a group of supporters of a candidate for election to the Los Angeles City Council, entered into a contract with appellee Candidates' Outdoor Graphics Service (COGS) to fabricate and post signs with the candidate's name on them.  COGS produced cardboard signs and attached them to utility pole crosswires at various locations.  Acting under  28.04, city employees routinely removed all posters (including the COGS signs) attached to utility poles and similar objects covered by the ordinance.  Appellees then filed suit in Federal District Court against appellants, the city and various city officials (hereafter City), alleging that  28.04 abridged appellees' freedom of speech within the meaning of the First Amendment, and seeking damages and injunctive relief.  The District Court entered findings of fact, concluded that  28.04 was constitutional, and granted the City's motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that the ordinance was presumptively unconstitutional because significant First Amendment interests were involved, and that the City had not justified its total ban on all signs on the basis of its asserted interests in preventing visual clutter, minimizing traffic hazards, and preventing interference with the intended use of public property.
Held:
1. The ""overbreadth"" doctrine is not applicable here.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that  28.04 will have any different impact on any third parties' interests in free speech than it has on appellees' interests, and appellees have failed to identify any significant difference between their claim that  28.04 is invalid on overbreadth grounds and their claim that it is unconstitutional when applied to their signs during a political campaign.  Thus, it is inappropriate to entertain an overbreadth challenge to  28.04.  Pp.  466 U. S. 796-803.
2. Section 28.04 is not unconstitutional as applied to appellees' expressive activity.  Pp.  466 U. S. 803-817.
(a) The general principle that the First Amendment forbids the government to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas 
Page 466 U. S. 790
 at the expense of others is not applicable here.  Section 28.04's text is neutral -- indeed it is silent -- concerning any speaker's point of view, and the District Court's findings indicate that it has been applied to appellees and others in an evenhanded manner.  It is within the City's constitutional power to attempt to improve its appearance, and this interest is basically unrelated to the suppression of ideas.  Cf. United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367,  391 U. S. 377.  Pp.  466 U. S. 803-805.
(b) Municipalities have a weighty, essentially esthetic interest in proscribing intrusive and unpleasant formats for expression.  The problem addressed by  28.04 -- the visual assault on the citizens of Los Angeles presented by an accumulation of signs posted on public property -- constitutes a significant substantive evil within the City's power to prohibit.  Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490.  Pp.  466 U. S. 805-807.
(c) Section 28.04 curtails no more speech than is necessary to accomplish its purpose of eliminating visual clutter.  By banning posted signs, the City did no more than eliminate the exact source of the evil it sought to remedy.  The rationale of Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147, which held that ordinances that absolutely prohibited handbilling on public streets and sidewalks were invalid, is inapposite in the context of the instant case.  Pp.  466 U. S. 808-810.
(d) The validity of the City's esthetic interest in the elimination of signs on public property is not compromised by failing to extend the ban to private property.  The private citizen's interest in controlling the use of his own property justifies the disparate treatment, and there is no predicate in the District Court's findings for the conclusion that the prohibition against the posting of appellees' signs fails to advance the City's esthetic interest.  Pp.  466 U. S. 810-812.

The District Court's findings indicate that there are ample alternative modes of communication in Los Angeles.  P.  466 U. S. 812.
(f) There is no merit in appellees' suggestion that the property covered by  28.04 either is itself a ""public forum,"" subject to special First Amendment protection, or at least should be treated in the same respect as the ""public forum"" in which the property is located.  The mere fact that government property can be used as a vehicle for communication -- such as the use of lampposts as signposts -- does not mean that the Constitution requires such use to be permitted.  Public property which is not, by tradition or designation, a forum for public communication may be reserved by the government for its intended purposes, communicative or otherwise, if the regulation on speech (as here) is reasonable and not an

(g) Although plausible policy arguments might well be made in support of appellees' suggestion that the City could have written an ordinance that would have had a less severe effect on expressive activity like theirs -- such as by providing an exception for political campaign signs -- it does not follow that such an exception is constitutionally mandated, nor is it clear that some of the suggested exceptions would even be constitutionally permissible.  To create an exception for appellees' political speech and not other types of protected speech might create a risk of engaging in constitutionally forbidden content discrimination.

			"|"Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v.
Taxpayers for Vincent
No. 82-975
Argued October 12, 1983
Decided May 15, 1984
466 U.S. 789

Syllabus 
Section 28.04 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code prohibits the posting of signs on public property.  Appellee Taxpayers for Vincent, a group of supporters of a candidate for election to the Los Angeles City Council, entered into a contract with appellee Candidates' Outdoor Graphics Service (COGS) to fabricate and post signs with the candidate's name on them.  COGS produced cardboard signs and attached them to utility pole crosswires at various locations.  Acting under  28.04, city employees routinely removed all posters (including the COGS signs) attached to utility poles and similar objects covered by the ordinance.  Appellees then filed suit in Federal District Court against appellants, the city and various city officials (hereafter City), alleging that  28.04 abridged appellees' freedom of speech within the meaning of the First Amendment, and seeking damages and injunctive relief.  The District Court entered findings of fact, concluded that  28.04 was constitutional, and granted the City's motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that the ordinance was presumptively unconstitutional because significant First Amendment interests were involved, and that the City had not justified its total ban on all signs on the basis of its asserted interests in preventing visual clutter, minimizing traffic hazards, and preventing interference with the intended use of public property.
Held:
1. The ""overbreadth"" doctrine is not applicable here.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that  28.04 will have any different impact on any third parties' interests in free speech than it has on appellees' interests, and appellees have failed to identify any significant difference between their claim that  28.04 is invalid on overbreadth grounds and their claim that it is unconstitutional when applied to their signs during a political campaign.  Thus, it is inappropriate to entertain an overbreadth challenge to  28.04.  Pp.  466 U. S. 796-803.
2. Section 28.04 is not unconstitutional as applied to appellees' expressive activity.  Pp.  466 U. S. 803-817.
(a) The general principle that the First Amendment forbids the government to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas 
Page 466 U. S. 790
 at the expense of others is not applicable here.  Section 28.04's text is neutral -- indeed it is silent -- concerning any speaker's point of view, and the District Court's findings indicate that it has been applied to appellees and others in an evenhanded manner.  It is within the City's constitutional power to attempt to improve its appearance, and this interest is basically unrelated to the suppression of ideas.  Cf. United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367,  391 U. S. 377.  Pp.  466 U. S. 803-805.
(b) Municipalities have a weighty, essentially esthetic interest in proscribing intrusive and unpleasant formats for expression.  The problem addressed by  28.04 -- the visual assault on the citizens of Los Angeles presented by an accumulation of signs posted on public property -- constitutes a significant substantive evil within the City's power to prohibit.  Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490.  Pp.  466 U. S. 805-807.
(c) Section 28.04 curtails no more speech than is necessary to accomplish its purpose of eliminating visual clutter.  By banning posted signs, the City did no more than eliminate the exact source of the evil it sought to remedy.  The rationale of Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147, which held that ordinances that absolutely prohibited handbilling on public streets and sidewalks were invalid, is inapposite in the context of the instant case.  Pp.  466 U. S. 808-810.
(d) The validity of the City's esthetic interest in the elimination of signs on public property is not compromised by failing to extend the ban to private property.  The private citizen's interest in controlling the use of his own property justifies the disparate treatment, and there is no predicate in the District Court's findings for the conclusion that the prohibition against the posting of appellees' signs fails to advance the City's esthetic interest.  Pp.  466 U. S. 810-812.
(e) While a restriction on expressive activity may be invalid if the remaining modes of communication are inadequate,  28.04 does not affect any individual's freedom to exercise the right to speak and to distribute literature in the same place where the posting of signs on public property is prohibited.  The District Court's findings indicate that there are ample alternative modes of communication in Los Angeles.  P.  466 U. S. 812.
(f) There is no merit in appellees' suggestion that the property covered by  28.04 either is itself a ""public forum,"" subject to special First Amendment protection, or at least should be treated in the same respect as the ""public forum"" in which the property is located.  The mere fact that government property can be used as a vehicle for communication -- such as the use of lampposts as signposts -- does not mean that the Constitution requires such use to be permitted.  Public property which is not, by tradition or designation, a forum for public communication may be reserved by the government for its intended purposes, communicative or otherwise, if the regulation on speech (as here) is reasonable and not an

Syllabus 
After respondents were arrested for nonjailable misdemeanors, petitioner, a Magistrate in a Virginia county, imposed bail, and when respondents were unable to meet the bail, petitioner committed them to jail.  Subsequently, respondents brought an action against petitioner in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, claiming that petitioner's practice of imposing bail on persons arrested for nonjailable offenses under Virginia law and of incarcerating those persons if they could not meet the bail was unconstitutional.  The court agreed and enjoined the practice, and also awarded respondents costs and attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976.  Determining that judicial immunity did not extend to injunctive relief under  1983 and that prospective injunctive relief properly had been awarded against petitioner, the Court of Appeals affirmed the award of attorney's fees.
Held:
1. Judicial immunity is not a bar to prospective injunctive relief against a judicial officer, such as petitioner, acting in her judicial capacity.  Pp.  466 U. S. 528-543.
(a) Common law principles of judicial immunity were incorporated into the United States judicial system, and should not be abrogated absent clear legislative intent to do so.  Although there were no injunctions against common law judges, there is a common law parallel to the  1983 injunction at issue here in the collateral prospective relief available against judges through the use of the King's prerogative writs in England.  The history of these writs discloses that the common law rule of judicial immunity did not include immunity from prospective collateral relief.  Pp.  466 U. S. 528-536.
(b) The history of judicial immunity in the United States is fully consistent with the common law experience.  There never has been a rule of absolute judicial immunity from prospective relief, and there is no evidence that the absence of that immunity has had a chilling effect on judicial independence.  Limitations on obtaining equitable relief serve to curtail or prevent harassment of judges through suits against them by disgruntled litigants.  Collateral injunctive relief against a judge, particularly when that relief is available through  1983, also raises a concern relating to the proper functioning of federal-state relations, but that 
Page 466 U. S. 523
 concern has been addressed directly as a matter of comity and federalism, independent of principles of judicial immunity.  While there is a need for restraint by federal courts called upon to enjoin actions of state judicial officers, there is no support for a conclusion that Congress intended to limit the injunctive relief available under  1983 in a way that would prevent federal injunctive relief against a state judge.  Rather, Congress intended  1983 to be an independent protection for federal rights, and there is nothing to suggest that Congress intended to expand the common law doctrine of judicial immunity to insulate state judges completely from federal collateral review.   Pp.  466 U. S. 536-543.
2. Judicial immunity is no bar to the award of attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act.  Congress has made clear in the Act its intent that attorney's fees be available in any action to enforce  1983.  And the legislative history confirms Congress' intent that an attorney's fee award be made available even when damages would be barred or limited by immunity doctrines.  Pp.  466 U. S. 543-544.

No. 82-1474
Argued January 16, 1984
Decided May 14, 1984
466 U.S. 558

Syllabus 
Respondent Ronwin (hereafter respondent) was an unsuccessful candidate for admission to the Arizona Bar in 1974.  Pursuant to the Arizona Constitution, the Arizona Supreme Court has plenary authority to determine admissions to the bar.  Under the Arizona Supreme Court Rules in effect in 1974, a Committee on Examinations and Admissions (Committee), appointed by the court, was authorized to examine applicants on specified subjects.  The Rules required the Committee to submit its grading formula to the court prior to giving the examination.  After grading the examination, the Committee was directed to submit its recommendations for the admission of applicants to the court, which then made the final decision to grant or deny admission to practice.  Under the Rules, a rejected applicant was entitled to seek individualized review of the Committee's adverse recommendation by filing a petition with the court.  After the Arizona Supreme Court denied respondent's petition for review, he ultimately filed this action in Federal District Court against the Arizona State Bar, members of the Committee (including petitioners), and others.  Respondent alleged that petitioners had conspired to restrain trade in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act by ""artificially reducing the numbers of competing attorneys in the State.""  He argued that the Committee had set the grading scale on the examination with reference to the number of new attorneys it thought desirable, rather than with reference to some ""suitable"" level of competence.  Petitioners contended that they were immune from antitrust liability under the state action doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground, inter alia, of failure to state a justiciable claim.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although petitioners ultimately might be able to show that they were entitled to state action immunity, the District Court should not have decided the issue on a motion to dismiss.
Held:  The District Court properly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.  Pp.  466 U. S. 567-582.
(a) Under Parker, when a state legislature adopts legislation, its actions constitute those of the State and ipso facto are exempt from the operation of the antitrust laws.  A state supreme court, when acting in a legislative capacity, occupies the same position as that of a state legislature 
Page 466 U. S. 559
 for purposes of the state action doctrine.  Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U. S. 350.  When the activity at issue is not directly that of the legislature or supreme court, but is carried out by others pursuant to state authorization, there must be a showing that the challenged conduct is pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy to replace competition with regulation, and the degree to which the state legislature or supreme court supervises its representative may be relevant to the inquiry.  However, where the challenged conduct is in fact that of the state legislature or supreme court, the issues of ""clear articulation"" and ""active supervision"" need not be addressed.  Pp.  466 U. S. 567-569.
(b) In this case, the actions of the Committee with regard to the bar examination grading formula cannot be divorced from the Arizona Supreme Court's exercise of its sovereign powers.  Although the Arizona Supreme Court necessarily delegated the administration of the admissions process to the Committee, under the court's Rules, the court itself retained the sole authority to determine who should be admitted to the practice of law in Arizona.  Thus, the challenged conduct was in reality that of the Arizona Supreme Court, and is therefore exempt from Sherman Act liability under the state action doctrine.  Cf. Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, supra.  Pp.  466 U. S. 569-574.
(c) Bates cannot be distinguished on the ground that the Arizona Supreme Court is not a petitioner in this case, and was not named as a defendant in the complaint, or on the ground that Parker is inapplicable because respondent is not challenging the Arizona Supreme Court's conduct.  The same situation existed in Bates.  As in Bates, the real party in interest is the Arizona Supreme Court.  The case law, as well as the State Supreme Court's Rules, makes clear that the court made the final decision on each applicant.  To allow Sherman Act plaintiffs to look behind the actions of state sovereigns and base their claims on perceived illegal conspiracies among the committees, commissions, or others who necessarily must advise the sovereign would emasculate the Parker v. Brown doctrine.  Pp.  466 U. S. 574-582.

466 U.S. 602

Syllabus 
Part A of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the Medicare Act, provides insurance for the cost of hospital and related post-hospital expenses, but precludes reimbursement for services which are not ""reasonable and necessary"" for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury.  Judicial review of a claim under the Medicare Act is available only after the Secretary of Health and Human Services renders a ""final decision"" on the claim in the same manner as is provided in 42 U.S.C.  405(g) for old-age and disability claims arising under Title II of the Social Security Act.  Title 42 U.S.C.  405(h), to the exclusion of 28 U.S.C.  1331 (federal question jurisdiction), makes  405(g) the sole avenue for judicial review of all ""claim[s] arising under"" the Medicare Act.  Pursuant to her rulemaking authority, the Secretary has provided that a ""final decision"" is rendered on a Medicare claim only after the claimant has pressed the claim through all designated levels of administrative review.  In January, 1979, the Secretary issued an administrative instruction to all fiscal intermediaries that no payment is to be made for Medicare claims arising out of a surgical procedure known as bilateral carotid body resection (BCBR) when performed to relieve respiratory distress.  Until October, 1980, Administrative Law Judges (ALJs), who were not bound by the instruction, consistently ruled in favor of claimants whose BCBR claims had been denied by the intermediaries.  The Appeals Council also authorized payment for BCBR Part A expenses in a case involving numerous claimants.  On October 28, 1980, the Secretary issued a formal administrative ruling, intended to have a binding effect on the ALJs and the Appeals Council, prohibiting them from ordering Medicare payments for BCBR operations occurring after that date, the Secretary having concluded that the BCBR procedure was not ""reasonable and necessary"" within the meaning of the Medicare Act.  Without having exhausted their administrative remedies, respondents brought an action in Federal District Court challenging the Secretary's instruction and ruling, and relying on 28 U.S.C.  1331, 28 U.S.C.  1361 (mandamus against federal official), and 42 U.S.C.  405(g) to establish jurisdiction.  Respondents are four Medicare claimants for whom BCBR surgery was prescribed to relieve pulmonary problems.  Three of the respondents (Holmes, Webster-Zieber, and Vescio) had the surgery before 
Page 466 U. S. 603
 October 28, 1980, and filed claims for reimbursement with the fiscal intermediary, and the fourth respondent (Ringer) never had the surgery, claiming that he was unable to afford it.  The complaint sought a declaration that the Secretary's refusal to find that BCBR surgery is ""reasonable and necessary"" under the Medicare Act is unlawful, and an injunction compelling her to instruct her intermediaries to provide payment for BCBR claims and barring her from forcing claimants to pursue administrative appeals in order to obtain payment.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, holding that, in essence, respondents were claiming entitlement to benefits for the BCBR procedure, that any challenges to the Secretary's procedure were ""inextricably intertwined"" with respondents' claim for benefits, and that therefore respondents must exhaust their administrative remedies pursuant to  405(g) before pursuing their action in federal court.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, to the extent respondents were seeking to invalidate the Secretary's procedure for determining entitlement to benefits, those claims were cognizable under the federal question and mandamus statutes, without the administrative exhaustion requirement of  405(g).  While acknowledging that  405(g), with its exhaustion requirement, provides the only jurisdictional basis for seeking judicial review of claims for benefits, the court nonetheless held that the District Court erred in requiring respondents to exhaust their administrative remedies, since exhaustion would be futile and might not fully compensate respondents for their asserted injuries in view of the fact that they sought payment without the prejudice -- and the necessity of appeal -- resulting from the existence of the Secretary's instruction and ruling.

1. Exhaustion of administrative remedies is in no sense futile for respondents Holmes, Webster-Zieber, and Vescio, and they, therefore, must adhere to the administrative procedure that Congress has established for adjudicating their Medicare claims.  Pp.  466 U. S. 613-619.
(a) The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that any portion of these respondents' claims could be channeled into federal court by way of federal question jurisdiction.  The inquiry in determining whether  405(h) bars federal question jurisdiction must be whether the claim ""arises under"" the Medicare Act, not whether it lends itself to a ""substantive,"" rather than a ""procedural,"" label.

(b) Assuming without deciding that  405(h) does not foreclose mandamus jurisdiction in all Social Security Act cases, the District Court did not err in dismissing respondents' complaint, because no writ of mandamus could properly issue.  Title 28 U.S.C.  1361 is intended to provide a remedy only if the plaintiff has exhausted all other avenues of 
Page 466 U. S. 604
 relief, and only if the defendant owes him a nondiscretionary duty.  Here, the above respondents clearly have an adequate remedy under  405(g) for challenging all aspects of the Secretary's denial of their claims, and thus  405(g) is the only avenue for judicial review of their claims.  While these respondents satisfied the nonwaivable requirement of presenting a claim to the Secretary, they did not satisfy the waivable requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted.  Pp.  466 U. S. 616-619.
2. The District Court had no jurisdiction as to respondent Ringer.  His claim is essentially one requesting the payment of benefits for BCBR surgery, a claim cognizable only under  405(g).  Mandamus jurisdiction is unavailable to him for the same reasons it is unavailable to the other respondents.  Regarding federal question jurisdiction, as with the other respondents, all aspects of Ringer's claim ""aris[e] under"" the Medicare Act.  He must pursue his claim under  405(g) in the same manner that Congress has provided.  Because he has not given the Secretary an opportunity to rule on a concrete claim for reimbursement, he has not satisfied the nonwaivable exhaustion requirement of  405(g).  Pp.  466 U. S. 620-626.

Syllabus 
Part A of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the Medicare Act, provides insurance for the cost of hospital and related post-hospital expenses, but precludes reimbursement for services which are not ""reasonable and necessary"" for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury.  Judicial review of a claim under the Medicare Act is available only after the Secretary of Health and Human Services renders a ""final decision"" on the claim in the same manner as is provided in 42 U.S.C.  405(g) for old-age and disability claims arising under Title II of the Social Security Act.  Title 42 U.S.C.  405(h), to the exclusion of 28 U.S.C.  1331 (federal question jurisdiction), makes  405(g) the sole avenue for judicial review of all ""claim[s] arising under"" the Medicare Act.  Pursuant to her rulemaking authority, the Secretary has provided that a ""final decision"" is rendered on a Medicare claim only after the claimant has pressed the claim through all designated levels of administrative review.  In January, 1979, the Secretary issued an administrative instruction to all fiscal intermediaries that no payment is to be made for Medicare claims arising out of a surgical procedure known as bilateral carotid body resection (BCBR) when performed to relieve respiratory distress.  Until October, 1980, Administrative Law Judges (ALJs), who were not bound by the instruction, consistently ruled in favor of claimants whose BCBR claims had been denied by the intermediaries.  The Appeals Council also authorized payment for BCBR Part A expenses in a case involving numerous claimants.  On October 28, 1980, the Secretary issued a formal administrative ruling, intended to have a binding effect on the ALJs and the Appeals Council, prohibiting them from ordering Medicare payments for BCBR operations occurring after that date, the Secretary having concluded that the BCBR procedure was not ""reasonable and necessary"" within the meaning of the Medicare Act.  Without having exhausted their administrative remedies, respondents brought an action in Federal District Court challenging the Secretary's instruction and ruling, and relying on 28 U.S.C.  1331, 28 U.S.C.  1361 (mandamus against federal official), and 42 U.S.C.  405(g) to establish jurisdiction.  Respondents are four Medicare claimants for whom BCBR surgery was prescribed to relieve pulmonary problems.  Three of the respondents (Holmes, Webster-Zieber, and Vescio) had the surgery before 
Page 466 U. S. 603
 October 28, 1980, and filed claims for reimbursement with the fiscal intermediary, and the fourth respondent (Ringer) never had the surgery, claiming that he was unable to afford it.  The complaint sought a declaration that the Secretary's refusal to find that BCBR surgery is ""reasonable and necessary"" under the Medicare Act is unlawful, and an injunction compelling her to instruct her intermediaries to provide payment for BCBR claims and barring her from forcing claimants to pursue administrative appeals in order to obtain payment.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, holding that, in essence, respondents were claiming entitlement to benefits for the BCBR procedure, that any challenges to the Secretary's procedure were ""inextricably intertwined"" with respondents' claim for benefits, and that therefore respondents must exhaust their administrative remedies pursuant to  405(g) before pursuing their action in federal court.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, to the extent respondents were seeking to invalidate the Secretary's procedure for determining entitlement to benefits, those claims were cognizable under the federal question and mandamus statutes, without the administrative exhaustion requirement of  405(g).  While acknowledging that  405(g), with its exhaustion requirement, provides the only jurisdictional basis for seeking judicial review of claims for benefits, the court nonetheless held that the District Court erred in requiring respondents to exhaust their administrative remedies, since exhaustion would be futile and might not fully compensate respondents for their asserted injuries in view of the fact that they sought payment without the prejudice -- and the necessity of appeal -- resulting from the existence of the Secretary's instruction and ruling.
Held:

Syllabus 
Respondent and two associates were indicted on mail fraud charges involving a ""check kiting"" scheme whereby checks were transferred between a bank in Florida and a bank in Oklahoma.  When respondent's retained counsel withdrew shortly before the scheduled trial date, the District Court appointed a young lawyer with a real estate practice who had never participated in a jury trial to represent respondent, but allowed him only 25 days to prepare for trial, even though the Government had taken over four and one-half years to investigate the case and had reviewed thousands of documents during that investigation.  Respondent was convicted, but the Court of Appeals reversed, because it inferred that respondent's right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment had been violated.  Finding it unnecessary to inquire into counsel's actual performance at trial, the court based its inference on the circumstances surrounding the representation of respondent, particularly (1) the time afforded for investigation and preparation, (2) the experience of counsel, (3) the gravity of the charge, (4) the complexity of possible defenses, and (5) the accessibility of witnesses to counsel.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in utilizing an inferential approach in determining whether respondent's right to the effective assistance of counsel had been violated.  Pp.  466 U. S. 653-667.
(a) The right to the effective assistance of counsel is the right of the accused to require the prosecution's case to survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.  When a true adversarial criminal trial has been conducted, the kind of testing envisioned by the Sixth Amendment has occurred.  Pp.  466 U. S. 653-657.
(b) Here, while the Court of Appeals purported to apply a standard of reasonable competence, it did not indicate that there had been an actual breakdown of the adversarial process during a trial.

466 U.S. 668

Syllabus 
Respondent pleaded guilty in a Florida trial court to an indictment that included three capital murder charges.  In the plea colloquy, respondent told the trial judge that, although he had committed a string of burglaries, he had no significant prior criminal record and that, at the time of his criminal spree, he was under extreme stress caused by his inability to support his family.  The trial judge told respondent that he had ""a great deal of respect for people who are willing to step forward and admit their responsibility.""  In preparing for the sentencing hearing, defense counsel spoke with respondent about his background, but did not seek out character witnesses or request a psychiatric examination.  Counsel's decision not to present evidence concerning respondent's character and emotional state reflected his judgment that it was advisable to rely on the plea colloquy for evidence as to such matters, thus preventing the State from cross-examining respondent and from presenting psychiatric evidence of its own.  Counsel did not request a presentence report, because it would have included respondent's criminal history and thereby would have undermined the claim of no significant prior criminal record.  Finding numerous aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstance, the trial judge sentenced respondent to death on each of the murder counts.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed, and respondent then sought collateral relief in state court on the ground, inter alia, that counsel had rendered ineffective assistance at the sentencing proceeding in several respects, including his failure to request a psychiatric report, to investigate and present character witnesses, and to seek a presentence report.  The trial court denied relief, and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed.  Respondent then filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court advancing numerous grounds for relief, including the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.  After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied relief, concluding that, although counsel made errors in judgment in failing to investigate mitigating evidence further than he did, no prejudice to respondent's sentence resulted from any such error in judgment.  The Court of Appeals ultimately reversed, stating that the Sixth Amendment accorded criminal defendants a right 
Page 466 U. S. 669
 to counsel rendering ""reasonably effective assistance given the totality of the circumstances.""  After outlining standards for judging whether a defense counsel fulfilled the duty to investigate nonstatutory mitigating circumstances and whether counsel's errors were sufficiently prejudicial to justify reversal, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for application of the standards.
Held:
1. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel, and the benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel's conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.  The same principle applies to a capital sentencing proceeding -- such as the one provided by Florida law -- that is sufficiently like a trial in its adversarial format and in the existence of standards for decision that counsel's role in the proceeding is comparable to counsel's role at trial.  Pp.  466 U. S. 684-687.
2. A convicted defendant's claim that counsel's assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction or setting aside of a death sentence requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel's performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.  Pp.  466 U. S. 687-696.
(a) The proper standard for judging attorney performance is that of reasonably effective assistance, considering all the circumstances.  When a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel's assistance, the defendant must show that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  Judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential, and a fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time.  A court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.  These standards require no special amplification in order to define counsel's duty to investigate, the duty at issue in this case.  Pp.  466 U. S. 687-691.
(b) With regard to the required showing of prejudice, the proper standard requires the defendant to show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.  A court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.  Pp.  466 U. S. 691-696. 
Page 466 U. S. 670

3. A number of practical considerations are important for the application of the standards set forth above.  The standards do not establish mechanical rules; the ultimate focus of inquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged.  A court need not first determine whether counsel's performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies.  If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, that course should be followed.  The principles governing ineffectiveness claims apply in federal collateral proceedings as they do on direct appeal or in motions for a new trial.  And in a federal habeas challenge to a state criminal judgment, a state court conclusion that counsel rendered effective assistance is not a finding of fact binding on the federal court to the extent stated by 28 U.S.C.  2254(d), but is a mixed question of law and fact.  Pp.  466 U. S. 696-698.
4. The facts of this case make it clear that counsel's conduct at and before respondent's sentencing proceeding cannot be found unreasonable under the above standards.  They also make it clear that, even assuming counsel's conduct was unreasonable, respondent suffered insufficient prejudice to warrant setting aside his death sentence.  Pp.  466 U. S. 698-700.

466 U.S. 720

Syllabus 
In May, 1978, the National Labor Relations Board found that respondent union had violated the National Labor Relations Act by discriminating against nonmembers in its hiring hall referral practices.  The Board ordered the union to compensate the five charging parties and other ""similarly situated"" employees for lost earnings, to be calculated according to a formula established by the Board.  In May, 1979, the Court of Appeals granted enforcement of the Board's order.  The Board then began preparation of a backpay specification, to identify employees who had been subjected to discrimination and to determine the amount of backpay due to each employee.  However, for various reasons, preparation of the backpay specification was delayed, and in 1982, the Court of Appeals ordered the Board to enter the specification by December 31, 1982.  On December 21, 1982, the Board submitted its specification, but it later revised the specification to incorporate more complete information.  Ultimately, in July, 1983, the Court of Appeals modified the Board's order to require that the union tender backpay only to the charging parties and only as calculated by the backpay specification of December 21, 1982.

			"|"National Labor Relations Board v. International
Association of Bridge, Structural & Ornamental
Ironworkers, Local 480, AFL-CIO
No. 83-1202
Decided May 14, 1984
466 U.S. 720

Syllabus 
In May, 1978, the National Labor Relations Board found that respondent union had violated the National Labor Relations Act by discriminating against nonmembers in its hiring hall referral practices.  The Board ordered the union to compensate the five charging parties and other ""similarly situated"" employees for lost earnings, to be calculated according to a formula established by the Board.  In May, 1979, the Court of Appeals granted enforcement of the Board's order.  The Board then began preparation of a backpay specification, to identify employees who had been subjected to discrimination and to determine the amount of backpay due to each employee.  However, for various reasons, preparation of the backpay specification was delayed, and in 1982, the Court of Appeals ordered the Board to enter the specification by December 31, 1982.  On December 21, 1982, the Board submitted its specification, but it later revised the specification to incorporate more complete information.  Ultimately, in July, 1983, the Court of Appeals modified the Board's order to require that the union tender backpay only to the charging parties and only as calculated by the backpay specification of December 21, 1982.  The court gave as its justification for modifying the Board's order ""the length of time that elapsed since the entry of [the court's] original judgment.""
Held:  The Court of Appeals may not refuse to enforce the backpay order merely because of the Board's delay subsequent to that order in formulating a backpay specification.  NLRB v. Rutter-Rex Mfg. Co., 396 U. S. 258.  ""[T]he Board is not required to place the consequences of its own delay, even if inordinate, upon wronged employees.""  Id. at  396 U. S. 265.  By restricting the beneficiaries of the Board's remedy and abridging procedures lawfully established by the Board for determining the amount of backpay, the Court of Appeals' order under review punishes employees for the Board's nonfeasance.

|466 u.s. 727|"Massachusetts v. Upton
No. 83-1338
Decided May 14, 1984
466 U.S. 727

Syllabus 
City police officers, executing a search warrant for a motel room reserved by Richard Kelleher, discovered several items of identification, including credit cards, belonging to two persons whose homes had recently been burglarized, but other items taken in the burglaries, such as jewelry, silver, and gold, were not found.  About three hours later, one of the officers received a phone call from an unidentified female who told him that a motor home containing stolen items, including jewelry, silver, and gold, was parked behind respondent's home; that respondent had purchased the items from Kelleher; and that respondent was going to move the motor home because of the search of the motel room.  The caller also stated that she had seen the stolen items, but refused to identify herself because ""he'll [referring to respondent] kill me.""  When the officer told the caller that he knew her name because he had met her and she had been identified as respondent's girlfriend, the caller admitted her identity and told the officer that she had broken up with respondent and ""wanted to burn him.""  Following the call, the officer verified that a motor home was parked on the property and, while other officers watched the premises, prepared an application for a search warrant, setting out the information noted above in an affidavit and also attaching police reports on the two prior burglaries and lists of the stolen property.  A Magistrate issued the warrant, and a subsequent search of the motor home produced the items described by the caller and other incriminating evidence.  The discovered evidence led to respondent's conviction on multiple counts of burglary, receiving stolen property, and related crimes.  However, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that the warrant violated the Fourth Amendment because it was not supported by a sufficient showing of probable cause, and reversed respondent's convictions.  It interpreted Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, as merely refining the previous ""two-pronged"" test -- which related to an informant's ""basis of knowledge"" and its ""reliability"" -- by allowing corroboration of the informant's tip to make up for a failure to satisfy the two-pronged test.  The court concluded that the two-pronged test was not met here, and that there was insufficient corroboration of the informant's tip. 
Page 466 U. S. 728

Held:  The two-pronged test was rejected in Gates, which instead held that the Fourth Amendment's requirement of probable cause for the issuance of a warrant is to be applied, not according to a fixed and rigid formula, but rather in the light of the ""totality of the circumstances"" made known to the magistrate, and which emphasized that the task of a reviewing court is not to conduct a de novo determination of probable cause, but only to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a ""substantial basis"" for the magistrate's decision to issue the warrant.  When properly examined in light of Gates, the officer's affidavit in this case provided a substantial basis for the Magistrate's issuance of the warrant.
Certiorari granted; 390 Mass. 562, 458 N.E.2d 717, reversed and remanded.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. On petition for writ of certiorari to the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District. On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. [ Williams v. Illinois 466 U.S. 981 (1984) ][981-Continued.] 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgments of the Supreme Court of Illinois and the Appellate Court of Illinois insofar as they left undisturbed the death sentences imposed in these three cases. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that capital punishment were constitutional under certain circumstances, I would vote to grant these petitions because they present a substantial constitutional challenge to the Illinois state's attorneys' practice of using peremptory challenges to exclude Negro jurors from participating in capital cases. 
 Hernando Williams, Wendell Dixon, and Lonnie Yates are Negroes. In unrelated indictments, the people of Illinois charged each of these men with serious felonies, punishable by death under Illinois law. Each was tried by jury, and each now claims that the prosecution violated the Federal Constitution by using peremptory challenges to remove Negroes from the jury venire. [Footnote 1] In petitioner Dixon's case, 20% of the jury venire were Negroes. The prosecution used five of seven peremptory challenges to exclude the Negro members from the venire. An all-white jury then convicted Dixon and sentenced him to death. In petitioner Williams' case, 22% of the venire were Negroes. The prosecution used 11 of its 20 peremptory challenges to exclude Negroes, and an all-white jury sentenced Williams to death. In petitioner Yates' case, the record does not indicate what percentage of the 
Page 466 U.S. 981 , 982
 venire were Negroes, but the record does show that the State used 13 of 16 peremptory challenges to remove Negroes from the venire. The jury that convicted Yates and sentenced him to death included a single Negro. 
 The claim raised in these petitions is distressingly familiar. Whenever a Negro defendant is charged with a capital offense, there is a substantial chance that the prosecution will employ its peremptory challenges to remove Negroes and other minorities from the jury panel. See Gilliard v. Mississippi, 464 U.S. 867, 867-868, and n. 3, 43 and n. 3 (1983) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting) (listing cases in 19 different jurisdictions raising the issue since 1979). Illinois provides a striking, but by no means isolated, illustration of the dimensions of the problem. Since 1959, the Supreme Court of Illinois has reviewed at least 33 cases in which criminal defendants have alleged prosecutorial misuse of peremptory challenges to exclude Negro jurors. See People v. Payne, 99 Ill.2d 135, 152-153, 75 Ill.Dec. 643, 651-652, 457 N.E. 2d 1202, 1210-1211 (1983) (Simon, J., dissenting) (list of cases). Petitioners in these three cases stand at the end of a long line of Negro criminal defendants who claim that the State of Illinois has denied them trial by a fair cross-section of the community. 
 The intentional exclusion of Negro jurors is particularly pronounced in capital cases in Illinois. Since the enactment of the latest Illinois Death Act, 29 juries have been empaneled to sentence Negro defendants in capital cases. Nineteen of these juries were all-white, and five had only one Negro juror. Illinois Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Death Sentences in Illinois (July 31, 1983). It is simply inconceivable that the racial composition of these juries was the result of statistical anomaly. According to the most recent Census figures, 14.65% of the Illinois population is Negro.2 If the jury-selection process in Illinois were completely race-blind, roughly 17% of all juries would be expected to have one or no Negro jurors. In fact, more than 80% of the Illinois sentencing juries have had less than two Negro members when the defendant was a Negro. [466 U.S. 981 , 983]

 Henry Martinez PORTERv. Dan V. McKASKLE, Acting Director, Texas Department of Corrections.No. 83-5808. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 14, 1984. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 This case presents a recurring question concerning the standard for determining when a trial judge has a constitutional obligation to order a psychiatric examination to determine a defendant's competency to stand trial. Especially because the correct answer to that question determines whether petitioner lives or dies, I would grant the petition. [Footnote 1] [ Porter v. McKaskle 466 U.S. 984 (1984) ][984-Continued.] 
 In 1976, petitioner, Henry Martinez Porter, was tried in Texas for the murder of a policeman. He was convicted and sentenced to death. However, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned his conviction on the ground that petitioner's constitutional right to confront witnesses against him had been violated by the introduction into evidence of materials from a file pertaining to petitioner's conduct while on federal parole during 1973 and 1974. Porter v. State, 578 S.W.2d 742 (Tex.Cr.App. 1979). Among those materials were various reports that cast doubt on petitioner's sanity and capacity to understand legal proceedings. For example, the director of a drug abuse treatment center described petitioner's debilitating and apparently incurable heroin addiction. The director went on to cite petitioner's "" 'serious mental and emotional handicaps,' "" concluding that petitioner's "" '[r]ehabilitative rating is very poor.' "" Id., at 745. Another report quoted unnamed psychologists to the effect that petitioner had "" 'a psychopathic personality' "" and had manifested "" 'paranoid schizophrenic behavior.' "" Id., at 744. 
 Petitioner was retried before the same judge who had presided over his first trial. After the jury had been selected but before it was empaneled, the prosecutor for the first time discovered a presentence report, prepared in 1959, that described a psychiatric 
Page 466 U.S. 984 , 985
 episode in petitioner's past. The report revealed that, while incarcerated on a robbery charge, petitioner was sent from a reformatory to a psychiatric hospital, ""because he had hallucinations of seeing his father and speaking to him."" After being held at the hospital for a month, petitioner escaped. 
 After receiving this report from the prosecutor, petitioner's counsel informed the trial judge that he was concerned about the bearing of the newly revealed evidence on petitioner's competency to stand trial and requested the judge to order a psychiatric examination of petitioner. Counsel also asked for a ruling that the results of such an examination would be admissible only for the purpose of assessing petitioner's competency, and would be excluded from the penalty phase of the trial. The prosecutor acceded to the request for an exam but objected to the proposed limitation on the admissibility of the results thereof. The trial judge ruled with the prosecutor on this issue, indicating that he would grant the request for a psychiatric exam only if the material disclosed thereby were admitted into the record and could be used by either side for any purpose. In the face of this ruling, defense counsel withdrew his request for a competency exam. 
 At the conclusion of the second trial, petitioner was once again convicted and sentenced to death. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, Porter v. State, 623 S.W.2d 374 (Tex.Cr.App.1981), and this Court denied certiorari, 456 U.S. 965 ( 1982). 
 After exhausting his state remedies, petitioner brought this suit in Federal District Court, seeking a writ of habeas corpus on the ground, inter alia, that the trial judge's ruling on his request for a psychiatric examination violated the Due Process Clause. The District Court denied relief without oral argument or an evidentiary hearing. No. C-82-159 (SD Tex., Oct. 28, 1982). The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. Porter v. Estelle, 709 F.2d 944 (1983). 
 As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, if petitioner's competency was questionable, the trial judge erred in refusing to order a psychiatric examination unless its results could be admitted by the prosecution in the penalty phase of the trial. See id., at 951. It is settled that, if evidence available to a trial judge raises a bona fide doubt regarding a defendant's ability to understand and participate in the proceedings against him, the judge has an obligation to order an examination to assess his competency, even if the defendant does not request such an exam.

 Ricky Ray RECTORv. ARKANSAS.No. 83-6080. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 14, 1984. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arkansas. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. However, even if I believed that capital punishment were constitutional under certain circumstances, I would vote to grant this petition because it raises an important and unresolved question about the composition of juries in capital cases. 
 Petitioner claims that he was denied his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to have his guilt determined by a fair cross-section of the community. Individuals with conscientious objections to the death penalty were excluded from participating in the liability phase of petitioner's trial. Even if it is permissible for the State to bar such jurors from serving on sentencing juries, see Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968), there is a substantial question whether they may also be excluded from the guilt-determination process, particularly in light of recently compiled empirical evidence that jurors who favor the death penalty are more likely to vote to convict defendants than jurors who oppose capital punishment.

 There can be no doubt that petitioner's claim raises a substantial issue of federal constitutional law. In the past, this Court has acknowledged the potential validity of this issue. See, e.g., Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 545, 1790 ( 1968); Witherspoon v. Illinois, supra, 391 U.S., at 516-518-1775. Again this Term, the claim has come to the attention of the Court. Woodard v. Hutchins, 464 U.S. 377, 382, 753d 541 (1984) (POWELL, J., concurring); id., at 379 ( BRENNAN, J., dissenting). Although the Supreme Court of Arkansas rejected the claim in this case, a Federal District Court in that State recently granted a writ of habeas corpus raising precisely the same claim. See Grigsby v. Mabry, 569 F.Supp. 1273 (ED Ark.1983), appeal pending, No. 83- 2113 (CA8). These two decisions are squarely in conflict. In light of the conflict, the State of Arkansas ""joins petitioner in requesting that this Court grant certiorari to decide this issue as a matter of federal constitutional law."" Brief for Respondent 2. Were this not a capital case, I seriously doubt whether this Court would ignore the request of the Arkansas Attorney General to address this unsettled area of federal law. 
 I dissent.

 Ricky Ray RECTORv. ARKANSAS.No. 83-6080. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 14, 1984. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arkansas. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. However, even if I believed that capital punishment were constitutional under certain circumstances, I would vote to grant this petition because it raises an important and unresolved question about the composition of juries in capital cases. 
 Petitioner claims that he was denied his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to have his guilt determined by a fair cross-section of the community. Individuals with conscientious objections to the death penalty were excluded from participating in the liability phase of petitioner's trial. Even if it is permissible for the State to bar such jurors from serving on sentencing juries, see Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968), there is a substantial question whether they may also be excluded from the guilt-determination process, particularly in light of recently compiled empirical evidence that jurors who favor the death penalty are more likely to vote to convict defendants than jurors who oppose capital punishment.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 14, 1984. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, Roland Paul Hamilton, and his friend, Billie Jean Rose, met John Shinall at a bar one evening, took a few drinks and accompanied Shinall to another bar. Later, Shinall suggested that they go to his house to eat, rest, and watch television before visiting more bars. Shinall died from injuries he suffered during this layover at his home. The State's theory was that petitioner went to Shinall's home with the intention of robbing him and killed him in the process. Petitioner claimed that he struck Shinall in order to prevent him from raping Rose and that Rose, too, participated in subduing Shinall by hitting him over the head with a bottle. According to petitioner, he robbed Shinall only as an 
Page 466 U.S. 989 , 990
 afterthought and without knowledge that Shinall's injuries were fatal. 
 Armed with Rose as its leading witness, the prosecution succeeded in convincing the jury to convict petitioner of felony murder. After a sentencing trial, the jury found that the murder was accompanied by two aggravating circumstances 1 and condemned petitioner to death. On direct appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court, his conviction and sentence were affirmed. Hamilton v. State, 244 Ga. 145, 259 S.E.2d 81 (1979). This Court vacated the sentence and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420 (1980). 446 U.S. 961 (1980). On remand, the Georgia Supreme Court reaffirmed the imposition of the death sentence. Hamilton v. State, 246 Ga. 264, 271 S.E.2d 173 (1980). This Court then denied a writ of certiorari. 449 U.S. 1103 ( 1981). 
 Petitioner next sought habeas corpus relief in the Superior Court of Butts County, Ga., claiming that at both the guilt-innocence and sentencing phases of his trial he had been denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Superior Court granted a new trial to petitioner based upon evidence produced at five hearings over a span of 18 months. [Footnote 2] The Supe- [466 U.S. 989 , 991]

ITT World Communications, Inc.
No. 83-371
Argued March 21, 1984
Decided April 30, 1984
466 U.S. 463

Syllabus 
The Government, in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C.  552b(b), requires that ""meetings"" of a federal agency be open to the public.  Section 552b(a)(2) defines a ""meeting"" as
""the deliberations of at least the number of individual agency members required to take action on behalf of the agency where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official agency business.""
Members of petitioner Federal Communications Commission (FCC) participate with their European and Canadian counterparts in the Consultative Process, a series of conferences intended to facilitate joint planning of telecommunications facilities through exchange of information or regulatory policies.  In this case, three FCC members who constituted a quorum of the FCC's Telecommunications Committee, a subdivision of the FCC, attended such conferences at which they were to attempt to persuade the European nations to cooperate with the FCC in encouraging competition in the overseas telecommunications market.  Respondents, who at the time, along with another corporation, were the only American corporations that provided overseas record telecommunications and who opposed the entry of new competitors, filed a rulemaking petition with the FCC requesting it to disclaim any intent to negotiate with foreign governments or to bind it to agreements at the conferences.  Respondents alleged that such negotiations were ultra vires the FCC's authority and that, moreover, the Sunshine Act required the Consultative Process to be held in public.  The FCC denied the petition.  Respondent ITT World Communications, Inc., then filed suit in Federal District Court, similarly alleging that the FCC's negotiations with foreign officials at the Consultative Process were ultra vires the agency's authority, and that future meetings of the Consultative Process must conform to the Sunshine Act's requirements.  The District Court dismissed the ultra vires count on jurisdictional grounds, but ordered the FCC to comply with the Sunshine Act.  Considering on consolidated appeal the District Court's judgment and the FCC's denial of the rulemaking petition, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's ruling that the Sunshine Act applied to meetings of the Consultative Process, but reversed the District Court's dismissal of the ultra vires count, and further held that the FCC had erroneously denied the rulemaking petition. 
Page 466 U. S. 464

Held:
1. The District Court lacked jurisdiction over respondent's ultra vires claim.  Exclusive jurisdiction for review of final FCC orders, such as the FCC's denial of respondents' rulemaking petition, lies by statute in the Court of Appeals.  Litigants may not evade this requirement by requesting the District Court to enjoin action that is the outcome of the agency's order.  Yet that is what respondents sought to do, since, in substance, the complaint in the District Court raised the same issues and sought to enforce the same restrictions upon FCC conduct as did the rulemaking petition that was denied by the FCC.  Pp.  466 U. S. 468-469.
2. The Sunshine Act does not require that Consultative Process sessions be held in public.  Pp.  466 U. S. 469-474.
(a) Such sessions do not constitute a ""meeting"" as defined by  552b(a)(2).  The Sunshine Act does not extend to deliberations of a quorum of a subdivision upon matters not within the subdivision's formally delegated authority.  Such deliberations lawfully could not ""determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official agency business"" within the meaning of the Act.  Here, the Telecommunications Committee at the Consultative Process session did not consider or act upon applications for common carrier certification, its only formally delegated authority.  Pp.  466 U. S. 469-473.
(b) Nor were the sessions in question a meeting ""of an agency"" within the meaning of the Sunshine Act.  The Consultative Process was not convened by the FCC, and its procedures were not subject to the FCC's unilateral control.  Pp.  466 U. S. 473-474.

466 U.S. 475

Syllabus 
Respondent was indicted for making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Secret Service, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1001, which makes it a crime knowingly and willfully to make a false statement ""in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.""  Respondent admittedly had lied in telling the FBI that his wife had been kidnaped when, in fact, as the FBI determined upon investigation, she had left him voluntarily, and in also telling the Secret Service that his wife was involved in a plot to assassinate the President when, in fact, the Secret Service, after investigating the charge and upon locating the wife, was told by her that she had left home to get away from respondent.  The District Court granted respondent's motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the investigations were not matters ""within the jurisdiction"" of the respective agencies, as that phrase is used in  1001.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on its decision in a prior case that limited the term ""jurisdiction"" as used in  1001 to ""the power to make final or binding determinations.""
Held:  The language of  1001 clearly encompasses criminal investigations conducted by the FBI and Secret Service, and nothing in the legislative history indicates that Congress intended a more restrictive reach for the statute.  Pp.  466 U. S. 479-484.
(a) A criminal investigation surely falls within the meaning of ""any matter,"" and the FBI and Secret Service equally surely qualify as ""department[s] or agenc[ies] of the United States.""  And the most natural, nontechnical meaning of ""jurisdiction"" is that it covers all matters confided to the authority of an agency or department.  Understood in this way, the statutory phrase ""within the jurisdiction"" merely differentiates the official, authorized functions of an agency or department from matters peripheral to its business.  To limit the term ""jurisdiction,"" as the Court of Appeals did, would exclude from the statute's coverage most, if not all, of the authorized activities of many federal departments and agencies, and thereby defeat Congress' purpose in using the broad inclusive language it did.  Pp.  466 U. S. 479-482.
(b) Policy arguments favoring a more limited construction of the statute will not change the result in this case.  Resolution of the pros and

 cons of whether a statute should sweep broadly or narrowly is for Congress.  Pp.  466 U. S. 482-484.
(c) The critical statutory language of  1001 is not sufficiently ambiguous to permit the rule of lenity in construing criminal statutes to control here.  P.  466 U. S. 484.
(d) Any argument against retroactive application of this decision to respondent, even if he could establish reliance on the Court of Appeals' decision in the prior case, is unavailing, since conflicting cases from other Courts of Appeals made review of the merits by this Court and a decision against respondent's position reasonably foreseeable.

466 U.S. 485

Syllabus 
Respondent published an article in its magazine evaluating the quality of numerous brands of loudspeaker systems, including one marketed by petitioner.  Petitioner objected to statements in the article about its system, including one to the effect that the sound of individual musical instruments tended to wander ""about the room.""  When respondent refused to publish a retraction, petitioner filed a product disparagement action in Federal District Court.  The court ruled that petitioner was a ""public figure,"" and that therefore, pursuant to the First Amendment as interpreted in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, to recover, petitioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence that respondent made a false disparaging statement with ""actual malice.""  Entering judgment for petitioner, the court found, based primarily on the testimony of the article's author (respondent's employee), that the article contained a false statement of ""fact,"" because the sound of instruments heard through the speakers tended to wander ""along the wall"" between the speakers, rather than ""about the room,"" as reported by respondent; that the author's testimony that the challenged statement was intended to mean ""along the wall"" was not credible; and that the statement was disparaging.  On the basis of what it considered to be clear and convincing proof, the court concluded that petitioner had sustained its burden of proving that respondent had published the false statement with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that its review of the ""actual malice"" determination was not limited to the ""clearly erroneous"" standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) -- which provides that
""[f]indings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses""
-- and that it must perform a de novo review, independently examining the record to ensure that the District Court had applied properly the governing constitutional rule.  Based on its review of the record, the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner had not sustained its burden of proof.
Held:
1. The clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a) does not prescribe the standard of review to be applied in reviewing a determination of actual 
Page 466 U. S. 486
 malice in a case governed by New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.  Appellate judges in such a case must exercise independent judgment and determine whether the record establishes actual malice with convincing clarity.  Pp.  466 U. S. 498-511.
(a) In cases raising First Amendment issues, an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record to ensure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.  However, the standard of review must be faithful to both Rule 52(a) and the New York Times rule of independent review, the conflict between the two rules being in some respects more apparent than real.  For instance, Rule 52(a) does not forbid an examination of the entire record, and the constitutionally based rule of independent review permits giving ""due regard"" to the trial judge's opportunity to judge witnesses' credibility, as provided by Rule 52(a).  Pp.  466 U. S. 498-501.
(b) Rule 52(a) applies to findings of fact, but does not inhibit an appellate court's power to correct errors of law, including those that may infect a so-called mixed finding of law and fact.  In a consideration of the possible application of Rule 52(a)'s distinction between questions of law and fact to the issue of ""actual malice,"" three characteristics of the New York Times rule are relevant:  (1) the common law heritage of the rule, (2) the fact that its content is given meaning through case-by-case adjudication, and (3) the fact that the constitutional values protected by it make it imperative that judges make sure that it is correctly applied.  Pp.  466 U. S. 501-503.

No. 82-1246

466 U.S. 485

Syllabus 
Respondent published an article in its magazine evaluating the quality of numerous brands of loudspeaker systems, including one marketed by petitioner.  Petitioner objected to statements in the article about its system, including one to the effect that the sound of individual musical instruments tended to wander ""about the room.""  When respondent refused to publish a retraction, petitioner filed a product disparagement action in Federal District Court.  The court ruled that petitioner was a ""public figure,"" and that therefore, pursuant to the First Amendment as interpreted in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, to recover, petitioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence that respondent made a false disparaging statement with ""actual malice.""  Entering judgment for petitioner, the court found, based primarily on the testimony of the article's author (respondent's employee), that the article contained a false statement of ""fact,"" because the sound of instruments heard through the speakers tended to wander ""along the wall"" between the speakers, rather than ""about the room,"" as reported by respondent; that the author's testimony that the challenged statement was intended to mean ""along the wall"" was not credible; and that the statement was disparaging.  On the basis of what it considered to be clear and convincing proof, the court concluded that petitioner had sustained its burden of proving that respondent had published the false statement with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that its review of the ""actual malice"" determination was not limited to the ""clearly erroneous"" standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) -- which provides that
""[f]indings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses""
-- and that it must perform a de novo review, independently examining the record to ensure that the District Court had applied properly the governing constitutional rule.  Based on its review of the record, the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner had not sustained its burden of proof.
Held:
1. The clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a) does not prescribe the standard of review to be applied in reviewing a determination of actual 
Page 466 U. S. 486
 malice in a case governed by New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.  Appellate judges in such a case must exercise independent judgment and determine whether the record establishes actual malice with convincing clarity.  Pp.  466 U. S. 498-511.
(a) In cases raising First Amendment issues, an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record to ensure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.  However, the standard of review must be faithful to both Rule 52(a) and the New York Times rule of independent review, the conflict between the two rules being in some respects more apparent than real.  For instance, Rule 52(a) does not forbid an examination of the entire record, and the constitutionally based rule of independent review permits giving ""due regard"" to the trial judge's opportunity to judge witnesses' credibility, as provided by Rule 52(a).  Pp.  466 U. S. 498-501.
(b) Rule 52(a) applies to findings of fact, but does not inhibit an appellate court's power to correct errors of law, including those that may infect a so-called mixed finding of law and fact.  In a consideration of the possible application of Rule 52(a)'s distinction between questions of law and fact to the issue of ""actual malice,"" three characteristics of the New York Times rule are relevant:  (1) the common law heritage of the rule, (2) the fact that its content is given meaning through case-by-case adjudication, and (3) the fact that the constitutional values protected by it make it imperative that judges make sure that it is correctly applied.  Pp.  466 U. S. 501-503.
(c) The requirement of independent appellate review enunciated in New York Times reflects a deeply held conviction that judges -- particularly Members of this Court -- must exercise such review in order to preserve precious constitutional liberties.  Under New York Times, the question whether the evidence in the record in a defamation case is of the convincing clarity required to strip the utterance of First Amendment protection is ultimately a question of federal constitutional law.

No. 82-1150
Argued January 9, 1984
Decided April 26, 1984
466 U.S. 435

Syllabus 
Section 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act permits a union and an employer to require all employees in the relevant bargaining unit to join the union as a condition of continued employment.  The collective bargaining agreement between respondent national union and an airline required that all of the airline's clerical employees join the union or pay agency fees equal to members' dues.  Petitioners, present or former clerical employees who objected to the use of their compelled dues or fees for specified union activities, filed separate suits (later consolidated) in Federal District Court against respondents -- the national union, its board of adjustment, and three locals -- who conceded that, as was held in Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, the statutory authorization of the union shop did not permit a union to spend an objecting employee's money for union political or ideological activities, and who had adopted a rebate program under which objecting employees were ultimately reimbursed for their shares of such expenditures.  The parties disagreed about the adequacy of the rebate scheme, and about the legality of charging objecting employees with union expenses for (1) the national union's quadrennial Grand Lodge convention, (2) litigation not involving the negotiation of agreements or settlement of grievances, (3) union publications, (4) social activities, (5) death benefits for employees, and (6) general organizing efforts.  Granting summary judgment for petitioners on the question of liability concerning the six expenses at issue, the court, after a trial on damages, held that the union's existing rebate program adequately protected employees' rights, and ordered refunds for the expenditures at issue.  Affirming in part and reversing in part, the Court of Appeals upheld the union's rebate plan, but ruled that, because the six challenged activities ultimately benefited the union's collective bargaining efforts, it could finance them with dues collected from objecting employees.
Held:
1. Petitioners' challenge to the rebate program is properly before the Court.  Although the claim for an injunction against the program would appear to be moot because the union has been decertified as the bargaining 
Page 466 U. S. 436
 representative of the airline's clerical employees, petitioners' additional claim for money damages, which would be in the form of interest on money illegally held for a period of time, remains in the case.  Pp.  466 U. S. 441-443.
2. The union's pure rebate approach for refunding the portion of dues expended for improper purposes to which the employee objects is inadequate.  Even if the union were to pay interest on the amount refunded, it would still obtain an involuntary loan for purposes to which the employee objected.  Given the existence of acceptable alternatives, such as advance reduction of dues, a union cannot be allowed, on the ground of administrative convenience, to commit dissenters' funds to improper uses even temporarily.  Pp.  466 U. S. 443-444.
3. While petitioners' primary submission is that the use of their fees to finance the challenged activities violated the First Amendment, the initial inquiry is whether the statute permits the union to charge petitioners for any of the challenged expenditures.  The purpose of  2, Eleventh in authorizing the union shop was to make it possible to require all members of a bargaining unit to pay their fair share of the union's costs of performing the function of exclusive bargaining agent, thus eliminating ""free rider"" employees on whose behalf the union was obliged to perform its statutory functions, but who refused to contribute to the cost thereof.  When employees object to being burdened with particular union expenditures, the test must be whether the challenged expenditures are necessarily or reasonably incurred for the purpose of performing the duties of an exclusive representative of the employees in dealing with the employer on labor-management issues.  Pp.  466 U. S. 444-448.
4. With regard to the specific union expenses challenged here, under the applicable test, petitioners must help defray the costs of the national union's conventions, at which the members elect officers, establish bargaining goals, and formulate overall union policy.  Such conventions are essential to the union's discharge of its duties as bargaining agent.  Petitioners may also be charged for union social activities, which, though not central to collective bargaining, are sufficiently related to it to be charged to all employees.  The statute also allows the union to charge objecting employees for its monthly magazine insofar as it reports to them about those activities the union can charge them for doing, but not insofar as the magazine reports on activities for which the union cannot spend dissenters' funds.  Section 2, Eleventh does not authorize charging objecting employees for the union's general organizing efforts, or for expenses of litigation that is not incident to negotiating and administering the contract or to settling grievances and disputes arising in the bargaining unit.  The question whether the statute authorizes compelled 
Page 466 U. S. 437
 participation in a death benefit program need not be ruled upon, because the union is no longer the exclusive bargaining agent, and petitioners are no longer involved in the program.  Even assuming that petitioners would have a right to an injunction against future collections for death benefits, they are not entitled to a refund of past contributions, since they had enjoyed a form of insurance for which the union collected a premium.  Pp.  466 U. S. 448-455.
5. There is no First Amendment barrier with regard to the three challenged activities for which the statute allows the union to use petitioners' contributions.  The significant interference with First Amendment rights resulting from allowing the union shop is justified by the governmental interest in industrial peace.  Forced contributions for union social affairs do not increase the infringement of the employee's First Amendment rights.  And while both union publications and conventions have direct communicative content, there is little additional infringement of First Amendment rights, and none that is not justified by the governmental interests behind the union shop itself.  Pp.  466 U. S. 455-457.

Syllabus 
When petitioner and respondent, both Caucasians, were divorced in Florida, petitioner, the mother, was awarded custody of their 3-year-old daughter.  The following year, respondent sought custody of the child by filing a petition to modify the prior judgment because of changed conditions, namely, that petitioner was then cohabiting with a Negro, whom she later married.  The Florida trial court awarded custody to respondent, concluding that the child's best interests would be served thereby.  Without focusing directly on the parental qualifications of petitioner, her present husband, or respondent, the court reasoned that, although respondent's resentment at petitioner's choice of a black partner was insufficient to deprive petitioner of custody, there would be a damaging impact on the child if she remained in a racially mixed household.  The Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed.
Held:  The effects of racial prejudice, however real, cannot justify a racial classification removing an infant child from the custody of its natural mother.  The Constitution cannot control such prejudice, but neither can it tolerate it.  Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.

No. 81-2394
Argued November 1, 1983
Decided April 24, 1984
466 U.S. 388

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC) was amended in 1971 to provide tax incentives for United States firms to increase their exports, and for that purpose special tax treatment was provided for a ""Domestic International Sales Corporation"" (""DISC""), a corporation substantially all of whose assets and gross receipts are export-related.  Under the IRC, a DISC is not taxed on its income, but instead a portion (50% for the tax years in question in this case) of its income -- ""deemed distributions"" -- is attributed to its shareholders whether or not actually paid or distributed to them.  Taxes on the remaining income -- ""accumulated DISC income"" -- are deferred until that income is actually distributed to shareholders or the DISC no longer qualifies for special tax treatment.  In response to these amendments, the New York Legislature enacted a franchise tax statute requiring the consolidation of the receipts, assets, expenses, and liabilities of a subsidiary DISC with those of its parent corporation.  The franchise tax is assessed against the parent on the basis of the consolidated amounts.  The statute also provides for an offsetting tax credit, the result of which is to lower the effective tax rate on the accumulated DISC income included in the consolidated return to 30% of the otherwise applicable rate.  The credit is limited to gross receipts from export products ""shipped from a regular place of business of the taxpayer within [New York].""  The credit is computed by (1) dividing the DISC's gross receipts from property shipped from a regular place of business in New York by its total gross receipts from the sale of export property; (2) multiplying that quotient (the DISC's export ratio) by the parent's New York business allocation percentage; (3) multiplying that product by the New York tax rate applicable to the parent; (4) multiplying that product by 70%; and (5) multiplying that product by the parent's attributable share of the DISC's accumulated income.  Appellant Westinghouse Electric Corporation, a manufacturer of electrical products that is qualified to do business in New York, has a wholly owned subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Export Corporation (Westinghouse Export), that qualifies as a federally tax-exempt DISC.  On its 1972 and 1973 New York franchise tax returns, appellant included as income an amount of deemed distributed income equal to about half of Westinghouse Export's income, but did not include its accumulated income.  The 
Page 466 U. S. 389
 New York State Tax Commission sought to include the accumulated DISC income, computing appellant's taxable income by first combining all of Westinghouse Export's income with that of appellant, and then giving appellant the benefit of the DISC export credit for the 5% of Westinghouse Export's receipts each year that could be attributed to New York shipments.  The Commission denied relief on appellant's petition for redetermination of the resulting tax deficiencies.  Ultimately, after appellant had mixed success in the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court on its federal constitutional challenges to the New York taxing scheme, the New York Court of Appeals reinstated the Tax Commission's determination.  Rejecting appellant's claim that the tax credit impermissibly subjected its export sales from a non-New York place of business to a higher tax rate than that on comparable sales shipped from a regular place of business in New York, the court held that the tax credit simply forgives a portion of the tax New York has a right to levy, such portion being determined by reference to shipments of export property from a regular place of business in New York, that this method satisfied due process, and that any effect on interstate commerce was too indirect to violate the Commerce Clause.
Held:  The manner in which New York allows corporations a tax credit on the accumulated income of their subsidiary DISCs discriminates against export shipping from other States, in violation of the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  466 U. S. 398-407.
(a) It is the second adjustment of the credit to reflect the DISC's New York export ratio, made only to the credit and not to the base taxable income figure, that has the effect of treating differently parent corporations that are similarly situated in all respects except for the percentage of their DISCs' shipping activities conducted from New York.  This adjustment allows a parent a greater tax credit on its accumulated DISC income as its subsidiary DISC moves a greater percentage of its shipping activities into New York.  Conversely, the adjustment decreases the tax credit allowed to the parent for a given amount of its DISC's shipping activities conducted from New York as the DISC increases its shipping activities in other States.  Thus, the New York tax scheme not only provides an incentive for increased business activity in New York, but also penalizes increases in the DISC's shipping activities in other States.  Pp.  466 U. S. 399-401.
(b) A State cannot circumvent the prohibition of the Commerce Clause against placing burdensome taxes on out-of-state transactions by burdening those transactions with a tax that is levied in the aggregate -- as is the New York franchise tax -- rather than on individual transactions.  Nor may a State encourage the development of local industry 
Page 466 U. S. 390

			"|"Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Tully
No. 81-2394
Argued November 1, 1983
Decided April 24, 1984
466 U.S. 388

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (IRC) was amended in 1971 to provide tax incentives for United States firms to increase their exports, and for that purpose special tax treatment was provided for a ""Domestic International Sales Corporation"" (""DISC""), a corporation substantially all of whose assets and gross receipts are export-related.  Under the IRC, a DISC is not taxed on its income, but instead a portion (50% for the tax years in question in this case) of its income -- ""deemed distributions"" -- is attributed to its shareholders whether or not actually paid or distributed to them.  Taxes on the remaining income -- ""accumulated DISC income"" -- are deferred until that income is actually distributed to shareholders or the DISC no longer qualifies for special tax treatment.  In response to these amendments, the New York Legislature enacted a franchise tax statute requiring the consolidation of the receipts, assets, expenses, and liabilities of a subsidiary DISC with those of its parent corporation.  The franchise tax is assessed against the parent on the basis of the consolidated amounts.  The statute also provides for an offsetting tax credit, the result of which is to lower the effective tax rate on the accumulated DISC income included in the consolidated return to 30% of the otherwise applicable rate.  The credit is limited to gross receipts from export products ""shipped from a regular place of business of the taxpayer within [New York].""  The credit is computed by (1) dividing the DISC's gross receipts from property shipped from a regular place of business in New York by its total gross receipts from the sale of export property; (2) multiplying that quotient (the DISC's export ratio) by the parent's New York business allocation percentage; (3) multiplying that product by the New York tax rate applicable to the parent; (4) multiplying that product by 70%; and (5) multiplying that product by the parent's attributable share of the DISC's accumulated income.  Appellant Westinghouse Electric Corporation, a manufacturer of electrical products that is qualified to do business in New York, has a wholly owned subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Export Corporation (Westinghouse Export), that qualifies as a federally tax-exempt DISC.  On its 1972 and 1973 New York franchise tax returns, appellant included as income an amount of deemed distributed income equal to about half of Westinghouse Export's income, but did not include its accumulated income.  The 
Page 466 U. S. 389
 New York State Tax Commission sought to include the accumulated DISC income, computing appellant's taxable income by first combining all of Westinghouse Export's income with that of appellant, and then giving appellant the benefit of the DISC export credit for the 5% of Westinghouse Export's receipts each year that could be attributed to New York shipments.  The Commission denied relief on appellant's petition for redetermination of the resulting tax deficiencies.  Ultimately, after appellant had mixed success in the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court on its federal constitutional challenges to the New York taxing scheme, the New York Court of Appeals reinstated the Tax Commission's determination.  Rejecting appellant's claim that the tax credit impermissibly subjected its export sales from a non-New York place of business to a higher tax rate than that on comparable sales shipped from a regular place of business in New York, the court held that the tax credit simply forgives a portion of the tax New York has a right to levy, such portion being determined by reference to shipments of export property from a regular place of business in New York, that this method satisfied due process, and that any effect on interstate commerce was too indirect to violate the Commerce Clause.
Held:  The manner in which New York allows corporations a tax credit on the accumulated income of their subsidiary DISCs discriminates against export shipping from other States, in violation of the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  466 U. S. 398-407.
(a) It is the second adjustment of the credit to reflect the DISC's New York export ratio, made only to the credit and not to the base taxable income figure, that has the effect of treating differently parent corporations that are similarly situated in all respects except for the percentage of their DISCs' shipping activities conducted from New York.  This adjustment allows a parent a greater tax credit on its accumulated DISC income as its subsidiary DISC moves a greater percentage of its shipping activities into New York.  Conversely, the adjustment decreases the tax credit allowed to the parent for a given amount of its DISC's shipping activities conducted from New York as the DISC increases its shipping activities in other States.  Thus, the New York tax scheme not only provides an incentive for increased business activity in New York, but also penalizes increases in the DISC's shipping activities in other States.  Pp.  466 U. S. 399-401.
(b) A State cannot circumvent the prohibition of the Commerce Clause against placing burdensome taxes on out-of-state transactions by burdening those transactions with a tax that is levied in the aggregate -- as is the New York franchise tax -- rather than on individual transactions.  Nor may a State encourage the development of local industry

466 U.S. 408

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a Colombian corporation, entered into a contract to provide helicopter transportation for a Peruvian consortium, the alter ego of a joint venture that had its headquarters in Houston, Tex., during the consortium's construction of a pipeline in Peru for a Peruvian state-owned oil company.  Petitioner has no place of business in Texas, and never has been licensed to do business there.  Its only contacts with the State consisted of sending its chief executive officer to Houston to negotiate the contract with the consortium, accepting into its New York bank account checks drawn by the consortium on a Texas bank, purchasing helicopters, equipment, and training services from a Texas manufacturer, and sending personnel to that manufacturer's facilities for training.  After a helicopter owned by petitioner crashed in Peru, resulting in the death of respondents' decedents -- United States citizens who were employed by the consortium -- respondents instituted wrongful death actions in a Texas state court against the consortium, the Texas manufacturer, and petitioner.  Denying petitioner's motion to dismiss the actions for lack of in personam jurisdiction over it, the trial court entered judgment against petitioner on a jury verdict in favor of respondents.  The Texas Court of Civil Appeals reversed, holding that in personam jurisdiction over petitioner was lacking, but in turn was reversed by the Texas Supreme Court.
Held:  Petitioner's contacts with Texas were insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and hence to allow the Texas court to assert in personam jurisdiction over petitioner.  The one trip to Houston by petitioner's chief executive officer for the purpose of negotiating the transportation services contract cannot be regarded as a contact of a ""continuous and systematic"" nature, and thus cannot support an assertion of general jurisdiction.  Similarly, petitioner's acceptance of checks drawn on a Texas bank is of negligible significance for purposes of determining whether petitioner had sufficient contacts in Texas.  Nor were petitioner's purchases of helicopters and equipment from the Texas manufacturer and the related training trips a sufficient basis for the Texas court's assertion of jurisdiction.  Rosenberg Bros. & Co. v. Curtis Brown Co., 260 U. S. 516.  Mere purchases, even if occurring at regular intervals, are not enough to warrant 
Page 466 U. S. 409
 a State's assertion of in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of action not related to the purchases.  And the fact that petitioner sent personnel to Texas for training in connection with the purchases did not enhance the nature of petitioner's contacts with Texas.  Pp.  466 U. S. 413-419.

Syllabus 
When petitioner was discharged from respondent city's police force, he filed a grievance pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the city and a labor union, contending that there was ""no proper cause"" for his discharge.  The grievance was ultimately taken to arbitration, and the arbitrator ruled against petitioner, finding that there was just cause for his discharge.  Petitioner did not appeal this decision, but filed an action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against the city and certain of its officials, including the Chief of Police, alleging that he was discharged for exercising his First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, freedom of association, and freedom to petition the government for redress of grievances.  The jury returned a verdict against the Chief of Police but in favor of the other defendants. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment against the Chief of Police, holding that petitioner's First Amendment claims were barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel.
Held:  In a  1983 action, a federal court should not afford res judicata or collateral estoppel effect to an award in an arbitration proceeding brought pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, and hence petitioner's  1983 action was not barred by the arbitration award.   466 U. S.  287-292.
(a) Title 28 U.S.C.  1738 -- which provides that the ""judicial proceedings"" of any court of any State shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State from which they are taken -- does not require that preclusive effect be given to the arbitration award in question.  Arbitration is not a ""judicial proceeding"" and, therefore,  1738 does not apply to arbitration awards.  Pp.  466 U. S. 287-288.
(b) Although arbitration is well-suited to resolving contractual disputes, it cannot provide an adequate substitute for a judicial proceeding in protecting the federal statutory and constitutional rights that  1983 is designed to safeguard.  As a result, according preclusive effect to an arbitration award in a subsequent  1983 action would undermine that statute's efficacy in protecting federal rights.

|466 u.s. 294|"Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon
No. 82-1479
Argued December 6, 1983
Decided April 18, 1984
466 U.S. 294

Syllabus 
Under Massachusetts law, a defendant charged with certain minor crimes in Boston Municipal Court may elect to have a bench trial or a jury trial.  If he chooses a jury trial and is convicted, he has the normal appellate process open to him, but if he chooses a bench trial and is dissatisfied with the results, he has an absolute right to a trial de novo before a jury, and need not allege error at the bench trial to obtain de novo review.  However, there is no right to appellate review of a bench trial conviction.  Respondent elected to undergo a first-tier bench trial on a charge of knowing possession of implements designed for breaking into an automobile to steal property.  He was convicted and sentenced to a jail term, the trial judge having rejected his claim that the prosecution had introduced no evidence of intent to steal.  Respondent then requested a de novo jury trial and was released on personal recognizance pending retrial.  Before the jury trial commenced, respondent moved to dismiss the charge on the ground that no evidence of intent had been presented at the bench trial, and thus retrial was barred under Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, which held that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a second trial when a reviewing court reverses a conviction on the ground that the evidence presented at the first trial was legally insufficient.  The motion to dismiss was denied, and respondent then sought relief in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which ultimately held that Burks was inapplicable because no appellate court had ruled that the evidence was insufficient at respondent's bench trial.  The Massachusetts court also ruled that a trial de novo without a determination as to the sufficiency of the evidence at the bench trial would not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Respondent then sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, which held that respondent was ""in custody"" for purposes of 28 U.S.C.  2254(b) and that he had exhausted his state remedies.  Finding for respondent on the merits, the court concluded that, under Burks, a second trial was foreclosed if the evidence against respondent at the bench trial was insufficient, and that there was insufficient evidence of intent at the bench trial to support respondent's conviction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The District Court had jurisdiction to entertain respondent's habeas corpus action.  Pp.  466 U. S. 300-303. 
Page 466 U. S. 295

(a) For purposes of the federal habeas corpus statutes, respondent was in ""custody"" even though his conviction was vacated when he applied for a trial de novo and he had been released on personal recognizance.  The use of habeas corpus is not restricted to situations in which the applicant is in actual physical custody.  The Massachusetts statute under which respondent was released subjected him to restraints not shared by the public generally, including the obligations to appear in court for trial and not to depart without leave.  Cf. Hensley v. Municipal Court, 411 U. S. 345.  Pp.  466 U. S. 300-302.
(b) Respondent had exhausted his state remedies with respect to his double jeopardy claim.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court rejected his claim, and the fact that he might ultimately be acquitted at the trial de novo did not alter the fact that he had taken his claim that he should not be tried again as far as he could in the state courts.  A requirement that a defendant run the entire gamut of state procedures, including retrial, prior to consideration of his claim in federal court would require him to sacrifice the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause against being twice put to trial for the same offense.  Pp.  466 U. S. 302-303.
2. Respondent's retrial de novo without any judicial determination of the sufficiency of the evidence at his prior bench trial will not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.  466 U. S. 304-313.
(a) Ludwig v. Massachusetts, 427 U. S. 618 -- upholding a prior Massachusetts two-tier system of trial courts that differed from the present one by requiring a defendant to participate in the first-tier proceedings and by not allowing him to choose a jury trial in the first instance -- was not disturbed by the decision in Burks, supra, and is dispositive of the double jeopardy issue here.  Pp.  466 U. S. 304-306.
(b) In this case, the State is not attempting, contrary to the guarantees embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause, to impose multiple punishments for a single offense or to convict respondent after acquittal.  Respondent has not been acquitted; he simply maintains that he ought to have been.  Pp.  466 U. S. 306-308.
(c) The concept of ""continuing jeopardy"" is implicit in the general rule that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial after reversal of a conviction.  Acquittal terminates the initial jeopardy, and Burks recognizes that a determination by a reviewing court that the evidence was legally insufficient likewise terminates the initial jeopardy.  Respondent failed to identify any stage of the state proceedings that can be held to have terminated jeopardy.  Pp.  466 U. S. 308-310.
(d) The Massachusetts system does not constitute governmental oppression of the sort against which the Double Jeopardy Clause was intended to protect, even when a defendant convicted at the first tier claims insufficiency of the evidence.  The defendant's absolute right to obtain a de novo jury trial without alleging error at the bench trial ameliorates 
Page 466 U. S. 296

			"|"Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon
No. 82-1479
Argued December 6, 1983
Decided April 18, 1984
466 U.S. 294

Syllabus 
Under Massachusetts law, a defendant charged with certain minor crimes in Boston Municipal Court may elect to have a bench trial or a jury trial.  If he chooses a jury trial and is convicted, he has the normal appellate process open to him, but if he chooses a bench trial and is dissatisfied with the results, he has an absolute right to a trial de novo before a jury, and need not allege error at the bench trial to obtain de novo review.  However, there is no right to appellate review of a bench trial conviction.  Respondent elected to undergo a first-tier bench trial on a charge of knowing possession of implements designed for breaking into an automobile to steal property.  He was convicted and sentenced to a jail term, the trial judge having rejected his claim that the prosecution had introduced no evidence of intent to steal.  Respondent then requested a de novo jury trial and was released on personal recognizance pending retrial.  Before the jury trial commenced, respondent moved to dismiss the charge on the ground that no evidence of intent had been presented at the bench trial, and thus retrial was barred under Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, which held that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a second trial when a reviewing court reverses a conviction on the ground that the evidence presented at the first trial was legally insufficient.  The motion to dismiss was denied, and respondent then sought relief in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which ultimately held that Burks was inapplicable because no appellate court had ruled that the evidence was insufficient at respondent's bench trial.  The Massachusetts court also ruled that a trial de novo without a determination as to the sufficiency of the evidence at the bench trial would not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Respondent then sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, which held that respondent was ""in custody"" for purposes of 28 U.S.C.  2254(b) and that he had exhausted his state remedies.  Finding for respondent on the merits, the court concluded that, under Burks, a second trial was foreclosed if the evidence against respondent at the bench trial was insufficient, and that there was insufficient evidence of intent at the bench trial to support respondent's conviction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The District Court had jurisdiction to entertain respondent's habeas corpus action.  Pp.  466 U. S. 300-303. 
Page 466 U. S. 295

(a) For purposes of the federal habeas corpus statutes, respondent was in ""custody"" even though his conviction was vacated when he applied for a trial de novo and he had been released on personal recognizance.  The use of habeas corpus is not restricted to situations in which the applicant is in actual physical custody.  The Massachusetts statute under which respondent was released subjected him to restraints not shared by the public generally, including the obligations to appear in court for trial and not to depart without leave.  Cf. Hensley v. Municipal Court, 411 U. S. 345.  Pp.  466 U. S. 300-302.
(b) Respondent had exhausted his state remedies with respect to his double jeopardy claim.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court rejected his claim, and the fact that he might ultimately be acquitted at the trial de novo did not alter the fact that he had taken his claim that he should not be tried again as far as he could in the state courts.  A requirement that a defendant run the entire gamut of state procedures, including retrial, prior to consideration of his claim in federal court would require him to sacrifice the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause against being twice put to trial for the same offense.  Pp.  466 U. S. 302-303.
2. Respondent's retrial de novo without any judicial determination of the sufficiency of the evidence at his prior bench trial will not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.  466 U. S. 304-313.
(a) Ludwig v. Massachusetts, 427 U. S. 618 -- upholding a prior Massachusetts two-tier system of trial courts that differed from the present one by requiring a defendant to participate in the first-tier proceedings and by not allowing him to choose a jury trial in the first instance -- was not disturbed by the decision in Burks, supra, and is dispositive of the double jeopardy issue here.  Pp.  466 U. S. 304-306.
(b) In this case, the State is not attempting, contrary to the guarantees embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause, to impose multiple punishments for a single offense or to convict respondent after acquittal.  Respondent has not been acquitted; he simply maintains that he ought to have been.  Pp.  466 U. S. 306-308.
(c) The concept of ""continuing jeopardy"" is implicit in the general rule that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial after reversal of a conviction.  Acquittal terminates the initial jeopardy, and Burks recognizes that a determination by a reviewing court that the evidence was legally insufficient likewise terminates the initial jeopardy.  Respondent failed to identify any stage of the state proceedings that can be held to have terminated jeopardy.  Pp.  466 U. S. 308-310.
(d) The Massachusetts system does not constitute governmental oppression of the sort against which the Double Jeopardy Clause was intended to protect, even when a defendant convicted at the first tier claims insufficiency of the evidence.  The defendant's absolute right to obtain a de novo jury trial without alleging error at the bench trial ameliorates 
Page 466 U. S. 296
 the danger of affording the prosecution an opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.  The prosecution has every incentive to put forward its strongest case at the bench trial, because an acquittal would preclude reprosecution of the defendant.  There is nothing to stop a defendant from choosing a bench trial for the sole purpose of getting a preview of the State's case to enable him to prepare better for the jury trial.

466 U.S. 341

Syllabus 
In petitioner's criminal trial in a Kentucky state court, the judge overruled defense counsel's request that ""an admonition be given to the jury that no emphasis be given to the defendant's failure to testify.""  Petitioner was convicted, and on appeal he argued that the trial judge's refusal to charge the jury as requested violated Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288, which held that, in order fully to effectuate the right to remain silent, a trial judge must, if requested to do so, instruct the jury not to draw an adverse inference from the defendant's failure to testify.  Conceding that Carter requires the trial judge, upon request, to give an appropriate instruction, the Kentucky Supreme Court held that the trial court properly denied petitioner's request because there was a ""vast difference"" under Kentucky law between an ""admonition"" and an ""instruction,"" and petitioner, who would have been entitled to an ""instruction,"" had requested only an ""admonition.""
Held:
1. In the circumstances of this case, the failure to respect petitioner's constitutional rights is not supported by an independent and adequate state ground.  Pp.  466 U. S. 344-351.
(a) Kentucky generally distinguishes between ""instructions"" -- which tend to be statements of black-letter law setting forth the legal rules governing the outcome of a case -- and ""admonitions"" -- which tend to be cautionary statements regarding the jury's conduct, such as statements requiring the jury to disregard certain testimony.  However, the substantive distinction between admonitions and instructions is not always clear or closely hewn to, and their content can overlap.  Nor is there strict adherence to the practice of giving admonitions orally only, while giving instructions in writing as well.  Pp.  466 U. S. 345-348.
(b) For federal constitutional purposes, petitioner adequately invoked his substantive right to jury guidance, and Kentucky's distinction between admonitions and instructions is not the sort of firmly established and regularly followed state practice that can prevent implementation of federal constitutional rights.  To insist on a particular label for the statement to the jury required by Carter would ""force resort to an arid ritual of meaningless form,"" Staub v. City of Baxley, 355 U. S. 313,  355 U. S. 320, and would further no perceivable state interest.  Pp.  466 U. S. 348-349. 
Page 466 U. S. 342

(c) This is not a case, as asserted by the State, of a defendant attempting to circumvent, as a matter of deliberate strategy, a firm state procedural rule that instructions be in writing.  The record reveals little to support the State's view of petitioner's request, a single passing reference to an ""admonition"" being far too slender a reed on which to rest the conclusion that petitioner insisted on an oral statement and nothing else.  Where it is inescapable that the defendant sought to invoke the substance of his federal right, the asserted state law defect in form must be more evident than it is here.  Pp.  466 U. S. 349-351.
2. Evaluation of the State's contention that any Carter error here was harmless is best made in state court before it is made in this Court.  Pp.  466 U. S. 351-352.

Syllabus 
Respondent manufacturer of cordage products, in filing its Ohio ad valorem personal property tax returns for 1976 and 1977, deducted from the total value of its inventory the value of imported fibers that were stored in their original packages for future use in the manufacturing process.  In taking this deduction, respondent relied on Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, 324 U. S. 652 (Hooven I), a case involving the same tax and the same parties as the instant case, as well as similar property, and wherein it was held that subjecting the property in question there to the Ohio personal property tax would violate the Import-Export Clause.  Petitioner Ohio Tax Commissioner disallowed the deduction and accordingly increased the assessments, relying on Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276, where the assessment of a State's nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax on an inventory of imported tires maintained at a wholesale distribution warehouse was held not to be within the Import-Export Clause's prohibition against States' levying ""any Imposts or Duties on Imports.""  The Ohio Board of Tax Appeals reversed, ruling that petitioner was collaterally estopped by the decision in Hooven I from levying the increased assessments, and rejecting respondent's argument that Michelin implicitly overruled Hooven I.  The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. The assessment of the Ohio personal property tax on the original-package imported fibers in question does not violate the Import-Export Clause.  This Court in Michelin specifically abandoned the concept that the Import-Export Clause constituted a broad prohibition against all forms of state taxation of imports, and changed the focus of Import-Export Clause cases from whether the goods have lost their status as imports to whether the tax sought to be imposed is an ""Impost or Duty.""  Hooven I, having been decided under the original-package doctrine, was among the progeny of Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29, which was expressly overruled in Michelin.  Thus, Hooven I is inconsistent with Michelin, and although not expressly overruled in Michelin, must be regarded as retaining no vitality since the Michelin decision, and accordingly is overruled to the extent that it espoused the original-package doctrine.  Pp.  466 U. S. 357-361. 
Page 466 U. S. 354

2. Petitioner is not barred by collateral estoppel from levying the increased assessments.  Pp.  466 U. S. 361-363.
(a) Collateral estoppel was applied here as a matter of federal, not state, law, and thus the case is not insulated from review in this Court on the asserted ground that, because Michelin did not expressly overrule Hooven I, state law principles of collateral estoppel bar imposition of the Ohio tax on respondent's imported fibers.  The case concerns federal issues and a contention that a state court disregarded a federal constitutional ruling of this Court.  Pp.  466 U. S. 361-362.
(b) While the parties, the tax, and the goods imported in their containers are the same here as in Hooven I, the years involved are not.  Because of this difference in tax years, the case is controlled by Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U. S. 591, a federal income tax case wherein it was held that an earlier decision of the Board of Tax Appeals involving the same facts, questions, and parties, but different tax years, was not conclusive under the collateral estoppel doctrine because certain intervening decisions of this Court made manifest the error of the result reached by the Board. Failure to follow Sunnen's dictates would lead to the very tax inequality that the admonition of that case was designed to avoid.  Pp.  466 U. S. 362-363.

Petitioner employers entered into collective bargaining agreements with a union that required them to participate in two multiemployer employee benefit trust funds.  The trust agreements required petitioners to contribute to the funds according to the applicable terms of their collective bargaining agreements.

Respondents filed complaints in Federal District Court, claiming that petitioners failed to meet their contribution requirements, and requesting the court to order an accounting and immediate payment of all sums thereby determined to be due.  Petitioners defended on the ground that the complaints raised disputed interpretations under the collective bargaining agreements, that first must be submitted to arbitration.

The agents then walked around the gate and along the road and found a field of marihuana over a mile from petitioner's house.  Petitioner was arrested and indicted for ""manufactur[ing]"" a ""controlled substance"" in violation of a federal statute.  After a pretrial hearing, the District Court suppressed evidence of the discovery of the marihuana field, applying Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, and holding that petitioner had a reasonable expectation that the field would remain private and that it was not an ""open"" field that invited casual intrusion.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Katz had not impaired the vitality of the open fields doctrine of Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57, which permits police officers to enter and search a field without a warrant.  In No. 82-1273, after receiving a tip that marihuana was being grown in the woods behind respondent's residence, police officers entered the woods by a path between the residence and a neighboring house, and followed a path through the woods until they reached two marihuana patches fenced with chicken wire and having ""No Trespassing"" signs.  Later, the officers, upon determining that the patches were on respondent's property, obtained a search warrant and seized the marihuana.  Respondent was then arrested and indicted.  The Maine trial court granted respondent's motion to suppress the fruits of the second search, holding that the initial warrantless search was unreasonable, that the ""No Trespassing"" signs and secluded location of the marihuana patches evinced a reasonable expectation of privacy, and that therefore the open fields doctrine did not apply.  The Maine Supreme Judicial Court affirmed.
Held:  The open fields doctrine should be applied in both cases to determine whether the discovery or seizure of the marihuana in question was valid.  Pp.  466 U. S. 176-184. 
Page 466 U. S. 171

(a) That doctrine was founded upon the explicit language of the Fourth Amendment, whose special protection accorded to ""persons houses, papers, and effects"" does ""not exten[d] to the open fields.""  Hester v. United States, supra, at  265 U. S. 59.  Open fields are not ""effects"" within the meaning of the Amendment, the term ""effects"" being less inclusive than ""property,"" and not encompassing open fields.  The government's intrusion upon open fields is not one of those ""unreasonable searches"" proscribed by the Amendment.  Pp.  466 U. S. 176-177.
(b) Since Katz v. United States, supra, the touchstone of Fourth Amendment analysis has been whether a person has a ""constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.""  Id. at  389 U. S. 360.  The Amendment does not protect the merely subjective expectation of privacy, but only those ""expectation[s] that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.'""  Id. at  389 U. S. 361.  Because open fields are accessible to the public and the police in ways that a home, office, or commercial structure would not be, and because fences or ""No Trespassing"" signs do not effectively bar the public from viewing open fields, the asserted expectation of privacy in open fields is not one that society recognizes as reasonable.  Moreover, the common law, by implying that only the land immediately surrounding and associated with the home warrants the Fourth Amendment protections that attach to the home, conversely implies that no expectation of privacy legitimately attaches to open fields.  Pp.  466 U. S. 177-181.
(c) Analysis of the circumstances of the search of an open field on a case-by-case basis to determine whether reasonable expectations of privacy were violated would not provide a workable accommodation between the needs of law enforcement and the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment.  Such an ad hoc approach not only would make it difficult for the policeman to discern the scope of his authority, but also would create the danger that constitutional rights would be arbitrarily and inequitably enforced.  Pp.  466 U. S. 181-182.
(d) Steps taken to protect privacy, such as planting the marihuana on secluded land and erecting fences and ""No Trespassing"" signs around the property, do not establish that expectations of privacy in an open field are legitimate in the sense required by the Fourth Amendment.  The test of legitimacy is not whether the individual chooses to conceal assertedly ""private"" activity, but whether the government's intrusion infringes upon the personal and societal values protected by the Amendment.  The fact that the government's intrusion upon an open field is a trespass at common law does not make it a ""search"" in the constitutional sense.  In the case of open fields, the general rights of property protected by the common law of trespass have little or no relevance to the applicability of the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  466 U. S. 182-184.

Decided April 17,1984
466 U.S. 198

Syllabus 
Petitioner owns the fee title to the Ballona Lagoon, a narrow body of water connected to a man-made harbor located in the city of Los Angeles on the Pacific Ocean.  The lagoon became part of the United States following the war with Mexico, which was formally ended by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848.  Petitioner s predecessors-in-interest had their interest in the lagoon confirmed in federal patent proceedings pursuant to an 1851 Act that had been enacted to implement the treaty, and that provided that the validity of claims to California lands would be decided according to Mexican law. California made no claim to any interest in the lagoon at the time of the patent proceedings, and no mention was made of any such interest in the patent that was issued.  Los Angeles brought suit against petitioner in a California state court, alleging that the city held an easement in the Ballona Lagoon for commerce, navigation, fishing, passage of fresh water to canals, and water recreation, such an easement having been acquired at the time California became a State.  California was joined as a defendant as required by state law and filed a cross-complaint alleging that it had acquired such an easement upon its admission to the Union and had granted this interest to the city.  The trial court ruled in favor of the city and State, finding that the lagoon was subject to the claimed public trust easement.  The California Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting petitioner's arguments that the lagoon had never been tideland, that even if it had been, Mexican law imposed no servitude on the fee interest by reason of that fact, and that, even if it were tideland and subject to servitude under Mexican law, such a servitude was forfeited by the State's failure to assert it in the federal patent proceedings.
Held: California cannot at this late date assert its public trust easement over petitioner's property, when petitioner's predecessors-in-interest had their interest confirmed without any mention of such an easement in the federal patent proceedings.  The interest claimed by California is one of such substantial magnitude that, regardless of the fact that the claim is asserted by the State in its sovereign capacity, this interest must have been presented in the patent proceedings or be barred.

Syllabus 
Acting pursuant to warrants issued on a showing of probable cause that numerous unidentified illegal aliens were employed at a garment factory, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) conducted two ""factory surveys"" of the workforce in search of illegal aliens.  A third factory survey was conducted with the employer's consent at another garment factory.  During each survey, which lasted from one to two hours, INS agents positioned themselves near the factory exits, while other agents moved systematically through the factory, approaching employees and, after identifying themselves, asking the employees from one to three questions relating to their citizenship.  If an employee gave a credible reply that he was a United States citizen or produced his immigration papers, the agent moved on to another employee.  During the survey, employees continued with their work and were free to walk around within the factory.  Respondent employees -- who were United States citizens or permanent resident aliens and who had been questioned during the surveys -- and their union filed actions, consolidated in Federal District Court, alleging that the factory surveys violated their Fourth Amendment rights, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the INS, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the surveys constituted a seizure of the entire workforces, and that the INS could not question an individual employee unless its agents had a reasonable suspicion that the employee was an illegal alien.
Held:  The factory surveys did not result in the seizure of the entire workforces, and the individual questioning of the respondent employees by INS agents concerning their citizenship did not amount to a detention or seizure under the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  466 U. S. 215-221.
(a) Interrogation relating to one's identity or a request for identification by the police does not, by itself, constitute a Fourth Amendment seizure.  Unless the circumstances of the encounter are so intimidating as to demonstrate that a reasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave if he had not responded, such questioning does not result in a detention under the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  466 U. S. 216-217.
(b) The entire workforces of the factories were not seized for the duration of the surveys here, even though INS agents were placed near 
Page 466 U. S. 211
 the exits of the factory sites.  The record indicates that the agents' conduct consisted simply of questioning employees and arresting those they had probable cause to believe were unlawfully present in the factory.  This conduct should not have given respondents, or any other citizens or aliens lawfully present in the factories, any reason to believe that they would be detained if they gave truthful answers to the questions put to them or if they simply refused to answer.  If mere questioning did not constitute a seizure when it occurred inside the factory, it was no more a seizure when it occurred at the exits.  Pp.  466 U. S. 217-219.
(c) Since there was no seizure of the workforces by virtue of the method of conducting the surveys, the issue of individual questioning could be presented only if one of the respondent employees had, in fact, been seized or detained, but their deposition testimony showed that none was.  They may only litigate what happened to them, and their description of the encounters with the INS agents showed that the encounters were classic consensual encounters, rather than Fourth Amendment seizures.

No. 82-1186
Argued November 30, 1983

466 U.S. 243

Syllabus 
The Warsaw Convention (Convention), an international air carriage treaty that the United States ratified in 1934, sets a limit on an air carrier's liability for lost cargo at 250 gold French francs per kilogram, which sum may be converted into any national currency.  In 1978, Congress repealed the Par Value Modification Act (PVMA), which set an ""official"" price of gold in the United States. Nevertheless, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) continued to sanction the use of the last official price of gold as a conversion factor.  As a result, a $9.07-per-pound limit of liability remained codified in the CAB regulations governing international air carriers' tariffs filed under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958.  Franklin Mint Corp. brought suit in Federal District Court against Trans World Airlines (TWA) to recover damages in the amount of $250,000 for the loss in 1979 of packages containing numismatic materials delivered to TWA for transport from Philadelphia to London.  The parties having stipulated that TWA was responsible for the loss, the only dispute was the extent of liability.  The District Court ruled that, under the Convention, the liability was limited to $6,475.98, a figure derived from the weight of the packages, the Convention's liability limit, and the last official price of gold in the United States.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but also ruled that, 60 days from the issuance of the mandate, the Convention's liability limit would be unenforceable in the United States, since enforcement of the Convention required a factor for converting the liability limit into dollars, and there was no United States legislation specifying a factor to be used by United States courts.
Held:
1. The Convention's cargo liability limit remains enforceable in United States courts, and was not rendered unenforceable by the 1978 repeal of the PVMA.  Pp.  466 U. S. 251-253.
(a) Legislative silence is not sufficient to abrogate a treaty.  Here, neither the legislative histories of the various PVMA's, the history of the repealing Act, nor the repealing Act itself, make any reference to the 
Page 466 U. S. 244
 Convention, the repeal being unrelated to the Convention and intended to give formal effect to a new international monetary system.  Since the Convention is a self-executing treaty, no domestic legislation is required to give it the force of law in the United States.  And neither Congress nor the Executive Branch has given the required notice to other parties to the Convention that the United States planned to abrogate the Convention.  To the contrary, the Executive Branch continues to maintain that the Convention's liability limit remains enforceable in the United States.  Pp.  466 U. S. 251-253.
(b) When the parties to a treaty continue to assert its vitality, a private person may not invoke the doctrine of rebus sic stantibus to assert that a treaty ceases to be binding when there has been a substantial change in conditions since its promulgation.  Accordingly, the erosion of the international gold standard and the 1978 repeal of the PVMA cannot be construed as terminating or repudiating the United States' duty to abide by the Convention's liability limit.  P.  466 U. S. 253.
2. A $9.07-per-pound liability limit is not inconsistent with domestic law or with the Convention itself.  Pp.  466 U. S. 254-260.
(a) It is clear that such limit does not contravene any domestic legislation, absent any suggestion by Congress when it repealed the PVMA that the CAB should thereafter use a conversion factor different from the official price of gold or that either of the political branches expected or intended the repealing Act to affect the dollar equivalent of the Convention's liability limit.  P.  466 U. S. 255.
(b) Tying the Convention's liability limit to today's gold market would fail to effect any purpose of the Convention's framers, and would be inconsistent with well-established international practice.  A fixed $9.07-per-pound liability limit represents a choice not inconsistent with the Convention's purposes of setting some limits on a carrier's liability, of setting a stable, predictable, and internationally uniform limit that would encourage the growth of the air carrier industry, and of linking the Convention to a constant value that would keep step with the average value of cargo carried, and so remain equitable for carriers and transport users alike.  Pp.  466 U. S. 255-260.

The District Court ruled that, under the Convention, the liability was limited to $6,475.98, a figure derived from the weight of the packages, the Convention's liability limit, and the last official price of gold in the United States.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but also ruled that, 60 days from the issuance of the mandate, the Convention's liability limit would be unenforceable in the United States, since enforcement of the Convention required a factor for converting the liability limit into dollars, and there was no United States legislation specifying a factor to be used by United States courts.
Held:
1. The Convention's cargo liability limit remains enforceable in United States courts, and was not rendered unenforceable by the 1978 repeal of the PVMA.  Pp.  466 U. S. 251-253.
(a) Legislative silence is not sufficient to abrogate a treaty.  Here, neither the legislative histories of the various PVMA's, the history of the repealing Act, nor the repealing Act itself, make any reference to the 
Page 466 U. S. 244
 Convention, the repeal being unrelated to the Convention and intended to give formal effect to a new international monetary system.  Since the Convention is a self-executing treaty, no domestic legislation is required to give it the force of law in the United States.  And neither Congress nor the Executive Branch has given the required notice to other parties to the Convention that the United States planned to abrogate the Convention.  To the contrary, the Executive Branch continues to maintain that the Convention's liability limit remains enforceable in the United States.  Pp.  466 U. S. 251-253.
(b) When the parties to a treaty continue to assert its vitality, a private person may not invoke the doctrine of rebus sic stantibus to assert that a treaty ceases to be binding when there has been a substantial change in conditions since its promulgation.  Accordingly, the erosion of the international gold standard and the 1978 repeal of the PVMA cannot be construed as terminating or repudiating the United States' duty to abide by the Convention's liability limit.  P.  466 U. S. 253.
2. A $9.07-per-pound liability limit is not inconsistent with domestic law or with the Convention itself.  Pp.  466 U. S. 254-260.
(a) It is clear that such limit does not contravene any domestic legislation, absent any suggestion by Congress when it repealed the PVMA that the CAB should thereafter use a conversion factor different from the official price of gold or that either of the political branches expected or intended the repealing Act to affect the dollar equivalent of the Convention's liability limit.  P.  466 U. S. 255.
(b) Tying the Convention's liability limit to today's gold market would fail to effect any purpose of the Convention's framers, and would be inconsistent with well-established international practice.  A fixed $9.07-per-pound liability limit represents a choice not inconsistent with the Convention's purposes of setting some limits on a carrier's liability, of setting a stable, predictable, and internationally uniform limit that would encourage the growth of the air carrier industry, and of linking the Convention to a constant value that would keep step with the average value of cargo carried, and so remain equitable for carriers and transport users alike.  Pp.  466 U. S. 255-260.

466 U.S. 147

Syllabus 
After respondent filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging discriminatory treatment by her former employer (petitioner), she received a right-to-sue letter from the Commission in January, 1981, informing her that she could commence a civil action in Federal District Court and that, if she chose to do so, the suit must be filed within 90 days of receipt of the letter.  Respondent mailed the letter to the District Court, where it was received in March.  In addition, she requested appointment of counsel.  In April, a Magistrate entered an order requiring that respondent's request for appointment of counsel be made by use of the court's motion form and supporting questionnaire, and reminding her that a complaint must be filed within 90 days of the issuance of the right-to-sue letter.  The questionnaire was not returned until the 96th day after receipt of the right-to-sue letter, and on the next day, the Magistrate denied, as untimely, the motion for appointment of counsel, but referred to the District Judge the question whether the filing of the right-to-sue letter with the court constituted commencement of an action under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The court held that respondent forfeited her right to pursue her claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because of her failure to file a proper complaint within 90 days of receipt of the right-to-sue letter, as required by the Act.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  There is no basis for giving Title VII actions a special status under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as the Court of Appeals apparently did.  Rule 3 states that an action ""is commenced by filing a complaint with the court,"" and Rule 8(a)(2) provides that a complaint must include ""a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.""  The Court of Appeals suggested no persuasive justification for its view that the Federal Rules were to have a different meaning in, or were not to apply to, Title VII litigation.  Nor is there any basis for the Court of Appeals' apparent alternative holding that the statutory 90-day period for invoking the court's jurisdiction is ""tolled"" by the filing of the right-to-sue letter.

No. 82-825
Argued October 31, 1983
Decided April 2, 1984
466 U.S. 54

Syllabus 
Section 707(e) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Act) authorizes the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) ""to investigate and act on a charge"" that an employer has engaged in ""a pattern or practice"" of employment discrimination.  Section 706(b) provides that such a charge ""shall be in writing under oath or affirmation and shall contain such information and be in such form as the Commission requires,"" and further requires the EEOC to
""serve a notice of the charge (including the date, place and circumstances of the alleged unlawful employment practice) on [the] employer . . . within ten days""
of the filing of the charge.  An implementing regulation provides that a charge of discrimination must
""contain . . . [a] clear and concise statement of the facts, including the pertinent dates, constituting the alleged unlawful employment practices.""
A Commissioner of the EEOC issued a sworn charge against respondent employer, alleging that it had violated the Act by discriminating against Negroes and women in ""recruitment, hiring, selection, job assignment, training, testing, promotion, and terms and conditions of employment.""  The charge also specified the occupational categories access to which had been affected by the alleged discrimination.  A copy of the charge was served on respondent 10 days after the charge was filed.  Thereafter, respondent claimed that the charge was ""not supportable by the facts,"" and when it persistently refused to provide the EEOC with certain requested records and data, the EEOC issued a subpoena duces tecum, directing respondent to turn over the information.  Instead of complying with the subpoena, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court to quash the subpoena and enjoin the EEOC's investigation, alleging that the subpoena was unenforceable because the EEOC had failed to disclose facts sufficient to satisfy  706(b)'s mandate.  The charge was then amended to allege that respondent had engaged in the identified unlawful employment practices on a continuing basis from at least the effective date of the Act until the present.  When respondent still refused to comply with the request for information, the EEOC filed suit in Federal District Court requesting enforcement of the subpoena, and this suit was consolidated with respondent's suit.  
Page 466 U. S. 55
 The District Court denied respondent relief and enforced the subpoena.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the EEOC had failed to comply with either  706(b) or the implementing regulation, that the charge and notice should inform the employer of the approximate dates of the unlawful practices, should include enough other information to show that those dates have some ""basis in fact,"" and should contain a ""statement of the circumstances"" of the alleged violations ""supported by some factual or statistical basis.""
Held:  All of the strictures embodied in Title VII and the implementing regulation pertaining to the form and content of a charge of systemic discrimination and to the timing and adequacy of the notice afforded the employer were adhered to in this case, and therefore the EEOC was entitled to enforcement of its subpoena.   466 U. S.  61-82.
(a) In determining the EEOC's authority to request judicial enforcement of its subpoenas, effect must be given to Congress' purpose in establishing a linkage between the EEOC's investigatory power and charges of discrimination.  If the EEOC were able to insist that an employer obey a subpoena despite the complainant's failure to file a valid charge, Congress' desire to prevent the EEOC from exercising unconstrained investigative authority would be thwarted.  Accordingly, the existence of a charge that meets the requirements of  706(b) is a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial enforcement of a subpoena issued by the EEOC.  And, for purposes of this case, it is assumed that compliance with  706(b)'s notice requirement is also a jurisdictional prerequisite to enforcement of a subpoena.  Pp.  466 U. S. 61-67.
(b) The prescription embodied in the implementing regulation, as applied to a charge alleging a ""pattern or practice"" of discrimination, should be construed as follows:  insofar as he is able, the Commissioner issuing the charge should identify the groups of persons that he has reason to believe have been discriminated against, the categories of employment positions from which they have been excluded, the methods by which the discrimination may have been effected, and the periods of time in which he suspects the discrimination to have been practiced.  The charge issued here, as amended, plainly satisfied these standards.  Pp.  466 U. S. 67-74.
(c) The specific purpose of  706(b)'s notice provision is to give an employer fair notice of the existence and nature of the allegations against it, and not to impose a substantive constraint on the EEOC's investigative authority.  Properly construed,  706(b) requires the EEOC, within 10 days of the filing of a charge, to reveal to the employer all of the information that must be included in the charge itself under the current version of the implementing regulation.  Because in this case respondent was 
Page 466 U. S. 56
 provided with a copy of the charge 10 days after it was filed, and because the charge comported with the regulation, the notice provision was satisfied.  Pp.  466 U. S. 74-81.

466 U.S. 96

Syllabus 
This original action was filed by Louisiana against Mississippi and a riparian landowner (Dille) to resolve a dispute as to the boundary between the two States in a reach of the Mississippi River.  In 1970, Louisiana, acting in its capacity under Louisiana law as the owner of the riverbed out to the boundary line, executed an oil and gas lease covering the disputed area.  In 1971, Dille, as the owner of riparian land in Mississippi who, under Mississippi law, has title to the riverbed out to the boundary line, executed a similar lease to the same lessee, who drilled a well directionally under the river from a surface location on Dille's land on the Mississippi side.  The location of the ""bottom hole"" of the well -- which was completed in 1972 and has been producing continuously since then -- is known and agreed upon.  After trial, the Special Master filed a Report, concluding that, at all times during the disputed period of 1972-1982, the well's bottom hole was within Louisiana, west of wherever the boundary might have been, and that it was not necessary to delineate the specific boundary during the relevant years.  Mississippi filed exceptions to the Report.
Held:
1. At all times since the completion of the well in 1972, its bottom hole has been within Louisiana.  Pp.  466 U. S. 99-106.
(a) Earlier original jurisdiction litigation between Louisiana and Mississippi in this Court has established that the ""live thalweg"" of the navigable channel of the Mississippi River is the boundary between the two States.  A boundary defined as the live thalweg follows the course of the stream as its bed and channel change with the gradual processes of erosion and accretion.  The ordinary course of vessel traffic on the river defines the thalweg.  Pp.  466 U. S. 99-101.
(b) The Court agrees with the Special Master's conclusion, which is consistent with the testimony of Louisiana's two expert witnesses, that the live thalweg was to the east of the well's bottom-hole location for each of the years in question, thus leaving the well within Louisiana throughout the disputed period, and with his rejection of the view of Mississippi's expert witness that the boundary line migrated so as to shift the jurisdictional location of the well back and forth between the States during the relevant years.  This conclusion resolves the case so far as 
Page 466 U. S. 97
 the Louisiana and Dille leases, and the consequences that flow therefrom, are concerned.  Pp.  466 U. S. 101-106.
2. The Master properly concluded that the only issue to be resolved centered on the location of the well's bottom hole, and that it as not necessary to delineate the specific boundary in the area for each of the 11 years from 1972 to 1982.  Pp.  466 U. S. 106-108.

Syllabus 
During their examination of a damaged package, consisting of a cardboard box wrapped in brown paper, the employees of a private freight carrier observed a white powdery substance in the innermost of a series of four plastic bags that had been concealed in a tube inside the package.  The employees then notified the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), replaced the plastic bags in the tube, and put the tube back into the box.  When a DEA agent arrived, he removed the tube from the box and the plastic bags from the tube, saw the white powder, opened the bags, removed a trace of the powder, subjected it to a field chemical test, and determined it was cocaine.  Subsequently, a warrant was obtained to search the place to which the package was addressed, the warrant was executed, and respondents were arrested.  After respondents were indicted for possessing an illegal substance with intent to distribute, their motion to suppress the evidence on the ground that the warrant was the product of an illegal search and seizure was denied, and they were tried and convicted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the validity of the warrant depended on the validity of the warrantless test of the white powder, that the testing constituted a significant expansion of the earlier private search, and that a warrant was required.
Held:  The Fourth Amendment did not require the DEA agent to obtain a warrant before testing the white powder.  Pp.  466 U. S. 113-126.
(a) The fact that employees of the private carrier independently opened the package and made an examination that might have been impermissible for a Government agent cannot render unreasonable otherwise reasonable official conduct.  Whether those employees' invasions of respondents' package were accidental or deliberate or were reasonable or unreasonable, they, because of their private character, did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  The additional invasions of respondents' privacy by the DEA agent must be tested by the degree to which they exceeded the scope of the private search.  Pp.  466 U. S. 113-118.
(b) The DEA agent's removal of the plastic bags from the tube and his visual inspection of their contents enabled him to learn nothing that had not previously been learned during the private search.  It infringed no legitimate expectation of privacy, and hence was not a ""search"" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Although the agent's assertion of dominion and control over the package and its contents constituted a 
Page 466 U. S. 110
 ""seizure,"" the seizure was reasonable, since it was apparent that the tube and plastic bags contained contraband and little else.  In light of what the agent already knew about the contents of the package, it was as if the contents were in plain view.  It is constitutionally reasonable for law enforcement officials to seize ""effects"" that cannot support a justifiable expectation of privacy without a warrant based on probable cause to believe they contain contraband.  Pp.  466 U. S. 118-122.
(c) The DEA agent's field test, although exceeding the scope of the private search, was not an unlawful ""search"" or ""seizure"" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Governmental conduct that can reveal whether a substance is cocaine, and no other arguably ""private"" fact, compromises no legitimate privacy interest.  United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696.  The destruction of the white powder during the course of the field test was reasonable.  The law enforcement interests justifying the procedure were substantial, whereas, because only a trace amount of material was involved and the property had already been lawfully detained, the warrantless ""seizure"" could have only a de minimis impact on any protected property interest.  Under these circumstances, the safeguards of a warrant would only minimally advance Fourth Amendment interests.  Pp.  466 U. S. 122-125.

The employees then notified the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), replaced the plastic bags in the tube, and put the tube back into the box.  When a DEA agent arrived, he removed the tube from the box and the plastic bags from the tube, saw the white powder, opened the bags, removed a trace of the powder, subjected it to a field chemical test, and determined it was cocaine.  Subsequently, a warrant was obtained to search the place to which the package was addressed, the warrant was executed, and respondents were arrested.  After respondents were indicted for possessing an illegal substance with intent to distribute, their motion to suppress the evidence on the ground that the warrant was the product of an illegal search and seizure was denied, and they were tried and convicted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the validity of the warrant depended on the validity of the warrantless test of the white powder, that the testing constituted a significant expansion of the earlier private search, and that a warrant was required.
Held:  The Fourth Amendment did not require the DEA agent to obtain a warrant before testing the white powder.  Pp.  466 U. S. 113-126.
(a) The fact that employees of the private carrier independently opened the package and made an examination that might have been impermissible for a Government agent cannot render unreasonable otherwise reasonable official conduct.  Whether those employees' invasions of respondents' package were accidental or deliberate or were reasonable or unreasonable, they, because of their private character, did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  The additional invasions of respondents' privacy by the DEA agent must be tested by the degree to which they exceeded the scope of the private search.  Pp.  466 U. S. 113-118.
(b) The DEA agent's removal of the plastic bags from the tube and his visual inspection of their contents enabled him to learn nothing that had not previously been learned during the private search.  It infringed no legitimate expectation of privacy, and hence was not a ""search"" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Although the agent's assertion of dominion and control over the package and its contents constituted a 
Page 466 U. S. 110
 ""seizure,"" the seizure was reasonable, since it was apparent that the tube and plastic bags contained contraband and little else.  In light of what the agent already knew about the contents of the package, it was as if the contents were in plain view.  It is constitutionally reasonable for law enforcement officials to seize ""effects"" that cannot support a justifiable expectation of privacy without a warrant based on probable cause to believe they contain contraband.  Pp.  466 U. S. 118-122.
(c) The DEA agent's field test, although exceeding the scope of the private search, was not an unlawful ""search"" or ""seizure"" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Governmental conduct that can reveal whether a substance is cocaine, and no other arguably ""private"" fact, compromises no legitimate privacy interest.  United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696.  The destruction of the white powder during the course of the field test was reasonable.  The law enforcement interests justifying the procedure were substantial, whereas, because only a trace amount of material was involved and the property had already been lawfully detained, the warrantless ""seizure"" could have only a de minimis impact on any protected property interest.  Under these circumstances, the safeguards of a warrant would only minimally advance Fourth Amendment interests.  Pp.  466 U. S. 122-125.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 2, 1984
 In these cases probable jurisdiction is noted limited to Question 1 in the jurisdictional statements. The cases are consolidated and a total of one hour is allotted for oral argument. The judgment with respect to the other issues presented by the appeals is affirmed. 

 Justice STEVENS, concurring. 
 In his amended complaint in this case, appellee sought (1) a judgment holding two statutory provisions, Ala.Code 16-1-20.1, Ala.Code 16-1-20. 2, and certain allegedly State sanctioned, though not statutorily sanctioned, school prayer practices invalid under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment, and (2) an injunction against the enforcement of these statutory provisions and nonstatutory practices. The District Court dismissed the amended complaint. The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's judgment in relevant part. It held the challenged statutory provisions and nonstatutory practices unconstitutional and ordered the District Court to enter an injunction. Appellants 
Page 466 U.S. 924 , 925
 invoke this Court's appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254(2) regarding the Court of Appeals' judgments on the statutory provisions. 
 As I understand it, the order this Court enters today is a holding that Ala.Code 16-1-20.2 is invalid as repugnant to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, the Court's order also affirms the judgment of the Court of Appeals insofar as it directed the District Court to enjoin the appellants from enforcing Ala.Code 16-1-20.2. The judgment of the Court of Appeals concerning the nonstatutory school prayer practices is not within the appellate jurisdiction of this Court and is challenged in a petition for a writ of certiorari in No. 83-804. The Court denies that petition. 
 The Court's order noting probable jurisdiction is thus limited to the judgment of the Court of Appeals concerning the constitutionality of Ala. Code 16-1-20.1 (1982). Appellants frame the constitutional questions presented by that provision as follows: 
 ""Whether a state statute which permits, but does not require, teachers in public schools to observe up to a minute of non-activity for meditation or silent prayer has the predominant effect of advancing students' liberty of religion and of mind rather than any effect of establishing a religion."" Juris. Statement, No. 83-812 i. 
 ""Does a moment of silence for individual silent 'prayer or meditation' at the beginning of each school day in a public school classroom violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment as interpreted by its language, framers' intent, and history?"" Juris. Statement, No. 83-929 i. 
 On the understanding that the Court has limited argument to the question whether Ala.Code 16-1-20.1 is invalid as repugnant to the Establishment Clause, applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment, I join the Court's order.

 Alan J. KARCHER, Speaker, New Jersey Assembly, et al., appellants, v. George T. DAGGETT et al No. A-740 (83-1526) Supreme Court of the United States March 30, 1984
 The application for stay presented to JUSTICE BRENNAN and by him referred to the Court is denied. 

 Justice STEVENS, concurring. 
 In Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. ___ ( 1983), we held that the reapportionment plan which had been adopted by New Jersey after the 1980 census was unconstitutional. On remand, the parties, by stipulation, asked the three-judge District Court to select which of a number of proposed redistricting plans should be employed in place of the plan which had been adjudicated unconstitutional. The District Court rejected the ""Senate Plan,"" and selected the ""Forsythe Plan."" The District Court chose the Forsythe Plan because it achieved lower population deviations and more compact districts than the Senate Plan. Appellants claim that the District Court was obligated to accept the Senate Plan because it most closely conformed to the State's original plan while eliminating unconstitutional population variances. They have, accordingly, filed an application for a stay of the District Court's order, as well as an appeal. Since there is currently no apportionment plan in effect in New Jersey and elections are imminent, what appellants really seek is an injunction from this Court ordering use of the Senate Plan pending disposition of the appeal. Once a constitutional violation has been found, a District Court has broad discretion to fashion an appropriate remedy. E.g., Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 280-288, 2757-2761 ( 1977). I do not believe there is a sufficient likelihood that the District Court abused that discretion by selecting the Forsythe Plan to justify the relief appellants seek. Because the Forsythe Plan contained lower population variances, it more completely redressed the constitutional violation. Nor was it an abuse of discretion to consider the fact that the Forsythe Plan created more compact districts; our previous opinion acknowledged that this is a legitimate consideration in reapportionment. See 462 U.S., at ___. We also stated that efforts to inhibit gerrymandering are a legitimate part of the reapportionment process, see id., at ___, n. 6, n. 6; here the 
Page 466 U.S. 910 , 911
 District Court found that the plan advocated by appellants constituted ""an intentional gerrymander in favor of certain Democratic representatives."" App. to Juris. Statement 13a. While a District Court should not unnecessarily ignore state policies when fashioning a remedy, White v. Weiser, 412 U.S. 783, 795-797, 2354-2355 ( 1973), there the District Court rejected a plan implementing ""decisions [ ] made by the legislature in pursuit of what were deemed important state interests,"" id., at 796, and did not explain why the plan it had rejected was ""unconstitutional or even undesirable."" Id., at 797. Here the District Court identified legitimate considerations justifying its choice, and appellants have identified no state policy to which the District Court should have deferred that justifies the bizarre district lines in the original reapportionment plan. See 462 U.S., at ___ and n. 12, n. 12. 
 Accordingly, I concur in the Court's decision to deny the application for stay. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice WHITE and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Before the Court is an application seeking to stay an order of a three-judge District Court pending final disposition of an appeal to this Court under 28 U.S.C. 1253. The challenged order directs the State of New Jersey to conduct upcoming elections for Members of the House of Representatives pursuant to a reapportionment plan adopted by the District Court as a remedy for the constitutional violation found in New Jersey's 1982 reapportionment plan. See Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. ___, 103 S. Ct. 2653 (1983), aff'g 535 F.Supp. 978 (D.C.N.J.1982). Because I believe that the District Court has acted beyond the scope of its authority in correcting the relevant constitutional violation, I would grant the application for stay and remand the case to the District Court for implementation of an alternative plan. I therefore dissent.

 Following the 1980 decennial census, the State of New Jersey was required to decrease its membership in the United States House of Representatives from 15 to 14.

No. 82-1031
Argued November 2, 1983
Decided March 27, 1984
466 U.S. 2

Syllabus 
A hospital governed by petitioners has a contract with a firm of anesthesiologists requiring all anesthesiological services for the hospital's patients to be performed by that firm.  Because of this contract, respondent anesthesiologist's application for admission to the hospital's medical staff was denied.  Respondent then commenced an action in Federal District Court, claiming that the exclusive contract violated  1 of the Sherman Act, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court denied relief, finding that the anticompetitive consequences of the contract were minimal, and outweighed by benefits in the form of improved patient care.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding the contract illegal ""per se.""  The court held that the case involved a ""tying arrangement"" because the users of the hospital's operating rooms (the tying product) were compelled to purchase the hospital's chosen anesthesiological services (the tied product), that the hospital possessed sufficient market power in the tying market to coerce purchasers of the tied product, and that, since the purchase of the tied product constituted a ""not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce,"" the tying arrangement was therefore illegal ""per se.""
Held:  The exclusive contract in question does not violate  1 of the Sherman Act.   466 U. S.  9-32.
(a) Any inquiry into the validity of a tying arrangement must focus on the market or markets in which the two products are sold, for that is where the anticompetitive forcing has its impact.  Thus, in this case, the analysis of the tying issue must focus on the hospital's sale of services to its patients, rather than its contractual arrangements with the providers of anesthesiological services.  In making that analysis, consideration must be given to whether petitioners are selling two separate products that may be tied together, and, if so, whether they have used their market power to force their patients to accept the tying arrangement.  Pp.  466 U. S. 9-18.
(b) No tying arrangement can exist here unless there is a sufficient demand for the purchase of anesthesiological services separate from hospital services to identify a distinct product market in which it is efficient to offer anesthesiological services separately from hospital services.  The 
Page 466 U. S. 3
 fact that the exclusive contract requires purchase of two services that would otherwise be purchased separately does not make the contract illegal.  Only if patients are forced to purchase the contracting firm's services as a result of the hospital's market power would the arrangement have anticompetitive consequences.  If no forcing is present, patients are free to enter a competing hospital and to use another anesthesiologist instead of the firm.   466 U. S.  18-25.
(c) The record does not provide a basis for applying the per se rule against tying to the arrangement in question.  While such factors as the Court of Appeals relied on in rendering its decision -- the prevalence of health insurance as eliminating a patient's incentive to compare costs, and patients' lack of sufficient information to compare the quality of the medical care provided by competing hospitals -- may generate ""market power"" in some abstract sense, they do not generate the kind of market power that justifies condemnation of tying.  Tying arrangements need only be condemned if they restrain competition on the merits by forcing purchases that would not otherwise be made.  The fact that patients of the hospital lack price consciousness will not force them to take an anesthesiologist whose services they do not want.  Similarly, if the patients cannot evaluate the quality of anesthesiological services, it follows that they are indifferent between certified anesthesiologists even in the absence of a tying arrangement.  Pp.  466 U. S. 26-29.
(d) In order to prevail in the absence of per se liability, respondent has the burden of showing that the challenged contract violated the Sherman Act because it unreasonably restrained competition, and no such showing has been made.  The evidence is insufficient to provide a basis for finding that the contract, as it actually operates in the market, has unreasonably restrained competition.  All the record establishes is that the choice of anesthesiologists at the hospital has been limited to one of the four doctors who are associated with the contracting firm.  If respondent were admitted to the hospital's staff, the range of choice would be enlarged, but the most significant restraints on the patient's freedom to select a specific anesthesiologist would nevertheless remain.  There is no evidence that the price, quality, or supply or demand for either the ""tying product"" or the ""tied product"" has been adversely affected by the exclusive contract, and no showing that the market as a whole has been affected at all by the contract.  Pp.  466 U. S. 29-32.

All the record establishes is that the choice of anesthesiologists at the hospital has been limited to one of the four doctors who are associated with the contracting firm.  If respondent were admitted to the hospital's staff, the range of choice would be enlarged, but the most significant restraints on the patient's freedom to select a specific anesthesiologist would nevertheless remain.  There is no evidence that the price, quality, or supply or demand for either the ""tying product"" or the ""tied product"" has been adversely affected by the exclusive contract, and no showing that the market as a whole has been affected at all by the contract.

Syllabus 
Appellee black voters of Escambia County, Fla., filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the at-large system for electing County Commissioners, by diluting appellees' voting strength, violated various federal constitutional and statutory provisions.  The court entered judgment for appellees, holding that the election system violated, inter alia, the Fourteenth Amendment and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that the election system violated the Fourteenth Amendment, but did not review the District Court's conclusion as to the violation of the Voting Rights Act.  This appeal presented the question whether the evidence of discriminatory intent in the record was adequate to support the District Court's finding that the at-large system violated the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:  Normally, this Court will not decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of the case.  The parties have not briefed the question whether the Voting Rights Act provided grounds for affirmance of the District Court's judgment, and, in any event, the question should be decided in the first instance by the Court of Appeals.  Therefore, the proper course is to vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment and remand the case to that court for consideration of the statutory question.

465 U.S. 805

Syllabus 
Respondent certified public accountant firm, as the independent auditor for respondent corporation, was responsible for reviewing the corporation's financial statements as required by the federal securities laws.  In the course of reviewing these statements, the accounting firm verified the corporation's statement of its contingent tax liabilities, and, in so doing, prepared tax accrual workpapers relating to the evaluation of the corporation's reserves for such liabilities.  When a routine audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine the corporation's income tax liability for certain years revealed that the corporation had made questionable payments from a ""special disbursement account,"" the IRS instituted a criminal investigation of the corporation's tax returns.  In that process, the IRS, pursuant to  7602 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 -- which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to summon and ""examine any books, papers, records, or other data which may be relevant or material"" to a particular tax inquiry -- issued a summons to the accounting firm requiring it to make available to the IRS all of its files relating to the corporation, including its tax accrual workpapers.  When the corporation instructed the accounting firm not to comply with the summons, the IRS commenced an enforcement action in Federal District Court, which, upon finding that the tax accrual workpapers were relevant to the IRS investigation within the meaning of  7602 and refusing to recognize an accountant-client privilege that would protect the workpapers, ordered the summons enforced.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.  While agreeing that the workpapers were relevant to the IRS investigation, the court held that the public interest in promoting full disclosure to public accountants, and in turn ensuring the integrity of the securities markets, required protection under a work-product immunity doctrine for the work that independent auditors perform for publicly owned corporations.  Accordingly, because it found that the IRS had not made a sufficient showing of need to overcome the immunity and was not seeking to prove fraud on the corporation's part, the court refused to enforce the summons insofar as it sought the tax accrual workpapers.
Held:
1. The tax accrual workpapers are relevant within the meaning of  7602.  As  7602's language indicates, an IRS summons is not to be 
Page 465 U. S. 806
 judged by the relevance standards used in deciding whether to admit evidence in court.  The language ""may be"" reflects Congress' intention to allow the IRS to obtain items of even potential relevance to the ongoing investigation, without reference to its admissibility.  As a discovery tool, a  7602 summons is critical to the IRS's investigative and enforcement functions.  That the tax accrual workpapers are not actually used in the preparation of tax returns by the taxpayer or its accountants does not bar a finding of relevance within the meaning of  7602.  Pp.  465 U. S. 813-815.
2. The tax accrual workpapers are not protected from disclosure under  7602.  Pp.  465 U. S. 815-821.
(a) While  7602 is subject to traditional privileges and limitations, any other restrictions upon the IRS summons power should be avoided ""absent unambiguous directions from Congress.""  United States v. Bisceglia, 420 U. S. 141,  420 U. S. 150.  There are no such unambiguous directions that would justify a judicially created work-product immunity doctrine for tax accrual workpapers summoned under  7602.  Indeed,  7602 reflects a congressional policy favoring disclosure of all information relevant to a legitimate IRS inquiry.  Pp.  465 U. S. 815-817.
(b) In light of Couch v. United States, 409 U. S. 322, which held that no confidential accountant-client privilege exists, the Court of Appeals' creation of a work-product privilege was misplaced, and conflicts with Congress' clear intent.  P.  465 U. S. 817.
(c) Nor is a work-product immunity for accountants' tax accrual workpapers a fitting analogue to the attorney work-product doctrine.  An independent certified public accountant performs a different role from an attorney, whose duty, as his client's confidential adviser and advocate, is to present the client's case in the most favorable possible light.  In certifying the public reports that depict a corporation's financial status, the accountant performs a public responsibility transcending any employment relationship with the client, and owes allegiance to the corporation's creditors and stockholders, as well as to the investing public.

No. 82-960

Syllabus 
Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act provides that employees shall have the right to join or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively, and ""to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.""  The collective bargaining agreement between respondent and the union representing its truckdrivers provides that respondent shall not require employees to operate any vehicle that is not in safe operating condition, and that ""[i]t shall not be a violation of this Agreement where employees refuse to operate such equipment unless such refusal is unjustified.""  One of respondent's employees (James Brown) was discharged when he refused to drive a truck that he honestly and reasonably believed to be unsafe because of faulty brakes.  After the union declined to process Brown's grievance under the bargaining agreement, he filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), challenging his discharge.  An Administrative Law Judge concluded that, even though Brown acted alone in asserting a contractual right, his refusal to operate the truck constituted ""concerted activit[y]"" protected by  7, and that respondent had therefore committed an unfair labor practice in discharging him.  The NLRB adopted the Administrative Law Judge's findings and conclusions and ordered Brown's reinstatement with backpay, applying its longstanding ""Interboro doctrine,"" which was based on the conclusions that an individual's reasonable and honest assertion of a right contained in a collective bargaining agreement is an extension of the concerted action that produced the agreement, and that the assertion of such a right affects the rights of all employees covered by the agreement.  However, the Court of Appeals denied enforcement of the NLRB's order, finding that Brown's refusal to drive the truck was an action taken solely on his own behalf, and thus was not a concerted activity within  7's meaning.
Held:
1. The NLRB's Interboro doctrine is a reasonable interpretation of the Act.  Pp.  465 U. S. 829-839.
(a) The language of  7 does not confine itself to situations where two or more employees are working together at the same time and the 
Page 465 U. S. 823
 same place toward a common goal, or to situations where a lone employee intends to induce group activity or acts as a representative of at least one other employee.  The invocation of a right rooted in a collective bargaining agreement is unquestionably an integral part of the process that gave rise to the agreement.  The Interboro doctrine is entirely consistent with the Act's purposes, which include the encouragement of collective bargaining and other practices fundamental to the friendly adjustment of industrial disputes arising out of differences as to wages, hours, or other working conditions.  Moreover,  7's general history reveals no inconsistency between the Interboro doctrine and congressional intent to equalize the bargaining power of management and labor.  As long as the employee's statement or action is based on a reasonable and honest belief that he is being, or has been, asked to perform a task that he is not required to perform under his collective bargaining agreement, and the statement or action is reasonably directed toward the enforcement of a collectively bargained right, there is no justification for overturning the NLRB's judgment that the employee is engaged in concerted activity.  Pp.  465 U. S. 830-837.
(b) The fact that an activity is concerted does not necessarily mean that an employee may engage in the activity with impunity.  If an employee engages in concerted activity in a manner that is overly abusive or violative of his collective bargaining agreement, his actions would be unprotected.  P.  465 U. S. 837.
(c) There is no merit to the argument that the Interboro doctrine undermines the arbitration process by providing employees with the possibility of provoking a discharge and then filing an unfair labor practice claim.  An employee who purposefully follows this route would run the risk that the NLRB would find his actions concerted but nonetheless unprotected.  More importantly, to the extent that the factual issues raised in an unfair labor practice action have been, or can be, addressed through the grievance process, the NLRB may defer to that process.  Pp.  465 U. S. 837-839.
2. The NLRB reasonably concluded that Brown's honest and reasonable assertion of his right to be free of the obligation to drive unsafe trucks, even though he did not explicitly refer to the collective bargaining agreement when he refused to drive the truck, constituted concerted activity within the meaning of  7.  As long as the nature of the employee's complaint is reasonably clear to the person to whom it is communicated, and the complaint in fact refers to a reasonably perceived violation of the collective bargaining agreement, the complaining employee is engaged in the process of enforcing that agreement.  Respondent's argument that the NLRB erred in finding Brown's action concerted based only on Brown's reasonable and honest belief that the truck was 
Page 465 U. S. 824
 unsafe, because the bargaining agreement required that the truck be objectively unsafe, confuses the threshold question whether Brown's conduct was concerted with the ultimate question whether that conduct was protected.  The latter question should be considered on remand.  Pp.  465 U. S. 839-841.

Syllabus 
Petitioner's art collection was seized by customs officials when he was suspected of smuggling the collection into the country.  Subsequently, petitioner was acquitted of the smuggling charge, and the objects of art were returned to him upon his petition for relief from civil forfeiture.  He then filed an administrative complaint seeking compensation for alleged damage to the property occurring while it was in the Customs Service's custody.  When the Service denied relief, petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), seeking damages for the alleged injury to his property.  The District Court granted the Government's motion for dismissal of the complaint or summary judgment on the ground that the claim was barred by 28 U.S.C.  2680(c), which exempts from the coverage of the FTCA ""[a]ny claims arising in respect of . . . the detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of customs.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 2680(c) precludes recovery against the United States for the alleged injury to petitioner's property.  Pp.  465 U. S. 851-861.
(a) The fairest interpretation of  2680(c)'s language ""arising in respect of "" is that such language means any claim ""arising out of"" the detention of goods, including a claim resulting from negligent handling or storage of the detained property, and is not limited to claims for damage caused by the detention itself.  That  2680(b) expressly bars actions ""arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission"" of mail does not undercut this reading of  2680(c)'s language, but merely suggests that Congress intended  2680(b) to be less encompassing than  2680(c).  Pp.  465 U. S. 851-855.
(b) The legislative history of  2680(c) supports the above interpretation.  Moreover, the interpretation accords with Congress' general purposes, in creating exceptions to the FTCA, of ensuring that ""certain governmental activities"" not be disrupted by the threat of damages suits, of avoiding exposure of the United States to liability for excessive or fraudulent claims, and of not extending coverage of the Act to suits for which adequate remedies were already available.

			"|"Kosak v. United States
No. 82-618
Argued November 7, 1983
Decided March 21, 1984
465 U.S. 848

Syllabus 
Petitioner's art collection was seized by customs officials when he was suspected of smuggling the collection into the country.  Subsequently, petitioner was acquitted of the smuggling charge, and the objects of art were returned to him upon his petition for relief from civil forfeiture.  He then filed an administrative complaint seeking compensation for alleged damage to the property occurring while it was in the Customs Service's custody.  When the Service denied relief, petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), seeking damages for the alleged injury to his property.  The District Court granted the Government's motion for dismissal of the complaint or summary judgment on the ground that the claim was barred by 28 U.S.C.  2680(c), which exempts from the coverage of the FTCA ""[a]ny claims arising in respect of . . . the detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of customs.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 2680(c) precludes recovery against the United States for the alleged injury to petitioner's property.  Pp.  465 U. S. 851-861.
(a) The fairest interpretation of  2680(c)'s language ""arising in respect of "" is that such language means any claim ""arising out of"" the detention of goods, including a claim resulting from negligent handling or storage of the detained property, and is not limited to claims for damage caused by the detention itself.  That  2680(b) expressly bars actions ""arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission"" of mail does not undercut this reading of  2680(c)'s language, but merely suggests that Congress intended  2680(b) to be less encompassing than  2680(c).  Pp.  465 U. S. 851-855.
(b) The legislative history of  2680(c) supports the above interpretation.  Moreover, the interpretation accords with Congress' general purposes, in creating exceptions to the FTCA, of ensuring that ""certain governmental activities"" not be disrupted by the threat of damages suits, of avoiding exposure of the United States to liability for excessive or fraudulent claims, and of not extending coverage of the Act to suits for which adequate remedies were already available.  Pp.  465 U. S. 855-861.
679 F.2d 306, affirmed.

465 U.S. 870

Syllabus 
Title 28 U.S.C.  1291 grants federal courts of appeals jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions of district courts, ""except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.""  Title 28 U.S.C.  1252 provides in its first paragraph for such a direct appeal from a district court judgment holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional in any civil action to which the United States or any of its agencies, or an officer or employee thereof, is a party.  Section 1252 further provides in its second paragraph that a party who has received notice of an appeal under the section shall take any subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court, and that all appeals taken to other courts prior to such notice shall be treated as taken directly to the Supreme Court.  Respondent filed a class action in Federal District Court against petitioner Secretary of Health and Human Services, challenging the constitutionality of  211(a)(5)(A) of the Social Security Act, which provides that all gross income and deductions derived from a family business in community property States shall be attributed to the husband unless the wife can establish that she exercised substantially all of the management and control of the business, in which case all income would be treated as the wife's.  Although petitioner conceded the unconstitutionality of  211(a)(5)(A)'s gender-based presumption, the District Court nevertheless rejected petitioner's claim of mootness, held the statute unconstitutional, and granted respondent's motion for summary judgment.  The court then found the respondent class entitled retroactively to an allocation of co-proprietor income between the spouses' earnings accounts on the basis of labor contributed by each.  Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals, challenging only the District Court's remedy.  The Court of Appeals granted respondent's motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under  1291, because direct review could be had in this Court pursuant to  1252.
Held:  A party does not have a right to direct review in this Court under  1252 unless the district court's holding of federal statutory unconstitutionality is in issue, and hence here the Court of Appeals improperly dismissed petitioner's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, since only the District Court's remedy was challenged.  Pp.  465 U. S. 876-885.
(a) While a literal reading of  1252 would seem to give a party a right to a direct appeal to this Court under the circumstances of this case, the 
Page 465 U. S. 871
 natural sense of  1252 is that the holding of statutory unconstitutionality, not other issues such as attorney's fees, remedy, or related state law claims, is what Congress wished this Court to review in the first instance.  Pp.  465 U. S. 877-879.
(b) Section 1252's structure supports this view.  The conclusion inherent in that structure is that not all appeals in a case in which an Act of Congress has been held unconstitutional must be taken directly to this Court, the necessary corollary to the second paragraph of  1252 being that, in the absence of a notice of appeal under  1252, other appeals in the case will follow the normal route for appellate review.  Because direct review is linked to a court's holding a federal statute unconstitutional, the logical test of which appeals from a judgment must be brought directly to this Court and which, standing alone, must follow the normal route of appellate review, is whether the issue on appeal is the holding of statutory unconstitutionality.  Pp.  465 U. S. 879-880.
(c) The legislative history also supports the view that Congress considered the jurisdictional predicate for mandatory review by this Court to be appeal from the constitutional holding.  Congress' concerns in enacting  1252's predecessor about the separation of powers and the need for certainty and uniformity in the administration of federal law are not implicated in cases in which the Government concedes statutory unconstitutionality by its decision not to appeal that aspect of the district court's judgment.  The only justification for exerting this Court's mandatory jurisdiction in a case such as this might be the considerable ramifications of district court orders, but serious consequences alone cannot support the exercise of such jurisdiction.  Although remedial aspects of a case are important, the touchstone of direct appeal under  1252 is not a party's or this Court's own judgment of the significance of a decision.  In  1252, Congress mandated direct review not simply for decisions with impact, but rather for decisions whose impact was predicated upon a potentially incorrect exercise of judicial review.  A construction of  1252 that would require this Court to review collateral issues as independent matters, rather than as pendent to the holding of statutory unconstitutionality, would undermine the effectiveness of the direct appeal provision.  Pp.  465 U. S. 880-885.
Vacated and remanded.
MARSHALL, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

465 U.S. 886

Syllabus 
Respondent -- who was represented by attorneys from the Legal Aid Society of New York, a private nonprofit law office -- filed a civil rights action in Federal District Court on behalf of a statewide class of Medicaid recipients.  The complaint challenged certain procedures utilized for termination of Medicaid benefits.  The District Court certified the class and entered summary judgment for it.  After the Court of Appeals affirmed, respondent filed in the District Court a request for an award of attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, which provides that, in federal civil rights actions
""the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.""
The total requested fee amounted to $118,968, consisting of $79,312 based on some 809 hours of work at rates varying from $95 to $105 per hour, plus a 50% ""bonus"" of $39,656 to compensate for the complexity of the case, the novelty of the issues, and the ""great benefit"" achieved.  The District Court awarded the full amount requested, holding that the hours expended and the rates charged, in view of prevailing market rates, were reasonable, and that the 50% bonus was proper because of the quality of representation, the complexity of the issues, the riskiness of success, and the ""great benefit to the large class"" that was achieved.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The statute and its legislative history establish that ""reasonable fees"" are to be calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community, not according to the cost of providing legal services, regardless of whether the prevailing party is represented by private profitmaking attorneys or nonprofit legal aid organizations.  Policy arguments in favor of a cost-based standard should be addressed to Congress, rather than to this Court.  Pp.  465 U. S. 892-896.
2. The District Court abused its discretion in awarding the 50% upward adjustment in the fee in this case.  Pp.  465 U. S. 896-902.
(a) There is no merit to the argument that an ""upward adjustment"" of a reasonable fee -- calculated by multiplying the reasonable number of hours expended times a reasonable hourly fee -- is never permissible.  The statute and its legislative history establish that the ""product of reasonable 
Page 465 U. S. 887
 hours times a reasonable rate"" normally provides a ""reasonable"" attorney's fee, but ""in some cases of exceptional success, an enhanced award may be justified.""  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424,  461 U. S. 435.  Pp.  465 U. S. 896-897.
(b) However, respondent failed to carry her burden of proving that an upward adjustment was necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee in this case.  The record contains no evidence supporting the District Court's conclusions that the upward adjustment was proper because of the complexity of the litigation, the novelty of the issues, the high quality of representation, and the ""great benefit"" to the class.  These factors generally are reflected in the reasonableness of the number of billable hours or the hourly rates.  Moreover, the record does not justify the District Court's upward adjustment on the basis of the ""riskiness"" of the law suit.  Respondent established only that the hourly rates and the hours billed were reasonable.  Pp.  465 U. S. 898-902.

Syllabus 
From 1957 to 1968, respondent, a wholesale distributor of agricultural chemicals that engaged in a discount operation, sold agricultural herbicides manufactured by petitioner.  In 1968, petitioner refused to renew respondent's 1-year distributorship term, and thereafter respondent was unable to purchase from other distributors as much of petitioner's products as it desired or as early in the season as it needed them.  Respondent ultimately brought suit in Federal District Court under  1 of the Sherman Act, alleging that petitioner and some of its distributors conspired to fix the resale prices of petitioner's products and that petitioner had terminated respondent's distributorship in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Petitioner denied the allegations of conspiracy, and asserted that respondent's distributorship had been terminated because of its failure to hire trained salesmen and promote sales to dealers adequately.  The District Court instructed the jury that petitioner's conduct was per se unlawful if it was in furtherance of a price-fixing conspiracy.  In answers to special interrogatories, the jury found, inter alia, that the termination of respondent's distributorship was pursuant to a price-fixing conspiracy between petitioner and one or more of its distributors.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that there was sufficient evidence to satisfy respondent's burden of proving a conspiracy to set resale prices.  It noted evidence of numerous complaints to petitioner from competing distributors about respondent's price-cutting practices.  In substance, the court held that an antitrust plaintiff can survive a motion for a directed verdict if it shows that a manufacturer terminated a price-cutting distributor in response to or following complaints by other distributors.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals applied an incorrect standard of proof to the evidence in this case.  A basic distinction in any distributor termination case is that between concerted action of the manufacturer and other distributors, which is proscribed by the Sherman Act, and independent action of the manufacturer, which is not proscribed.  United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U. S. 300.  A second important distinction in such cases is that between concerted action to set prices, which is per se illegal, and concerted action on nonprice restrictions, which is judged under 
Page 465 U. S. 753
 the rule of reason.  See Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36.  Permitting a price-fixing agreement to be inferred from the existence of complaints from other distributors, or even from the fact that termination came about ""in response to"" complaints, could deter or penalize perfectly legitimate conduct.  Thus, something more than evidence of complaints is needed.  The correct standard is that there must be evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the manufacturer and nonterminated distributors were acting independently.  That is, there must be direct or circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove that the manufacturer and others had a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective.  Pp.  465 U. S. 760-764.
2. Under the proper standard of proof, the evidence in this case created a jury issue as to whether respondent was terminated pursuant to a price-fixing conspiracy between petitioner and its distributors.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals' judgment is affirmed.  Pp.  465 U. S. 765-768.
(a) There was sufficient evidence for the jury reasonably to have concluded that petitioner and some of its distributors were parties to an ""agreement"" or ""conspiracy"" to maintain resale prices and terminate price-cutters.  Pp.  465 U. S. 765-766.
(b) It also would be reasonable to find that respondent's termination was part of or pursuant to that agreement, since it is necessary for competing distributors contemplating compliance with suggested prices to know that those who do not comply will be terminated.  Moreover, there is some circumstantial evidence of such a link.  Pp.  465 U. S. 767-768.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a resident of New York, brought a libel suit against respondent magazine publisher (hereafter respondent), an Ohio corporation, in Federal District Court in New Hampshire, alleging jurisdiction by reason of diversity of citizenship.  Petitioner's only connection with New Hampshire is the circulation there of a magazine that she assists in producing.  Respondent's contacts with New Hampshire consist of monthly sales of some 10,000 to 15,000 copies of its nationally published magazine.  The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbade application of New Hampshire's long-arm statute in order to acquire personal jurisdiction over respondent.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that petitioner's lack of contact with New Hampshire rendered that State's interest in redressing the tort of libel to petitioner too attenuated for an assertion of personal jurisdiction over respondent, and that, in view of the ""single publication rule,"" which would require an award of damages caused in all States, as well as New Hampshire's unusually long (6-year) limitation period for libel actions, it would be ""unfair"" to assert jurisdiction over respondent.
Held:  Respondent's regular circulation of magazines in the forum State is sufficient to support an assertion of jurisdiction in a libel action based on the contents of the magazine.  Pp.  465 U. S. 773-781.
(a) New Hampshire jurisdiction over a complaint based on this circulation of magazines satisfies the Due Process Clause's requirement that a State's assertion of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant be predicated on ""minimum contacts"" between the defendant and the State.  Pp.  465 U. S. 774-775.
(b) In judging minimum contacts, a court properly focuses on ""the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.""  Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186,  433 U. S. 204.  Thus, it is relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry here that petitioner is seeking to recover damages suffered in all States in one suit.  The contacts between respondent and the forum must be judged in light of that claim, rather than a claim only for damages sustained in New Hampshire.  P.  465 U. S. 775.
(c) The combination of New Hampshire's interest in redressing injuries that occur within the State and its interest in cooperating with other States in applying the ""single publication rule"" demonstrates the propriety 
Page 465 U. S. 771
 of requiring respondent to answer a multistate libel action in New Hampshire.  Pp.  465 U. S. 775-778.
(d) Any potential unfairness in applying New Hampshire's statute of limitations to all aspects of this nationwide suit has nothing to do with jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim.  And the chance duration of statutes of limitations of nonforum States has nothing to do with the contacts among respondent, New Hampshire, and the suit.  Pp.  465 U. S. 778-779.
(e) The fact that petitioner has very limited contacts with New Hampshire does not defeat jurisdiction, since a plaintiff is not required to have ""minimum contacts"" with the forum State before that State is permitted to assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant.  A plaintiff's residence in the forum State is not a separate jurisdictional requirement, and lack of residence will not defeat jurisdiction established on the basis of the defendant's contacts.  The victim of a libel, like the victim of any other tort, may choose to bring suit in any forum with which the defendant has
""certain minimum contacts . . . such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'""
International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310,  326 U. S. 316.  Pp.  465 U. S. 779-781.
(f) Here, where respondent has continuously and deliberately exploited the New Hampshire market, it must reasonably anticipate being haled into court there in a libel action based on the contents of its magazine.  And, since respondent can be charged with knowledge of the ""single publication rule,"" it must anticipate that such a suit will seek nationwide damages.  There is no unfairness in calling respondent to answer for the contents of its national publication wherever a substantial number of copies are regularly sold and distributed.  P.  465 U. S. 781.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a resident of New York, brought a libel suit against respondent magazine publisher (hereafter respondent), an Ohio corporation, in Federal District Court in New Hampshire, alleging jurisdiction by reason of diversity of citizenship.  Petitioner's only connection with New Hampshire is the circulation there of a magazine that she assists in producing.  Respondent's contacts with New Hampshire consist of monthly sales of some 10,000 to 15,000 copies of its nationally published magazine.  The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbade application of New Hampshire's long-arm statute in order to acquire personal jurisdiction over respondent.

Syllabus 
Respondent, a professional entertainer who lives and works in California and whose television career was centered there, brought suit in California Superior Court, claiming that she had been libeled in an article written and edited by petitioners in Florida and published in the National Enquirer, a national magazine having its largest circulation in California.  Petitioners, both residents of Florida, were served with process by mail in Florida, and, on special appearances, moved to quash the service of process for lack of personal jurisdiction.  The Superior Court granted the motion on the ground that First Amendment concerns weighed against an assertion of jurisdiction otherwise proper under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The California Court of Appeal reversed, holding that a valid basis for jurisdiction existed on the theory that petitioners intended to, and did, cause tortious injury to respondent in California.
Held:
1. Jurisdiction by appeal does not lie in this Court, but under 28 U.S.C.  2103 the jurisdictional statement will be treated as a petition for certiorari, which is hereby granted.  Pp.  465 U. S. 787-788.
2. Jurisdiction over petitioners in California is proper because of their intentional conduct in Florida allegedly calculated to cause injury to respondent in California.  Pp.  465 U. S. 788-791.
(a) The Due Process Clause permits personal jurisdiction over a defendant in any State with which the defendant has

(b) Here, California is the focal point both of the allegedly libelous article and of the harm suffered.  Jurisdiction over petitioners is therefore proper in California based on the ""effects"" of their Florida conduct in California.  Pp.  465 U. S. 788-789.
(c) Petitioners are not charged with mere untargeted negligence, but rather, their intentional, and allegedly tortious, actions were expressly aimed at California.  They wrote and edited an article that they

 knew would have a potentially devastating impact upon respondent, and they knew that the brunt of that injury would be felt by respondent in the State in which she lives and works and in which the magazine has its largest circulation.

Syllabus 
When the engine of an Air Force aircraft failed in flight, the pilot was severely injured when he ejected from the plane.  After Air Force collateral and safety investigations of the incident had been completed, the pilot filed a damages action against respondents as the entities responsible for the design and manufacture of the plane's ejection equipment.  Respondents sought pretrial discovery of documents containing confidential unsworn statements made during the safety investigation by the pilot and the airman who had rigged and maintained the pilot's parachute equipment.  But such discovery was prevented by Machin v. Zukert, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 335, 316 F.2d 336, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 896, which held that confidential statements made to air crash safety investigators are privileged with respect to pretrial discovery.  Respondents then filed requests for the statements under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and, when the Air Force refused production, commenced an action in Federal District Court, which held that the statements were protected from disclosure by Exemption 5 of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure
""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.""
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although the requested documents were ""intra-agency memorandums"" within the meaning of Exemption 5 and were protected from civil discovery under the Machin privilege, the statutory phrase ""would not be available by law"" did not encompass every civil discovery privilege, but rather reached only those privileges explicitly recognized in the FOIA's legislative history, which the court read as not extending to the Machin privilege.
Held:  The statements in question are protected from disclosure by Exemption 5.  The Exemption's plain language, as construed by this Court's prior decisions, is sufficient to resolve the question presented.  The statements are unquestionably ""intra-agency memorandums or letters"" within the meaning of the Exemption, and, since the Machin privilege normally protects them from civil discovery, they ""would not be available by law to a party other than [the Air Force] in litigation with [the Air Force].""  Exemption 5's scope is not limited to privileges 
Page 465 U. S. 793
 explicitly identified by Congress in the FOIA's legislative history.  To hold that material that is normally privileged can be obtained through the FOIA would create an anomaly in that the FOIA could be used to supplement civil discovery.  And Exemption 5's legislative history does not contain the kind of compelling evidence of congressional intent that would necessitate looking beyond the plain statutory language, but rather indicates that Congress intended to incorporate governmental privileges analogous to the Machin privilege.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 19, 1984
 The appeals are dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 

 Justice STEVENS, concurring. 
 The New Mexico Discrimination in Selling Act, enacted in 1967, N.M. Stat.Ann. 60-12-1 through 60-12-10, limited the price which a producer of ""alcoholic liquor"" (defined to exclude malt beverages such as beer) could charge New Mexico liquor wholesalers to the lowest price it charged wholesalers in any other state during the preceding month. In 1979, the New Mexico legislature amended the statute, commonly referred to as a price affirmation law, to extend its coverage to malt beverages. 1979 N.M. Laws, ch. 83. [ U.S. Brewers Ass'n Inc. v. Rodriguez 465 U.S. 1093 (1984) ][1093-Continued.] 
 The appellants, producers of malt beverages, filed this action in the New Mexico District Court of Santa Fe County for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the validity of the 1979 amendment on state and federal constitutional grounds. Specifically, appellants argued that the amended Act constituted a burden on commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause and conflicted with federal antitrust laws in violation of the Supremacy Clause. In 1980, the district court entered summary judgment for appellee, upholding the constitutionality of the 1979 amendment. The New Mexico Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the district court and remanded for further proceedings, rejecting appellants' federal constitutional claims that the amended statute was invalid on its face. The court relied on this Court's decisions in Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter, 384 U.S. 35 (1966) and Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654 (1982). 
 In 1981, while the appeal to the New Mexico Supreme Court was pending, the New Mexico Legislature repealed the 1967 Act, as amended, and enacted a new price affirmation law. N.M. 
Page 465 U.S. 1093 , 1094
 Stat.Ann. 60-8A-12 through 60-8A-15 (1981 Replacement Pamplet). While in most respects the 1981 Act is a recodification of the previous statute, it differs from the prior law in one respect which appellant in 83-911 argues is significant for purposes of constitutional analysis. The 1981 Act does not limit wholesale prices to the lowest price charged in other states in the preceding month, but instead employs a different time period as the reference point. 
 The New Mexico Supreme Court expressly noted that the 1967 Act had been repealed and replaced by the 1981 Act. Jurisdictional Statement, No. 83-911, 2b, n. 1. It did not pass on the validity of the 1981 Act, however, and limited its consideration to the 1967 Act as amended in 1979. Indeed, it does not appear that appellants ever specifically requested the court to construe the 1981 Act or to rule on its validity. 
 Appellant in No. 83-911 asks us to vacate the judgment below and to remand the case to the New Mexico Supreme Court ""for clarification of the implications for this case of the 1981 amendments"" and for further consideration in light of this Court's decision in Healy v. United States Brewers Ass'n, ___ U.S. ___ (1983) ( summarily aff'g 692 F.2d 275 (CA2 1982)). Jurisdictional Statement 11. Appellant in No. 83-927, on the other hand, maintains that since the New Mexico Supreme Court did not rule on the effect or validity of the 1981 statute, no question concerning the 1981 statute is involved in this appeal. Appellant in No. 83-927 also demonstrates that the question of the validity of the 1967 Act as amended in 1979 is not moot. 
 Our recent decision in Healy, invalidating a Connecticut price affirmation statute, does not undermine the New Mexico Supreme Court's reliance on Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter and Rice v. Norman Williams Co. in upholding the constitutionality of the 1967 New Mexico Act as amended in 1979. Moreover, it seems quite plain that the New Mexico Supreme did not pass on the validity of the 1981 Act. Thus, we have no occasion to consider whatever relevance Healy might have to a constitutional challenge of the 1981 Act in these appeals. Nor do we have any power to order the state court to pass on a question that was apparently not properly presented to it when it entered the judgment we are now being asked to review. I therefore concur in dismissing these appeals from the judgment upholding the 1967 Act as amended in 1979 for want of a substantial federal question without reaching any issue which might exist concerning the 1981 Act. 
 Justice POWELL took no part in the consideration or decision of these appeals.

The 1981 Act does not limit wholesale prices to the lowest price charged in other states in the preceding month, but instead employs a different time period as the reference point. 
 The New Mexico Supreme Court expressly noted that the 1967 Act had been repealed and replaced by the 1981 Act. Jurisdictional Statement, No. 83-911, 2b, n. 1. It did not pass on the validity of the 1981 Act, however, and limited its consideration to the 1967 Act as amended in 1979. Indeed, it does not appear that appellants ever specifically requested the court to construe the 1981 Act or to rule on its validity. 
 Appellant in No. 83-911 asks us to vacate the judgment below and to remand the case to the New Mexico Supreme Court ""for clarification of the implications for this case of the 1981 amendments"" and for further consideration in light of this Court's decision in Healy v. United States Brewers Ass'n, ___ U.S. ___ (1983) ( summarily aff'g 692 F.2d 275 (CA2 1982)). Jurisdictional Statement 11. Appellant in No. 83-927, on the other hand, maintains that since the New Mexico Supreme Court did not rule on the effect or validity of the 1981 statute, no question concerning the 1981 statute is involved in this appeal. Appellant in No. 83-927 also demonstrates that the question of the validity of the 1967 Act as amended in 1979 is not moot. 
 Our recent decision in Healy, invalidating a Connecticut price affirmation statute, does not undermine the New Mexico Supreme Court's reliance on Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter and Rice v. Norman Williams Co. in upholding the constitutionality of the 1967 New Mexico Act as amended in 1979. Moreover, it seems quite plain that the New Mexico Supreme did not pass on the validity of the 1981 Act. Thus, we have no occasion to consider whatever relevance Healy might have to a constitutional challenge of the 1981 Act in these appeals. Nor do we have any power to order the state court to pass on a question that was apparently not properly presented to it when it entered the judgment we are now being asked to review. I therefore concur in dismissing these appeals from the judgment upholding the 1967 Act as amended in 1979 for want of a substantial federal question without reaching any issue which might exist concerning the 1981 Act. 
 Justice POWELL took no part in the consideration or decision of these appeals.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting: 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder for the killing of a fellow inmate at the Florida State Prison. After the guilty verdict was rendered by the jury, the trial judge announced that the penalty phase of the trial would begin after a two-hour lunch break. Petitioner's counsel moved for a continuance on the ground that he was ""unable and unprepared to proceed."" App. to Pet. for 
Page 465 U.S. 1109 , 1110
 Cert. E-4.1 The trial judge stated that he would take the motion under advisement but that both parties should assume that the penalty phase of the trial would begin after the lunch break. 
 When the court reconvened, the judge denied petitioner's motion and immediately proceeded with the penalty hearing. Following the hearing, at which no witnesses were presented on petitioner's behalf, the jury recommended that the court impose the death penalty. After reading the results of a pre-sentencing investigation, the judge adopted the jury's recommendation and sentenced petitioner to death. 
 The Florida Supreme Court, with two Justices dissenting,2 upheld the sentence, rejecting petitioner's claim that the trial court's denial of a continuance constituted an abuse of discretion. Williams v. State, 438 So. 2d 781, 785-786 (1983). The Florida Supreme Court justified its decision by reference to the wide discretion accorded to trial judges in determining whether to grant continuances, defense counsel's awareness that this was a case in which the death penalty would be sought, and defense counsel's failure to offer reasons for his unpreparedness. 
 The trial court's refusal to grant petitioner a continuance makes a mockery of federal constitutional standards that have been designed to ensure heightened sensitivity to fairness and accuracy [465 U.S. 1109 , 1111]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 13, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 It is not unusual for this Court to spend considerable amounts of time deliberating over difficult issues presented in a petition for a writ of certiorari. Yet in this case, where the constitutional validity of a death sentence is challenged on a variety of substantial grounds, the Court is dramatically expediting its normal deliberative processes to clear the way for an impending execution. 
 Unfortunately, this case is not an aberration but is part of a pattern of recent decisions in each of which the Court has shown an unseemly desire to bring litigation in a capital case to a fast and irrevocable end. See, e.g., Woodard v. Hutchins, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 755 (1984) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting) ( criticizing ""rush to judgment"" in decision to vacate stay of execution); id., at ___, 104 S.Ct. at 755 (WHITE, J., and STEVENS, J., dissenting); id., at ___, 104 S.Ct. at 755 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); Autry v. Estelle, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 23 (1983) ( STEVENS, J., dissenting) (criticizing decision to deny stay of execution pending filing and disposition of petition for certiorari); Barefoot v. Estelle, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 3401 (1983) ( MARSHALL, J., dissenting) (criticizing suggestion that courts of appeal may adopt special, 
Page 465 U.S. 1085 , 1086
 summary procedures for cases in which a stay of a death sentence has been requested). 
 Among the materials presently before the Court pertaining to petitioner's conviction and sentence are an application for a certificate of probable cause, two petitions for certiorari, and an application for a stay pending disposition of the latest petition for certiorari. See Autry v. McKaskle, ___ U.S. ___, 78 L.Ed.2d ___. Despite the fact that the petition in No. 83-5720 was still pending in this Court, the state set the date for petitioner's execution during our recess. Aware that the state cannot execute petitioner while his various petitions are pending in this Court, cf. United States v. Shipp, 203 U.S. 563 (1906), and yet unwilling to postpone petitioner's scheduled execution even a day or so, the Court has cut short its consideration of petitioner's multifarious claims. I, for one, feel unfairly pressed by the Court's insistence upon expedited procedures in death cases. [Footnote 1] 

 As an indication of the serious nature of the questions petitioner poses, I shall briefly discuss two issues raised in one of his petitions for certiorari, No. 82-5720, that clearly merit plenary review. I fear that, in our rush to judgment, we could be overlooking still other important claims. 
 The first issue posed in No. 82-5720-whether the state wrongfully denied immunity to a witness necessary to petitioner's defense-implicates a conflict among the federal courts of appeals regarding the proper standards for testing such claims. The second issue involves substantial allegations that petitioner was convicted on the basis, at least in part, of statements made as a result of beatings administered by police- allegations that have never been adequately addressed by the courts below. 
 Petitioner, James David Autry, was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering a clerk while attempting to rob a convenience store. [Footnote 2] For the purpose of evaluating his petition for certiorari, two sets of circumstances are significant. First, petitioner unsuccessfully requested the trial court to grant his co-defendant, John Alton Sandifer, use immunity for his eye-witness testimony [465 U.S. 1085 , 1087]

Mr. Autry has already endured the profound psychological torment of lying strapped to a gurney for over an hour with an intravenous needle in his arm, waiting to be put to death. That wait was brought to an end by the grant of a last-minute stay permitting him time to vindicate his constitutional rights. Following today's decision, however, he will again have to undergo the same indignity and psychological anguish, knowing that this time will probably be the last. Faced with such circumstances, I for one refuse to accept the notion implicit in today's decision that we have kept faith with the dual promise of the Eighth Amendment that the state's power to punish is ""exercised within the limits of civilized standards,"" and that we keep pace with the ""evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society"" in carrying out criminal punishments.

No. 82-1256
Argued October 4, 1983
Decided March 5, 1984
465 U.S. 668

Syllabus 
The city of Pawtucket, R.I., annually erects a Christmas display in a park owned by a nonprofit organization and located in the heart of the city's shopping district.  The display includes, in addition to such objects as a Santa Claus house, a Christmas tree, and a banner that reads ""SEASONS GREETINGS,"" a creche or Nativity scene, which has been part of this annual display for 40 years or more.  Respondents brought an action in Federal District Court, challenging the inclusion of the creche in the display on the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court upheld the challenge and permanently enjoined the city from including the creche in the display.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Notwithstanding the religious significance of the creche, Pawtucket has not violated the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  465 U. S. 672-687.
(a) The concept of a ""wall"" of separation between church and state is a useful metaphor, but is not an accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists.  The Constitution does not require complete separation of church and state; it affirmatively mandates accommodation, not merely tolerance, of all religions, and forbids hostility toward any.  Anything less would require the ""callous indifference,"" Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306,  343 U. S. 314, that was never intended by the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  465 U. S. 672-673.
(b) This Court's interpretation of the Establishment Clause comports with the contemporaneous understanding of the Framers' intent.  That neither the draftsmen of the Constitution, who were Members of the First Congress, nor the First Congress itself saw any establishment problem in employing Chaplains to offer daily prayers in the Congress is a striking example of the accommodation of religious beliefs intended by the Framers.  Pp.  465 U. S. 673-674.
(c) Our history is pervaded by official acknowledgment of the role of religion in American life, and equally pervasive is evidence of accommodation of all faiths and all forms of religious expression and hostility toward none.  Pp.  465 U. S. 674-678. 
Page 465 U. S. 669

(d) Rather than taking an absolutist approach in applying the Establishment Clause and mechanically invalidating all governmental conduct or statutes that confer benefits or give special recognition to religion in general or to one faith, this Court has scrutinized challenged conduct or legislation to determine whether, in reality, it establishes a religion or religious faith or tends to do so.  In the line-drawing process called for in each case, it has often been found useful to inquire whether the challenged law or conduct has a secular purpose, whether its principal or primary effect is to advance or inhibit religion, and whether it creates an excessive entanglement of government with religion.  But this Court has been unwilling to be confined to any single test or criterion in this sensitive area.  Pp.  465 U. S. 678-679.
(e) Here, the focus of the inquiry must be on the creche in the context of the Christmas season.  Focus exclusively on the religious component of any activity would inevitably lead to its invalidation under the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  465 U. S. 679-680.
(f) Based on the record in this case, the city has a secular purpose for including the creche in its Christmas display, and has not impermissibly advanced religion or created an excessive entanglement between religion and government.  The display is sponsored by the city to celebrate the Holiday recognized by Congress and national tradition and to depict the origins of that Holiday; these are legitimate secular purposes.  Whatever benefit to one faith or religion or to all religions inclusion of the creche in the display effects, is indirect, remote, and incidental, and is no more an advancement or endorsement of religion than the congressional and executive recognition of the origins of Christmas, or the exhibition of religious paintings in governmentally supported museums.  This Court is unable to discern a greater aid to religion from the inclusion of the creche than from the substantial benefits previously held not violative of the Establishment Clause.  As to administrative entanglement, there is no evidence of contact with church authorities concerning the content or design of the exhibition prior to or since the city's purchase of the creche.  No expenditures for maintenance of the creche have been necessary, and, since the city owns the creche, now valued at $200, the tangible material it contributes is de minimis.  Political divisiveness alone cannot serve to invalidate otherwise permissible conduct, and, in any event, apart from the instant litigation, there is no evidence of political friction or divisiveness over the creche in the 40-year history of the city's Christmas celebration.  Pp.  465 U. S. 680-685.
(g) It would be ironic if the inclusion of the creche in the display, as part of a celebration of an event acknowledged in the Western World for 20 centuries, and in this country by the people, the Executive Branch, 
Page 465 U. S. 670
 Congress, and the courts for 2 centuries, would so ""taint"" the exhibition as to render it violative of the Establishment Clause.  To forbid the use of this one passive symbol while hymns and carols are sung and played in public places including schools, and while Congress and state legislatures open public sessions with prayers, would be an overreaction contrary to this Nation's history and this Court's holdings.  Pp.  465 U. S. 685-686.

Held:  Notwithstanding the religious significance of the creche, Pawtucket has not violated the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  465 U. S. 672-687.
(a) The concept of a ""wall"" of separation between church and state is a useful metaphor, but is not an accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists.  The Constitution does not require complete separation of church and state; it affirmatively mandates accommodation, not merely tolerance, of all religions, and forbids hostility toward any.  Anything less would require the ""callous indifference,"" Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306,  343 U. S. 314, that was never intended by the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  465 U. S. 672-673.
(b) This Court's interpretation of the Establishment Clause comports with the contemporaneous understanding of the Framers' intent.  That neither the draftsmen of the Constitution, who were Members of the First Congress, nor the First Congress itself saw any establishment problem in employing Chaplains to offer daily prayers in the Congress is a striking example of the accommodation of religious beliefs intended by the Framers.  Pp.  465 U. S. 673-674.
(c) Our history is pervaded by official acknowledgment of the role of religion in American life, and equally pervasive is evidence of accommodation of all faiths and all forms of religious expression and hostility toward none.  Pp.  465 U. S. 674-678. 
Page 465 U. S. 669

(d) Rather than taking an absolutist approach in applying the Establishment Clause and mechanically invalidating all governmental conduct or statutes that confer benefits or give special recognition to religion in general or to one faith, this Court has scrutinized challenged conduct or legislation to determine whether, in reality, it establishes a religion or religious faith or tends to do so.  In the line-drawing process called for in each case, it has often been found useful to inquire whether the challenged law or conduct has a secular purpose, whether its principal or primary effect is to advance or inhibit religion, and whether it creates an excessive entanglement of government with religion.  But this Court has been unwilling to be confined to any single test or criterion in this sensitive area.  Pp.  465 U. S. 678-679.
(e) Here, the focus of the inquiry must be on the creche in the context of the Christmas season.  Focus exclusively on the religious component of any activity would inevitably lead to its invalidation under the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  465 U. S. 679-680.
(f) Based on the record in this case, the city has a secular purpose for including the creche in its Christmas display, and has not impermissibly advanced religion or created an excessive entanglement between religion and government.  The display is sponsored by the city to celebrate the Holiday recognized by Congress and national tradition and to depict the origins of that Holiday; these are legitimate secular purposes.  Whatever benefit to one faith or religion or to all religions inclusion of the creche in the display effects, is indirect, remote, and incidental, and is no more an advancement or endorsement of religion than the congressional and executive recognition of the origins of Christmas, or the exhibition of religious paintings in governmentally supported museums.  This Court is unable to discern a greater aid to religion from the inclusion of the creche than from the substantial benefits previously held not violative of the Establishment Clause.  As to administrative entanglement, there is no evidence of contact with church authorities concerning the content or design of the exhibition prior to or since the city's purchase of the creche.  No expenditures for maintenance of the creche have been necessary, and, since the city owns the creche, now valued at $200, the tangible material it contributes is de minimis.  Political divisiveness alone cannot serve to invalidate otherwise permissible conduct, and, in any event, apart from the instant litigation, there is no evidence of political friction or divisiveness over the creche in the 40-year history of the city's Christmas celebration.  Pp.  465 U. S. 680-685.
(g) It would be ironic if the inclusion of the creche in the display, as part of a celebration of an event acknowledged in the Western World for 20 centuries, and in this country by the people, the Executive Branch, 
Page 465 U. S. 670
 Congress, and the courts for 2 centuries, would so ""taint"" the exhibition as to render it violative of the Establishment Clause.  To forbid the use of this one passive symbol while hymns and carols are sung and played in public places including schools, and while Congress and state legislatures open public sessions with prayers, would be an overreaction contrary to this Nation's history and this Court's holdings.  Pp.  465 U. S. 685-686.

Syllabus 
Prior to 1977, spousal benefits under the Social Security Act (Act) were payable only to husbands or widowers who could demonstrate dependency on their wives for one-half of their support, whereas wives and widows were entitled to benefits without any such showing of dependency on their husbands.  In Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, this Court affirmed a District Court judgment holding that the gender-based dependency requirement for widowers violated the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Thereafter, while repealing the dependency requirement for widowers and husbands, Congress, in order to avoid a fiscal drain on the Social Security trust fund, enacted a ""pension offset"" provision that generally requires the reduction of spousal benefits by the amount of Federal or State Government pensions received by the Social Security applicant.  However, in order to protect the interests of those individuals who had retired or were about to retire and who had planned their retirements in reliance on their entitlement, under pre-1977 law, to spousal benefits unreduced by government pension benefits, Congress exempted from the pension offset requirement those spouses who were eligible to receive pension benefits prior to December, 1982, and who would have qualified for unreduced spousal benefits under the Act as administered in January, 1977.  Congress also included a severability clause which, in substance, provides that, if the exception to the pension offset requirement is held invalid, that requirement would not be affected, and the application of the exception would not be broadened to include persons not included within it.  Appellee husband (hereafter appellee), after retiring from the United States Postal Service, applied for husband's benefits under the Act on account of his wife, who had retired earlier and was fully insured under the Act.  It was determined administratively that, although appellee was entitled to spousal benefits, they were entirely offset by his Postal Service pension pursuant to the pension offset provision of the Act.  Appellee and his wife then brought a class action in Federal District Court, alleging that application of the pension offset provision to him and other nondependent men, but not to similarly situated nondependent women, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and that the severability clause was also unconstitutional.  
Page 465 U. S. 729
 The District Court held both the pension offset provision and the severability clause unconstitutional, concluding that the latter would, if valid, deprive appellee of standing to bring the action by preventing him from receiving any more spousal benefits if he prevails than he is now allowed.
Held.
1. Appellee has standing to prosecute this action.  Because the right he asserts is the right to receive benefits according to classifications that do not without sufficient justification differentiate among covered applicants solely on the basis of sex, and not a substantive right to any particular amount of benefits, appellee's standing does not depend on his ability to obtain increased Social Security payments.  The right to equal treatment guaranteed by the Constitution is not coextensive with any substantive rights to the benefits denied the party discriminated against.  Rather, discrimination itself, by perpetuating ""archaic and stereotypic notions"" or by stigmatizing members of the disfavored group as ""innately inferior,"" and therefore less worthy participants in the political community, can cause serious noneconomic injuries to those persons who are denied equal treatment solely because of their membership in a disfavored group.  Because the severability clause would forbid only the extension of benefits to the excluded class and not the withdrawal of benefits from the favored class, the injury caused by the unequal treatment allegedly suffered by appellee may be redressed.  Pp.  465 U. S. 737-740.
2. The pension offset exception applies to otherwise eligible men only when they can show dependency on their wives for one-half of their support.  The language and history of the exception plainly demonstrate that Congress intended to resurrect, for a 5-year grace period, the gender-based dependency test of pre-Goldfarb law so as to afford protection to those who anticipated receiving spousal benefits prior to Goldfarb without providing it also to those who would qualify only as a result of the Goldfarb decision.  To interpret the exception, as appellee urges, so that it does not incorporate a gender-based classification of the kind invalidated in Goldfarb, but instead exempts from the offset requirement both men and women, without regard to dependency, would defeat Congress' intention and, by rendering the offset requirement applicable to only a few applicants, frustrate the congressional aim of preventing a fiscal drain on the Social Security trust fund.  Pp.  465 U. S. 741-744.
3. The gender-based classification of the pension offset exception is constitutional.  Pp.  465 U. S. 744-751.
(a) Although temporarily reviving the gender-based classification invalidated in Goldfarb, the offset exception is directly and substantially related to the important governmental objective of protecting individuals who planned their retirements in reasonable reliance on the law in effect prior to that decision under which they could receive spousal benefits 
Page 465 U. S. 730
 unreduced by the amount of government pensions to which they were also entitled.  This objective provides an exceedingly persuasive justification for the gender-based classification incorporated in the offset exception.  Pp.  465 U. S. 745-748.
(b) And the means employed by the statute is substantially related to the achievement of that objective.  By reviving for a 5-year period the eligibility criteria in effect in January, 1977, the offset exception is narrowly tailored to protect only those persons who made retirement plans prior to the changes in the law that occurred after that date.  Such persons, men as well as women, may receive spousal benefits unreduced by their government pensions while those persons, men as well as women, who first became eligible for benefits after January, 1977, may not.  The exception distinguishes Social Security applicants, not according to archaic generalizations about the roles and abilities of men and women, but rather according to whether they planned their retirements with the expectation, created by the law in effect in January, 1977, that they would receive full spousal benefits and a government pension.  Pp.  465 U. S. 748-750.
Reversed.

Syllabus 
Respondent, a homicide suspect, when arrested on unrelated charges, made incriminating statements to the police about the homicide after the police had twice renewed interrogation despite respondent's having invoked his right to counsel.  Respondent was charged with murder and, after the South Dakota trial court refused to suppress the statements made to the police, was convicted of first-degree manslaughter.  The South Dakota Supreme Court affirmed.  Respondent then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, which denied the writ.  While respondent's appeal was pending, this Court, in Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, held that once a suspect has invoked the right to counsel, any subsequent conversation must be initiated by him.  Applying Edwards to this case, the Court of Appeals found that the police had acted unconstitutionally.
Held:  Edwards should not be applied retroactively, and therefore the Court of Appeals erred in evaluating the constitutionality of the police conduct in this case under the standards set out in Edwards.  Pp.  465 U. S. 642-651.
(a) The criteria guiding resolution of whether a new constitutional decision should be applied retroactively implicate (1) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (2) the extent law enforcement authorities relied on the old standards, and (3) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.  Pp.  465 U. S. 642-643.
(b) Complete retroactive effect is most appropriate where a new constitutional principle is designed to enhance the accuracy of criminal trials.  Edwards has little to do with the truthfinding function of the criminal trial.  The fact that a suspect has requested a lawyer does not mean that statements he makes in response to subsequent police questioning are likely to be inaccurate.  Moreover, in those situations where renewed interrogation raises significant doubt as to the voluntariness and reliability of the statements and, therefore, the accuracy of the outcome at trial, it is likely that suppression could be achieved without reliance on the prophylactic rule adopted in Edwards.  Pp.  465 U. S. 643-645.
(c) It would be unreasonable to expect law enforcement authorities to have conducted themselves in accordance with Edwards' bright-line rule prior to its announcement.  Edwards did not overrule any prior decision 
Page 465 U. S. 639
 or transform standard practice, but it did establish a new test for when the waiver of right to counsel would be acceptable once the suspect had invoked that right.  It cannot be said that the Edwards decision had been ""clearly"" or ""distinctly"" foreshadowed.  Pp.  465 U. S. 645-650.
(d) The retroactive application of Edwards would have a disruptive effect on the administration of justice.  In a significant number of cases, an inquiry, hampered by problems of lost evidence, faulty memory, and missing witnesses, would be required to assess the substantiality of any Edwards claim.

Syllabus 
Section 901(a) of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination in ""any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,"" and  902 provides that a recipient's compliance with regulations of a federal agency awarding assistance may be secured by termination of assistance ""to the particular program, or part thereof, in which . . . noncompliance has been . . . found.""  Under the statute, a federally assisted program must be identified before Title IX coverage is triggered.  Petitioner Grove City College (College), a private, coeducational, liberal arts college, accepts no direct federal assistance, nor does it participate in the Regular Disbursement System (RDS) of the Department of Education (Department), whereby amounts for federal grants to students are advanced to the institution, which then itself selects eligible students and calculates and distributes the grants.  However, the College enrolls students who receive direct federal Basic Educational Opportunity Grants (BEOG's) under the Department's Alternative Disbursement System (ADS).  The Department concluded that, under applicable regulations, the College was a ""recipient"" of ""Federal financial assistance,"" and when the College refused to execute an Assurance of Compliance with Title IX's nondiscrimination provisions, as required by the regulations, the Department initiated administrative proceedings, which resulted in an order terminating assistance until the College executed an Assurance of Compliance and satisfied the Department that it was in compliance with the regulations.  The College and four of its students then filed suit in Federal District Court, which held that the students' BEOG's constituted ""Federal financial assistance"" to the College, but that the Department could not terminate the students' aid because of the College's refusal to execute an Assurance of Compliance.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Department could terminate the students' BEOG's to force the College to execute an Assurance of Compliance.
Held:
1. Title IX coverage is triggered because some of the College's students receive BEOG's to pay for their education.  In view of the structure of the Education Amendments of 1972, the clear statutory language, 
Page 465 U. S. 556
 the legislative history (including postenactment history) showing Congress' awareness that the student assistant programs established by the Amendments significantly aided colleges and universities, and the longstanding administrative construction of the phrase ""receiving Federal financial assistance"" as including assistance to a student who uses it at a particular institution, Title IX coverage is not foreclosed merely because federal funds are granted to the students, rather than to the College's educational programs.  Pp.  465 U. S. 563-570.
2. However, the receipt of BEOG's by some of the College's students does not trigger institution-wide coverage under Title IX.  In purpose and effect, BEOG's represent financial assistance to the College's own financial aid program, and it is that program that may properly be regulated under Title IX's nondiscrimination provision.  Under the program-specific limitations of  901 and 902, the College's choice of participating in the ADS, rather than the RDS, mechanism for administering the BEOG program neither expands nor contracts the breadth of the ""program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.""  The fact that federal funds eventually reach the College's general operating budget cannot subject it to institution-wide coverage.  Pp.  465 U. S. 570-574.
3. A refusal to execute a proper program-specific Assurance of Compliance warrants the Department's termination of federal assistance to the student financial aid program.  The College's contention that termination must be preceded by a finding of actual discrimination is not supported by  902's language.  Pp.  465 U. S. 574-575.
4. Requiring the College to comply with Title IX's prohibition of discrimination as a condition for its continued eligibility to participate in the BEOG program infringes no First Amendment rights of the College or its students.   Pp.  465 U. S. 575-576.

The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Department could terminate the students' BEOG's to force the College to execute an Assurance of Compliance.
Held:
1. Title IX coverage is triggered because some of the College's students receive BEOG's to pay for their education.  In view of the structure of the Education Amendments of 1972, the clear statutory language, 
Page 465 U. S. 556
 the legislative history (including postenactment history) showing Congress' awareness that the student assistant programs established by the Amendments significantly aided colleges and universities, and the longstanding administrative construction of the phrase ""receiving Federal financial assistance"" as including assistance to a student who uses it at a particular institution, Title IX coverage is not foreclosed merely because federal funds are granted to the students, rather than to the College's educational programs.  Pp.  465 U. S. 563-570.
2. However, the receipt of BEOG's by some of the College's students does not trigger institution-wide coverage under Title IX.  In purpose and effect, BEOG's represent financial assistance to the College's own financial aid program, and it is that program that may properly be regulated under Title IX's nondiscrimination provision.  Under the program-specific limitations of  901 and 902, the College's choice of participating in the ADS, rather than the RDS, mechanism for administering the BEOG program neither expands nor contracts the breadth of the ""program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.""  The fact that federal funds eventually reach the College's general operating budget cannot subject it to institution-wide coverage.  Pp.  465 U. S. 570-574.
3. A refusal to execute a proper program-specific Assurance of Compliance warrants the Department's termination of federal assistance to the student financial aid program.  The College's contention that termination must be preceded by a finding of actual discrimination is not supported by  902's language.  Pp.  465 U. S. 574-575.
4. Requiring the College to comply with Title IX's prohibition of discrimination as a condition for its continued eligibility to participate in the BEOG program infringes no First Amendment rights of the College or its students.   Pp.  465 U. S. 575-576.

Argued December 7, 1983
Decided February 28, 1984
465 U.S. 605

Syllabus 
During a federal grand jury investigation of corruption in the awarding of county and municipal contracts, subpoenas were served on respondent owner of sole proprietorships demanding production of certain business records of several of his companies.  Respondent then filed a motion in Federal District Court seeking to quash the subpoenas.  The District Court granted the motion (except as to records required by law to be kept or disclosed to a public agency), finding that the act of producing the records would involve testimonial self-incrimination.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the records were privileged, that the act of producing them also would have ""communicative aspects of its own"" in that the turning over of the records to the grand jury would admit their existence, possession, and authenticity, and that hence respondent was entitled to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination rather than produce the records.  The court further held that, in view of the Government's failure to make a formal request for use immunity under 18 U.S.C.  6002 and 6003, it was proper to reject the Government's attempt to compel delivery of the records.
Held:
1. The contents of the subpoenaed records in question are not privileged under the Fifth Amendment.  That Amendment protects the person asserting the privilege only from compelled self-incrimination.  Fisher v. United States, 425 U. S. 391,  425 U. S. 396.  Where the preparation of business records is voluntary, no compulsion is present.  Here, respondent does not claim that he prepared the records involuntarily or that the subpoenas would force him to restate, repeat, or affirm the truth of the records' contents.  The fact that the records are in his possession is irrelevant to the determination of whether the creation of the records was compelled.  Pp.  465 U. S. 610-612.
2. The act of producing the documents at issue in this case is privileged.  Pp.  465 U. S. 612-614.
3. The act of producing the subpoenaed documents cannot be compelled without a statutory grant of use immunity pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  6002 and 6003.  This Court will not extend the jurisdiction of courts to include prospective grants of use immunity under a doctrine of constructive

Syllabus 
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides that
""[n]o . . . handicapped individual . . . shall, solely by reason of his handicap, . . . be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.""
Section 505(a)(2), which was added to the Act in 1978, makes ""available"" the ""remedies, procedures, and rights"" set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) for suits under  504 against ""any recipient of Federal assistance.""  Petitioner was formed under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act to acquire and operate insolvent railroads, and, as authorized by statute, has sold its securities to the United States, the proceeds of which sales are permitted to be used for maintenance of rail properties, capital needs, refinancing of indebtedness, or working capital.  Petitioner also received federal funds to provide for reassignment and retraining of railroad workers whose jobs were affected by the reorganization, and now receives federal funds to provide termination allowances to workers who lost their jobs as a result of the reorganization.  Respondent's decedent filed suit in Federal District Court against petitioner for violation of his rights under  504, alleging that, while employed as a locomotive engineer by a railroad to which petitioner is the successor in interest, he suffered an accident requiring amputation of his left hand and forearm, and that thereafter the railroad and the petitioner refused to employ him.  The District Court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the decedent had no ""standing"" to bring a private action under  504.  The court held that  505(a)(2) had incorporated the limitation in  604 of Title VI, which provides that employment discrimination is actionable only when the employer receives federal financial assistance the ""primary objective"" of which is to provide employment, and that the federal assistance to petitioner did not satisfy this ""primary objective"" test.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. The death of respondent's decedent did not moot the case, since it is clear that  504 authorizes a plaintiff who alleges intentional discrimination (as was done here) to bring an equitable action for backpay.  Pp.  465 U. S. 630-631. 
Page 465 U. S. 625

2. The suit may be maintained even if petitioner receives no federal aid the primary objective of which is to promote employment.  Pp.  465 U. S. 631-637.
(a) Section 504's language suggests that its bar on employment discrimination should not be limited to programs that receive such federal aid.  The legislative history, executive interpretation, and the Rehabilitation Act's purpose to promote and expand employment opportunities for the handicapped all are consistent with this construction.  Pp.  465 U. S. 631-634.
(b) Nor did Congress intend to enact the ""primary objective"" requirement of  604 of Title VI into the Rehabilitation Act when it added  505(a)(2) to the Act in 1978.  Section 505(a)(2)'s language does not incorporate  604's ""primary objective"" limitation.  Rather, the legislative history reveals that  505(a)(2) was intended to codify regulations governing enforcement of  504 that prohibited employment discrimination regardless of the purpose of federal financial assistance.

After a long trial-the record includes the testimony of 42 witnesses and over 7500 pages of exhibits 1 the District Court found discrimination in both hiring and promotion. The findings were supported by statistical evidence, expert testimony, and nonstatistical evidence covering specific instances of discrimination. 
 The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's finding of discrimination in promotion, but held that petitioners were not responsible for the hiring discrimination that had been proved-another federal agency 2 had done the discriminatory hiring-and also that petitioners were not liable for discriminatory conduct prior to 1972. Thus, the ""employment decisions that are not actionable in this case"" are ( 1) hiring decisions, and (2) pre-1972 discrimination. The order the Court enters today requires that this case be remanded to the District Court for additional findings of fact on the evidentiary value of respondents' statistical evidence in the light of these two conclusions. The Court's decision overlooks the fact that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals have already done exactly what the Court orders. 
 The Court of Appeals has already considered the impact of both of the District Court's errors on its findings concerning discrimination in promotion, and has squarely held that those findings are adequately supported by the remaining evidence. Thus, with respect to the pre-1972 discrimination, the Court of Appeals stated:

 Gregory Arnold MURPHY, petitioner,v. KENTUCKY and Keith PHILLIPS, petitioner,v. KENTUCKYNo. 83-5352No.83-5662 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 27, 1984
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Kentucky. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioners challenge their convictions on the ground that they were obtained in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. I, 10. 
 Prior to "" Ky.Rules Crim.Proc. 9.62. Effective that date, the rule was repealed, and thereafter convictions in Kentucky could legally be based upon the uncorroborated testimony of accomplices. [ Murphy v. Kentucky 465 U.S. 1072 (1984) ][1072-Continued.] 
 After repeal of the rule, petitioners in these two unrelated cases were tried for crimes that had been committed prior to the repeal. In each case, the trial court rejected the defendant's request for an instruction to the effect that the jury could not convict on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed both convictions over the claim that application of the new rule violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. Murphy v. Commonwealth, 652 S.W.2d 69 ( Ky.1983); Phillips v. Commonwealth, 655 S.W.2d 6 (Ky.1983). 
 The Supreme Court of Kentucky held that the change was not ex post facto, because it was merely a change in procedure. The change did not decrease the amount of evidence necessary to convict, but merely removed an impediment to the credibility of 
certain witnesses. Murphy v. Commonwealth, supra, at 72. In reaching its conclusion, the Kentucky court relied upon this Court's decision in Hopt v. Utah, 110 U.S. 574 (1884), which upheld retroactive application of a statute eliminating the ineligibility of convicted felons as witnesses. The Court in Hopt stated: 
 Any statutory alteration of the legal rules of evidence which would authorize conviction upon less proof, in amount or degree, than was required when the offence was committed, might, in respect of that offence, be obnoxious to the constitu- 
Page 465 U.S. 1072 , 1073
 tional inhibition upon ex post facto laws. But alterations which do not increase the punishment, nor change the ingredients of the offence or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt, but- leaving untouched the nature of the crime and the amount or degree of proof essential to conviction-only remove existing restrictions upon the competency of certain classes of persons as witnesses, relate to modes of procedure only, in which no one can be said to have a vested right, and which the State, upon grounds of public policy, may regulate at pleasure. 110 U.S., at 590. 
 See also Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U.S. 167 ( 1925); Thompson v. Missouri, 171 U.S. 380 ( 1898). 
 The Kentucky court found Hopt to be dispositive, stating that ""[t]he rule change was simply a procedure change which made a certain class of witnesses competent without corroboration."" 652 S.W.2d, at 73. 
 Other courts, however, have come to precisely the opposite conclusion . For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, distinguishing Hopt, has held that repeal of a statute requiring corroboration of accomplice testimony ""reduces the amount of proof necessary for conviction"" and therefore cannot constitutionally be applied retroactively. Government of the Virgin Islands v. Civil, 591 F.2d 255, 259 (3 Cir.1979). See also Bowyer v. United States, 422 A.2d 973 (D.C.App. 1980) (abolition of requirement of corroboration of testimony of sex-crime victims); State v. Byers, 102 Idaho 159, 627 P.2d 788 (1980) (same). Indeed, in Commonwealth v. Brown, 619 S.W.2d 699 (Ky.1981), which was overruled by Murphy v. Commonwealth, supra, the Kentucky Supreme Court itself reached a result contrary to the one it reached in these two cases. 
 Because of the evident confusion among lower courts concerning the application of the Ex Post Facto Clause to changes in rules of evidence and procedure-and because some 15 other states have accomplice- corroboration requirements that they may choose to abolish, see App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 83-5352, p. 15-we disregard our duty when certiorari is denied. Respectfully, I dissent.

 After repeal of the rule, petitioners in these two unrelated cases were tried for crimes that had been committed prior to the repeal. In each case, the trial court rejected the defendant's request for an instruction to the effect that the jury could not convict on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed both convictions over the claim that application of the new rule violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. Murphy v. Commonwealth, 652 S.W.2d 69 ( Ky.1983); Phillips v. Commonwealth, 655 S.W.2d 6 (Ky.1983). 
 The Supreme Court of Kentucky held that the change was not ex post facto, because it was merely a change in procedure. The change did not decrease the amount of evidence necessary to convict, but merely removed an impediment to the credibility of 
certain witnesses. Murphy v. Commonwealth, supra, at 72. In reaching its conclusion, the Kentucky court relied upon this Court's decision in Hopt v. Utah, 110 U.S. 574 (1884), which upheld retroactive application of a statute eliminating the ineligibility of convicted felons as witnesses. The Court in Hopt stated: 
 Any statutory alteration of the legal rules of evidence which would authorize conviction upon less proof, in amount or degree, than was required when the offence was committed, might, in respect of that offence, be obnoxious to the constitu- 
Page 465 U.S. 1072 , 1073
 tional inhibition upon ex post facto laws. But alterations which do not increase the punishment, nor change the ingredients of the offence or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt, but- leaving untouched the nature of the crime and the amount or degree of proof essential to conviction-only remove existing restrictions upon the competency of certain classes of persons as witnesses, relate to modes of procedure only, in which no one can be said to have a vested right, and which the State, upon grounds of public policy, may regulate at pleasure. 110 U.S., at 590. 
 See also Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U.S. 167 ( 1925); Thompson v. Missouri, 171 U.S. 380 ( 1898). 
 The Kentucky court found Hopt to be dispositive, stating that ""[t]he rule change was simply a procedure change which made a certain class of witnesses competent without corroboration."" 652 S.W.2d, at 73. 
 Other courts, however, have come to precisely the opposite conclusion . For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, distinguishing Hopt, has held that repeal of a statute requiring corroboration of accomplice testimony ""reduces the amount of proof necessary for conviction"" and therefore cannot constitutionally be applied retroactively. Government of the Virgin Islands v. Civil, 591 F.2d 255, 259 (3 Cir.1979). See also Bowyer v. United States, 422 A.2d 973 (D.C.App. 1980) (abolition of requirement of corroboration of testimony of sex-crime victims); State v. Byers, 102 Idaho 159, 627 P.2d 788 (1980) (same). Indeed, in Commonwealth v. Brown, 619 S.W.2d 699 (Ky.1981), which was overruled by Murphy v. Commonwealth, supra, the Kentucky Supreme Court itself reached a result contrary to the one it reached in these two cases. 
 Because of the evident confusion among lower courts concerning the application of the Ex Post Facto Clause to changes in rules of evidence and procedure-and because some 15 other states have accomplice- corroboration requirements that they may choose to abolish, see App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 83-5352, p. 15-we disregard our duty when certiorari is denied. Respectfully, I dissent.

465 U.S. 330

Syllabus 
Section 2501(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 imposes a tax upon ""the transfer of property by gift.""  Section 2511(a) provides that such tax shall apply whether ""the transfer is in trust or otherwise, whether the gift is direct or indirect, and whether the property is real or personal, tangible or intangible.""  Petitioner wife and her husband, now deceased, made substantial interest-free demand loans to their son and a closely held family corporation.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the loans resulted in taxable gifts to the extent of the value of the use of the loaned funds, and assessed gift tax deficiencies.  Petitioner wife and petitioner personal representative of her husband sought redetermination of the deficiencies in the Tax Court, which held that the loans were not subject to the gift tax.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The loans in question resulted in taxable gifts of the reasonable value of the use of the money lent.  Pp.  465 U. S. 333-344.
(a) The language of  2501(a)(1) and 2511(a) is clear, and admits of only one reasonable interpretation:  transfers of property by gift, by whatever means effected, are subject to the federal gift tax.  The gift tax was designed to encompass all transfers of property and property rights having significant value.  Pp.  465 U. S. 333-335.
(b) The interest-free loan of funds is a ""transfer of property by gift"" within the contemplation of the Code.  The transfer of cash, interest-free and repayable on demand, is a grant of the use of valuable property.  And the right to use the money without charge is a valuable interest in the money lent, although the value of such interest may be reduced by virtue of its demand status.  Pp.  465 U. S. 335-338.
(c) Failure to impose the gift tax on interest-free loans would seriously undermine Congress' goal in enacting the gift tax as a protection against income tax avoidance by the transferor and as a supplement to the estate tax.  Pp.  465 U. S. 338-339.
(d) Subjecting interest-free loans to the gift tax does not impose upon the transferor a duty to invest profitably, but rather merely recognizes that certain tax consequences flow from a decision to make ""a transfer of property by gift.""  Pp.  465 U. S. 339-340. 
Page 465 U. S. 331

(e) There is no merit to petitioners' contention that imposing a gift tax on interest-free loans could result in imposing the tax on routine neighborly or familial gifts, thus intruding into cherished zones of privacy.  Any such administrative problems are rendered illusory by the generous exclusions, exceptions, and credits provided by the Code for gifts to both family members and others.  Pp.  465 U. S. 340-342.
(f) Assuming, arguendo, that the Commissioner's present position represents a departure from prior administrative practice, he may, nevertheless, change an earlier interpretation of the law, even if such a change is made retroactive in effect, and even though a taxpayer may have relied to his detriment upon the Commissioner's prior position.

Syllabus 
Upon trial in Federal District Court, defendant Mulcahey, who asserted the defense of entrapment, was acquitted of charges of knowingly engaging in the business of dealing in firearms without a license, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(a)(1).  The Government then instituted this in rem action for forfeiture of the firearms involved, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. i 924(d), which authorizes forfeitures of any firearms ""involved in or used or intended to be used in, any violation of the provisions of this chapter.""  Ordering forfeiture, the District Court rejected Mulcahey's defenses of res judicata and collateral estoppel based on his earlier acquittal.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that, because the  924(d) forfeiture proceeding was criminal and punitive in nature, it was barred by double jeopardy principles in view of Mulcahey's prior acquittal.  Relying on Coffey v. United States, 116 U. S. 436, the Court of Appeals also held that the forfeiture action was barred by collateral estoppel, because it was based upon the same facts as the earlier criminal action.
Held:  A gun owner's acquittal on criminal charges involving firearms does not preclude a subsequent in rem forfeiture proceeding against those firearms under  924(d).  Pp.  465 U. S. 357-366.
(a) To the extent that Coffey v. United States, supra, suggests that collateral estoppel or double jeopardy automatically bars a civil, remedial forfeiture proceeding following an acquittal on related criminal charges, it is disapproved.  Cf. Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391; One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232.  Pp.  465 U. S. 357-361.
(b) The difference in the relative burdens of proof in the criminal and civil actions precludes the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.  Acquittal on a criminal charge merely reflects the existence of a reasonable doubt as to Mulcahey's guilt, not innocence.  Nor did the acquittal negate the possibility that a preponderance of the evidence in the forfeiture proceeding could show that Mulcahey was engaged in an unlicensed firearms business.  Pp.  465 U. S. 361-362.
(c) The Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to civil proceedings, and is not applicable here.  Under the procedural mechanisms established for enforcing forfeitures under  924(d), Congress intended such 
Page 465 U. S. 355
 forfeitures to be civil and remedial, rather than criminal and punitive.  Moreover, the differences in the language of  924(d), which subjects to forfeiture firearms used or ""intended to be used"" in substantive offenses and  922(a)(1), which does not render unlawful mere intention to deal in firearms without a license, shows that the forfeiture provisions were meant to be broader in scope than the criminal sanctions.  The forfeiture provision also furthers broad remedial aims of controlling the indiscriminate flow of firearms.  Nor is the statutory scheme so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate Congress' intention to establish a civil remedial mechanism.  Pp.  465 U. S. 362-366.

Syllabus 
Section 103(a) of the Internal Revenue Code exempts from a taxpayer's gross income the interest earned on the obligations of any State.  Section 103 was amended by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, which added a new provision,  103(j)(1), to the Internal Revenue Code.  Section 103(j)(1) requires that ""registration-required obligation[s]"" be issued in registered, rather than bearer, form to qualify for the  103(a) exemption.  If a registration-required obligation is issued in bearer, rather than registered, form,  103(j)(1) provides that the interest is taxable.  South Carolina asks leave to file a complaint against the Secretary of the Treasury, seeking injunctive and other relief on the ground that  103(j)(1) is invalid as violative of the Tenth Amendment and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.  The Secretary argues that the action is barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, which provides that
""no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.""
Held:  The motion for leave to file the complaint is granted.
JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the Anti-Injunction Act does not bar the action.  Pp.  465 U. S. 373-381.
(a) The Act's purposes and the circumstances of its enactment indicate that it does not apply to actions brought by aggrieved parties, such as South Carolina, for whom Congress has not provided an alternative forum in which to litigate their claims.  Here, if South Carolina issues bearer bonds, its bondholders, by virtue of  103(j)(1), will be liable for the tax on the interest earned on those bonds.  South Carolina will incur no tax liability.  Under these circumstances, the State will be unable to utilize any statutory procedure to contest the constitutionality of  103(j)(1).  Pp.  465 U. S. 373-380.
(b) The indicia of congressional intent also demonstrate that Congress did not intend the Anti-Injunction Act to apply where an aggrieved party would be required to depend on the mere possibility of persuading a third party to assert his claims.  The nature of the remedy proposed 
Page 465 U. S. 368
 by the Secretary that the State may obtain judicial review of its claims by issuing bearer bonds and urging a purchaser of those bonds to bring a suit contesting the legality of  103(j)(1), only buttresses the conclusion that the Act was not intended to apply to this kind of action.  Reliance on such proposed remedy would create the risk that the Act would entirely deprive the State of any opportunity to obtain review of its claims.  Pp.  465 U. S. 380-381.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded in Part III that, since the manner in which a State may exercise its borrowing power is a question of vital importance to all States, it is appropriate for this Court to exercise its discretion in favor of hearing this case.  But since the record is presently not sufficiently developed to permit the merits to be addressed, a Special Master will be appointed to develop the record.  Pp.  465 U. S. 381-382.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded that, because the suit is not one ""for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax,"" the Anti-Injunction Act is no bar to South Carolina's ability to bring the suit in another court.  Nevertheless, because the issue presented is substantial and of concern to a number of States, and because prompt resolution of the issue in this Court will benefit all concerned, the grant of leave to file is a proper exercise of the Court's discretion.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by JUSTICE POWELL and JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that, although great deference is due the congressional policy against premature judicial interference with federal taxes, it is proper to exercise this Court's original jurisdiction where South Carolina has demonstrated injury of ""serious magnitude"" and that it has no adequate alternative forum in which to raise its unique claims.

Decided February 22, 1984
465 U.S. 420

Syllabus 
In 1980, respondent pleaded guilty to a sex-related charge in a Minnesota court, and was given a suspended prison sentence and placed on probation.  The terms of his probation required him to participate in a treatment program for sexual offenders, to report to his probation officer periodically, and to be truthful with the officer ""in all matters.""  During the course of a meeting with his probation officer, who had previously received information from a treatment counselor that respondent had admitted to a 1974 rape and murder, respondent, upon questioning, admitted that he had committed the rape and murder.  After being indicted for first-degree murder, respondent sought to suppress the confession made to the probation officer on the ground that it was obtained in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Minnesota trial court found that respondent was not ""in custody"" at the time of the confession, and that the confession was neither compelled nor involuntary despite the absence of Miranda warnings.  The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed, holding that, notwithstanding the lack of custody in the usual sense, respondent's failure to claim the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when he was questioned was not fatal to his claim, because of the nature of his meeting with the probation officer, because he was under court order to respond truthfully, and because the probation officer had substantial reason to believe that respondent's answers were likely to be incriminating.

Syllabus 
In 1980, respondent pleaded guilty to a sex-related charge in a Minnesota court, and was given a suspended prison sentence and placed on probation.  The terms of his probation required him to participate in a treatment program for sexual offenders, to report to his probation officer periodically, and to be truthful with the officer ""in all matters.""  During the course of a meeting with his probation officer, who had previously received information from a treatment counselor that respondent had admitted to a 1974 rape and murder, respondent, upon questioning, admitted that he had committed the rape and murder.  After being indicted for first-degree murder, respondent sought to suppress the confession made to the probation officer on the ground that it was obtained in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Minnesota trial court found that respondent was not ""in custody"" at the time of the confession, and that the confession was neither compelled nor involuntary despite the absence of Miranda warnings.  The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed, holding that, notwithstanding the lack of custody in the usual sense, respondent's failure to claim the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when he was questioned was not fatal to his claim, because of the nature of his meeting with the probation officer, because he was under court order to respond truthfully, and because the probation officer had substantial reason to believe that respondent's answers were likely to be incriminating.

Syllabus 
The Cheyenne River Act (Act), enacted in 1908, authorized the Secretary of the Interior ""to sell and dispose of "" for homesteading a specified portion of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation located in South Dakota, with the sale proceeds to be deposited in the United States Treasury to the credit of the Indians having tribal rights on the reservation.  Respondent, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, was convicted of attempted rape in a South Dakota state court.  After exhausting state remedies, he filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, contending that the crime occurred within Indian country, that although the Act opened a portion of the reservation for homesteading, it did not diminish the reservation, and that therefore the State lacked jurisdiction over him, the federal courts having exclusive jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.  1153.  The District Court issued a writ of habeas corpus, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Act did not diminish the reservation.  Pp.  465 U. S. 466-481.
(a) Only Congress can divest an Indian reservation of its land and diminish its boundaries.  But Congress must clearly evince an intent to change boundaries before diminishment will be found.  When both a surplus land Act and its legislative history fail to provide substantial and compelling evidence of such an intent, this Court is bound by its traditional solicitude for Indian tribes to rule that diminishment did not take place, and that old reservation boundaries survived the opening of unallotted land for non-Indian settlement.  Pp.  465 U. S. 466-472.
(b) Here, the Act's operative language authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to ""sell and dispose"" of certain lands, coupled with the creation of Indian accounts for the proceeds, suggests that the Secretary was simply being authorized to act as the Tribe's sales agent.  The balance of the Act is consistent with the implication of the operative language that the Act opened, but did not diminish, the reservation.  In fact, certain provisions of the Act strongly suggest that the unallotted opened lands would, for the immediate future, remain an integral part of the reservation.  Isolated phrases in the Act supporting the view that the reservation was diminished, when balanced against the Act's stated and limited goal of opening up reservation lands for sale to non-Indian settlers,

(c) Nor do either the circumstances surrounding the passage of the Act or subsequent events establish a clear congressional purpose to diminish the reservation.  Moreover, the opened portions of the reservation have retained their Indian character since 1908.  Pp.  465 U. S. 476-480.  691 F.2d 420, affirmed.

Syllabus 
The city of Peoria received federal block grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCDA), which provides for such grants for urban renewal programs.  As authorized by the HCDA, the city designated a community-based, social service corporation to be the city's subgrantee in charge of the administration of the federal grants.  Petitioners, officers responsible for the expenditure of the federal funds and administration of the corporation's urban renewal programs, were indicted for violating the federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C.  201, by using their positions to extract kickbacks from contractors seeking to work on housing rehabilitation projects.  Before trial, the Federal District Court denied petitioners' motions to dismiss the indictment on the asserted ground that they were not ""public officials"" under 18 U.S.C.  201(a), which defines the term ""public official"" as including
""an officer or employee or person acting for or on behalf of the United States, or any department, agency or branch of Government thereof, . . . in any official function, under or by authority of any such department, agency, or branch of Government.""
Petitioners were convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Petitioners are ""public officials"" within the meaning of  201(a), and thus are subject to prosecution under the bribery statute.  Pp.  465 U. S. 489-501.
(a) There is no merit in petitioners' contention that they cannot be considered to be persons ""acting for or on behalf of the United States"" under the statutory definition, because neither they nor their employer ever entered into any direct agreement with the Federal Government.  Although the language of  201(a) does not decide the dispute, its legislative history -- including Congress' longstanding commitment to a broadly drafted federal bribery statute, its desire to continue that tradition when it adopted the language of  201(a) in the 1962 revisions of the federal conflicts of interest and bribery statutes, and its awareness of the federal judiciary's interpretation of the identical phrase in earlier federal bribery statutes to have a broad jurisdictional reach (particularly the Second Circuit's 
Page 465 U. S. 483
 decision in United States v. Levine, 129 F.2d 745) -- establishes that Congress never intended  201(a)'s open-ended definition of ""public official"" to be restricted to persons in a formal employment or agency relationship with the Government.  The proper inquiry is whether the person occupies a position of public trust with official federal responsibilities.  Pp.  465 U. S. 489-496.
(b) Given the structure of the HCDA program and petitioners' responsible positions as administrators of the subgrant, they served as public officials for purposes of  201(a).  In allocating the federal resources made available to the city through the HCDA grant program, petitioners were charged with abiding by federal guidelines, which dictated both where and how the federal funds could be distributed.  By accepting the responsibility for distributing the federal resources, petitioners assumed the quintessentially official role of administering a social service program established by Congress.  Pp.  465 U. S. 496-498.
(c) The majority of recent decisions in lower federal courts supports the conclusion that employment by the United States or some other similarly formal contractual or agency bond is not a prerequisite to prosecution under the federal bribery statute.  Pp.  465 U. S. 498-499.
(d) The holding here does not mean that the mere presence of some federal assistance brings a local organization and its employees within the jurisdiction of the federal bribery statute, or that all employees of local organizations responsible for administering federal grant programs are public officials within the meaning of  201(a).

Syllabus 
Section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (Code) provides that, with certain exceptions, the trustee, subject to the Bankruptcy Court's approval, may assume or reject ""any executory contract"" of the debtor.  In April, 1980, respondent debtor (hereafter respondent), a building supplies distributor, filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Code, and was subsequently authorized by the Bankruptcy Court to operate the business as a debtor-in-possession.  At the time the petition was filed, some of respondent's employees were represented by petitioner Union with whom respondent had negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that was to expire in April, 1982.  Beginning in January, 1980, respondent failed to meet some of its obligations under the agreement, including the payment of health and pension benefits and the remittance to the Union of dues collected, and in May, 1980, respondent refused to pay wage increases called for in the agreement.  Thereafter, respondent requested and received permission from the Bankruptcy Court to reject the agreement, and the Union was allowed 30 days in which to file a claim for damages stemming from the rejection.  The District Court upheld the order. In the summer of 1980, the Union filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board (Board), which found that respondent had violated  8(a)(5) and 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by unilaterally changing the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and by refusing to negotiate with the Union, and ordered respondent to make the pension and health contributions and to remit dues to the Union.  Consolidating the Union's appeal from the District Court's order and the Board's petition for enforcement of its order, the Court of Appeals held that a collective bargaining agreement is an executory contract subject to rejection by a debtor-in-possession under  365(a) of the Code; that the debtor-in-possession's authority to seek rejection of the 
Page 465 U. S. 514
 agreement was not qualified by  8(d) of the NLRA; but that to obtain rejection, a debtor-in-possession must show not only that the agreement burdens the estate but also that the equities balance in favor of rejection.  The case was remanded for the Bankruptcy Court's reconsideration in light of these standards.  The Court of Appeals refused to enforce the Board's order, rejecting the Board's conclusion that respondent, as a debtor-in-possession, was the alter ego of the pre-petition employer, and holding that, under the Code, a debtor-in-possession was deemed a ""new entity"" not bound by the debtor's prior collective bargaining agreement.
Held:
1. The language ""executory contract"" in  365(a) of the Code includes collective bargaining agreements subject to the NLRA, and the Bankruptcy Court should permit rejection of such an agreement under  365(a) if the debtor can show that the agreement burdens the estate and that the equities balance in favor of rejection.  Pp.  465 U. S. 521-527.
(a) Any inference that collective bargaining agreements are not included within the general scope of  365(a) because they differ for some purposes from ordinary contracts is rebutted by  365(a)'s statutory design and by the language of  1167 of the Code expressly exempting from  365(a) collective bargaining agreements subject to the Railway Labor Act.  The failure to grant a similar exemption to agreements subject to the NLRA indicates that Congress intended  365(a) to apply to all collective bargaining agreements covered by the NLRA.  Pp.  465 U. S. 521-523.
(b) Because of the special nature of a collective bargaining agreement, and the consequent ""law of the shop"" that it creates, a somewhat stricter standard than the ""business judgment"" standard applied to authorize rejection of an ordinary executory contract should govern the Bankruptcy Court's decision to allow rejection of a collective bargaining agreement.  But a standard that would require respondent to demonstrate that its reorganization will fail unless rejection is permitted is at odds with the flexibility and equity built into Chapter 11 and subordinates the multiple, competing considerations underlying a Chapter 11 reorganization to the issue of whether rejection of the agreement is necessary to prevent the debtor from going into liquidation.  Pp.  465 U. S. 523-526.
(c) Before acting on a petition to modify or reject a collective bargaining agreement, the Bankruptcy Court should be persuaded that reasonable efforts to negotiate a voluntary modification have been made and are not likely to produce a prompt and satisfactory solution.  If the parties are unable to agree, a decision on the rejection of the agreement may become necessary to the reorganization process.  But since the policy of Chapter 11 is to permit successful rehabilitation of debtors, rejection should not be permitted without a finding that that policy would be 
Page 465 U. S. 515
 served by such action.  Determining what would constitute a successful rehabilitation involves balancing the interests of the debtor, creditors, and employees, and in striking the balance the court must consider not only the degree of hardship faced by each party, but also any qualitative differences between the types of hardship each may face.  Pp.  465 U. S. 526-527.
2. A debtor-in-possession does not commit an unfair labor practice when it unilaterally rejects or modifies a collective bargaining agreement before formal rejection is approved by the Bankruptcy Court.  Pp.  465 U. S. 527-534.
(a) To hold that the debtor commits an unfair labor practice under such circumstances would undermine whatever benefit the debtor otherwise obtains by its authority to request rejection of the agreement.  The difference between a Chapter 11 reorganization, wherein the debtor-in-possession has until a reorganization plan is confirmed to decide whether to accept or reject an executory contract, and a Chapter 7 liquidation, wherein the trustee has only 60 days from the order for relief in which to make such a decision, reflects Congress' considered judgment that a debtor-in-possession seeking to reorganize should be granted more latitude in making the decision than should a trustee in liquidation.  Pp.  465 U. S. 528-529.
(b) Since recovery on a claim arising from a debtor-in-possession's rejection of an executory collective bargaining agreement after the filing of a petition in bankruptcy may be had only through administration of the claim in bankruptcy, and not by a suit against the debtor-in-possession under the agreement, the Board is necessarily precluded from, in effect, enforcing the agreement by filing an unfair labor practice charge against the debtor-in-possession for violating  8(d) of the NLRA.  Such enforcement would run directly counter to the Code's express provisions and to its overall effort to give a debtor-in-possession some flexibility and breathing space.  From the filing of the bankruptcy petition until formal acceptance, the collective bargaining agreement is not an enforceable contract within the meaning of  8(d).  Accordingly, the debtor-in-possession need not comply with  8(d) prior to seeking the Bankruptcy Court's permission to reject the agreement.  It necessarily follows that any corresponding duty to bargain to impasse under  8(a)(5) and  8(d) before seeking rejection must also be subordinated to the exigencies of bankruptcy.  Pp.  465 U. S. 529-534.

Section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (Code) provides that, with certain exceptions, the trustee, subject to the Bankruptcy Court's approval, may assume or reject ""any executory contract"" of the debtor.  In April, 1980, respondent debtor (hereafter respondent), a building supplies distributor, filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Code, and was subsequently authorized by the Bankruptcy Court to operate the business as a debtor-in-possession.  At the time the petition was filed, some of respondent's employees were represented by petitioner Union with whom respondent had negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that was to expire in April, 1982.  Beginning in January, 1980, respondent failed to meet some of its obligations under the agreement, including the payment of health and pension benefits and the remittance to the Union of dues collected, and in May, 1980, respondent refused to pay wage increases called for in the agreement.  Thereafter, respondent requested and received permission from the Bankruptcy Court to reject the agreement, and the Union was allowed 30 days in which to file a claim for damages stemming from the rejection.  The District Court upheld the order. In the summer of 1980, the Union filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board (Board), which found that respondent had violated  8(a)(5) and 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by unilaterally changing the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and by refusing to negotiate with the Union, and ordered respondent to make the pension and health contributions and to remit dues to the Union.  Consolidating the Union's appeal from the District Court's order and the Board's petition for enforcement of its order, the Court of Appeals held that a collective bargaining agreement is an executory contract subject to rejection by a debtor-in-possession under  365(a) of the Code; that the debtor-in-possession's authority to seek rejection of the 
Page 465 U. S. 514
 agreement was not qualified by  8(d) of the NLRA; but that to obtain rejection, a debtor-in-possession must show not only that the agreement burdens the estate but also that the equities balance in favor of rejection.  The case was remanded for the Bankruptcy Court's reconsideration in light of these standards.  The Court of Appeals refused to enforce the Board's order, rejecting the Board's conclusion that respondent, as a debtor-in-possession, was the alter ego of the pre-petition employer, and holding that, under the Code, a debtor-in-possession was deemed a ""new entity"" not bound by the debtor's prior collective bargaining agreement.
Held:
1. The language ""executory contract"" in  365(a) of the Code includes collective bargaining agreements subject to the NLRA, and the Bankruptcy Court should permit rejection of such an agreement under  365(a) if the debtor can show that the agreement burdens the estate and that the equities balance in favor of rejection.  Pp.  465 U. S. 521-527.
(a) Any inference that collective bargaining agreements are not included within the general scope of  365(a) because they differ for some purposes from ordinary contracts is rebutted by  365(a)'s statutory design and by the language of  1167 of the Code expressly exempting from  365(a) collective bargaining agreements subject to the Railway Labor Act.  The failure to grant a similar exemption to agreements subject to the NLRA indicates that Congress intended  365(a) to apply to all collective bargaining agreements covered by the NLRA.  Pp.  465 U. S. 521-523.
(b) Because of the special nature of a collective bargaining agreement, and the consequent ""law of the shop"" that it creates, a somewhat stricter standard than the ""business judgment"" standard applied to authorize rejection of an ordinary executory contract should govern the Bankruptcy Court's decision to allow rejection of a collective bargaining agreement.  But a standard that would require respondent to demonstrate that its reorganization will fail unless rejection is permitted is at odds with the flexibility and equity built into Chapter 11 and subordinates the multiple, competing considerations underlying a Chapter 11 reorganization to the issue of whether rejection of the agreement is necessary to prevent the debtor from going into liquidation.  Pp.  465 U. S. 523-526.
(c) Before acting on a petition to modify or reject a collective bargaining agreement, the Bankruptcy Court should be persuaded that reasonable efforts to negotiate a voluntary modification have been made and are not likely to produce a prompt and satisfactory solution.  If the parties are unable to agree, a decision on the rejection of the agreement may become necessary to the reorganization process.  But since the policy of Chapter 11 is to permit successful rehabilitation of debtors, rejection should not be permitted without a finding that that policy would be 
Page 465 U. S. 515
 served by such action.  Determining what would constitute a successful rehabilitation involves balancing the interests of the debtor, creditors, and employees, and in striking the balance the court must consider not only the degree of hardship faced by each party, but also any qualitative differences between the types of hardship each may face.  Pp.  465 U. S. 526-527.
2. A debtor-in-possession does not commit an unfair labor practice when it unilaterally rejects or modifies a collective bargaining agreement before formal rejection is approved by the Bankruptcy Court.  Pp.  465 U. S. 527-534.
(a) To hold that the debtor commits an unfair labor practice under such circumstances would undermine whatever benefit the debtor otherwise obtains by its authority to request rejection of the agreement.  The difference between a Chapter 11 reorganization, wherein the debtor-in-possession has until a reorganization plan is confirmed to decide whether to accept or reject an executory contract, and a Chapter 7 liquidation, wherein the trustee has only 60 days from the order for relief in which to make such a decision, reflects Congress' considered judgment that a debtor-in-possession seeking to reorganize should be granted more latitude in making the decision than should a trustee in liquidation.  Pp.  465 U. S. 528-529.
(b) Since recovery on a claim arising from a debtor-in-possession's rejection of an executory collective bargaining agreement after the filing of a petition in bankruptcy may be had only through administration of the claim in bankruptcy, and not by a suit against the debtor-in-possession under the agreement, the Board is necessarily precluded from, in effect, enforcing the agreement by filing an unfair labor practice charge against the debtor-in-possession for violating  8(d) of the NLRA.  Such enforcement would run directly counter to the Code's express provisions and to its overall effort to give a debtor-in-possession some flexibility and breathing space.  From the filing of the bankruptcy petition until formal acceptance, the collective bargaining agreement is not an enforceable contract within the meaning of  8(d).  Accordingly, the debtor-in-possession need not comply with  8(d) prior to seeking the Bankruptcy Court's permission to reject the agreement.  It necessarily follows that any corresponding duty to bargain to impasse under  8(a)(5) and  8(d) before seeking rejection must also be subordinated to the exigencies of bankruptcy.  Pp.  465 U. S. 529-534.

465 U.S. 208

Syllabus 
Acting pursuant to a statewide affirmative action program, the city of Camden, N.J., adopted an ordinance requiring that at least 40% of the employees of contractors and subcontractors working on city construction projects be Camden residents.  After the ordinance was approved by the New Jersey Treasury Department, appellant, an association of labor organizations representing private employees in the building and construction trades, filed an appeal with the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court challenging the Treasury Department's approval of the ordinance.  The New Jersey Supreme Court certified the appeal directly to that court and rejected appellant's challenges to the ordinance's validity, including the claim that the ordinance violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV of the Federal Constitution.  The court held that the Clause did not apply, because the ordinance discriminated on the basis of municipal, not state, residency, and had identical effects upon out-of-state citizens and New Jersey citizens not residing in Camden.
Held:
1. The ordinance is properly subject to the strictures of the Privileges and Immunities Clause.  Pp.  465 U. S. 214-218.
(a) That the ordinance is a municipal, rather than a state, law does not place it outside the Clause's scope.  Here, municipal action cannot be distinguished easily from state action, since the ordinance would not have gone into effect without the Treasury Department's approval.  Moreover, a municipality is merely a political subdivision of the State, and what would be unconstitutional if done directly by the State can no more readily be accomplished by a city deriving its authority from the State.  Pp.  465 U. S. 214-215.
(b) The Clause applies not only to laws that discriminate on the basis of state citizenship, but also to laws that discriminate on the basis of municipal residency.  For purposes of analysis of most cases under the Clause, the terms ""citizen"" and ""resident"" are essentially interchangeable.  Camden's ordinance is not immune from constitutional review 
Page 465 U. S. 209
 at the behest of out-of-state residents merely because in-state residents who do not live in Camden are similarly disadvantaged.  While such in-state residents have no claim under the Clause, nevertheless they at least have a chance to remedy at the polls the discrimination against them.  Pp.  465 U. S. 215-218.
2. On remand, the determination of whether the Camden ordinance violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause should be made under the appropriate constitutional standard, which requires determination of whether the ordinance burdens one of those privileges and immunities protected by the Clause, and, if so, whether there is a ""substantial reason"" for the discrimination against citizens of other States.  Pp.  465 U. S. 218-223.
(a) Although Camden may, without fear of violating the Commerce Clause, pressure private employers engaged in public works projects funded in whole or in part by the city to hire city residents, cf. White v. Massachusetts Council of Construction Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204, an out-of-state resident's interest in employment by private employers on public works projects in another State is sufficiently fundamental to the promotion of interstate harmony and sufficiently basic to the livelihood of the Nation as to fall within the purview of the Privileges and Immunities Clause.  Pp.  465 U. S. 218-222.
(b) However, it is impossible on the record as it now stands to evaluate Camden's contention that its ordinance is carefully tailored to counteract grave economic and social ills involving unemployment of city residents and a sharp decline in the city's population.  On remand, the New Jersey Supreme Court may decide, consistent with state procedures, on the best method for making the necessary findings of fact.  Pp.  465 U. S. 222-223.

Syllabus 
Prior to 1966, Edgefield County, S.C. was governed by a three-member Board of County Commissioners, consisting of the County Supervisor, who was elected at-large, and two members who were appointed by the Governor.  There were no residency requirements for the Commissioners.  In 1966, the state legislature enacted a statute creating a new form of government for the county and altering its election practices.  A three-member County Council was established, and the county was divided into three residency districts for the purpose of electing Council members.  Voters throughout the county cast votes for a candidate from each district, and the candidate in each district with the most votes occupies that district's seat on the Council.  The 1966 statute was not submitted to federal officials for approval as required by  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  In 1971, the 1966 statute was amended so as to increase the number of residency districts, and thus the number of Council members, from three to five, necessarily resulting in new district boundaries.  This amendment was submitted to the Attorney General for his approval pursuant to  5 of the Voting Rights Act, and, after requesting and receiving additional information (including a copy of the 1966 statute and information concerning previous candidates, election results, and residency district boundaries), the Attorney General stated that he did not object ""to the change in question.""  Thereafter, appellants, black voters residing in the county, brought a class action in Federal District Court against appellee county officials, challenging the county's election practices on constitutional grounds.  Ultimately, after protracted litigation and after appellants had filed an amended complaint alleging that the 1966 Act had never been submitted to federal officials for approval as required by  5 of the Voting Rights Act, the District Court held that the Attorney General's request for additional information indicated that he had considered all aspects of the electoral scheme, including the changes effected in the 1966 Act, and that, since the 1971 amendment retained such changes, the lack of objection to the 1971 submission necessarily constituted approval of those changes as well, and rendered the failure to preclear the 1966 Act moot.
Held:  The Attorney General's lack of objection to the 1971 submission cannot be deemed to have the effect of ratifying the changes embodied in the 1966 Act.  Pp.  465 U. S. 243-258. 
Page 465 U. S. 237

(a) In light of the structure, purpose, history, and operation of  5 of the Voting Rights Act, a State that seeks preclearance of changes in voting procedures pursuant to  5 from the Attorney General, rather than a declaratory judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, must do so in an unambiguous and recordable manner.  The Act does not contemplate that a ""submission"" occurs when the Attorney General merely becomes aware of the legislation in question.  The Act's purposes would be subverted if the Attorney General could be deemed to have approved a voting change when the proposal was neither properly submitted nor in fact evaluated by him.  Pp.  465 U. S. 243-250.
(b) Here, the submission of the 1971 amendment to the Attorney General required him to determine whether either the change in the district boundaries or the change in the number of districts had a discriminatory purpose or effect, but would not appear to have required him to pass on whether the 1966 changes represented a setback for minority voters.  The additional information requested and received by the Attorney General does not suggest that he approved changes that he was not requested to approve, and did not enable him to ascertain whether a covered change was made by the 1966 Act, much less evaluate whether the 1966 changes were discriminatory in purpose or effect when compared to prior practices.  In order to pass on the 1966 Act, the Attorney General would have needed information concerning the pre-1966 election law and its practical effects, and he neither requested nor received such information.  Pp.  465 U. S. 250-254.
(c) When a jurisdiction adopts legislation that makes clearly defined changes in its election practices, sending that legislation to the Attorney General merely with a general request for preclearance pursuant to  5 constitutes a submission of the changes made by the enactment, and cannot be deemed a submission of changes made by previous legislation that themselves were independently subject to  5 preclearance.  A request for preclearance of certain identified changes in election practices that fails to identify other practices as new ones cannot be considered an adequate submission of the latter practices.  Here, the 1971 submission failed to inform the Attorney General that the provisions of the 1971 amendment which merely recodified various practices contained in the 1966 Act were themselves changes that might give rise to an inference of discrimination.  To the extent there was any ambiguity in the scope of the preclearance request, the structure and purpose of the preclearance requirement plainly counsel against resolving such ambiguities in favor of the submitting jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case.  Pp.  465 U. S. 256-257.

Syllabus 
Petitioners, four Philadelphia police officers, were indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiring to deprive citizens of their civil rights and for committing substantive civil rights offenses.  Prior to the return of the indictment, petitioners had retained a certain law firm to act as joint counsel, and continued the joint representation after the indictment, even though the indictment did not make the same allegations against all petitioners.  After three of the petitioners moved to sever their case from the fourth petitioner's, and after petitioners moved to dismiss the conspiracy count, the District Court granted the Government's motion to disqualify the law firm from its multiple representation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, noting that it had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1291, because the disqualification order was appealable prior to trial as a collateral order.
Held:  The disqualification order was not immediately appealable under  1291, and hence the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to review the order prior to entry of final judgment in the case.  Pp.  465 U. S. 263-270.
(a) The policy embodied in  1291, which limits the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals to appeals from ""final decisions of the district courts,"" is inimical to piecemeal appellate review of trial court decisions that do not terminate the litigation.  This policy is at its strongest in the field of criminal law.  Pp.  465 U. S. 263-265.
(b) To come within the ""collateral order"" exception to the final judgment rule, a trial court order must (1) ""conclusively determine the disputed question,"" (2) ""resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,"" and (3) ""be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.""  Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463,  437 U. S. 468.  A counsel disqualification order is not analogous to any of the three types of interlocutory orders -- orders denying motions to reduce bail or to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy or speech or debate grounds -- that this Court has found immediately appealable in criminal cases as collateral-order exceptions.  Nothing about a counsel disqualification order distinguishes it from the run of pretrial decisions that affect the rights of criminal defendants yet must await completion of trial court proceedings for review.  Such an order fails to satisfy the 
Page 465 U. S. 260
 stringent Coopers & Lybrand conditions for qualification as an immediately appealable collateral order, and the overriding policies against interlocutory review in criminal casts apply in full.  Pp.  465 U. S. 265-270.

This policy is at its strongest in the field of criminal law.  Pp.  465 U. S. 263-265.
(b) To come within the ""collateral order"" exception to the final judgment rule, a trial court order must (1) ""conclusively determine the disputed question,"" (2) ""resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,"" and (3) ""be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.""  Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463,  437 U. S. 468.  A counsel disqualification order is not analogous to any of the three types of interlocutory orders -- orders denying motions to reduce bail or to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy or speech or debate grounds -- that this Court has found immediately appealable in criminal cases as collateral-order exceptions.  Nothing about a counsel disqualification order distinguishes it from the run of pretrial decisions that affect the rights of criminal defendants yet must await completion of trial court proceedings for review.  Such an order fails to satisfy the 
Page 465 U. S. 260
 stringent Coopers & Lybrand conditions for qualification as an immediately appealable collateral order, and the overriding policies against interlocutory review in criminal casts apply in full.  Pp.  465 U. S. 265-270.

No. 82-898
Argued November 1, 1983
Decided February 21, 1984*
465 U.S. 271

Syllabus 
The Minnesota Public Employment Labor Relations Act (PELRA) authorizes state employees to bargain collectively over terms and conditions of employment.  The statute also grants professional employees, such as college faculty, the right to ""meet and confer"" with their employers on matters related to employment that are outside the scope of mandatory bargaining.  However, if professional employees forming an appropriate bargaining unit have selected an exclusive representative for mandatory bargaining, their employer may ""meet and confer"" on nonmandatory subjects only with that representative.  Appellant Minnesota State Board for Community Colleges (Board) operates the Minnesota community college system, and appellant Minnesota Community College Faculty Association (MCCFA) is the designated exclusive representative of the faculty of the State's community colleges.  On the state level, MCCFA and the Board established ""meet and confer"" committees to discuss policy questions applicable to the entire system.  On the campus level, the MCCFA chapters and the college administrations created local ""meet and confer"" committees to discuss policy questions applicable only to the campus.  Appellees, 20 Minnesota community college faculty instructors who are not members of MCCFA, filed suit in Federal District Court, challenging, inter alia, the constitutionality of MCCFA's exclusive representation of community college faculty in the ""meet and confer"" processes.  The District Court held that the ""meet and confer"" provisions of PELRA deprived appellees of their First and Fourteenth Amendment speech and associational rights by denying them an opportunity to participate in their employer's making of policy, and the court granted declaratory and injunctive relief.
Held:  The ""meet and confer"" provisions do not violate appellees' constitutional rights.  Pp.  465 U. S. 280-292.
(a) Appellees have no constitutional right, either as members of the public, as state employees, or as college instructors, to force officers of the State acting in an official policymaking capacity to listen to appellees' 
Page 465 U. S. 272
 views.  Nothing in the First Amendment or in this Court's case law interpreting it suggests that the rights to speak, associate, and petition require government policymakers to listen or respond to communications of members of the public on public issues.  Neither appellees' status as public employees nor the fact that an academic setting is involved gives them any special constitutional right to a voice in the making of policy by their employer.  Even assuming that First Amendment speech rights take on a special meaning in an academic setting, they do not require government to allow teachers to participate in institutional policymaking.  Pp.  465 U. S. 280-288.
(b) Appellees' speech and associational rights have not been infringed by PELRA's restriction of participation in ""meet and confer"" sessions to the faculty's exclusive representative.  The State has not restrained appellees' freedom to speak on any education-related issue or to associate or not to associate with whom they please, including the exclusive representative.  Nor has the State attempted to suppress ideas.  Similarly, appellees' associational freedom has not been impaired, since they are free to form whatever advocacy groups they like.  Pp.  465 U. S. 288-290.
(c) Appellees' exclusion from ""meet and confer"" sessions does not deny them equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The State has a legitimate interest in ensuring that its public employers hear one, and only one, voice presenting the majority view of its professional employees on employment-related policy questions, and permitting selection of ""meet and confer"" representatives to be made by the exclusive representative is a rational means of serving that interest.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of New York. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 
Page 465 U.S. 1038 , 1039
 
 Justice WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, and Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, Union Processing Corporation (Union), operates a scrap- metal business in Auburn, New York. Respondents, Morris, Sol, and Samuel Atkin (Atkins), are in the same business in Rochester. Both Union and Atkins purchase and process scrap metal and then sell the processed metal to steel mills and foundries. In 1974, Union and Atkins independently decided to establish metal-shredding operations in Rochester. Steel mills prefer shredded metal because shredding allows the separation of ferrous and non-ferrous scrap, yielding a cleaner grade of scrap. When Union learned that Atkins had entered into a purchase contract for a shredder, it initiated negotiations to ensure that there would be only one shredding operation in Rochester. The parties agreed that there were not enough raw materials in the area to support two shredding operations. Ultimately, they agreed that Atkins would assign the purchase contract to Union in return for 2% of Union's gross sales for the next seven years. Within two years, Union ceased making payments under the contract. 
 Atkins brought suit in October 1978 for payments due under the contract. Union argued that the contract was unenforceable because part of the consideration for the contract consisted of an oral promise by Atkins not to operate a shredder in the Rochester area. Such an agreement, Union contended, violates 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1. 
 The trial court found that the oral agreement not to compete was indeed a part of the contract. It concluded that since the agreement constituted a horizontal division of territories, it was a per se violation of the Sherman Act. 
 On appeal, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court rejected Union's contention that since the contract constituted a horizontal division of markets it was per se illegal under 1 of the Sherman Act. The court reasoned that the rule of per se illegality is applicable only if the entire geographic market is divided. It found that the relevant geographic market in this case consisted of the entire area in which steel mills purchase the end product produced by the shredder. Because only the Rochester area was allocated, the court concluded that a rule-of-reason analysis was appropriate. Using that analysis, the court found the impact of the agreement on competition to be minimal because Atkins could operate a [465 U.S. 1038 , 1040]

 February 21, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioners, representatives of the estates of individuals killed in a one-car accident in Joliet, Illinois, filed complaints in federal dis- 
Page 465 U.S. 1049 , 1050
 trict court under 42 U.S.C. 1983, contending that various county and city officials violated decedents' constitutional rights by failing to save decedents from the burning automobile. In their complaint, petitioners alleged that two minutes after the car swerved off the road and burst into flames, one of the respondents, a police officer, arrived on the scene and began directing traffic around the car. Firemen were summoned, and the fire was extinguished; yet no efforts were made to remove decedents from the car, nor was an ambulance called until some 45 minutes after the accident occurred. The complaint alleged that decedents were still alive when the fire was doused and that had adequate rescue measures been taken at the outset, decedents would have survived. 
 The District Court denied respondents' motion to dismiss the complaints for failure to state a cause of action. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, however, reversed, concluding that an attempt by state officers to assist at an accident does not result in the deprivation of a constitutional right when the attempt fails because of the negligence or gross negligence of the officers. 
 In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeals noted that ""[n]o problem so perplexes the federal courts today as determining the outer bounds of section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. 1983 . . . ."" Section 1983 actions have been brought in a variety of contexts by those injured as a result of a state official's failure to exercise adequate care in carrying out his duties. Clark v.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 21, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Justus was sentenced to death through the retroactive application of a statutory aggravating factor in violation of the Federal Constitution's prohibition against ex post facto punishments.

Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 30 ( 1981), this Court held that a change in sentencing procedures violates the Constitution's prohibition on ex post facto punishments ""if it is both retrospective and more onerous than the law in effect on the date of the offense.""

 The State's position is simply untenable. A Florida Circuit Judge relied upon Florida's new aggravating factor to sentence petitioner to death. Before 1979, the Florida death penalty statute contained no aggravating factor analogous to the one added by 1979 Fla.Laws 353. Had the new factor not been applied at petitioner's sentencing trial, the sentencing judge would have found only one aggravating factor, and it is impossible to know whether he still would have chosen to impose the death penalty. The application of the new aggravating factor made it easier for the Florida judge to sentence petitioner to death, and for that reason alone was more onerous for petitioner than the sentencing procedure in place at the date of his offense.

 February 21, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Justus was sentenced to death through the retroactive application of a statutory aggravating factor in violation of the Federal Constitution's prohibition against ex post facto punishments. U.S. Const., Art. I, 9, cl. 3; Art. I, 10, cl. 1. The murder for which petitioner was convicted occurred in 1978. In 1979, Florida added a new aggravating factor to the State's death penalty statute.

Decided January 25, 1984
465 U.S. 200

Syllabus 
In 1976, applicant was convicted in a Florida state court of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death.  The Florida Supreme Court ultimately affirmed, and this Court denied certiorari.  Applicant was also a party to an unsuccessful state court suit challenging the Florida Supreme Court's use of extra-record materials in conducting proportionality review of death sentences.  In 1982, the trial court denied applicant's motions for postconviction relief, and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed.  Applicant also sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, which denied relief.  The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed, and this Court denied certiorari.  After applicant's execution was set for January 24, 1984, his second state court application for postconviction relief was denied, and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed.  That court also denied applicant's petition for extraordinary relief.  Applicant then filed a second habeas petition in Federal District Court, which again denied relief.  The Court of Appeals held that the District Court was correct in dismissing applicant's petition on the grounds that it presented successive claims that had been previously considered, and constituted an abuse of the writ as to any ""new"" claims, since they should have been raised on the first habeas petition.  However, the Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay of execution until January 25, at 12 noon, to afford applicant an opportunity to apply to this Court for a stay of execution.  After the Court of Appeals denied a petition for rehearing, a suggestion for rehearing en banc, and an application for a stay pending rehearing, applicant filed with this Court a petition for writ of certiorari and an application for a stay of execution pending consideration of the petition.
Held:  With respect to the claims for relief that applicant presented for the first time on his second habeas petition, the District Court and the Court of Appeals properly found that presentation of the claims constituted an abuse of the writ.  As applicant had presented the claims to the state courts before the first habeas petition was filed, he cannot properly contend that the claims were unknown to him at that time.  Nor has applicant shown any basis for disagreeing with the finding of the District

 Court and the Court of Appeals that the ends of justice would not be served by reconsideration of those claims previously presented on federal habeas.  The federal and state courts carefully and repetitively have reviewed applicant's challenges to his conviction and sentence.

Syllabus 
Appellant Southland Corp. (hereafter appellant) is the owner and franchisor of 7-Eleven convenience stores.  Appellees are 7-Eleven franchisees.  Each franchise agreement between appellant and appellees contains a clause requiring arbitration of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the agreement or breach thereof.  Several of the appellees filed individual actions against appellant in California Superior Court, alleging fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the disclosure requirements of the California Franchise Investment Law.  These actions were consolidated with a subsequent class action filed by another appellee making substantially the same claims.  Appellant moved to compel arbitration of the claims pursuant to the contract.  The Superior Court granted the motion as to all claims except those based on the Franchise Investment Law, and did not pass on appellees' request for class certification.  The California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's refusal to compel arbitration of the claims under the Franchise Investment Law, construing the arbitration clause to require arbitration of such claims and holding that the Franchise Investment Law did not invalidate arbitration agreements and that, if it rendered such agreements involving commerce unenforceable, it would conflict with  2 of the United States Arbitration Act, which provides that
""a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy . . . arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, 
Page 465 U. S. 2
 save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.""
The court also directed the trial court to conduct class-certification proceedings.  The California Supreme Court reversed the ruling that claims asserted under the Franchise Investment Law are arbitrable, interpreting  31512 of that Law -- which renders void any provision purporting to bind a franchisee to waive compliance with any provision of that Law -- to require judicial consideration of claims brought under that statute and holding that the statute did not contravene the federal Act.  The court remanded the case to the trial court for consideration of appellees' request for class certification.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1257(2) to decide whether the United States Arbitration Act preempts  31512 of the California statute.  Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469.  To delay review of a state judicial decision denying enforcement of an arbitration contract until the state litigation has run its course would defeat the core purpose of the contract.  On the other hand, since it does not affirmatively appear that the request for class certification was ""drawn in question"" on federal grounds, this Court is without jurisdiction to resolve this question as a matter of federal law under  1257(2).  Pp.  465 U. S. 6-9.
2. Section 31512 of the California statute directly conflicts with  2 of the United States Arbitration Act, and hence violates the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.  465 U. S. 10-16.
(a) In enacting  2 of the federal Act, Congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims that the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.  That Act, resting on Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause, creates a body of federal substantive law that is applicable in both state and federal courts.  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., 460 U. S. 1.  To confine the Act's scope to arbitrations sought to be enforced in federal courts would frustrate what Congress intended to be a broad enactment.

No. 82-1095

Decided January 23, 1984
465 U.S. 37

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of a capital crime in a California court and was sentenced to death, and the California Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting the claim that California's capital punishment statute was invalid under the Federal Constitution because it failed to require the California Supreme Court to compare respondent's sentence with sentences imposed in similar capital cases, and thereby to determine whether they were proportionate.  After habeas corpus relief was denied by the state courts, respondent sought habeas corpus in Federal District Court, again contending that he had been denied the comparative proportionality review assertedly required by the Constitution.  The District Court denied the writ, but the Court of Appeals held that comparative proportionality review was constitutionally required.
Held:
1. There is no merit to respondent's contention that the Court of Appeals' judgment should be affirmed solely on the ground that state decisional law entitles him to comparative proportionality review.  Under 28 U.S.C.  2241, a federal court may not issue a writ of habeas corpus on the basis of a perceived error of state law.  In rejecting respondent's demand for proportionality review, the California Supreme Court did not suggest that it was in any way departing from state case law precedent.  Moreover, if respondent's claim is that, because of an evolution of state law, he would now enjoy the kind of proportionality review that has so far been denied him, the state courts should consider the matter, if they are so inclined, free of the constraints of the federal writ of habeas corpus.  Pp.  465 U. S. 41-42.
2. The Eighth Amendment does not require, as an invariable rule in every case, that a state appellate court, before it affirms a death sentence, compare the sentence in the case before it with the penalties imposed in similar cases if requested to do so by the prisoner.  Pp.  465 U. S. 44-54.
(a) This Court's cases do not require comparative proportionality review by an appellate court in every capital case.  The outcome in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (upholding Georgia's statutory scheme which required comparative proportionality review), and Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242 (upholding Florida's scheme under which the appellate court performed proportionality review despite the absence of a 
Page 465 U. S. 38

			"|"Pulley v. Harris
No. 82-1095
Argued November 7, 1983
Decided January 23, 1984
465 U.S. 37

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of a capital crime in a California court and was sentenced to death, and the California Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting the claim that California's capital punishment statute was invalid under the Federal Constitution because it failed to require the California Supreme Court to compare respondent's sentence with sentences imposed in similar capital cases, and thereby to determine whether they were proportionate.  After habeas corpus relief was denied by the state courts, respondent sought habeas corpus in Federal District Court, again contending that he had been denied the comparative proportionality review assertedly required by the Constitution.  The District Court denied the writ, but the Court of Appeals held that comparative proportionality review was constitutionally required.
Held:
1. There is no merit to respondent's contention that the Court of Appeals' judgment should be affirmed solely on the ground that state decisional law entitles him to comparative proportionality review.  Under 28 U.S.C.  2241, a federal court may not issue a writ of habeas corpus on the basis of a perceived error of state law.  In rejecting respondent's demand for proportionality review, the California Supreme Court did not suggest that it was in any way departing from state case law precedent.  Moreover, if respondent's claim is that, because of an evolution of state law, he would now enjoy the kind of proportionality review that has so far been denied him, the state courts should consider the matter, if they are so inclined, free of the constraints of the federal writ of habeas corpus.  Pp.  465 U. S. 41-42.
2. The Eighth Amendment does not require, as an invariable rule in every case, that a state appellate court, before it affirms a death sentence, compare the sentence in the case before it with the penalties imposed in similar cases if requested to do so by the prisoner.  Pp.  465 U. S. 44-54.
(a) This Court's cases do not require comparative proportionality review by an appellate court in every capital case.  The outcome in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (upholding Georgia's statutory scheme which required comparative proportionality review), and Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242 (upholding Florida's scheme under which the appellate court performed proportionality review despite the absence of a 
Page 465 U. S. 38
 statutory requirement), did not hinge on proportionality review.  That some schemes providing proportionality review are constitutional does not mean that such review is indispensable.  Moreover, Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, upheld Texas' scheme even though neither the statute nor state case law provided for comparative proportionality review.  Pp.  465 U. S. 44-51.
(b) Assuming that there could be a capital sentencing system so lacking in other checks on arbitrariness that it would not pass constitutional muster without comparative proportionality review, the California statute involved here is not of that sort.  Pp.  465 U. S. 51-54.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was employed by respondent Warren, Ohio, Board of Education (Board) as a supervisor of elementary education on an annual basis under written contracts.  The Board, at a regularly scheduled meeting, adopted a resolution renewing petitioner's employment for the 1979-1980 school year, and, upon being advised of this, petitioner accepted the appointment by letter.  But shortly thereafter, the Board, at a special meeting at which four of its five members were present, voted 3 to 1 not to renew petitioner's employment, and so notified her in writing.  Petitioner then brought suit in the Ohio Court of Common Pleas against the Board and the three members who had voted not to renew her employment.  The complaint alleged two causes of action -- a breach of contract by the Board and wrongful interference by the individual members with petitioner's employment contract.  The trial court held that petitioner's acceptance of the employment proffered for 1979-1980 created a binding contract, and that the Board's subsequent action purporting not to renew the employment had no legal effect, and awarded petitioner reinstatement and compensatory damages.  The court granted petitioner's motion to dismiss without prejudice ""the issue of conspiracy and individual board member liability,"" which issue the court had previously ""reserved and continued.""  The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed, and review was denied by the Ohio Supreme Court.  Thereafter, petitioner filed an action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 (1976 ed., Supp. V), inter alia, against the Board, its members, and the Superintendent of Schools, alleging that, because of her activities involving a desegregation plan for the Warren elementary schools and a social studies curriculum that she had prepared, the Board members determined not to renew her contract, and that the Board's actions violated her rights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments.  She requested injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the basis of res judicata, inter alia, and dismissed the complaint.  The United States Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  With respect to petitioner's  1983 claim, which was not litigated in state court, petitioner's state court judgment has the same claim preclusive 
Page 465 U. S. 76
 effect in federal court that the judgment would have in the Ohio state courts.  Pp.  465 U. S. 80-87.
(a) In the absence of federal law modifying the operation of 28 U.S.C.  1738, which provides that state judicial proceedings shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States as they have in the courts of the State from which they are taken -- the preclusive effect in federal court of petitioner's state court judgment is determined by Ohio law.  Having rejected in Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, the view that state court judgments have no issue preclusive effect in  1983 suits, this Court must also reject the view that 1983 prevents petitioner's state court judgment from creating a claim preclusive bar in this case.  Section 1738 embodies the view that it is more important to give full faith and credit to state court judgments than to ensure separate forums for federal and state claims.  Section 1983 does not override state preclusion law and guarantee petitioner a right to proceed to judgment in state court on her state claims and then turn to federal court for adjudication of her federal claims.  Pp.  465 U. S. 80-85.
(b) The case is remanded for further proceedings.  It appears that Ohio preclusion law has experienced a gradual evolution, and that Ohio courts recently have applied preclusion concepts more broadly than in the past, but the District Court's opinion does not indicate whether it applied what it thought was the Ohio law of preclusion.

465 U.S. 89

Syllabus 
Respondent Halderman, a resident of petitioner Pennhurst State School and Hospital, a Pennsylvania institution for the care of the mentally retarded, brought a class action in Federal District Court against Pennhurst, certain of its officials, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, and various state and county officials (also petitioners).  It was alleged that conditions at Pennhurst violated various federal constitutional and statutory rights of the class members as well as their rights under the Pennsylvania Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966 (MH/MR Act).  Ultimately, the District Court awarded injunctive relief based in part on the MH/MR Act, which was held to provide a right to adequate habilitation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the MH/MR Act required the State to adopt the ""least restrictive environment"" approach for the care of the mentally retarded, and rejecting petitioners' argument that the Eleventh Amendment barred a federal court from considering this pendent state law claim.  The court reasoned that, since that Amendment did not bar a federal court from granting prospective injunctive relief against state officials on the basis of federal claims, citing Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, the same result obtained with respect to a pendent state law claim.
Held:  The Eleventh Amendment prohibited the District Court from ordering state officials to conform their conduct to state law.  Pp.  465 U. S. 97-124.
(a) The principle of sovereign immunity is a constitutional limitation on the federal judicial power established in Art. III of the Constitution.  The Eleventh Amendment bars a suit against state officials when the State is the real, substantial party in interest, regardless of whether the suit seeks damages or injunctive relief.  The Court in Ex parte Young, supra, recognized an important exception to this general rule:  a suit challenging the federal constitutionality of a state official's action is not one against the State.  Pp.  465 U. S. 97-103.
(b) In Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, this Court recognized that the need to promote the supremacy of federal law that is the basis of Young must be accommodated to the constitutional immunity of the States.  Thus, the Court declined to extend the Young doctrine to 
Page 465 U. S. 90
 encompass retroactive relief, for to do so would effectively eliminate the States' constitutional immunity.  Edelman's distinction between prospective and retroactive relief fulfilled Young's underlying purpose of vindicating the supreme authority of federal law while at the same time preserving to an important degree the States' constitutional immunity.  But this need to reconcile competing interests is wholly absent when a plaintiff alleges that a state official has violated state law.  In such a case, the entire basis for the doctrine of Young and Edelman disappears.  A federal court's grant of relief against state officials on the basis of state law, whether prospective or retroactive, does not vindicate the supreme authority of federal law.  When a federal court instructs state officials on how to conform their conduct to state law, this conflicts directly with the principles of federalism that underlie the Eleventh Amendment.  Pp.  465 U. S. 103-106.
(c) The dissenters' view is that an allegation that official conduct is contrary to a state statute would suffice to override the State's protection from injunctive relief under the Eleventh Amendment because such conduct is ultra vires the official's authority.  This view rests on fiction, is wrong on the law, and would emasculate the Eleventh Amendment.  At least insofar as injunctive relief is sought, an error of law by state officers acting in their official capacity will not suffice to override the sovereign immunity of the State where the relief effectively is against it.  Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U. S. 682.  Under the dissenters' view, the ultra vires doctrine, a narrow and questionable exception, would swallow the general rule that a suit is against the State if the relief will run against it.  Pp.  465 U. S. 106-117.
(d) The principle that a claim that state officials violated state law in carrying out their official responsibilities is a claim against the State that is protected by the Eleventh Amendment applies as well to state law claims brought into federal court under pendent jurisdiction.  Pp.  465 U. S. 117-121.
(e) While it may be that applying the Eleventh Amendment to pendent state law claims results in federal claims' being brought in state court or in bifurcation of claims, such considerations of policy cannot override the constitutional limitation on the authority of the federal judiciary to adjudicate suits against a State.  Pp.  465 U. S. 121-123.
(f) The judgment below cannot be sustained on the basis of the state law obligation of petitioner county officials, since any relief granted against these officials on the basis of the MH/MR Act would be partial and incomplete, at best.  Such an ineffective enforcement of state law would not appear to serve the purposes of efficiency, convenience, and fairness that must inform the exercise of pendent jurisdiction.  Pp.  465 U.

Syllabus 
At his state robbery trial, respondent was permitted to proceed pro se, but the trial court appointed standby counsel to assist him.  Before and during the trial, respondent frequently changed his mind regarding the standby counsel's role, objecting to counsel's participation on some occasions but agreeing to it on other occasions.  Following his conviction, respondent unsuccessfully moved for a new trial on the ground that his standby counsel had unfairly interfered with his presentation of his defense.  After exhausting direct appellate and state habeas corpus review, respondent filed a habeas petition in Federal District Court, claiming that standby counsel's conduct deprived him of his right to present his own defense, as guaranteed by Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806.  The District Court denied the petition, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's Sixth Amendment right of self-representation was violated by the unsolicited participation of overzealous standby counsel.
Held:  Respondent's Sixth Amendment right to conduct his own defense was not violated, since it appears that he was allowed to make his own appearances as he saw fit, and that his standby counsel's unsolicited involvement was held within reasonable limits.  Pp.  465 U. S. 173-187.
(a) The Counsel Clause of the Sixth Amendment implies a right in the defendant to conduct his own defense, with assistance at what is his, not counsel's, trial.  Here, the record reveals that respondent was accorded the rights of a pro se defendant to control the organization and conduct of his own defense, to make motions, to argue points of law, to participate in voir dire, to question witnesses, and to address the court and the jury at appropriate points in the trial.  Pp.  465 U. S. 173-175.
(b) The objectives of affirming a pro se defendant's dignity and autonomy and of allowing the presentation of what may be his best possible defense can both be achieved without categorically silencing standby counsel.  In determining whether a defendant's Faretta rights have been respected, the primary focus must be on whether he had a fair chance to present his case in his own way.  Such rights, however, do impose limits on the extent of standby counsel's unsolicited participation.  
Page 465 U. S. 169
 First, the pro se defendant is entitled to preserve actual control over the case he chooses to present to the jury, and, second, standby counsel's participation without the defendant's consent should not be allowed to destroy the jury's perception that the defendant is representing himself.  Pp.  465 U. S. 176-179.
(c) The appearance of a pro se defendant's self-representation will not be undermined by standby counsel's participation outside the jury's presence.  In this case, most of the incidents of which respondent complains occurred when the jury was not in the courtroom, and, while some of those incidents were regrettable, counsel's participation fully satisfied the first limitation noted above.  Respondent was given ample opportunity to present his own position to the court on every matter discussed, and all conflicts between respondent and counsel were resolved in respondent's favor.  Pp.  465 U. S. 179-181.
(d) It is when standby counsel participate in the jury's presence that a defendant may legitimately claim that excessive involvement by counsel will destroy the appearance that the defendant is acting pro se.  Nevertheless, a categorical bar on counsel's participation is unnecessary.  Here, where respondent's pro se efforts were undermined primarily by his own changes of mind regarding counsel's role, it is very difficult to determine how much of counsel's participation was, in fact, contrary to respondent's desires.  If a defendant is given the opportunity and elects to have counsel appear before the court or a jury, his complaints concerning counsel's subsequent unsolicited participation lose much of their force.  Once a pro se defendant invites or agrees to any substantial participation by counsel, subsequent appearances by counsel must be presumed to be with the defendant's acquiescence, at least until the defendant expressly and unambiguously renews his request that standby counsel be silenced.  Pp.  465 U. S. 181-183.
(e) A defendant's Sixth Amendment rights are not violated when a trial judge appoints standby counsel -- even over the defendant's objection -- to relieve the judge of the need to explain and enforce basic rules of courtroom protocol or to assist the defendant in overcoming routine obstacles that stand in the way of his achievement of his own clearly indicated goals.  At respondent's trial, a significant part of standby counsel's participation involved such basic procedures, and none interfered with respondent's control over his defense or undermined his appearance before the jury in the status of a pro se defendant.  Pp.  465 U. S. 183-185.
(f) Aside from standby counsel's participation that was either approved by respondent or attendant to routine clerical or procedural matters, counsel's unsolicited comments in front of the jury were not substantial or frequent enough to have seriously undermined respondent's 
Page 465 U. S. 170
 appearance before the jury in the status of representing himself.  Pp.  465 U. S. 185-187.

At his state robbery trial, respondent was permitted to proceed pro se, but the trial court appointed standby counsel to assist him.  Before and during the trial, respondent frequently changed his mind regarding the standby counsel's role, objecting to counsel's participation on some occasions but agreeing to it on other occasions.  Following his conviction, respondent unsuccessfully moved for a new trial on the ground that his standby counsel had unfairly interfered with his presentation of his defense.  After exhausting direct appellate and state habeas corpus review, respondent filed a habeas petition in Federal District Court, claiming that standby counsel's conduct deprived him of his right to present his own defense, as guaranteed by Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806.  The District Court denied the petition, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's Sixth Amendment right of self-representation was violated by the unsolicited participation of overzealous standby counsel.
Held:  Respondent's Sixth Amendment right to conduct his own defense was not violated, since it appears that he was allowed to make his own appearances as he saw fit, and that his standby counsel's unsolicited involvement was held within reasonable limits.  Pp.  465 U. S. 173-187.
(a) The Counsel Clause of the Sixth Amendment implies a right in the defendant to conduct his own defense, with assistance at what is his, not counsel's, trial.  Here, the record reveals that respondent was accorded the rights of a pro se defendant to control the organization and conduct of his own defense, to make motions, to argue points of law, to participate in voir dire, to question witnesses, and to address the court and the jury at appropriate points in the trial.  Pp.  465 U. S. 173-175.
(b) The objectives of affirming a pro se defendant's dignity and autonomy and of allowing the presentation of what may be his best possible defense can both be achieved without categorically silencing standby counsel.  In determining whether a defendant's Faretta rights have been respected, the primary focus must be on whether he had a fair chance to present his case in his own way.  Such rights, however, do impose limits on the extent of standby counsel's unsolicited participation.  
Page 465 U. S. 169
 First, the pro se defendant is entitled to preserve actual control over the case he chooses to present to the jury, and, second, standby counsel's participation without the defendant's consent should not be allowed to destroy the jury's perception that the defendant is representing himself.  Pp.  465 U. S. 176-179.
(c) The appearance of a pro se defendant's self-representation will not be undermined by standby counsel's participation outside the jury's presence.  In this case, most of the incidents of which respondent complains occurred when the jury was not in the courtroom, and, while some of those incidents were regrettable, counsel's participation fully satisfied the first limitation noted above.  Respondent was given ample opportunity to present his own position to the court on every matter discussed, and all conflicts between respondent and counsel were resolved in respondent's favor.  Pp.  465 U. S. 179-181.
(d) It is when standby counsel participate in the jury's presence that a defendant may legitimately claim that excessive involvement by counsel will destroy the appearance that the defendant is acting pro se.  Nevertheless, a categorical bar on counsel's participation is unnecessary.  Here, where respondent's pro se efforts were undermined primarily by his own changes of mind regarding counsel's role, it is very difficult to determine how much of counsel's participation was, in fact, contrary to respondent's desires.  If a defendant is given the opportunity and elects to have counsel appear before the court or a jury, his complaints concerning counsel's subsequent unsolicited participation lose much of their force.  Once a pro se defendant invites or agrees to any substantial participation by counsel, subsequent appearances by counsel must be presumed to be with the defendant's acquiescence, at least until the defendant expressly and unambiguously renews his request that standby counsel be silenced.  Pp.  465 U. S. 181-183.
(e) A defendant's Sixth Amendment rights are not violated when a trial judge appoints standby counsel -- even over the defendant's objection -- to relieve the judge of the need to explain and enforce basic rules of courtroom protocol or to assist the defendant in overcoming routine obstacles that stand in the way of his achievement of his own clearly indicated goals.  At respondent's trial, a significant part of standby counsel's participation involved such basic procedures, and none interfered with respondent's control over his defense or undermined his appearance before the jury in the status of a pro se defendant.  Pp.  465 U. S. 183-185.
(f) Aside from standby counsel's participation that was either approved by respondent or attendant to routine clerical or procedural matters, counsel's unsolicited comments in front of the jury were not substantial or frequent enough to have seriously undermined respondent's 
Page 465 U. S. 170
 appearance before the jury in the status of representing himself.  Pp.  465 U. S. 185-187.

Syllabus 
Before the voir dire examination of prospective jurors began at a trial in California Superior Court for the rape and murder of a teenage girl, petitioner moved that the voir dire be open to the public and the press.  The State opposed the motion, arguing that, if the press were present, juror responses would lack the candor necessary to assure a fair trial.  The trial judge agreed and permitted petitioner to attend the ""general"" but not the ""individual"" voir dire proceedings.  All but approximately three days of the 6-week voir dire was thus closed to the public.  After the jury was empaneled, petitioner moved for release of the complete transcript of the voir dire proceedings, but both defense counsel and the prosecutor argued that release of the transcript would violate the jurors' right to privacy.  The court denied the motion and, after the defendant had been convicted and sentenced to death, denied petitioner's second application for release of the voir dire transcript. Petitioner then sought in the California Court of Appeal a writ of mandate to compel the trial court to release the transcript and vacate the order closing the voir dire proceedings.  The petition was denied, and the California Supreme Court denied petitioner's request for a hearing.
Held:
1. The guarantees of open public proceedings in criminal trials cover proceedings for the voir dire examination of potential jurors.  Pp.  464 U. S. 505-510.
(a) The historical evidence reveals that the process of selection of jurors has presumptively been a public process with exceptions only for good cause shown.  The presumptive openness of the jury selection process in England carried over into proceedings in colonial America, and public jury selection was the common practice in America when the Constitution was adopted.  Pp.  464 U. S. 505-508.
(b) Openness enhances both the basic fairness of the criminal trial and the appearance of fairness so essential to public confidence in the criminal justice system.  Public proceedings vindicate the concerns of the victims and the community in knowing that offenders are being brought to account for their criminal conduct by jurors fairly and openly selected.  Closed proceedings, although not absolutely precluded, must be rare, and only for cause shown that outweighs the value of openness.  
Page 464 U. S. 502
 The presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  Pp.  464 U. S. 508-510.
2. The presumption of openness has not been rebutted in this case.  There were no findings to support the trial court's conclusion that an open proceeding would threaten the defendant's right to a fair trial and the prospective jurors' interests in privacy.  Even with findings adequate to support closure, the court's orders denying access to the voir dire transcript failed to consider whether alternatives were available to protect the prospective jurors' interests.  To preserve fairness and at the same time protect legitimate privacy, a trial judge should inform the prospective jurors, once the general nature of sensitive questions is made known to them, that those individuals believing public questioning will prove damaging because of embarrassment may properly request an opportunity to present the problem to the judge in camera but with counsel present and on the record.  When limited closure is ordered, the constitutional values sought to be protected by holding open proceedings may be satisfied later by making a transcript of the closed proceedings available within a reasonable time, if the judge determines that disclosure can be accomplished while safeguarding the juror's valid privacy interests.  Even then a valid privacy interest may rise to a level that part of the transcript should be sealed, or the name of a juror withheld, to protect the person from embarrassment.  Pp.  464 U.

No. 82-1200
Argued November 7, 1983
Decided January 18, 1984
464 U.S. 523

Syllabus 
Respondent, a shareholder of petitioner Daily Income Fund, Inc. (Fund), an open-end diversified management investment company regulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Act), filed suit in Federal District Court against both the Fund and petitioner Reich & Tang, Inc. (R&T), which provides the Fund with investment advice and management services.  Respondent alleged that fees paid to R&T by the Fund were unreasonable, in violation of  36(b) of the Act, which imposes a fiduciary duty on an investment company's adviser ""with respect to the receipt of compensation for services"" paid by the company and provides that
""[a]n action may be brought under this subsection by the [Securities and Exchange] Commission, or by a security holder of such registered investment company on behalf of such company""
against the adviser and other affiliated parties.  The complaint sought damages in favor of the Fund as well as payment of respondent's costs, expenses, and attorney's fees.  The District Court dismissed the suit, finding that  36(b) actions are subject to the ""demand requirement"" of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1 -- which governs
""a derivative action brought by one or more shareholders . . . to enforce a right of a corporation [when] the corporation [has] failed to enforce a right which may properly be asserted by it""
and requires a shareholder bringing such a suit to allege his efforts, if any, to obtain the desired action from the directors and the reasons for his failure to obtain or request such action -- and that respondent had not complied with the Rule.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Rule 23.1 does not apply to an action brought by an investment company shareholder under  36(b), and thus the plaintiff in such a case need not first make a demand upon the company's directors before bringing suit.  Pp.  464 U. S. 527-542.
(a) The term ""derivative action,"" which defines the scope of Rule 23.1, applies only to those actions in which the right claimed by the shareholder is one the corporation itself could have enforced in court.   This interpretation of the Rule is consistent with earlier decisions (e.g., Hawes v. Oakland, 104 U. S. 450, from which the Rule's provisions were derived), and is supported by its purpose of preventing shareholders from improperly suing in place of a corporation.  Pp.  464 U. S. 527-534. 
Page 464 U. S. 524

(b) The right asserted by a shareholder suing under  36(b) cannot be judicially enforced by the investment company.  Instead of establishing a corporate action from which a shareholder's right to sue derivatively may be inferred,  36(b) expressly provides only that the new corporate right it creates may be enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission and security holders of the company.  Moreover, an investment company does not have an implied right of action under  36(b).  Consideration of pertinent factors -- the statute's legislative history and purposes, the identity of the class for whose particular benefit the statute was passed, the existence of express statutory remedies adequate to serve the legislative purpose, and the traditional role of the States in affording the relief claimed -- plainly demonstrates that Congress intended the unique right created by  36(b) to be enforced solely by the Commission and security holders of the investment company.

Syllabus 
Respondent parents and son sued petitioner in Federal District Court to recover damages sustained by the son when his feet came in contact with the blades of a riding lawnmower manufactured by petitioner.  After a trial that extended over a 3-week period, the District Court entered judgment for petitioner upon a jury verdict and denied respondents' motion for a new trial.  One of the grounds alleged for a new trial was that the District Court had erred in denying respondents' motion to approach the jury after the judgment was entered because one of the jurors had not responded to a question on voir dire seeking to elicit information about previous ""injuries . . . that resulted in any disability or prolonged pain or suffering"" to members of the juror's immediate family when, in fact, the juror's son had sustained a broken leg as a result of an exploding tire.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the juror's failure to respond affirmatively to the question on voir dire had prejudiced respondents' right of peremptory challenge.
Held:  Respondents are not entitled to a new trial unless the juror's failure to disclose denied them their right to an impartial jury.  Courts should exercise judgment in preference to the automatic reversal for ""error"" and ignore errors that do not affect the essential fairness of a trial.  To invalidate the result of a 3-week trial because of a juror's mistaken, though honest, response to a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.  It ill-serves the important end of finality to wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the peremptory challenge process because counsel lacked an item of information that he should have obtained from a juror on voir dire examination.  The Court of Appeals' standard is contrary to the practical necessities of judicial management reflected in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 61 and the harmless error statute, 28 U.S.C.  2111.  To obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.

|464 u.s. 386|"Badaracco v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
No. 82-1453
Argued November 28, 1983
Decided January 17, 1984*
464 U.S. 386

Syllabus 
Section 6501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 establishes a general 3-year period of limitations ""after the return was filed"" for the assessment of federal income taxes.  However,  6501(c)(1) provides that, when there is ""a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade tax,"" the tax then may be assessed ""at any time.""  In No. 82-1453, petitioners conceded, for purposes of this litigation, that they had filed fraudulent partnership and individual income tax returns for the years 1965-1969.  However, in 1971, they filed nonfraudulent amended returns and paid the additional basic taxes shown thereon.  In 1977, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued notices of deficiency, asserting liability under  6653(b) of the Code for the addition to tax on account of fraud of 50% of the underpayment in the basic tax.  Petitioners sought redetermination in the United States Tax Court of the asserted deficiencies, contending that  6501(c)(1) did not apply because of the filing of the nonfraudulent amended returns, and that the Commissioner's action was barred by  6501(a) because the deficiency notices were issued more than three years from the date of filing of the amended returns.  The Tax Court agreed with petitioners.  In No. 82-1509, petitioner filed timely corporation income tax returns for the years 1967 and 1968, but, in 1973, it filed amended returns disclosing certain receipts that had not been reported on the original returns.  In 1979, the Commissioner issued a notice asserting deficiencies in tax and additions under  6653(b) for 1967 and 1968.  Petitioner paid the alleged deficiencies and brought suit for refund in Federal District Court, which granted summary judgment for petitioner on the ground that the Commissioner's action was barred by  6501(a), regardless of whether the original returns were fraudulent.  The Court of Appeals, consolidating the appeals, reversed in both cases.
Held:  Where a taxpayer files a false or fraudulent return but later files a nonfraudulent amended return,  6501(c)(1) applies and a tax may be assessed ""at any time,"" regardless of whether more than three years have expired since the filing of the amended return.  Pp.  464 U. S. 391-401. 
Page 464 U. S. 387

(a) The plain and unambiguous language of  6501(c)(1) permits the Commissioner to assess ""at any time"" the tax for a year in which the taxpayer has filed ""a false or fraudulent return,"" despite any subsequent disclosure the taxpayer might make.  Nothing is present in the statute that can be construed to suspend its operation as a consequence of a fraudulent filer's subsequent repentant conduct.  Neither is there anything in the wording of  6501(a) that itself enables a taxpayer to reinstate the section's general 3-year limitations period by filing an amended return.  Moreover, the substantive operation of the fraud provisions of the Code itself confirms the conclusion that  6501(c)(1) permits assessment at any time in fraud cases regardless of a taxpayer's later repentance.

(c) There is no need to twist  6501(c)(1) beyond the contours of its plain and unambiguous language in order to comport with good policy, for its literal language is supported by substantial policy considerations -- the increased difficulty in investigating fraud cases as opposed to cases marked for routine audits; the fact that the filing of a document styled ""amended return"" does not fundamentally change the nature of a tax fraud investigation; and the compounding of the difficulties that attend a civil fraud investigation where the Commissioner's initial findings lead him to conclude that the case should be referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.  Pp.  464 U. S. 397-400.
(d) Petitioners' argument that a literal reading of  6501(c) would elevate one form of tax fraud over another because it produces a disparity in treatment between a taxpayer who in the first instance files a fraudulent return and one who fraudulently fails to file any return at all, cannot prevail.  Section 6501(c)(3) -- which provides that, in a case of failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed ""at any time"" -- has been construed as ceasing to apply once a return has been filed for a particular year, regardless of whether that return is filed late and even though the failure to file a timely return in the first instance was due to fraud.  However, the language employed in the respective subsections of  6501 establishes that Congress intended different limitations results under  6501(c)(1).  Pp.  464 U. S. 400-401.

			"|"Badaracco v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
No. 82-1453
Argued November 28, 1983
Decided January 17, 1984*
464 U.S. 386

Syllabus 
Section 6501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 establishes a general 3-year period of limitations ""after the return was filed"" for the assessment of federal income taxes.  However,  6501(c)(1) provides that, when there is ""a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade tax,"" the tax then may be assessed ""at any time.""  In No. 82-1453, petitioners conceded, for purposes of this litigation, that they had filed fraudulent partnership and individual income tax returns for the years 1965-1969.  However, in 1971, they filed nonfraudulent amended returns and paid the additional basic taxes shown thereon.  In 1977, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued notices of deficiency, asserting liability under  6653(b) of the Code for the addition to tax on account of fraud of 50% of the underpayment in the basic tax.  Petitioners sought redetermination in the United States Tax Court of the asserted deficiencies, contending that  6501(c)(1) did not apply because of the filing of the nonfraudulent amended returns, and that the Commissioner's action was barred by  6501(a) because the deficiency notices were issued more than three years from the date of filing of the amended returns.  The Tax Court agreed with petitioners.  In No. 82-1509, petitioner filed timely corporation income tax returns for the years 1967 and 1968, but, in 1973, it filed amended returns disclosing certain receipts that had not been reported on the original returns.  In 1979, the Commissioner issued a notice asserting deficiencies in tax and additions under  6653(b) for 1967 and 1968.  Petitioner paid the alleged deficiencies and brought suit for refund in Federal District Court, which granted summary judgment for petitioner on the ground that the Commissioner's action was barred by  6501(a), regardless of whether the original returns were fraudulent.  The Court of Appeals, consolidating the appeals, reversed in both cases.
Held:  Where a taxpayer files a false or fraudulent return but later files a nonfraudulent amended return,  6501(c)(1) applies and a tax may be assessed ""at any time,"" regardless of whether more than three years have expired since the filing of the amended return.  Pp.  464 U. S. 391-401. 
Page 464 U. S. 387

(a) The plain and unambiguous language of  6501(c)(1) permits the Commissioner to assess ""at any time"" the tax for a year in which the taxpayer has filed ""a false or fraudulent return,"" despite any subsequent disclosure the taxpayer might make.  Nothing is present in the statute that can be construed to suspend its operation as a consequence of a fraudulent filer's subsequent repentant conduct.  Neither is there anything in the wording of  6501(a) that itself enables a taxpayer to reinstate the section's general 3-year limitations period by filing an amended return.  Moreover, the substantive operation of the fraud provisions of the Code itself confirms the conclusion that  6501(c)(1) permits assessment at any time in fraud cases regardless of a taxpayer's later repentance.  Pp.  464 U. S. 391-396.
(b) Nothing in the statutory language, the structure of the Code, or the decided cases supports petitioners' contention that a fraudulent return is a ""nullity"" for statute of limitations purposes, and that therefore the amended return is necessarily ""the return"" referred to in  6501(a).  Pp.  464 U. S. 396-397.
(c) There is no need to twist  6501(c)(1) beyond the contours of its plain and unambiguous language in order to comport with good policy, for its literal language is supported by substantial policy considerations -- the increased difficulty in investigating fraud cases as opposed to cases marked for routine audits; the fact that the filing of a document styled ""amended return"" does not fundamentally change the nature of a tax fraud investigation; and the compounding of the difficulties that attend a civil fraud investigation where the Commissioner's initial findings lead him to conclude that the case should be referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.  Pp.  464 U. S. 397-400.
(d) Petitioners' argument that a literal reading of  6501(c) would elevate one form of tax fraud over another because it produces a disparity in treatment between a taxpayer who in the first instance files a fraudulent return and one who fraudulently fails to file any return at all, cannot prevail.  Section 6501(c)(3) -- which provides that, in a case of failure to file a return, the tax may be assessed ""at any time"" -- has been construed as ceasing to apply once a return has been filed for a particular year, regardless of whether that return is filed late and even though the failure to file a timely return in the first instance was due to fraud.  However, the language employed in the respective subsections of  6501 establishes that Congress intended different limitations results under  6501(c)(1).  Pp.  464 U. S. 400-401.

Syllabus 
The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) is authorized by  11(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to investigate and gather data regarding wages, hours, and other conditions of employment to determine whether an employer is violating the Act, and by  9 to subpoena witnesses and documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation.  Pursuant to these provisions, a Department of Labor official, upon entering appellee motel and restaurant, served an administrative subpoena duces tecum on one of appellee's employees, directing the employee to appear at the regional Wage and Hour Office with certain payroll and sales records.  Appellee refused to comply with the subpoena and sought declaratory and injunctive relief in Federal District Court, claiming that the subpoena constituted an unlawful search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The District Court held that, although the Secretary had complied with the applicable FLSA provisions in issuing the subpoena, enforcement of the subpoena would violate the Fourth Amendment because the Secretary had not previously obtained a judicial warrant.
Held:  The subpoena duces tecum did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U. S. 186, controlling.  An entry into the public lobby of a motel and restaurant for the purpose of serving an administrative subpoena is not the sort of governmental act that is forbidden by that Amendment.  Here, the subpoena itself did not authorize either entry or inspection of appellee's premises, but merely directed appellee to produce certain wage and hour records, and no nonconsensual entry into areas not open to the public was made.

Syllabus 
Petitioner Sony Corp. manufactures home videotape recorders (VTR's), and markets them through retail establishments, some of which are also petitioners.  Respondents own the copyrights on some of the television programs that are broadcast on the public airwaves.  Respondents brought an action against petitioners in Federal District Court, alleging that VTR consumers had been recording some of respondents' copyrighted works that had been exhibited on commercially sponsored television, and thereby infringed respondents' copyrights, and further that petitioners were liable for such copyright infringement because of their marketing of the VTR's.  Respondents sought money damages, an equitable accounting of profits, and an injunction against the manufacture and marketing of the VTR's.  The District Court denied respondents all relief, holding that noncommercial home use recording of material broadcast over the public airwaves was a fair use of copyrighted works, and did not constitute copyright infringement, and that petitioners could not be held liable as contributory infringers even if the home use of a VTR was considered an infringing use.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding petitioners liable for contributory infringement and ordering the District Court to fashion appropriate relief
Held:  The sale of the VTR's to the general public does not constitute contributory infringement of respondents' copyrights.  Pp.  464 U. S. 428-456.
(a) The protection given to copyrights is wholly statutory, and, in a case like this, in which Congress has not plainly marked the course to be followed by the judiciary, this Court must be circumspect in construing the scope of rights created by a statute that never contemplated such a calculus of interests.  Any individual may reproduce a copyrighted work for a ""fair use""; the copyright owner does not possess the exclusive right to such a use.  Pp.  464 U. S. 428-434.
(b) Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U. S. 55, does not support respondents' novel theory that supplying the ""means"" to accomplish an infringing activity and encouraging that activity through advertisement are sufficient to establish liability for copyright infringement.  This case does not fall in the category of those in which it is manifestly just to 
Page 464 U. S. 418
 impose vicarious liability because the ""contributory"" infringer was in a position to control the use of copyrighted works by others and had authorized the use without permission from the copyright owner.  Here, the only contact between petitioners and the users of the VTR's occurred at the moment of sale.  And there is no precedent for imposing vicarious liability on the theory that petitioners sold the VTR's with constructive knowledge that their customers might use the equipment to make unauthorized copies of copyrighted material.  The sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes, or, indeed, is merely capable of substantial noninfringing uses.  Pp.  464 U. S. 434-442.
(c) The record and the District Court's findings show (1) that there is a significant likelihood that substantial numbers of copyright holders who license their works for broadcast on free television would not object to having their broadcast time-shifted by private viewers (i.e., recorded at a time when the VTR owner cannot view the broadcast so that it can be watched at a later time); and (2) that there is no likelihood that time-shifting would cause nonminimal harm to the potential market for, or the value of, respondents' copyrighted works.  The VTR's are therefore capable of substantial noninfringing uses.  Private, noncommercial time-shifting in the home satisfies this standard of noninfringing uses both because respondents have no right to prevent other copyright holders from authorizing such time-shifting for their programs and because the District Court's findings reveal that even the unauthorized home time-shifting of respondents' programs is legitimate fair use.

Syllabus 
Appellant's decedent, a laboratory analyst at a federally licensed nuclear plant in Oklahoma operated by appellee Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corp. (hereafter appellee), was contaminated by plutonium.  Subsequently, after the decedent was killed in an unrelated automobile accident, appellant, as administrator of the decedent's estate, brought a diversity action in Federal District Court based on common law tort principles under Oklahoma law to recover for the contamination injuries to the decedent's person and property.  The jury returned a verdict in appellant's favor, awarding, in addition to actual damages, punitive damages as authorized by Oklahoma law.  The Court of Appeals, inter alia, reversed as to the punitive damages award on the ground that such damages were preempted by federal law.
Held:
1. The appeal is not within this Court's appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1254(2).  The Court of Appeals held that, because of the preemptive effect of federal law, punitive damages could not be awarded.  It did not purport to rule on the constitutionality of the Oklahoma punitive damages statute, which was left untouched.  The decision, however, is reviewable by writ of certiorari.  Pp.  464 U. S. 246-248.
2. The award of punitive damages is not preempted by federal law.  Pp.  464 U. S. 248-258.
(a) The federal preemption of state regulation of the safety aspects of nuclear energy, see Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, does not extend to the state-authorized award of punitive damages for conduct related to radiation hazards.  There is ample evidence that Congress had no intention, when it enacted and later amended the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, of forbidding the States to provide remedies for those suffering injuries from radiation in a nuclear plant.  Nor is appellee able to point to anything in the legislative history of the Price-Anderson Act -- which established an indemnification scheme for operators of nuclear facilities -- or in the implementing regulations that indicates that punitive damages were not to be allowed.  Rather, it is clear 
Page 464 U. S. 239
 that, in enacting and amending the Price-Anderson Act, Congress assumed that state law remedies were available to those injured by nuclear incidents, even though Congress was aware of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's exclusive authority to regulate safety matters.  Insofar as damages for radiation injuries are concerned, preemption should not be judged on the basis that the Federal Government has so completely occupied the field of safety that state remedies are foreclosed, but on whether there is an irreconcilable conflict between the federal and state standards or whether the imposition of a state standard in a damages action would frustrate the objectives of the federal law.  Pp.  464 U. S. 249-256.
(b) The award of punitive damages in this case does not conflict with the federal remedial scheme under which the NRC is authorized to impose civil penalties on licensees for violation of federal standards.  Paying both federal fines and state-imposed punitive damages for the same incident is not physically impossible, nor does exposure to punitive damages frustrate any purpose of the federal remedial scheme.  The award of punitive damages does not hinder the purpose of 42 U.S.C.  2013(d) ""to encourage widespread participation in the development and utilization of atomic energy for peaceful purposes,"" since Congress disclaimed any interest in accomplishing this purpose by means that fail to provide adequate remedies to those injured by exposure to hazardous nuclear materials.  Finally, the punitive damages award does not conflict with Congress' intent to preclude dual regulation of radiation hazards, since, as indicated above, Congress did not believe that it was inconsistent to vest the NRC with exclusive regulatory authority over the safety aspects of nuclear development while at the same time allowing plaintiffs like appellant to recover for injuries caused by nuclear hazards.

Syllabus 
Respondents' private residence was damaged by an early morning fire while they were out of town.  Firefighters extinguished the blaze at 7:04 a.m., at which time all fire officials and police left the premises.  Five hours later, a team of arson investigators arrived at the residence for the first time to investigate the cause of the blaze.  They found a work crew on the scene boarding up the house and pumping water out of the basement.  The investigators learned that respondents had been notified of the fire and had instructed their insurance agent to send the crew to secure the house.  Nevertheless, the investigators entered the residence and conducted an extensive search without obtaining either consent or an administrative warrant.  Their search began in the basement, where they found two Coleman fuel cans and a crock pot attached to an electrical timer.  The investigators determined that the fire had been caused by the crock pot and timer and had been set deliberately.  After seizing and marking the evidence found in the basement, the investigators extended their search to the upper portions of the house, where they found additional evidence of arson.  Respondents were charged with arson and moved to suppress all the evidence seized in the warrantless search on the ground that it was obtained in violation of their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Michigan trial court denied the motion on the ground that exigent circumstances justified the search.  On interlocutory appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals found that no exigent circumstances existed, and reversed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded that, where reasonable expectations of privacy remain in fire-damaged premises, administrative searches into the cause and origin of a fire are subject to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment absent consent or exigent circumstances.  There are especially strong expectations of privacy in a private residence, and respondents here retained significant privacy interests in their fire-damaged home.  Because the warrantless search of the basement and upper areas of respondents' home was authorized neither by consent nor by exigent circumstances, the evidence seized in that search was obtained in violation of respondents' rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and must be suppressed.  Pp.  464 U. S. 291-299.

(a) Where a warrant is necessary to search fire-damaged premises, an administrative warrant suffices if the primary object of the search is to determine the cause and origin of the fire, but a criminal search warrant, obtained upon a showing of probable cause, is required if the primary object of the search is to gather evidence of criminal activity.  Pp. 464 U. S. 291-295.
(b) The search here was not a continuation of an earlier search, and the privacy interests in the residence made the delay between the fire and the midday search unreasonable absent a warrant, consent, or exigent circumstances.  Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S. 499, distinguished.  Because the cause of the fire was known upon search of the basement, the search of the upper portions of the house could only have been a search to gather evidence of arson requiring a criminal warrant absent exigent circumstances.  Even if the basement search had been a valid administrative search, it would not have justified the upstairs search, since, as soon as it had been determined that the fire originated in the basement, the scope of the search was limited to the basement area.  Pp.  464 U. S. 296-298.
JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that the search of respondents' home was unreasonable, in contravention of the Fourth Amendment, because the investigators made no effort to provide fair advance notice of the inspection to respondents.  A nonexigent, forceful, warrantless entry cannot be reasonable unless the investigator has made some effort to give the owner sufficient notice to be present while the investigation is made.

Syllabus 
Section 307(c)(1) of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) provides that
""[e]ach Federal agency conducting or supporting activities directly affecting the coastal zone shall conduct or support those activities in a manner which is, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with approved state management programs.""
CZMA defines the ""coastal zone"" to include state but not federal land near the shorelines of the several coastal States, as well as coastal waters extending ""seaward to the outer limit of the United States territorial sea.""  The territorial sea for the States bordering on the Pacific Ocean or Atlantic Ocean extends three geographical miles seaward from the coastline.  Submerged lands subject to the jurisdiction of the United States that lie beyond the territorial sea constitute the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  By virtue of the Submerged Lands Act, the coastal zone belongs to the States, while the OCS belongs to the Federal Government.  In these cases, the Department of the Interior (Interior), rejecting California's demands that a consistency review was required under  307(c)(1), sold oil and gas leases of certain tracts on the OCS off the coast of California.  California and other interested parties then filed suits in Federal District Court to enjoin the sale of some of the tracts, alleging that Interior had violated  307(c)(1) in that leasing sets in motion a chain of events that culminates in oil and gas development and therefore ""directly affects"" the coastal zone within the meaning of  307(c)(1).  The District Court entered a summary judgment for the plaintiffs, holding that a consistency determination was required before the sale.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Interior's sale of OCS oil and gas leases is not an activity ""directly affecting"" the coastal zone within the meaning of  307(c)(1), and thus a consistency review is not required under that section before such sales are made.  Pp.  464 U. S. 320-343. 
Page 464 U. S. 313

(a) CZMA nowhere defines or explains which federal activity should be viewed as ""directly affecting"" the coastal zone, but the legislative history of  307(c)(1) discloses that Congress did not intend the section to reach OCS lease sales.  The ""directly affecting"" language was aimed primarily at activities conducted or supported by federal agencies on federal lands physically situated in the coastal zone but excluded from the zone as formally defined by CZMA.  This reading of  307(c)(1) finds further support in the history of other sections of CZMA.  Pp.  464 U. S. 321-330.
(b) Nor is a broader reading of  307(c)(1) compelled by the thrust of other CZMA provisions.  It is clear that Congress believed that CZMA's purposes could be adequately effectuated without reaching federal activities conducted outside the coastal zone.  Moreover, an examination of  307's structure suggests that lease sales are a type of federal agency activity not intended to be covered by  307(c)(1).  Section 307(c)(3), which deals with private parties' activities authorized by a federal agency's issuance of licenses and permits, is the provision that is more pertinent to OCS lease sales, and that provision definitely does not require consistency review of such sales.  Pp.  464 U. S. 331-335.
(c) Congress has carefully codified the fine distinction between a sale of a ""lease"" and the issuance of a permit to ""explore for,"" ""produce,"" or ""develop"" oil or gas.  By the time the leases in question here were sold, it was clear that a lease sale by Interior did not involve the submission or approval of ""any plan for the exploration or development of, or production from"" the lease tracts.  Since 1978, when the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (OCSLA) was amended, there have been four statutory stages to developing an offshore oil well:  (1) preparation of a leasing program, (2) lease sales (the stage in dispute here), (3) exploration by the lessees, and (4) development and production.  The purchase of an OCS lease, standing alone, entails no right to explore for, develop, or produce oil or gas resources on the OCS.  The first two stages are not subject to consistency review, but the last two stages are.  Under OCSLA's plain language, the purchase of a lease entails no right to proceed with full exploration, development, or production that might trigger  307(c)(3)(B)'s consistency review provisions; the lessee acquires only a priority in submitting plans to conduct those activities.  Pp.  464 U. S. 335-341.
(d) Even if OCS lease sales are viewed as involving an activity ""conduct[ed]"" or ""support[ed]"" by a federal agency within the meaning of  307(c)(1), lease sales cannot be characterized as ""directly affecting"" the coastal zone.  Since 1978, the sale of a lease grants the lessee the right to conduct only very limited ""preliminary activities"" on the OCS, and does not authorize full-scale exploration, development, or production.  
Page 464 U. S. 314
 Those activities may not begin until separate federal approval has been obtained.  In these circumstances, the possible effects on the coastal zone that may eventually result from the sale of a lease cannot be termed ""direct.""  Pp.  464 U. S. 342-343.

Respondent, a Filipino national, filed a petition for naturalization under the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended, asserting that he had been denied due process of law by the Government's administration of the Act with regard to the naturalization in the Philippines in 1945 and 1946 of noncitizens who had served in the Armed Forces of the United States during World War II.  The naturalization examiner recommended denial of the petition, but the Federal District Court granted the petition without reaching the merits of respondent's constitutional claim.  The court held that the Government was collaterally estopped from litigating the constitutional issue because of an earlier, unappealed Federal District Court decision against the Government in a case brought by other Filipino nationals.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The United States may not be collaterally estopped on an issue such as the one involved here, adjudicated against it in an earlier lawsuit brought by a different party.  Pp.  464 U. S. 158-164.
(a) Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision is conclusive in a subsequent suit based on a different cause of action involving a party to the prior litigation.  However, the doctrine of nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel, under which a nonparty to a prior lawsuit may make ""offensive"" use of collateral estoppel against a party to the prior suit, is limited to private litigants, and does not apply against the Government.  Pp.  464 U. S. 158-159.
(b) The Government is not in a position identical to that of a private litigant, both because of the geographic breadth of Government litigation and also, most importantly, because of the nature of the issues the Government litigates, frequently involving legal questions of substantial public importance.  A rule allowing nonmutual collateral estoppel against the Government would substantially thwart the development of important questions of law by freezing the first final decision rendered on a particular legal issue, and would require substantial revision of the Solicitor General's policy for determining when to appeal an adverse decision, a policy that involves consideration of a variety of factors, such as the Government's limited resources and the crowded court dockets.  Pp.  464 U. S. 159-162. 
Page 464 U. S. 155

(c) The conduct of Government litigation in the federal courts is sufficiently different from the conduct of private civil litigation in those courts so that what might otherwise be economy interests underlying a broad application of nonmutual collateral estoppel are outweighed by the constraints which peculiarly affect the Government.

Syllabus 
When officials of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the State of Tennessee, accompanied by employees of a private firm under contract to EPA, attempted to inspect one of respondent's Tennessee plants, respondent refused entry to the private contractors unless they would sign an agreement not to disclose trade secrets.  The private contractors refused to do so, and EPA later obtained an administrative warrant authorizing the private employees to conduct the inspection.  After respondent refused to honor the warrant, the Government began a civil contempt proceeding against respondent in Federal District Court in Tennessee, and respondent moved to quash the warrant on the ground that private contractors are not ""authorized representatives"" under  114(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act for the purposes of conducting inspections of premises subject to regulation under the Act.  The court denied respondent's motion, and on appeal respondent reiterated its statutory argument and also asserted that the Government should be collaterally estopped from asserting that  114(a)(2) authorizes private contractors to conduct inspections, because of a contrary decision of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in a case involving the same parties which arose from respondent's similar refusal to allow private contractors, accompanying EPA and Wyoming officials, to enter and inspect one of respondent's Wyoming plants.  The Court of Appeals in the present case reversed the District Court, agreeing with respondent both on the merits of the statutory issue and, alternatively, on the collateral estoppel issue.
Held:  The doctrine of mutual defensive collateral estoppel is applicable against the Government to preclude relitigation of the same issue already litigated against the same party in another case involving virtually identical facts.  Cf. Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147.  Pp.  464 U. S. 169-174.
(a) The doctrine of collateral estoppel generally applies to preclude relitigation of both issues of law and issues of fact if those issues were conclusively determined in a prior action involving the same parties.  The exception to the applicability of the principles of collateral estoppel for ""unmixed questions of law"" arising in ""successive actions involving unrelated subject matter,"" Montana v. United States, supra, at  440 U. S. 162, does not apply here.  Whatever the purpose or extent of the exception, 
Page 464 U. S. 166
 there is no reason to apply it here to allow the Government to litigate twice with the same party an issue arising in both cases from virtually identical facts.  Pp.  464 U. S. 169-172.
(b) Nor is an exception to the doctrine of mutual defensive estoppel justified here on the asserted ground that its application in Government litigation involving recurring issues of public importance will freeze the development of the law.  That argument is persuasive only to prevent the application of collateral estoppel against the Government in the absence of mutuality.  While the Sixth Circuit's decision prevents EPA from relitigating the  114(a)(2) issue with respondent, it still leaves EPA free to litigate the same issue in the future with other litigants.  Pp.  464 U. S. 173-174.

When officials of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the State of Tennessee, accompanied by employees of a private firm under contract to EPA, attempted to inspect one of respondent's Tennessee plants, respondent refused entry to the private contractors unless they would sign an agreement not to disclose trade secrets.  The private contractors refused to do so, and EPA later obtained an administrative warrant authorizing the private employees to conduct the inspection.  After respondent refused to honor the warrant, the Government began a civil contempt proceeding against respondent in Federal District Court in Tennessee, and respondent moved to quash the warrant on the ground that private contractors are not ""authorized representatives"" under  114(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act for the purposes of conducting inspections of premises subject to regulation under the Act.  The court denied respondent's motion, and on appeal respondent reiterated its statutory argument and also asserted that the Government should be collaterally estopped from asserting that  114(a)(2) authorizes private contractors to conduct inspections, because of a contrary decision of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in a case involving the same parties which arose from respondent's similar refusal to allow private contractors, accompanying EPA and Wyoming officials, to enter and inspect one of respondent's Wyoming plants.  The Court of Appeals in the present case reversed the District Court, agreeing with respondent both on the merits of the statutory issue and, alternatively, on the collateral estoppel issue.
Held:  The doctrine of mutual defensive collateral estoppel is applicable against the Government to preclude relitigation of the same issue already litigated against the same party in another case involving virtually identical facts.  Cf. Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147.  Pp.  464 U. S. 169-174.
(a) The doctrine of collateral estoppel generally applies to preclude relitigation of both issues of law and issues of fact if those issues were conclusively determined in a prior action involving the same parties.  The exception to the applicability of the principles of collateral estoppel for ""unmixed questions of law"" arising in ""successive actions involving unrelated subject matter,"" Montana v. United States, supra, at  440 U. S. 162, does not apply here.  Whatever the purpose or extent of the exception, 
Page 464 U. S. 166
 there is no reason to apply it here to allow the Government to litigate twice with the same party an issue arising in both cases from virtually identical facts.  Pp.  464 U. S. 169-172.
(b) Nor is an exception to the doctrine of mutual defensive estoppel justified here on the asserted ground that its application in Government litigation involving recurring issues of public importance will freeze the development of the law.  That argument is persuasive only to prevent the application of collateral estoppel against the Government in the absence of mutuality.  While the Sixth Circuit's decision prevents EPA from relitigating the  114(a)(2) issue with respondent, it still leaves EPA free to litigate the same issue in the future with other litigants.  Pp.  464 U. S. 173-174.

Syllabus 
Section 244(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) authorizes the Attorney General, in his discretion, to suspend deportation of an otherwise deportable alien who ""has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years"" and is a person of good moral character whose deportation would result in extreme hardship to the alien or his spouse, parent, or child.  Respondent, a citizen of Thailand, first entered the United States as a nonimmigrant student in October, 1969, and was authorized to remain until July, 1971.  But when her visa expired, she chose to stay without securing permission from the immigration authorities.  In 1977, petitioner Immigration and Naturalization Service commenced deportation proceedings against respondent.  Conceding deportability, respondent applied for suspension pursuant to  244(a)(1).  Based on respondent's testimony that she had left the United States for Thailand during January, 1974, and that she had improperly obtained a nonimmigrant visa from the United States consular officer in Thailand to aid her reentry three months later, an Immigration Judge concluded that respondent had failed to meet  244(a)(1)'s 7-year ""continuous physical presence"" requirement, and accordingly denied her application for suspension.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed, holding that respondent's absence from the United States was meaningfully interruptive of her continuous physical presence in the country, since she was illegally in the United States at the time she left for Thailand and was able to return only by misrepresenting her status.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the BIA had placed too much emphasis on respondent's illegal presence prior to her departure and on the increased risk of deportation that her departure had engendered, and that an absence can be ""meaningfully interruptive"" only when it increases the risk and reduces the hardship of deportation.
Held:  Respondent did not meet  244(a)(1)'s ""continuous physical presence"" requirement.  Pp.  464 U. S. 189-196.
(a) The Court of Appeals' interpretation of this requirement departs from the Act's plain meaning.  Section 244(a)(1)'s language requiring certain threshold criteria to be met before the Attorney General, in his 
Page 464 U. S. 184
 discretion, may suspend deportation plainly narrows the class of aliens who may obtain suspension.  The ordinary meaning of such language does not readily admit any exception to the ""continuous physical presence"" requirement.  When Congress has intended that a ""continuous physical presence"" requirement be flexibly administered, it has provided authority for doing so.  Moreover, the evolution of the deportation provision itself shows that Congress knew how to distinguish between actual ""continuous physical presence"" and some irreducible minimum of ""nonintermittent"" presence.  Pp.  464 U. S. 189-192.
(b) Since this case deals with a threshold requirement added to the statute specifically to limit the discretionary availability of the deportation suspension remedy, a flexible approach to statutory construction, such as the Court of Appeals' approach, is not consistent with the congressional purpose underlying the ""continuous physical presence"" requirement.  Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U. S. 449, distinguished.  Pp.  464 U. S. 192-194.
(c) To interpret  244(a)(1) as the Court of Appeals did collapses the section's ""continuous physical presence"" requirement into its ""extreme hardship"" requirement and reads the former out of the Act.  Section 244(a)(1)'s language and history suggest that the two requirements are separate preconditions for a suspension of deportation.  It is also clear that Congress intended strict threshold criteria to be met before the Attorney General could exercise his discretion to suspend deportation.  To construe the Act so as to broaden such discretion is fundamentally inconsistent with this intent.  Pp.  464 U. S. 195-196.

464 U.S. 206

Syllabus 
In response both to the public outcry concerning the United States' growing dependence on foreign energy and to the alleged excessive profits that major integrated oil companies were earning, the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 repealed, as applied to the major integrated oil companies, the percentage depletion allowance authorized as a deduction from taxable income, but exempted independent producers and royalty owners from the repeal so as to encourage domestic production of oil and gas.  The Act added  613A to the Internal Revenue Code.  That section provides that a percentage depletion allowance under  611 for such independent producers and royalty owners shall be computed in accordance with  613
""with respect to . . . so much of the taxpayer's average daily production of domestic crude oil as does not exceed the taxpayer's depletable oil quantity""
and ""depletable natural gas quantity.""  During 1975, respondents (husband and wife) in No. 82-599 assigned their oil and gas leases to third parties, while retaining overriding royalties.  As partial consideration for these assignments, respondents received $7,600 in advance royalties.  This constituted the entire income received from the property in 1975, since there was no oil and gas production that year.  On their joint federal income tax return for 1975, respondents claimed a percentage depletion deduction equal to 22% of the advance royalties.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction because the advance royalties were not received ""with respect to"" any ""average daily production"" of oil or gas.  The Tax Court upheld this determination, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  In No. 82-774, petitioner joint owners leased their oil and gas interests in 1975 to various lessees.  Under the leases, petitioners were to receive both royalties from oil and gas produced and annual cash bonuses even if no oil or gas was produced.  In 1976, oil and gas was discovered on the property and was produced in substantial amounts.  Petitioners claimed depletion deductions on both the bonuses and the royalties received in that year.  
Page 464 U. S. 207
 The Commissioner disallowed the deduction on the bonuses, again because they were not received ""with respect to"" any ""average daily production.""  After paying the resulting deficiencies, petitioners filed a suit for refund in the Court of Claims, which held for the Commissioner.
Held:  Section 613A was not intended to deny the allowance for percentage depletion on advance royalty or lease bonus income altogether; rather,  611-613A entitle taxpayers to such an allowance at some time during the productive life of the lease.  Pp.  464 U. S. 214-227.
(a) Any reasonable interpretation of  613A must harmonize with the section's goal of subsidizing the combined efforts of small producers and royalty owners in the exploration and production of the Nation's oil and gas resources.  The Commissioner's interpretation -- under which taxpayers would receive percentage depletion on income derived from oil and gas interests only if the payment associated with that income could be attributed directly to specific units of production, and which anomalously suggests that a Congress intent on increasing domestic production by small producers included substantial economic disincentives in the same legislation -- does not comport with this goal.  By contrast, allowing percentage depletion on all qualified income makes available the maximum public subsidy that Congress was willing to provide.  Pp.  464 U. S. 217-220.
(b) The legislative history of  613A discloses a clear congressional intent to retain the percentage depletion rules that existed in 1975, and under which taxpayers leasing their interests in mineral deposits were entitled to a percentage depletion on any bonus or advance royalty whether there was production of the underlying mineral or not.  Pp.  464 U. S. 220-223.
(c) When  613A is considered together with related Code sections and in light of the legislative history, it is clear that Congress did not mean to withdraw the percentage depletion on lease bonuses or advance royalty income arising from oil and gas properties.  Section 613A clearly provides that income attributable to production over a certain level will not be eligible for percentage depletion, but nothing in the statute bars such a depletion on income received prior to actual production.  To the contrary, so long as the income can be attributed to production below the established ceilings, lease bonuses and royalty income come within the four corners of the percentage depletion provisions.  Pp.  464 U. S. 223-224.
(d) Since the Commissioner's interpretation is unreasonable, this Court will not defer to it.  The Commissioner has not shown any ""insurmountable"" practical problems that would render his position more tenable.  While  613A's various production requirements and limitations make accurate calculation of percentage depletion allowances difficult 
Page 464 U. S. 208
 in the absence of production figures, these problems can be resolved in a number of reasonable ways, as, for example, by requiring lessors to defer depletion deductions to years of actual production or to adjust deductions taken with amended returns.  The Commissioner cannot resolve the practical problems by eliminating the allowances altogether.  Pp.  464 U. S. 224-227.
No. 82-599, 677 F.2d 594, affirmed; No. 82-774, 231 Ct.Cl. 642, 689 F.2d 1017, reversed and remanded.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice O'CONNOR, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 This petition presents the important question whether the exhaustion rule in 28 U.S.C. 2254(b), (c) prohibits federal courts from considering federal habeas corpus petitions that contain specific allegations of error that are integral to the constitutional challenge but were not raised in the state courts. Because the question has great significance for the relations between federal and state courts, I would grant the petition for certiorari. 
 I  
 Respondent, Conrado Vela, pleaded guilty to a Texas murder indictment . After a jury found he had killed with malice, respondent was sentenced to 99 years imprisonment. The conviction was upheld on direct appeal. See Vela v. State, 516 S.W.2d 176 (Tex.Cr.App.1974). Respondent then filed consecutive petitions for writs of habeas corpus in state and federal courts, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. In both petitions, respondent raised the same three allegations of error as support for his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Both the state courts and the Federal District Court found that the three errors, when considered in the context of the entire record, were not cumulatively of such magnitude to render counsel's conduct of the trial as a whole constitutionally infirm. The courts also held that respondent was not prejudiced from any inadequacy that could be found. See Ex Parte Vela, Application No. 9209, at 20-22 (June 4, 1980) (state court); Supp.App. E1- E8 (Federal District Court). 
Page 464 U.S. 1053 , 1054
 Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, presenting the same three allegations of counsel error and, for the first time, raising other allegations of error as well. The Court of Appeals decided that the exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C. 2254(b), (c) did not prevent it from considering the additional instances of alleged ineffective assistance. Though these additional instances of ineffectiveness had not specifically been brought to the attention of the state courts, the Court of Appeals noted that the alleged errors were contained in the trial record and that the state courts purportedly had reviewed the entire record in finding counsel's performance adequate in the ""totality of the circumstances."" Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that ""the alleged 'new facts' [were] not new at all,"" and that respondent had exhausted all available state remedies. App. to Pet. for Cert. B15- B16. On the merits, it found that respondent had received ineffective assistance at trial because his counsel had committed the three ""central errors"" raised in the state court petition and ""several other serious errors as well."" Id., at B18-B28. The Court concluded that respondent had suffered prejudice of sufficient magnitude to warrant granting a writ of habeas corpus. Id., at B28-B30. 
 II  
 Whatever the correctness of the Court of Appeals' ""ineffective assistance"" determination, see Supp.App. E2-E8, this petition raises an issue of considerable importance to the administration of federal habeas corpus. The Fifth Circuit's consideration of factual allegations not specifically raised in the state court undermines the policies behind the requirement that state remedies be exhausted before federal habeas corpus relief becomes available. 
 The exhaustion rule ""reflects a policy of federal-state comity"" that is fundamental to our federal system. Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275, 512 (1971). It ""serves to minimize friction between our federal and state systems of justice by allowing the State an initial opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of prisoners' federal rights."" Duckworth v. Serrano, 454 U.S. 1, 2, 19 (1981) (per curiam ). For the State to have that opportunity, ""the federal claim must be fairly presented to the state courts."" Picard v.

Id., at B18-B28. The Court concluded that respondent had suffered prejudice of sufficient magnitude to warrant granting a writ of habeas corpus. Id., at B28-B30. 
 II  
 Whatever the correctness of the Court of Appeals' ""ineffective assistance"" determination, see Supp.App. E2-E8, this petition raises an issue of considerable importance to the administration of federal habeas corpus. The Fifth Circuit's consideration of factual allegations not specifically raised in the state court undermines the policies behind the requirement that state remedies be exhausted before federal habeas corpus relief becomes available. 
 The exhaustion rule ""reflects a policy of federal-state comity"" that is fundamental to our federal system. Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275, 512 (1971). It ""serves to minimize friction between our federal and state systems of justice by allowing the State an initial opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of prisoners' federal rights."" Duckworth v. Serrano, 454 U.S. 1, 2, 19 (1981) (per curiam ). For the State to have that opportunity, ""the federal claim must be fairly presented to the state courts."" Picard v. Connor, supra, 404 U.S., at 275. A federal habeas petitioner making a claim critically dependent on specific allegations of error never [464 U.S. 1053 , 1055]

 Charlie YOUNG, Jr.v. GEORGIANo. 83-5365 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 9, 1984
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 I dissent from the Court's denial of certiorari because it lets stand a ruling of the Georgia Supreme Court which violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment as made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 794, 2062 (1969). Because of the Georgia Supreme Court's blatant misreading of a decision by the United States Court of Appeals which granted habeas corpus relief to the petitioner, he will again be subjected to the State's attempt to impose a death sentence upon him even though a federal district court has made an undisturbed ruling that a death sentence recommended by a jury was invalid due to insufficiency of the evidence. 
 In February 1976, the petitioner, Charlie Young, Jr., was convicted of murder, armed robbery and robbery by intimidation. At the sentencing phase of the trial, the jury condemned the petitioner to death after finding that the murder was accompanied by two statutorily defined aggravating circumstances: the murder was committed while the petitioner was engaged in the commission of another capital felony, Ga.Code 17-10- 30(b)(2), 
Page 464 U.S. 1057 , 1058
 and the petitioner committed the murder for the purpose of receiving money, id., (b)(4).1 The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the conviction and the sentence. Young v. State, 237 Ga. 852, 230 S.E.2d 287 (1976). Subsequently, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed a lower state court's denial of Young's application for habeas corpus relief. Young v. Ricketts, 242 Ga. 559, 250 S.E.2d 404 (1978), cert. denied sub nom. Young v. Zant, 442 U.S. 934 (1979). 
 Young then initiated habeas corpus proceedings in United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. The District Court rejected Young's challenge to the validity of his conviction but set aside his death sentence. Young v. Zant, 506 F.Supp. 274 (M.D.Ga.1980). The District Court's order was based upon two holdings. First, the court held that Young had been denied effective assistance of counsel at the sentencing stage of his trial, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal constitution. Id., at 278.2 Second, the District Court held that [464 U.S. 1057 , 1059]

 State of LOUISIANAv. State of MISSISSIPPI et alNo. 86 Orig 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 2, 1984
 On application to Special Master for compensation. 
 The application of the Special Master for compensation in the amount of $64,829.50 is hereby granted. One-half of this amount shall be paid to the Special Master by the plaintiff and one-half by the defendants. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, dissenting in part from the allowance of the Special Master's expenses. 
 The Special Master has applied for $64,829.50 covering fees for himself and six persons who assisted him; only two of whom were lawyers. The total amount requested can be broken down as follows: 
 Special Master 143.6 hrs. @ $200 $28,720.00 Mr. Witt (assoc. 4 yrs. +) 240.9 hrs. @ 125 30,112.50 Mr. Amber (1st yr. assoc.) 11.6 hrs. @ 70 812.00 Others (summer law clerks) 103.7 hrs. @ 50 5,185.00 ______--- $64,829.50 
 
 A Special Master of this Court is a surrogate of the Court and in that sense the service performed is an important public duty of high order in much the same way as is serving in the Judiciary. I do not suggest that Special Masters should serve without compensation, as for example, Senior Federal Judges have done for a number of years in such cases, but I believe the public service aspect of the appointment is a factor that is not to be wholly ignored in determining the reasonableness of fees charged in a case like this. 
Page 466 U.S. 921 , 922
 The parties apparently agreed with the Special Master as to a rate of $ 200 per hour for his services; hence no question as to his charge is before the Court. The private defendants and Mississippi have questioned the rates at which the two lawyer associates, and the four non-lawyer assistants were billed, and the total number of hours charged for their services. Mississippi, for example, stated that it has ""no objection to the allowance and payment of such fees as this Honorable Court may find equitable . . . taking into consideration the three-day trial and the fact that the legal principles involved in this case have long since been settled by prior decisions of this Court."" 
 (1) the $125 per hour charge for assistance of a four-year associate; 
 (2) the $70 per hour charge for a one-year associate; and 
 (3) the $50 per hour for a ""summer law clerk."" 
 I assume that the latter is a law student working under the supervision of a member of the Bar. In my view, there is no basis to charge $50 per hour for a student assistant; it is obviously far more than such a student would be paid. 
 The associate lawyers, unburdened by the managerial or administrative aspects of group law practice, as partners in a large firm often are, should record 1,600 to 2,000 billable hours a year. At the rates charged here for the ""four-year"" lawyer, taking the mean figure, 1,800 hours at $ 125 per hour would total $225,000. There is no evidence before us to justify the rate charged. On the same basis, i.e., $70 per hour, the total for the one-year associate, would be $126,000. 
 I am not unaware of the heavy overhead expenses of a modern law firm: office rental, support staff salaries, computer and other equipment, libraries, insurance, all burden the gross income from the firm's practice . In my view, however, even given these expenses, the rates charged for these associates, absent proof, do not appear to be reasonable. 
 Absent supporting evidence, there may well be questions as to the total number of hours necessarily devoted to this case by the ""associates"" and the summer law clerks. I do not doubt that those hours were spent, but the need for them is challenged by the States and possibly some supporting evidence is called for. 
 More than $5,000 is requested for 100 hours of work by four student clerks. The record shows that almost 60 hours were spent [466 U.S. 921 , 923]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 These cases raise three recurring issues regarding the administration of the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule. [Footnote 1] Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E) provides that ""a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of 
Page 469 U.S. 1058 , 1059
 the conspiracy,"" when offered against that party, is not hearsay. The Rule has given rise to confusion among the lower courts with regard to when, by what standard of proof, and in light of what evidence the trial court should determine whether the necessary conspiracy existed. 
 In No. 83-6866, a critical prosecution witness testified to incriminating statements made to him by petitioner's co-conspirator. The Sixth Circuit held that these statements were properly introduced pursuant to Rule 801(d)(2)(E). 729 F.2d 1462 (1984). It concluded that the independent evidence, ""when viewed in conjunction with the [hearsay] statements made by Blotske concerning [petitioner's] participation,"" established the existence of a conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence. Pet. for Cert. 9. Thus, the Court of Appeals relied on the challenged statements to support the existence of the conspiracy pursuant to which those statements were introduced. 
 This approach was first adopted by the Sixth Circuit in United States v. Vinson, 606 F.2d 149, 153 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1074 and sub nom. Thompson v. United States, 445 U.S. 904 (1980), and has been approved en banc, United States v. Piccolo, 723 F.2d 1234, 1240, and n. 1 (6 Cir.1983) (en banc), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 970 (1984). Though not entirely without support,2 it is inconsistent with the stated position of every other Federal Court of Appeals. See United States v.
