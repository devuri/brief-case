No. 84-1023
Argued October 9, 1985
Decided December 16, 1985
474 U.S. 231

Syllabus 
Respondent was indicted by a federal grand jury on February 18, 1983, for felony illegal entry into the United States and reentry by a deported alien, he having been previously convicted for illegal entry ""on or about December 17, 1981.""  Appearing through counsel on February 18, 1983, respondent was arraigned, and the trial was set for April 19, 1983.  When it was noticed that the date of the previous conviction was actually December 7, 1981, the grand jury, on April 15, 1983, returned a superseding indictment identical to the original except that it corrected the date of the previous conviction.  Respondent then moved for a 30-day continuance of the trial, contending that 18 U.S.C.  3161(c)(2) -- which provides that a trial shall not commence less than 30 days ""from the date on which the defendant first appears through counsel"" -- required a new 30-day trial preparation period following the return of the superseding indictment.  The District Court denied the motion, and respondent was convicted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to the new 30-day trial preparation period.
Held:  The Speedy Trial Act, of which  3161(c)(2) is a part, does not require that the 30-day preparation period be restarted upon the filing of a superseding indictment.  Pp.  474 U. S. 234-237.
(a) That this was Congress' intention is evident from the unambiguous language of  3161(c)(2) that clearly fixes the beginning point for the trial preparation period as the first appearance through counsel, and does not refer to the date of the indictment, much less the date of any superseding indictment.  This conclusion is further supported by the language of  3161(c)(1), which establishes the outside time limit within which a trial must commence and explicitly refers to the date of indictment as one of the relevant dates for determining that time limit.  Pp.  474 U. S. 234-235.
(b) The requirements of  3161(c)(2) were met here, where the time between the date of respondent's first appearance through counsel and the date of the trial afforded a trial preparation period twice as long as the minimum required by  3161(c)(2).  P.  474 U. S. 236.
(c) Respondent was clearly not prejudiced by the return of the superseding indictment, which did nothing except correct the date of the previous conviction.  Pp.  474 U. S. 236-237.

 Janice Marie NYFLOTv. MINNESOTA COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC SAFETY.No. 85-636 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 16, 1985
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice STEVENS joins, dissenting. 
 Shortly after 1:30 o'clock on the morning of September 23, 1984, appellant Janice Nyflot was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. She immediately requested that she be allowed to speak with an attorney, but this request was denied. She was then taken to the local law enforcement center. There, she was advised that state law required that she be tested to determine if she was under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance and that refusal to allow such a test would result in her driver's license being revoked for a minimum of one year. She was 
Page 474 U.S. 1027 , 1028
 further advised that refusal to take the test could be offered in evidence against her at trial. Finally, she was told that if she consented to the test and the test indicated that she was under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, she would be subject to criminal prosecution and her right to drive could be revoked for a minimum of 90 days. And she was advised that she had the right, after submitting to the testing, to consult with an attorney and to have additional tests done by someone of her own choosing. These admonitions complied with the advice requirements of the state implied consent statute. See Minn.Stat. 169.123, subd. 2(b ) (1984). 
 After being thus advised, Nyflot informed the police officer that she would not submit to testing without first speaking to an attorney. She was again told that she would not be allowed to speak with an attorney before deciding whether to take the test. She again declined to consent to the test. The police officer then informed her that she had effectively refused the test and allowed her to contact her attorney. Immediately after contacting her attorney, she indicated her willingness to take the test, but she was told that she had been deemed to have refused it and could no longer consent. Her license was then revoked for one year based on her refusal. 
 The state trial court upheld the revocation against Nyflot's challenge that she had a right to counsel for the purpose of determining whether to consent to the blood alcohol test, which right had been unconstitutionally denied. The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a limited right to counsel was provided by state law. 365 N. W.2d 266 (1985). The Minnesota Supreme Court, with two justices dissenting, reversed again and upheld the revocation. 369 N.W.2d 512 ( 1985). 
 The Minnesota Supreme Court first rejected the Court of Appeals' conclusion that a right to counsel in this situation was provided by state law. Then, turning to Nyflot's federal constitutional challenge, the court held that no Sixth Amendment right to counsel extended to the decision whether to consent to testing. The court reasoned that Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682 (1972), concluded that ""the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not attach until judicial proceedings are formally commenced (by indictment, complaint or substitute for complaint)."" 369 N.W.2d, at 516.

|474 u.s. 214|"Regents of the University of Michigan v. Ewing
No. 84-1273
Argued October 8, 1985
Decided December 12, 1985
474 U.S. 214

Syllabus 
Respondent was enrolled in a year program of study at the University of Michigan known as ""Inteflex.""  An undergraduate degree and a medical degree are awarded upon successful completion of the program.  To qualify for the final two years of the program, a student must pass an examination known as ""NBME Part I.""  Respondent was dismissed from the University when he failed this examination with the lowest score recorded in the history of the Inteflex program.  After unsuccessfully seeking, from University authorities, readmission to the program and an opportunity to retake the examination, respondent brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging a right to retake the examination on the ground, inter alia, that he had a property interest in the Inteflex program and that his dismissal was arbitrary and capricious in violation of his ""substantive due process rights"" guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  While determining that respondent had a constitutionally protected property interest in continued enrollment in the Inteflex program, the District Court found no violation of his due process rights.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Even if respondent's assumed property interest gave rise to a substantive right under the Due Process Clause to continue enrollment free from arbitrary state action, the facts of record disclose no such action.  The record unmistakably demonstrates that the decision to dismiss respondent was made conscientiously and with careful deliberation, based on an evaluation of his entire academic career at the University, including his singularly low score on the NBME Part I examination.  The narrow avenue for judicial review of the substance of academic decisions precludes any conclusion that such decision was such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the faculty did not exercise professional judgment.  Pp.  474 U. S. 222-228.

No. 84-786
Argued October 8, 1985
Decided December 10, 1985
474 U.S. 159

Syllabus 
Respondent, represented by retained counsel, pleaded not guilty in a Maine Superior Court to charges of theft by receiving of automotive vehicles and parts.  Respondent's codefendant Colson informed the police that he had received anonymous threatening telephone calls regarding the pending charges, and indicated that he wished to talk to the police about the charges.  Before meeting with the police, Colson met with respondent to plan for the upcoming trial, and, according to Colson, respondent suggested the possibility of killing a State's witness.  Thereafter, Colson and his lawyer met with police officers, and Colson confessed to his participation with respondent in committing the crimes for which they had been indicted and agreed to testify against respondent and cooperate in the prosecution of respondent on the pending charges if no further charges were brought against Colson.  Colson also consented to have a recording device placed on his telephone, and agreed to record any anonymous threats or any calls from respondent.  Having learned from recorded telephone calls that Colson and respondent were going to meet to plan defense strategy for the upcoming trial, the police obtained Colson's consent to be equipped with a body wire transmitter to record the meeting.  Although Colson was instructed not to attempt to question respondent at the meeting, his remarks in fact caused respondent to make incriminating statements.  The trial court denied respondent's pretrial motion to suppress the recorded statements he made to Colson as having been obtained in violation of respondent's right to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments on the ground that the recordings were made for other reasons.  Some of respondent's recorded incriminating statements made at the meeting with Colson were admitted in evidence, and respondent was convicted of some of the charges.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine reversed and remanded for a new trial.
Held:  Respondent's Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel was violated by the admission at trial of incriminating statements made by him to Colson after indictment and at the meeting of the two to plan defense strategy for the upcoming trial.  Pp.  474 U. S. 168-180.
(a) The assistance of counsel is necessary to safeguard the other procedural safeguards provided to the accused by the criminal justice process.  Accordingly, the right to the assistance of counsel is not limited to 
Page 474 U. S. 160
 participation in a trial; to deprive a person of counsel during the period prior to trial may be more damaging than denial of counsel during the trial itself.  Whatever else it may mean, the right to counsel means at least that a person is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against him.  Pp.  474 U. S. 168-170.
(b) Once the right to counsel has attached and been asserted, the State must honor it.  At the very least, the prosecutor and police have an affirmative obligation not to act in a manner that circumvents and thereby dilutes the protection afforded by the right to counsel.  Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315; Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201; United States v. Henry, 447 U. S. 264.   474 U. S.  170-174.
(c) The State misreads Massiah, supra, and Henry, supra, in contending that the decisive fact in those cases was that the police set up the confrontation between the accused and a police agent at which incriminating statements were elicited, and that, thus, respondent's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated here because, he rather than Colson, initiated the recorded conversations.  The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused, at least after the initiation of formal charges, the right to rely on counsel as a ""medium"" between him and the State.  Knowing exploitation by the State of an opportunity to confront the accused without counsel being present is as much a breach of the State's obligation not to circumvent the right to the assistance of counsel as is the intentional creation of such an opportunity.  Pp.  474 U. S. 174-176.
(d) In this case, the State clearly violated respondent's Sixth Amendment right when it arranged to record conversations between respondent and its undercover informant, Colson.  When the police requested that Colson wear a body wire transmitter to the meeting with respondent, the police knew that respondent would make statements that he had a constitutional right not to make to their agent prior to consulting with counsel.  By concealing the fact that Colson was an agent of the State, the police denied respondent the opportunity to consult with counsel, and thus denied him the assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.  Pp.  474 U. S. 176-177.
(e) There is no merit to the argument that the incriminating statements obtained by the police should not be suppressed because the police had other, legitimate reasons for listening to respondent's conversations with Colson, namely, to investigate respondent's alleged plan to kill the State's witness and to insure Colson's safety.  This same argument was rejected in Massiah, supra, where the Court held that to allow the admission of evidence obtained from the accused in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights whenever the police assert the need to investigate other crimes to justify their surveillance invites abuse by law enforcement personnel in the form of fabricated investigations and risks the 
Page 474 U. S. 161
 evisceration of the Sixth Amendment right.  Evidence obtained that is relevant to crimes as to which the Sixth Amendment right has not yet attached may be admissible at a trial on those charges.  Pp.  474 U. S. 178-180.

No.  84-701
Argued October 16, 1985
Decided December 4, 1985
474 U.S. 121

Syllabus 
The Clean Water Act prohibits any discharge of dredged or fill materials into ""navigable waters"" -- defined as the ""waters of the United States"" -- unless authorized by a permit issued by the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps).  Construing the Act to cover all ""freshwater wetlands"" that are adjacent to other covered waters, the Corps issued a regulation defining such wetlands as
""those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.""
After respondent Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc. (hereafter respondent), began placing fill materials on its property near the shores of Lake St. Clair, Michigan, the Corps filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin respondent from filling its property without the Corps' permission.  Finding that respondent's property was characterized by the presence of vegetation requiring saturated soil conditions for growth, that the source of such soil conditions was ground water, and that the wetland on the property was adjacent to a body of navigable water, the District Court held that the property was wetland subject to the Corps' permit authority.  The Court of Appeals reversed, construing the Corps' regulation to exclude from the category of adjacent wetlands -- and hence from that of ""waters of the United States"" -- wetlands that are not subject to flooding by adjacent navigable waters at a frequency sufficient to support the growth of aquatic vegetation.  The court took the view that the Corps' authority under the Act and its implementing regulations must be narrowly construed to avoid a taking without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Under this construction, it was held that respondent's property was not within the Corps' jurisdiction, because its semi-aquatic characteristics were not the result of frequent flooding by the nearby navigable waters, and that therefore respondent was free to fill the property without obtaining a permit.
Held:
1.  The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that a narrow reading of the Corps' regulatory jurisdiction over wetlands was necessary to avoid a taking problem.  Neither the imposition of the permit requirement 
Page 474 U. S. 122
 itself nor the denial of a permit necessarily constitutes a taking.  And the Tucker Act is available to provide compensation for takings that may result from the Corps' exercise of jurisdiction over wetlands.  Pp.  474 U. S. 126-129.
2.  The District Court's findings are not clearly erroneous, and plainly bring respondent's property within the category of wetlands, and thus of the ""waters of the United States"" as defined by the regulation in ques tion.  Pp.  474 U. S. 129-131.
3.  The language, policies, and history of the Clean Water Act compel a finding that the Corps has acted reasonably in interpreting the Act to require permits for the discharge of material into wetlands adjacent to other ""waters of the United States."" Pp.  474 U. S. 131-139.

Argued October 7, 1985
Decided December 4, 1985
474 U.S. 140

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of homicide in an Ohio court, and ultimately the Ohio Supreme Court upheld the conviction.  She sought habeas corpus relief in the Federal District Court, which referred the case to a Magistrate, who issued a report recommending denial of the writ and containing proposed findings and conclusions of law and a notice that failure to file objections within 10 days waived the right to appeal the District Court's order.  Petitioner failed to file objections even though she had received an extension of time to do so, but the District Judge sua sponte reviewed the entire record de novo and dismissed the petition on the merits.  On appeal, petitioner provided no explanation for her failure to object to the Magistrate's report.  Without reaching the merits, the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that petitioner had waived the right to appeal by failing to file objections to the Magistrate's report.
Held: A court of appeals may adopt a rule conditioning appeal, when taken from a district court judgment that adopts a magistrate's recommendation, upon the filing of objections with the district court identifying those issues on which further review is desired.  Such a rule, at least when (as here) it incorporates clear notice to the litigants and an opportunity to seek an extension of time for filing objections, is a valid exercise of the court's supervisory power that does not violate either the Federal Magistrates Act or the Constitution.  Pp.  474 U. S. 145-155.
(a) Here, the Court of Appeals intended to adopt a rule of procedure in the exercise of its supervisory power.  Neither the intent nor the practical effect of the court's waiver rule is to restrict the court's own jurisdiction.  Pp.  474 U. S. 145-146.
(b) The courts of appeals have supervisory powers that permit, at the least, the promulgation of procedural rules governing the management of litigation.  The fact that the Sixth Circuit has deemed petitioner to have forfeited her statutory right to an appeal is not enough, standing alone, to invalidate the court's exercise of its supervisory power.  Moreover, the Sixth Circuit's decision to require the filing of objections is supported by sound considerations of judicial economy.  Pp.  474 U. S. 146-148.
(c) Neither the language nor the legislative history of the Federal Magistrates Act -- which provides that a litigant ""may"" file objections to 
Page 474 U. S. 141
 the magistrate's report within 10 days and thus obtain de novo review by the district judge, 28 U.S.C.  636(b)(1)(C) -- supports petitioner's argument that the Act precludes the waiver rule adopted by the Sixth Circuit.  The Act does not require that the district court review the magistrate's report under some lesser standard than de novo review when no objection is filed.  Nor does the obligatory filing of objections under the Act extend only to findings of fact, and not to the magistrate's conclusions of law.  Moreover, the waiver of appellate review is not inconsistent with the Act's purposes.  Pp.  474 U. S. 148-153.
(d) The waiver of appellate review does not violate Article III of the Constitution.  Although a magistrate is not an Article III judge, a district court may refer dispositive motions to a magistrate for a recommendation so long as the entire process takes place under the district court's control and jurisdiction, and the judge exercises the ultimate authority to issue an appropriate order.  The waiver of appellate review does not implicate Article III, because it is the district court, not the court of appeals, that must exercise supervision over the magistrate, and the waiver rule does not elevate the magistrate from an adjunct to the functional equivalent of an Article III judge.  Nor does the waiver rule violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Petitioner's statutory right of appeal was not denied; it was merely conditioned upon the filing of a piece of paper.  Pp.  474 U. S. 153-155.

Syllabus 
Petitioner recipients of benefits under the federal Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program brought class actions in Federal District Court against respondent Director of the Michigan Department of Social Services.  They claimed that respondent's policies of prohibiting the deduction of child care costs and requiring the inclusion of stepparents' income for purposes of calculating earned income, thereby determining eligibility for and the amount of AFDC benefits, violated applicable federal law.  Petitioners sought an injunction, a declaratory judgment, and ""notice relief.""  While the actions were pending, Congress amended the relevant federal statute to expressly require States to deduct child care expenses and to include stepparents' income.  Granting respondent's motions to dismiss in each case, the District Court held that the changes in federal law rendered moot the claims for prospective relief, that the remaining claims for declaratory and ""notice relief "" related solely to past violations of federal law, and that such retrospective relief was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in a consolidated appeal.
Held:
1. Petitioners are not entitled to ""notice relief.""  Since there is no continuing violation of federal law to enjoin, and therefore no valid injunction to which notice could attach, the notice cannot be justified as a mere case-management device that is ancillary to a judgment awarding valid prospective relief.  Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, distinguished.  Absent these conditions, the Eleventh Amendment limitation on the Art. III power of federal courts prevents them from ordering ""notice relief"" against States, because it is not the type of remedy designed to prevent ongoing violations of supreme federal law.  Pp.  474 U. S. 68-72.
2. Nor are petitioners entitled to a declaratory judgment that respondent violated federal law in the past.  Where there is no claimed continuing violation of federal law or any threat of future violation, a declaratory judgment is inappropriate, because its purpose could only be to provide a federal judgment on the issue of liability with the hope that it would be res judicata in state court proceedings, leaving to the state courts only a form of accounting proceeding whereby damages or restitution 
Page 474 U. S. 65

No. 84-5555
Argued October 9, 1985
Decided December 3, 1985
474 U.S. 82

Syllabus 
Petitioner hired two men to kill his wife.  In accordance with petitioner's plan, the men kidnaped petitioner's wife from her home in Alabama.  Her body was later found on the side of a road in Georgia.  Petitioner pleaded guilty to ""malice"" murder in a Georgia trial court in exchange for a sentence of life imprisonment.  Subsequently, he was tried and convicted of murder during a kidnaping, and was sentenced to death in an Alabama trial court, which rejected his claim of double jeopardy.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.
Held:
1. This Court will not decide whether the Alabama trial court had jurisdiction, where petitioner did not claim lack of jurisdiction in his petition to the Alabama Supreme Court, but raised the claim for the first time in his petition to this Court.  P.  474 U. S. 87.
2. Under the dual sovereignty doctrine, successive prosecutions by two States for the same conduct are not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and, hence, Alabama was not barred from trying petitioner.  Pp.  474 U. S. 87-93.
(a) The dual sovereignty doctrine provides that, when a defendant in a single act violates the ""peace and dignity"" of two sovereigns by breaking the laws of each, he has committed two distinct ""offences"" for double jeopardy purposes.  In applying the doctrine, the crucial determination is whether the two entities that seek successively to prosecute a defendant for the same course of conduct can be termed separate sovereigns.  This determination turns on whether the prosecuting entities' powers to undertake criminal prosecutions derive from separate and independent sources.  It has been uniformly held that the States are separate sovereigns with respect to the Federal Government because each State's power to prosecute derives from its inherent sovereignty, preserved to it by the Tenth Amendment, and not from the Federal Government.  Given the distinct sources of their powers to try a defendant, the States are no less sovereign with respect to each other than they are with respect to the Federal Government.  Pp.  474 U. S. 87-91.
(b) The application of the dual sovereignty principle cannot be restricted to cases in which two prosecuting sovereigns can demonstrate that allowing only one sovereign to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant 
Page 474 U. S. 83
 will interfere with the second sovereign's unvindicated ""interests.""  If the prosecuting entities are separate sovereigns, the circumstances of the case and the specific ""interests"" of each are irrelevant.  Pp.  474 U. S. 91-92.
(c) The suggestion that the dual sovereignty doctrine be overruled and replaced with a balancing of interests approach is rejected.  The Court's rationale for the doctrine is not a fiction that can be disregarded in difficult cases; it finds weighty support in the historical understanding and political realities of the States' role in the federal system and in the Double Jeopardy Clause itself.  Pp.  474 U. S. 92-93.

			"|"Heath v. Alabama
No. 84-5555
Argued October 9, 1985
Decided December 3, 1985
474 U.S. 82

Syllabus 
Petitioner hired two men to kill his wife.  In accordance with petitioner's plan, the men kidnaped petitioner's wife from her home in Alabama.  Her body was later found on the side of a road in Georgia.  Petitioner pleaded guilty to ""malice"" murder in a Georgia trial court in exchange for a sentence of life imprisonment.  Subsequently, he was tried and convicted of murder during a kidnaping, and was sentenced to death in an Alabama trial court, which rejected his claim of double jeopardy.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.
Held:
1. This Court will not decide whether the Alabama trial court had jurisdiction, where petitioner did not claim lack of jurisdiction in his petition to the Alabama Supreme Court, but raised the claim for the first time in his petition to this Court.  P.  474 U. S. 87.
2. Under the dual sovereignty doctrine, successive prosecutions by two States for the same conduct are not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and, hence, Alabama was not barred from trying petitioner.  Pp.  474 U. S. 87-93.
(a) The dual sovereignty doctrine provides that, when a defendant in a single act violates the ""peace and dignity"" of two sovereigns by breaking the laws of each, he has committed two distinct ""offences"" for double jeopardy purposes.  In applying the doctrine, the crucial determination is whether the two entities that seek successively to prosecute a defendant for the same course of conduct can be termed separate sovereigns.  This determination turns on whether the prosecuting entities' powers to undertake criminal prosecutions derive from separate and independent sources.  It has been uniformly held that the States are separate sovereigns with respect to the Federal Government because each State's power to prosecute derives from its inherent sovereignty, preserved to it by the Tenth Amendment, and not from the Federal Government.  Given the distinct sources of their powers to try a defendant, the States are no less sovereign with respect to each other than they are with respect to the Federal Government.  Pp.  474 U. S. 87-91.
(b) The application of the dual sovereignty principle cannot be restricted to cases in which two prosecuting sovereigns can demonstrate that allowing only one sovereign to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant 
Page 474 U. S. 83
 will interfere with the second sovereign's unvindicated ""interests.""  If the prosecuting entities are separate sovereigns, the circumstances of the case and the specific ""interests"" of each are irrelevant.  Pp.  474 U. S. 91-92.
(c) The suggestion that the dual sovereignty doctrine be overruled and replaced with a balancing of interests approach is rejected.  The Court's rationale for the doctrine is not a fiction that can be disregarded in difficult cases; it finds weighty support in the historical understanding and political realities of the States' role in the federal system and in the Double Jeopardy Clause itself.  Pp.  474 U. S. 92-93.

No. 84-5786
Argued October 16, 1985
Decided December 3, 1985
474 U.S. 104

Syllabus 
Petitioner, after a 58-minute interrogation at the New Jersey State Police Barracks, confessed to a murder.  The New Jersey trial court rejected his motion to suppress the confession, and the jury found him guilty of first-degree murder.  The New Jersey Superior Court Appellate Division reversed, finding as a matter of law that the confession was the result of compulsion, and thus was impermissible under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process guarantee.  The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed, finding, after examining the ""totality of all the surrounding circumstances,"" that the interrogation was proper and that the resulting confession, being voluntary, had been properly admitted into evidence.  Petitioner then sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, which dismissed the petition without an evidentiary hearing.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the voluntariness of a confession is a ""factual issue"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  2254(d), which provides that state court findings of fact, with certain exceptions, ""shall be presumed to be correct"" in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, and that accordingly federal review of the New Jersey Supreme Court's determination that petitioner's confession was voluntary was limited to whether that court applied the proper legal test and whether its factual conclusions were supported by the record.  Under this standard, the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court's denial of the habeas corpus petition was proper.
Held:  The voluntariness of a confession is not an issue of fact entitled to the  2254(d) presumption, but is a legal question meriting independent consideration in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.  Pp.  474 U. S. 109-118.
(a) There is no support in this Court's decisions for the suggestion that the enactment of  2254(d) in 1966 altered this Court's prior confession cases holding that the ultimate issue of ""voluntariness"" is a legal question requiring independent federal determination.  More importantly,  2254(d)'s history undermines any argument that Congress intended that the ultimate question of the admissibility of a confession be treated as a ""factual issue"" within the meaning of that provision.  Pp.  474 U. S. 109-112.
(b) In addition to considerations of stare decisis and congressional intent, the nature of the ""voluntariness"" inquiry itself lends support to the 
Page 474 U. S. 105
 holding in this case.  Moreover, the practical considerations that have led this Court to find other issues within the scope of the  2254(d) presumption are absent in the confession context.  Unlike such issues as the impartiality of a juror or competency to stand trial, assessments of credibility and demeanor are not crucial to the proper resolution of the ultimate issue of voluntariness.  And the critical events surrounding the taking of a confession almost invariably occur, not in open court, but in a secret and more coercive environment.  Pp.  474 U. S. 112-118.

 Appellants, two recalled city councilmen of the city of Honolulu and the Republican Party of Hawaii, ask me to stay an order of the Supreme Court of Hawaii, or to affirmatively enjoin the conduct of appellee Pua, the city clerk of the city of Honolulu. They claim that the following provision of the Honolulu City Charter violates the United States Constitution as interpreted by this Court in Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983):

 Appellants Matsumoto and Paccaro were recalled in an election held October 5. They seek to run in a special election called to fill the vacancies caused by the recall which is scheduled for tomorrow, Saturday, November 30. The stay application was presented to me about 1 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today, Friday, November 29. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that the ordinance as it construed it was unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court of Hawaii has now adopted a narrowing construction, which nonetheless prevents Matsumoto and Paccaro from appearing on the ballot, and ordered the city clerk to enforce the statute in tomorrow's election. 
 It is almost impossible in the length of time available to me to ascertain whether four Justices of this Court would vote to note probable jurisdiction of an appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of Hawaii, or whether a majority of this Court would be likely to reverse the decision of that court. The City Charter provision as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Hawaii is not, in my judgment, clearly unconstitutional under our decision in Anderson v. Celebrezze, supra. Under these circumstances, the ""stay equities"" of the case and the usual presumption of constitutionality accorded to state and local laws lead me to deny the application.

No. 84-489
Argued October 15, 1985
Decided November 18, 1985
474 U.S. 34

Syllabus 
A Pennsylvania state prisoner temporarily confined in the Philadelphia County jail brought suit in Federal District Court under 42 U. S.C.  1983 against various county officials, alleging that they had beaten and harassed him.  The court assigned the action to a Magistrate, who issued writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum for the producing of state prisoners, including the plaintiff, as witnesses.  The order directed the state Wardens to transport the prisoners to the county jail nearest the federal court, and then directed the United States Marshals Service (respondent) to transport the prisoners from the county jail to the federal court.  Respondent's motion for reconsideration of the latter part of the order was denied.  The Court of Appeals reversed in pertinent part, holding that the All Writs Act did not confer power on the District Court to compel noncustodians to bear the expense of producing the prisoner-witnesses.
Held:  There is no statutory authority for the order in question.  Pp.  474 U. S. 37-43.
(a) Title 28 U.S.C.  567 and 569(b) merely enumerate respondent's obligations to obey a federal court's mandate and to transport prisoners if the court so orders.  The court's authority to issue such mandates must derive from some independent source.  Pp.  474 U. S. 37-38.
(b) The habeas corpus statutes -- 28 U.S.C.  2241(c)(5) and 2243 -- do not authorize a federal court to direct a writ ad testificandum to parties who do not have custody of the prisoner.  There is no evidence in the language of  2241 and 2243, in their legislative history, or in the common law writ ad testificandum that courts are empowered to cause third parties who are neither custodians nor parties to the litigation to bear the cost of producing the prisoner in federal court.  Nor does Carbo v. United States, 364 U. S. 611, support an expansive reading of the power conferred upon federal district courts by the writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.  Pp.  474 U. S. 38-39.
(c) The All Writs Act does not confer authority upon a federal court to issue an order such as the one at issue.  An examination of the Act, its legislative history, and this Court's past interpretations of the Act all support this conclusion.  Although the Act empowers federal courts to

Syllabus 
Pursuant to a plea-bargaining agreement, petitioner pleaded guilty in an Arkansas court to charges of first-degree murder and theft of property, and the court accepted the plea, sentencing him, in accordance with the State's recommendations, to concurrent sentences of 35 years for the murder and 10 years for the theft.  Petitioner later filed a federal habeas corpus petition alleging, inter alia, that his guilty plea was involuntary by reason of ineffective assistance of counsel because his court-appointed attorney had misinformed him that, if he pleaded guilty he would become eligible for parole after serving one-third of his prison sentence, whereas, under Arkansas law, petitioner, as a ""second offender,"" was required to serve one-half of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole.  The District Court denied habeas relief without a hearing, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court did not err in declining to hold a hearing on petitioner's claim.   474 U. S.  56-60.
(a) Where a defendant enters a guilty plea upon counsel's advice, the voluntariness of the plea depends on whether the advice was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.  The two-part standard adopted in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel -- requiring that the defendant show that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different -- applies to guilty plea challenges based on ineffective assistance of counsel.  In order to satisfy the second, or ""prejudice,"" requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty, and would have insisted on going to trial.  Pp.  474 U. S. 56-60.
(b) In the present case, it is unnecessary to determine whether there may be circumstances under which erroneous advice by counsel as to parole eligibility may be deemed constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, because petitioner's allegations were insufficient to satisfy the ""prejudice"" requirement.  He did not allege in his habeas petition that, had counsel correctly informed him about his parole eligibility date, 
Page 474 U. S. 53

 This case presents the question whether, in a habeas corpus proceeding presenting multiple claims for relief, an appellate court has jurisdiction to review an order of the district court without disposing of all of petitioner's claims. In his habeas petition to 
Page 474 U.S. 998 , 999
 the District Court, respondent presented 59 constitutional claims. The District Court found that three of these claims had merit and granted the writ, but expressly refused to rule on the remaining claims. Blake v. Zant, 513 F.Supp. 772 (SD Ga.1981). On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit originally held that, because the District Court's order did not finally determine all of the claims presented in the habeas petition, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b),1 there was no final judgment, and therefore, the court was without jurisdiction to consider the appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1291.2 Blake v. Zant, 737 F.2d 925, 928 (CA11 1984). On sua sponte reconsideration, however, the court determined that a district court order granting a writ of habeas corpus is a final judgment within the meaning of 1291, regardless of the district court's refusal to consider the remainder of petitioner's claims. 758 F.2d 523, 524-525 ( 1985). 
 This later decision of the Eleventh Circuit conflicts with the practice of the Eighth Circuit. That court has held that, when a district court grants habeas relief to a petitioner on some but not all of the claims presented for consideration, the court of appeals does not have jurisdiction to review the trial court's decision unless its order also finally disposes of the remainder of petitioner's claims.

|474 u.s. 28|"Pennsylvania v. Goldhammer
No. 84-1852
Decided November 12, 1985
474 U.S. 28

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted in a Pennsylvania trial court on multiple counts of theft and multiple counts of forgery.  He was sentenced to two-to-five years of imprisonment on a single theft count and five years of probation on one of the forgery counts.  Sentence was suspended on the remaining counts.  On respondent's appeal, the Pennsylvania Superior Court held that the statute of limitations barred the prosecution of several of the theft counts, including the count on which respondent had received his sentence of imprisonment.  On the Commonwealth's appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court's ruling on the statute of limitations, and denied the Commonwealth's request that the case be remanded to the trial court for resentencing on the remaining theft counts.  The court acknowledged that a defendant could be twice sentenced for the same count when there was an intervening retrial at the defendant's request, but it held that resentencing on the counts which were affirmed after an appeal by the Commonwealth was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause when the sentence of imprisonment on another count was vacated.
Held:  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's rationale was inconsistent with the rationale of the holding in United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, that the Double Jeopardy Clause was not violated by 18 U.S.C.  3576, which allows the United States to appeal to a court of appeals the sentence given a ""dangerous special offender"" by a district court, and allows the court of appeals to affirm the sentence, impose a different sentence, or remand to the district court for further sentencing proceedings.  Since the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in this case held that resentencing was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, it did not consider whether Pennsylvania laws in effect at the time allowed the State to obtain review of the sentences on the counts for which the sentence had been suspended.  Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for a determination of that issue and for further consideration in light of DiFrancesco.
Certiorari granted; 507 Pa. 236, 489 A.2d 1307, reversed and remanded.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 
 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. It is well recognized that the Fourth Amendment ""imposes substantive standards for searches and seizures; but with them one of the important safeguards it establishes is a procedure; and [that] central to this procedure is an independent control over the actions of officers effecting searches of private premises."" Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 251- 252, 703-704 (1960) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting ). Thus this Court has long insisted that the determination whether probable cause exists to support a search warrant be made by ""a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime."" Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 14, 369 (1948) ( emphasis added). See also United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 913-914, 3416-3417 (1984); Illinois v.

"" Id., 468 U.S., at 914 (quoting Aguilar v. Texas, supra, 378 U.S., at 111). And, as we explained in Shadwick v. City of Tampa, supra, 407 U.S., at 350, ""[w]hatever else neutrality and detach-

Today the Court refuses to act on its convictions, denying certiorari in a case in which the judge who issued the search warrant indisputably ""rubber-stamped"" the police request. In this case, a large quantity of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of petitioner's automobile when it was searched pursuant to a warrant. Petitioner challenged the validity of the warrant at a pretrial suppression hearing, arguing that it was not supported by probable cause. The judge who granted the warrant testified at the hearing. With remarkable candor, he explained that he had relied principally on the fact that police officers had asked for the warrant, rather than on the underlying facts and circumstances set forth in the affidavit. The pertinent portion of the judge's testimony on cross-examination follows: ""Q.

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
Syllabus 
Pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (Act), the Secretary of Labor issued a citation to Cuyahoga Valley Railway Co. for a violation of the Act; the company contested the citation; the Secretary filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (Commission), and the company filed an answer; and the United Transportation Union, which represents the company's employees, intervened.  At the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), over the Union's objection, granted the Secretary's motion to vacate the citation on the ground that the Secretary did not have jurisdiction over the relevant safety conditions.  Despite the Secretary's objection, the Commission directed review of the ALJ's order and ultimately remanded the case to the ALJ for consideration of the Union's objections.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, because the adversarial process was well advanced at the time the Secretary attempted to withdraw the citation, the Commission, as the adjudicative body, had the authority to review the Secretary's withdrawal of the citation.
Held:  The Secretary has unreviewable discretion to withdraw a citation charging an employer with violating the Act.  The Court of Appeals' decision is inconsistent with the detailed statutory scheme, which contemplates that the rights created by the Act are to be protected by the Secretary, and that enforcement of the Act is the Secretary's sole responsibility.  The Commission's function is to act as a neutral arbiter and to determine whether the Secretary's citations should be enforced.  Its authority does not extend to overturning the Secretary's decision not to issue or to withdraw a citation.

No. 85-130
Decided November 4, 1985
474 U.S. 9

Syllabus 
Since 1959, California has imposed an excise tax on the distribution of cigarettes, and respondent Chemehuevi Indian Tribe originally remitted the tax to petitioner State Board of Equalization (Board) insofar as the tax was imposed on the distribution of cigarettes to non-Indians who purchased the cigarettes from the Tribe on its reservation in California.  However, in 1977, the Tribe enacted its own cigarette tax and ceased collecting and remitting the state tax.  When California sought to obtain the unremitted tax, the Tribe filed suit in Federal District Court for injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that the Board could not lawfully apply the state tax to cigarettes sold by the Tribe to non-Indian purchasers.  The court held that the Board's counterclaim for damages in the amount of back taxes allegedly owed by the Tribe was barred by sovereign immunity, but that California could lawfully require the Tribe to collect state taxes imposed on cigarettes that it sold to non-Indians.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the first determination, but reversed the second.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred insofar as it held that the Tribe could not be required to collect the tax imposed by California on non-Indian purchasers at tribal smoke shops.  It is not necessary that a state cigarette tax statute contain an express statement that the tax is to be passed on to the ultimate purchaser in order for the State to require a tribe to collect the tax from non-Indian purchasers and remit the amounts of such tax to the State.  If the legal incidence of the tax falls on non-Indian purchasers, the State may impose on the tribe the burden of collecting the tax.  The proper test for determining the legal incidence of the tax is nothing more than a fair interpretation of the taxing statute as written and applied.  The fairest reading of California's cigarette scheme as a whole is that the legal incidence of the tax falls on consuming purchasers if the vendors are untaxable, and thus the Board has the right to require the Tribe to collect the tax on the Board's behalf with regard to purchases of cigarettes by non-Indian consumers.

During respondent's murder trial in a Delaware court, the State sought to prove that a cat leash was the weapon used in strangling the victim, and that a hair found on the leash was similar to the victim's hair, and had been forcibly removed.  The State's expert witness testified that, in his opinion, the hair had been forcibly removed, but stated, on both direct examination and cross-examination, that he could not recall which of three methods he had employed in determining that the hair had been forcibly removed.  The trial court overruled respondent's objection that the admission of the expert's testimony precluded adequate cross-examination unless he could testify as to which of the methods he relied upon.  The defense offered its own expert, who testified that he had talked earlier with the State's expert and had been informed as to the method employed by the State's expert in reaching his ""forcible removal"" conclusion.  The defense's expert then proceeded to challenge the premise of that method.  Respondent was convicted, but the Delaware Supreme Court reversed, holding that, because the State's expert was unable to recall the method he used in arriving at his opinion, the admission of the opinion violated respondent's rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.
Held:
1. The admission of the State's expert's opinion did not offend the Confrontation Clause, despite his inability to recall the basis for that opinion.  This case does not fall within the category of Confrontation Clause cases involving the admission of out-of-court statements as substantive hearsay evidence against the defendant and his literal right to ""confront"" the witness at the time of trial.  The State made no attempt to introduce an out-of-court statement by its expert for any purpose, let alone as hearsay.  Nor does this case fall within the category of Confrontation Clause cases involving restrictions imposed by law or by the trial court on the scope of cross-examination of prosecution witnesses.  The trial court here did not limit the scope or nature of defense counsel's cross-examination of the State's expert.  Generally speaking, the Confrontation Clause guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination (as in this case), not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish. 
Page 474 U. S. 16

2. The prosecution's foreknowledge that its expert would be unable to give the precise basis for his opinion did not impose an obligation on it, as a matter of due process, to refrain from introducing the expert's testimony unless the basis for that testimony could definitely be ascertained.  Whether or not, under state law, the State's expert's opinion should have been admitted, the Federal Constitution does not forbid the trial court's conclusion that the expert's inability to recall the basis for his opinion went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.  The testimony of the defense's expert, suggesting the actual basis for the State's expert's opinion and disputing its validity, dispels any possibility of a claim that the introduction of the State's expert's opinion was so lacking in reliability and so prejudicial as to deny respondent a fair trial.
Certiorari granted; 493 A.2d 959, reversed and remanded.

No. 85-5260
Decided November 4, 1985
474 U.S. 25

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who was convicted of armed robbery, contended that the South Carolina trial court should have suppressed his confession as being the product of an illegal arrest.  The South Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, holding that, even assuming petitioner's arrest was illegal, the confession was admissible because voluntariness was the test of admissibility and petitioner did not claim that his confession was not voluntary.
Held:  The South Carolina Court of Appeals' judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded, because the court's reasoning is inconsistent with well-established precedent holding that a finding of voluntariness of a confession for Fifth Amendment purposes is not, by itself, sufficient to purge the taint of an illegal arrest, but is merely a threshold requirement for Fourth Amendment analysis.

 See 474 U.S. 1097.

 The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed. Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 ( 1985). 
 Opinion on remand, 782 F.2d 1510. 

 Justice STEVENS, dissenting. 
 Respondent is afflicted with Crohn's disease. Although originally accepted, her application for admission to the Los Angeles County School of Nursing was ultimately denied, at least in part, because of the school physician's opinion that the school program was ""too stressful"" for her. Finding of Fact No. 12, App. to Pet. for Cert. D-40. Nevertheless, the District Court concluded that respondent had ""failed to show that she was denied admission to the School solely by reason of her affliction or because she had Crohn's disease."" Finding of Fact No. 18, App. to Pet. for Cert. D-43. Based on this critical finding, the District Court denied respondent any relief under 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U. S.C. 794.

 Justice MARSHALL dissents from this summary disposition, which has been ordered without affording the parties prior notice or an opportunity to file briefs on the merits. See Maggio v.

 The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. After reviewing the prior history of the case and explaining why it had previously reversed the District Court's order denying respondent's motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court of Appeals wrote: 
 ""The trial in the district court did not produce substantially different evidence from that which we considered in Kling I. The district court's findings are clearly erroneous and in many instances are inconsistent.

 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Error and misstatement are inevitable in any scheme of truly free expression and debate. Because punishment of error may induce a cautious and restrained exercise of the freedoms of speech and press, the fruitful exercise of these essential freedoms requires a degree of ""breathing space ."" NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 338 ( 1963). Accordingly, ""we protect some falsehood in order to protect speech that matters."" Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 341, 3007 (1974); see also St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 732, 1326 (1968). The New York Times actual malice 
Page 474 U.S. 953 , 954
 standard defines the level of constitutional protection appropriate in the context of defamation of a public official. It rests on our ""profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open."" New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270, 721 (1964). In Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130 ( 1967), the New York Times standard was extended to statements criticizing "" public figures"" because we recognized that "" 'public figures,' like 'public officials,' often play an influential role in ordering society"" and that therefore ""[o]ur citizenry has a legitimate and substantial interest in the conduct of such persons, and freedom of the press to engage in uninhibited debate about their involvement in public issues and events is as crucial as it is in the case of 'public officials.' "" 388 U.S., at 164 (Warren, C.J., concurring in result). In Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., supra, we limited the applicability of the New York Times standard by holding that ""so long as they do not impose liability without fault, the States may define for themselves the appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehood injurious to a private individual."" 418 U.S., at 347 (footnote omitted). 
 In this case, the Ohio Supreme Court found Gertz rather than New York Times applicable to respondent Milkovich's libel suit against petitioners. Ostensibly, then, the issue presented in this petition is simply the narrow one whether petitioners will be required to pay damages upon a showing of negligence or actual malice. However, by allowing damages to be awarded upon a showing of negligence, thereby diminishing the "" breathing space"" allowed for free expression in the New York Times case, the decision in Gertz exacerbated the likelihood of self-censorship with respect to reports concerning ""private individuals."" See 418 U.S., at 365- 368-3021 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). Consequently, the rules we adopt to determine an individual's status as ""public"" or ""private"" powerfully affect the manner in which the press decides what to publish and, more importantly, what not to publish. In finding New York Times inapplicable, the Ohio Supreme Court read the ""public official"" and "" public figure"" doctrines in an exceptionally narrow way that is sure to restrict expression by the press in Ohio. Its decision is especially unfortunate in that it most affects reporting by local papers about the local controversies that constitute their primary content. Moreover, it is these local papers that are most coerced by the threat of libel damages [474 U.S. 953 , 955]

 November 4, 1985
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The motion of respondents for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice, BURGER, dissenting. 
 For the past nine years, the prison system in Philadelphia has been operating under the supervision of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, following that court's finding in 1972 that prison conditions violated both the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Since 1976, a full-time, court-appointed Special Master has been in place and numerous remedial orders have been issued, including orders requiring the building of new prison facilities and contempt orders imposing over $500,000 in fines for failure to comply with prior orders. In addition, the parties have entered into consent decrees aimed at controlling the population in the prison system. Beginning in 1984, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court assumed plenary jurisdiction over the entire state proceeding. 
 The state suit commenced by the filing of a class action in 1971 on behalf of all inmates in the Philadelphia prisons, seeking equitable relief from alleged unconstitutional prison conditions; defendants are officials of Philadelphia. In the case now before us, respondent Harris, an inmate who admits he is a member of the same class represented in the state action, brought a separate class action in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on behalf of all persons confined in the Philadelphia prisons ; defendants include city and state officials. The federal complaint similarly makes claims like those in the state suit, and asserts that the Philadelphia prisons are overcrowded, thereby violating the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution; it seeks extensive injunctive relief and monetary damages under 42 U.S.C. 1983. 
Page 474 U.S. 965 , 966
 The District Court dismissed the equitable relief claims sought in this second class action on the alternative grounds of res judicata, or abstention under the doctrine of Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800 ( 1976); it dismissed the damages claim on grounds of sovereign and qualified official immunity. A divided Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, rejecting each of the District Court's holdings. 755 F.2d 338 (1985). In his dissenting opinion, Judge Garth agreed that while Colorado River did not support abstention, Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), mandated it: ""I do not believe that Supreme Court teachings, comity, or reason support a federal court's intrusion into a state's administration of its prison system when the state courts have been, and presently are, exercising supervision over these institutions and are doing so in accordance with both state and federal constitutional requirements."" 755 F.2d, at 347. 
 Rehearing was denied over two dissents. 758 F.2d 83 (1985). 
 Respondents essentially ask the federal courts to duplicate the ongoing state-court regulation of the Philadelphia prison system. The District Court recognized that the substantial and ongoing state-court proceedings involve an important state interest, namely, the administration of a prison system. The Court of Appeals nevertheless found Younger abstention restricted to pending state criminal or quasi- criminal proceedings initiated by the State. Our cases, however, recognize that ""[t]he policies underlying Younger are fully applicable to noncriminal judicial proceedings when important state interests are involved."" Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar Assn., 457 U.S. 423, 432, 2521 (1982). See also Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 423, 2377 ( 1979) (the Younger doctrine is ""fully applicable to civil proceedings in which important state interests are involved""). 
 The Younger doctrine is rooted in the concept of comity, because 
 There is no question that the State is a party to the ongoing state proceedings and that important state policies are implicated [474 U.S. 965 , 967]

 Rehearing was denied over two dissents. 758 F.2d 83 (1985). 
 Respondents essentially ask the federal courts to duplicate the ongoing state-court regulation of the Philadelphia prison system. The District Court recognized that the substantial and ongoing state-court proceedings involve an important state interest, namely, the administration of a prison system. The Court of Appeals nevertheless found Younger abstention restricted to pending state criminal or quasi- criminal proceedings initiated by the State. Our cases, however, recognize that ""[t]he policies underlying Younger are fully applicable to noncriminal judicial proceedings when important state interests are involved."" Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar Assn., 457 U.S. 423, 432, 2521 (1982). See also Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 423, 2377 ( 1979) (the Younger doctrine is ""fully applicable to civil proceedings in which important state interests are involved""). 
 The Younger doctrine is rooted in the concept of comity, because 
 There is no question that the State is a party to the ongoing state proceedings and that important state policies are implicated [474 U.S. 965 , 967]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 4, 1985
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Justice REHNQUIST and Justice O'CONNOR join, dissenting. 
 In this case the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that a prosecutor is not entitled to absolute immunity from liability in a civil rights suit brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983 based upon the prosecutor's presence during questioning of the plaintiff. Absolute immunity was denied even though the prosecutor was present not as an investigator but as a counsel to advise on compliance with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). 
 In Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409 ( 1976), this Court established an absolute immunity for prosecutors engaged in activities associated with the criminal process. This Court left open the extent to which investigative activities by prosecutors would also come within the umbrella of absolute immunity. But the principle of absolute immunity established in Imbler was based on the need to ensure sound decisionmaking by the prosecutor by protecting from fear of retaliatory suits for vigorous law enforcement. Here the prosecutor was acting as an officer of the court in ensuring compliance with the Miranda requirements, and I would grant the petition for certiorari in order to define the applicability of absolute immunity in this context; surely the prosecutor's action was well within his function as a prosecutor and officer of the court.[ Johnson v. Rex 474 U.S. 967 (1985) ]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER. 
 I agree that we should deny the petition for certiorari, but I would award respondents costs and fees under Rule 49.2. The time has come- indeed it is long past-when the Court should enforce Rule 49.2 or strike it. This petition, like much which preceded it, is utterly frivolous. On this record I can only conclude that petitioner and his counsel have filed actions designed to delay the orderly settlement of the estate of respondent Keller's decedent. This misuse of judicial processes should subject the attorney who filed the petition here to the sanction of Rule 49.2.1 
 On July 14, 1978, petitioner brought suit in Louisiana state court to contest the probate of the will of his aunt, Laura Clement. Petitioner requested and received no fewer than three continuances. The trial was finally set for May 12, 1980. Three days before trial, petitioner requested and was denied a fourth continuance. 
 On the day of trial, petitioner appeared before Judge Melvin Duran, objected to the proceedings, offered no evidence, and stood mute. Judge Duran accordingly dismissed the suit with prejudice. The intermediate state appellate court unanimously affirmed. Succession of Clement, 402 So. 2d 702 (La.App.1981). That court noted that petitioner had ""succeeded in delaying implementation of Mrs. Clement's bequests for three years, possibly longer if this matter goes to a higher court."" Id., at 703. The court concluded that Judge Duran had not abused his discretion, after granting three continuances, in refusing to grant a fourth. 
Page 474 U.S. 968 , 969
 The Louisiana Supreme Court unanimously declined to review the case. 407 So.2d 733 (1981). 
 Petitioner then brought a 42 U.S.C. 1983 action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Petitioner contended that the state trial court, by refusing his request for a fourth continuance, had deprived him of due process of law. He named as defendants the Clerk of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, Dan Foley ; the Succession of Laura Clement; the executor of the will, Thomas Keller; and Judge Duran. The defendants, respondents in this Court, moved for dismissal of the action. The District Court correctly granted the motion, concluding that the complaint should be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. Petitioner then took an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 That court unanimously affirmed, holding that the District Court had properly dismissed the action on jurisdictional grounds. 749 F.2d 217 ( 1984). Petitioner's suit was brought in the face of the ""well-settled rule"" that a plaintiff may not seek reversal of a state-court judgment simply by casting his complaint in the form of a civil rights action; Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent ""clearly prohibit[ed]"" the effort made by petitioner. The Court of Appeals also held that the District Court had properly dismissed petitioner's suit for failure to state a claim. The court explained that ordinarily it would not be inclined to give this issue any attention since the District Court's judgment in its entirety could be affirmed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. However, ""to further demonstrate the frivolousness of the appeal,"" the court addressed this point as well, concluding that the trial court had properly dismissed the claims against all defendants on this basis.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 4, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting. 
 This case presents the issue of the agreement necessary to support a conviction for so-called RICO conspiracy. For his part in a large-scale narcotics distribution scheme, petitioner Adams was convicted of both the substantive RICO offense defined by 18 
Page 474 U.S. 971 , 972
 U.S.C. 1962(c) * and conspiracy to commit this offense. Petitioner requested a jury instruction that he could not be found guilty on the conspiracy count unless the evidence showed that he had personally agreed to commit two acts of racketeering activity. The District Judge refused this instruction. In affirming petitioner's RICO conspiracy conviction, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that, to be convicted of conspiracy to violate 1962(c), a defendant need only agree to the commission of two predicate acts of racketeering activity, and need not agree to personally commit those acts. 759 F.2d 1099, 1116 (1985). 
 The Courts of Appeals disagree as to the proper interpretation of 18 U.S.C. 1962(d), the RICO conspiracy statute. Some require, as the predicate for conviction under 1962(d) of conspiracy to violate 1962(c ), an agreement to personally commit two acts of racketeering activity. See, e.g., United States v. Ruggiero, 726 F.2d 913, 921 (CA2), cert. denied sub nom. Rabito v. United States, 469 U.S. 831, 83 L. Ed.2d 60 (1984); United States v. Winter, 663 F.2d 1120, 1136 (CA1 1981), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1011 (1983). Other Courts of Appeals agree with the Third Circuit that 1962(d) also makes unlawful an agreement that another violate 1962(c) by committing two acts of racketeering activity. See, e.g., United States v. Carter, 721 F.2d 1514, 1529-1531 (CA11), cert. denied sub nom. Morris v. United States, 469 U.S. 819 (1984). 
 Surprisingly, even the Government's interpretation of the RICO conspiracy statute has not been wholly consistent. In Winter, supra, the Government conceded that a count under 1962(d) of conspiracy to violate 1962(c) requires proof that the defendant ""agreed to commit personally two or more predicate crimes constituting a pattern of racketeering activity."" 663 F.2d 1136.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 4, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 In Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153 ( 1976), six Justices concluded that a capital sentencing scheme that directs and limits the jury's discretion minimizes the risk of arbitrary and freakish imposition of the death penalty and thereby cures the defects that led the Court in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 33 L. Ed.2d 346 (1972), to invalidate capital punishment as unconstitutionally cruel and unusual. I dissented in Gregg because I do not believe that the unconstitutionality of capital punishment depends upon the procedures under which the penalty is inflicted. In my view, the constitutional infirmity in the punishment of death is that ""it treats 'members of the human race as nonhumans, as objects to be toyed with and discarded' "" and is thus "" 'inconsistent with the fundamental premise of the [Eighth Amendment] that even the vilest criminal remains a human being possessed of common human dignity.' "" Gregg, supra, 428 U.S., at 230 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting) (quoting Furman v. Georgia, supra, 408 U.S., at 273). 
 I have adhered to this view that capital punishment is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. I do so again today. But even if I agreed that capital punishment is constitutional if imposed in a rational and nondiscriminatory manner, I remain convinced that the Court deludes itself when it insists that the infliction of the death penalty, as currently administered, is not 
Page 474 U.S. 973 , 974
 arbitrary or capricious under any meaningful definition of those terms. See Pulley v. Harris, 465 U.S. 37, 59, 884 ( 1984) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). This case demonstrates just one way in which capital sentencing schemes have failed to eliminate arbitrariness in the choice of who is put to death. 
 With the aid of Helen Mejia, Roger DeGarmo kidnaped and murdered a young woman. DeGarmo was subsequently convicted of capital murder and condemned to die by lethal injection. As part of a plea bargain, Mejia- whose participation made her equally subject to prosecution under the capital murder statute-received a sentence of only 10 years' deferred probation. In other words, while the State sought and may soon succeed in putting DeGarmo to death, it did not care to see his accomplice serve even a day in jail for participating in the same offense. This gross disparity in treatment is solely a product of the prosecutor's unfettered discretion to choose who will be put in jeopardy of life and who will not.* 
 I believe that such a disparity in treatment is alone sufficient grounds to set aside DeGarmo's death sentence as disproportionate under the circumstances. Cf. Pulley v. Harris, supra, 465 U.S., at 43, 104 S.Ct ., at 875; Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277 ( 1983).

 Albert OETTINGERv. Leona Gordon OETTINGER.No. 84-2011 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 21, 1985
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Appellant Albert Oettinger and appellee Leona Gordon Oettinger were married in Louisiana in 1967. Both had been married before, and both had substantial property of their own at the time of the marriage. Unbeknownst to appellant, at the time of the marriage appellee recorded a declaration of paraphernality under the authority of Article 2386 of the Louisiana Civil Code. This declaration allowed a wife to reserve for herself any fruits from her paraphernal property (nondotal property she brought into the marriage); it also gave her the right to manage such property and the fruits from such property. See La.Civ.Code Ann., Art. 
Page 474 U.S. 912 , 913
 2386 (West 1971).* Under the Louisiana marital property laws in effect at that time, the husband would, absent such a declaration, have the right to manage the fruits of the wife's paraphernal property, and those fruits would thus normally fall into the community property. See La.Civ.Code Ann ., Arts. 2402, 2404 (West 1971). 
 Under Louisiana law at that time, no similar provision existed for the husband. For a husband to reserve the fruits of his separate property to himself, he had to prove that they were separate property; a simple declaration was not possible for him. See La.Civ.Code Ann., Art. 2405 ( West 1971). Thus, although a husband had the right to manage his separate property (because he had the right under law, with certain exceptions, to manage all separate and community property), the fruits from that property that accrued during the marriage would normally become community property. 
 During their marriage, appellant and appellee attempted to maintain their finances separately. In 1980, they were divorced. In 1982, appellee sued for a partition of former community property and for settlement of the former community. Appellant, mindful of this Court's recent gender-discrimination decisions, see e.g., Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268 (1979), challenged inclusion in the community of the property that he had brought into the marriage and of the fruits from that property on the ground that the Louisiana Civil Code provision that allowed the wife but not the husband to reserve the fruits of such property to herself by a mere declaration of paraphernality was an unconstitutional denial of equal protection.

 Albert OETTINGERv. Leona Gordon OETTINGER.No. 84-2011 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 21, 1985
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Appellant Albert Oettinger and appellee Leona Gordon Oettinger were married in Louisiana in 1967. Both had been married before, and both had substantial property of their own at the time of the marriage. Unbeknownst to appellant, at the time of the marriage appellee recorded a declaration of paraphernality under the authority of Article 2386 of the Louisiana Civil Code. This declaration allowed a wife to reserve for herself any fruits from her paraphernal property (nondotal property she brought into the marriage); it also gave her the right to manage such property and the fruits from such property. See La.Civ.Code Ann., Art. 
Page 474 U.S. 912 , 913
 2386 (West 1971).* Under the Louisiana marital property laws in effect at that time, the husband would, absent such a declaration, have the right to manage the fruits of the wife's paraphernal property, and those fruits would thus normally fall into the community property. See La.Civ.Code Ann ., Arts. 2402, 2404 (West 1971). 
 Under Louisiana law at that time, no similar provision existed for the husband. For a husband to reserve the fruits of his separate property to himself, he had to prove that they were separate property; a simple declaration was not possible for him. See La.Civ.Code Ann., Art. 2405 ( West 1971). Thus, although a husband had the right to manage his separate property (because he had the right under law, with certain exceptions, to manage all separate and community property), the fruits from that property that accrued during the marriage would normally become community property. 
 During their marriage, appellant and appellee attempted to maintain their finances separately. In 1980, they were divorced. In 1982, appellee sued for a partition of former community property and for settlement of the former community. Appellant, mindful of this Court's recent gender-discrimination decisions, see e.g., Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268 (1979), challenged inclusion in the community of the property that he had brought into the marriage and of the fruits from that property on the ground that the Louisiana Civil Code provision that allowed the wife but not the husband to reserve the fruits of such property to herself by a mere declaration of paraphernality was an unconstitutional denial of equal protection.

Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 (1976) ( MARSHALL, J., dissenting). The petitioner has presented an important question concerning the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment as applied to the execution of a mentally retarded person. 
 I  
 The petitioner is mentally retarded, with an IQ of 65 and mental abilities roughly equivalent to those of a 10-year-old child. He was tried for the murder of one Dan Turner, a friend of the petitioner and his family. There were no eyewitnesses to the crime. The petitioner had gone into Turner's grocery store to buy some cigarettes. The petitioner testified at trial that he grabbed Turner when the latter opened the cash register. Turner reacted by picking up a hammer, and the petitioner then stabbed him and hit him with the hammer after it fell from the victim's hand. The petitioner took money from the cash register and Turner's wallet and fled. 
 The petitioner turned himself in to the police and gave a lengthy statement in which he admitted stabbing Turner. When asked about the reasons for his actions, the petitioner stated that he had wanted to get money. At trial, however, the petitioner stated that he had not entered the store intending to rob Turner, and did not know why he had grabbed Turner as the latter was getting the petitioner's cigarettes. 
 A psychiatrist who examined the petitioner stated that the petitioner showed considerable remorse in discussing the murder. The petitioner testified at trial that he ""didn't mean to kill Mr. Dan,"" but had gotten "" carried away"" after he saw the victim wielding the hammer in what the petitioner interpreted as a threatening manner. There was evidence that the petitioner was under considerable stress in the days preceding the murder. The petitioner's counsel argued that the petitioner was insane or, at minimum, lacked the requisite mental intent because of his retardation. Nevertheless, the jury found the petitioner guilty of malice murder and armed robbery and sentenced him to death. [474 U.S. 925 , 927]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 21, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 In At that time, Kerr was incarcerated in North Carolina. On May 21, 1979, Kerr filed a ""Motion and Request for a Speedy Trial Upon Pending Charge or for Dismissal of Detainer"" in the Spotsylvania County Circuit Court. Receipt of the motion was acknowledged by that court on May 23, 1979. On September 25, 1979, Kerr was transported to Virginia from North Carolina. A preliminary hearing was set for November 7, 1979, but the hearing was rescheduled for November 28, 1979, at the request of Kerr's attorney. On the latter date, Kerr waived his right to a preliminary hearing and consented to the State's proceeding by grand jury indictment. The Spotsylvania County grand jury indicted Kerr on January 21, 1980, and his trial was set for May 22, 1980. 
 On May 19, 1980, Kerr moved to dismiss the indictment. He based this motion on Article III(a) of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), which provides that a prisoner against whom a detainer has been lodged "" shall be brought to trial within one hundred and eighty days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court . . . written notice of . . . his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information, or complaint . . .,"" as set forth in 18 U.S.C. App. 2. Article V(c) of the IAD further provides that 
Page 474 U.S. 929 , 930
 ""in the event that an action on the indictment, information, or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in article III . . . hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information, or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice. . . ."" 
 Kerr's motion was denied, and he was tried and found guilty as charged. His petition to the Supreme Court of Virginia for a writ of error was denied. 
 Kerr then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. He asserted in that petition that he was entitled to relief because he had not been tried within the time limits prescribed by Article III(a) of the IAD. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it did not state a claim for relief under 28 U.S.C. 2254. 
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Kerr's habeas corpus petition. 757 F.2d 604 (1985). The Fourth Circuit cited Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333 (1974), as setting forth the inquiry for determining whether habeas relief is warranted: "" 'whether the claimed error of law was ""a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice,"" and whether ""[i]t . . . present[s] exceptional circumstances where the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of habeas corpus is apparent."" ' "" 757 F.2d, at 606 (in turn quoting Davis, supra, 417 U.S., at 346 (quoting Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 428, 471 (1962))). The court then noted that in a similar case concerning Article IV(e) of the IAD (under which a prisoner must be tried before being returned to his original place of incarceration and to which the same Article V sanction applies), a previous panel of the Circuit had held that the IAD violation did not present a cognizable habeas claim under the Davis test. See Bush v. Muncy, 659 F.2d 402 (CA4 1981). In that case, the court had concluded that ""only those statutory rights of a fundamental nature closely related to constitutionally secured rights to fair prosecution and adjudication should be subject to vindication by collateral review of criminal convictions."" Id., at 409. 
 The Court of Appeals also noted in this case that the Circuits are divided on the question whether Articles III and IV IAD viola- [474 U.S. 929 , 931]

 This is a suit brought in Federal District Court by various lumber companies who had contracted to purchase timber from the United States. The plaintiffs-petitioners here-seek both a declaratory judgment to the effect that the contracts are void as a matter of federal common law and an injunction restraining the United States from enforcing them.

 relief. Although conceding that such a suit arose under federal law for purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1331, the court concluded that the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. 1346 and 1491, impliedly barred the relief sought. The court reasoned that the Tucker Act, under which declaratory relief is not available, see Richardson v. Morris, 409 U.S. 464d 647 (1973), defined the extent of the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity against the types of claims for which the Tucker Act authorizes monetary relief.

 My doubts about the correctness of this ruling and its consistency with the decision of another Court of Appeals lead me to believe that review of the Ninth Circuit's conclusion in this Court is warranted.

 Lawrence FEINv. PERMANENTE MEDICAL GROUP.No. 85-19 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 15, 1985
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 California Civ.Code Ann. 3333.2 (West Supp.1985) establishes a $250, 000 maximum limitation in medical malpractice actions for ""noneconomic losses to compensate for pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement, and other non-pecuniary damage."" This statute is part of the Medical Injury Compensation Act of 1975, enacted by the California Legislature in response to the dramatic rise in consumer medical costs caused by the increase in both monetary awards in medical malpractice actions and medical malpractice insurance premiums. See 1975 Cal.Stats., 2d Ex.Sess., ch. 2, 12.5(1)(b), p. 4007. 
 Appellant brought a medical malpractice action against appellee, Permanente Medical Group, a partnership of physicians, for failing to diagnose and prevent a myocardial infarction. The jury awarded appellant total damages of $1,287,783, including $500,000 for noneconomic losses. The trial judge, however, pursuant to 3333.2, reduced the amount of noneconomic damages to $250,000. 
Page 474 U.S. 892 , 893
 The California Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting appellant's challenge that 3333.2 contravenes both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal Constitution. 38 Cal.3d 137, 211 Cal. Rptr. 368, 695 P.2d 665 (1985). The court found no due process violation based on the theory that ""the Legislature retains broad control over the measure, as well as the timing, of damages that a defendant is obligated to pay and a plaintiff is entitled to receive, and . . . the Legislature may expand or limit recoverable damages so long as its action is rationally related to a legitimate state interest."" Id., at 158, 211 Cal. Rptr., at 383, 695 P.2d, at 680 (emphasis in original). The court then reasoned that the limitation imposed by 3333.2 was a rational response to the problem of rising medical malpractice insurance costs. 
 Similarly, the court found that 3333.2 did not improperly discriminate either between medical malpractice plaintiffs and other tort plaintiffs, or within the class of medical malpractice plaintiffs by denying full recovery to those with noneconomic damages exceeding $250,000 . The legislature's decision to limit the application of 3333.2 to medical malpractice cases, and within those cases to those with large noneconomic damages awards, the court reasoned, was a rational response to escalating malpractice insurance rates. 
 California thus joins Indiana as the only two States to uphold the constitutionality of this type of medical malpractice damages limits. See Johnson v. St. Vincent Hospital, Inc., 273 Ind. 374, 404 N.E.2d 585, 598- 601 (1980). Four other States which have addressed similar damages limitations have invalidated the challenged provisions on federal constitutional grounds. Baptist Hospital of Southeast Texas v. Baber, 672 S.W.2d 296, 298 (Tex.App.1984) ($500,000 limit on damages other than medical expenses); Carson v. Maurer, 120 N.H. 925, 941-943, 424 A.2d 825, 836-838 (1980) ($250,000 limit on ""noneconomic"" damages); Arneson v. Olsen, 270 N.W.2d 125, 135-136 (N.D.1978) ($300,000 limit on total damages ); Simon v. St. Elizabeth Medical Center, 3 Ohio Op.3d 164, 166, 355 N.E. 2d 903, 906-907 (Com.Pl.1976) ($200,000 limit on ""general"" damages).* [474 U.S. 892 , 894]

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 California Civ.Code Ann. 3333.2 (West Supp.1985) establishes a $250, 000 maximum limitation in medical malpractice actions for ""noneconomic losses to compensate for pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement, and other non-pecuniary damage."" This statute is part of the Medical Injury Compensation Act of 1975, enacted by the California Legislature in response to the dramatic rise in consumer medical costs caused by the increase in both monetary awards in medical malpractice actions and medical malpractice insurance premiums. See 1975 Cal.Stats., 2d Ex.Sess., ch. 2, 12.5(1)(b), p. 4007. 
 Appellant brought a medical malpractice action against appellee, Permanente Medical Group, a partnership of physicians, for failing to diagnose and prevent a myocardial infarction. The jury awarded appellant total damages of $1,287,783, including $500,000 for noneconomic losses. The trial judge, however, pursuant to 3333.2, reduced the amount of noneconomic damages to $250,000. 
Page 474 U.S. 892 , 893
 The California Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting appellant's challenge that 3333.2 contravenes both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal Constitution. 38 Cal.3d 137, 211 Cal. Rptr. 368, 695 P.2d 665 (1985). The court found no due process violation based on the theory that ""the Legislature retains broad control over the measure, as well as the timing, of damages that a defendant is obligated to pay and a plaintiff is entitled to receive, and . . . the Legislature may expand or limit recoverable damages so long as its action is rationally related to a legitimate state interest."" Id., at 158, 211 Cal. Rptr., at 383, 695 P.2d, at 680 (emphasis in original). The court then reasoned that the limitation imposed by 3333.2 was a rational response to the problem of rising medical malpractice insurance costs. 
 Similarly, the court found that 3333.2 did not improperly discriminate either between medical malpractice plaintiffs and other tort plaintiffs, or within the class of medical malpractice plaintiffs by denying full recovery to those with noneconomic damages exceeding $250,000 . The legislature's decision to limit the application of 3333.2 to medical malpractice cases, and within those cases to those with large noneconomic damages awards, the court reasoned, was a rational response to escalating malpractice insurance rates. 
 California thus joins Indiana as the only two States to uphold the constitutionality of this type of medical malpractice damages limits. See Johnson v. St. Vincent Hospital, Inc., 273 Ind. 374, 404 N.E.2d 585, 598- 601 (1980). Four other States which have addressed similar damages limitations have invalidated the challenged provisions on federal constitutional grounds. Baptist Hospital of Southeast Texas v. Baber, 672 S.W.2d 296, 298 (Tex.App.1984) ($500,000 limit on damages other than medical expenses); Carson v. Maurer, 120 N.H. 925, 941-943, 424 A.2d 825, 836-838 (1980) ($250,000 limit on ""noneconomic"" damages); Arneson v. Olsen, 270 N.W.2d 125, 135-136 (N.D.1978) ($300,000 limit on total damages ); Simon v. St. Elizabeth Medical Center, 3 Ohio Op.3d 164, 166, 355 N.E. 2d 903, 906-907 (Com.Pl.1976) ($200,000 limit on ""general"" damages).* [474 U.S. 892 , 894]

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151 (1983) (actions brought under 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 185, are governed by the 6-month statute of limitations provided in 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S.C. 160(b)), was not to be applied retroactively because such retroactive application would shorten the applicable limitations period. Cf. Glover v. United Grocers, Inc., 746 F.2d 1380 (CA9 1984) (applying DelCostello retroactively when doing so lengthened time for filing). In so holding, the Court of Appeals followed a prior decision in that court that relied on the factors outlined in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U.S. 97, 106-107, 355-356 (1971), in deciding this retroactivity question. See Barina v. Gulf Trading & Transportation Co., 726 F.2d 560, 563-564 (CA9 1984). 
 The decision below conflicts with those in other Circuits which have held that DelCostello should be applied retroactively. See, e.g., Smith v. General Motors Corp., 747 F.2d 372 (CA6 1984) (en banc); Graves v. Smith's Transfer Corp., 736 F.2d 819 (CA1 1984).

 Petitioner in this case seeks no revolutionary expansion of the principles underlying this Court's current death-penalty jurisprudence. All he asks is the benefit of existing law as proclaimed by a majority of this Court. This Court has declared that a sentence of death may not be imposed on one ""who aids and abets a felony in the course of which a murder is committed by others but who does not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal force will be employed."" Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 797, 3376 (1982). Yet the Court's refusal to consider petitioner's case countenances just that result. Even if I believed, therefore, that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances,1 I would grant certiorari in this case and vacate the death sentence imposed here.

 At his murder trial, petitioner Darryl Elroy Stewart and his accomplice Kelvin Kelly provided conflicting theories about the crime. According to Stewart's statement, which the State introduced at trial, he and Kelly were walking past the deceased's apartment when Kelly saw through the open door a stereo that he wanted to steal. Kelly told Stewart that he was going to run in and grab the stereo, and instructed Stewart to stand guard at the door. Stewart heard a woman scream; heard Kelly attempt to force sexual relations on her; saw glimpses of a struggle; and heard two shots. Thus, Stewart's statement indicated that he agreed to assist in Kelly's theft of the stereo; that Kelly strayed from the plan to steal the stereo and attempted to commit a sexual offense against the occupant of the apartment; and that during the course of this offense Kelly killed the victim. If Stewart's account of the crime is accepted, he did not himself kill, did not attempt to kill, and did not intend that a killing would take place. According to Kelly, however, it was Stewart who entered the apartment to commit burglary, Stewart who had the gun, Stewart who attempted a sexual assault on the victim, and Stewart who killed her, while Kelly waited at the door; the State introduced some evidence corroborating this story. Kelly was promised, in exchange for his testimony, that he would receive no more than 50 years in prison.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 7, 1985
 Rehearing Denied Dec. 2, 1985. 
 See 474 U.S. 1015. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Louisiana. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice BLACKMUN join, dissenting. 
 Once again this Court has declined to correct an error of constitutional magnitude with a defendant's life in the balance. The petitioner's death sentence was unconstitutionally imposed under last Term's decision in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320 (1985), and this Court's refusal to vacate that sentence is an unwarranted departure from procedures that we follow routinely in the most insignificant case. 
 I  
 The petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder. At the sentencing phase of his trial, his counsel attempted to impress upon the jury the significance of its role, in light of the growing number of executions in Louisiana and the Nation as a whole. Counsel admonished the jurors that, should they decide upon the death penalty, they should "" 'give it with the appreciation that it'll be carried out.' "" 464 So.2d 262, 266 (La.1985). The prosecutor responded by arguing to the jury: 
 "" 'Though it's difficult to stand before you ladies and gentlemen and ask you to consider imposing upon anyone the pen- 
Page 474 U.S. 873 , 874
 alty of death, but in order to make your task easier, we'll state for you that first of all, you have a solemn obligation to live up to your oath. Second of all, that whatever you decide will be recommendations-and recommendations to the Judge, for the Judge to impose the death penalty. It will be the Judge that sentences this defendant to whatever the sentence might be. You make recommendations.' "" Ibid. 
 The jury sentenced petitioner to death. 
 II  
 After the Louisiana Supreme Court had affirmed petitioner's conviction and death sentence, and after his petition for certiorari had been filed, this Court decided Caldwell.* There, the Court held that ""it is constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant's death rests elsewhere."" 472 U.S., at 328-329. In Caldwell, the prosecutor argued to the jury that the State Supreme Court would automatically review the death sentence. This Court noted that the jury might not understand the limits on appellate review, and might conclude that the ultimate determination of the appropriateness of a death sentence for that defendant would lie with the court. Id., at 330-331. Furthermore, whether or not the jury was misled as to the appellate court's function, it might decide to ""delegate"" its responsibility to the court. Id., at 332. 
 In the present case, we need not speculate about the misleading nature of the prosecutor's argument, for it flatly misstated Louisiana law . In Louisiana, a jury's decision in favor of death is binding on the court. La.Code Crim.Proc.Ann., Art. 905.8 (West 1984). Thus, the prosecutor's argument in this case was not an ""accurate statement of a potential sentencing alternative,"" as in California v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992, 1009, 3457 (1983); cf. Caldwell, supra, 472 U.S., at 342 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Rather, the prosecutor's argument urged the jury [474 U.S. 873 , 875]

 Robert PATTENv. FLORIDA.No. 84-6873 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 7, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN dissenting: 
 Adhering to my views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the judgment below so that the court below can determine the sentence-other than death-that may be appropriate. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. [ Patten v. Florida 474 U.S. 876 (1985) ][876-Continued.] 
 I continue to adhere to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). I also continue to believe that the death penalty's cruel and unusual nature is made all the more arbitrary when it is imposed by a judge in the face of a jury determination that death is an inappropriate punishment. See Jones v. Alabama, 470 U.S. 1062, 1063, 1780 (1985) ( MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447, 481-490, 3173-3178 (1984) ( STEVENS, J., dissenting). However, even were I to believe that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances and that a jury decision for life could be accorded mere advisory status, I would grant certiorari in this case to decide whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the State from forcing a defendant to face a second sentencing jury even though the presumptive validity of his first jury's life recommendation has never been overcome. 
 I  
 Petitioner Robert Patten was convicted of first-degree murder, and the State sought the death penalty. During subsequent sentencing deliberations, the jury advised the trial judge that they were deadlocked, 6 to 6; the note concluded: ""What now?"" Over petitioner's objections, the judge responded by giving an Allen charge encouraging further deliberations. [Footnote 1] After continued deliberations, the jury returned with a 7- to-5 recommendation for death. The court imposed the death sentence. On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction. 467 
Page 474 U.S. 876 , 877
 So.2d 975 (1985). It emphasized, however, that under Florida law, ""if seven jurors do not vote to recommend death, then the recommendation is life imprisonment."" Rose v. State, 425 So.2d 521, 525 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 909 (1983). The court consequently found the giving of the Allen charge improper and vacated the death sentence. At this point, though, rather than instructing the trial judge to determine whether it would be appropriate to enter a death sentence regardless of the jury's action, the court chose to remand the case to the trial court for a new sentencing proceeding before a jury. In his motion for rehearing, petitioner urged that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred a second sentencing proceeding. That motion was denied. 
 II  
 In Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U.S. 430 (1981), this Court held that because Missouri's capital sentencing proceeding was comparable to a trial, in which a life sentence constituted a determination that the prosecution had failed to prove its case, the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from subjecting a defendant who had received a life sentence in his first trial to the ordeal of a second sentencing proceeding after his conviction had been reversed. In Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.S. 203 (1984), where a life sentence had been imposed by a judge rather than a jury, the Court found that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred resentencing even though the judge's decision to grant life had been based upon what was later held to be a misinterpretation of state law. ""[A]n acquittal on the merits by the sole decisionmaker in the proceeding is final and bars retrial on the same charge."" Id., at 211, 104 S.Ct. at 2310. 
 In Florida, the jury is not the sole decisionmaker in the sentencing proceedings; the trial judge has the power to override a jury's recommendation for life. See Spaziano v. Florida, supra. Yet the defendant who has persuaded a jury to reject the State's claim that he deserves to die has nonetheless won a significant victory, for Florida has severely limited the trial judge's power to override a life recommendation . In Tedder v. State, 322 So.2d 908 (1975), the Florida Supreme Court held an override to be appropriate only where the ""facts suggesting a sentence of death [are] so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ."" Id., at 910; accord, Odom v. State, 403 So.2d 936, 942 (Fla.1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 925 (1982). Thus, while the life recommendation of a Florida jury does not have the conclusive [474 U.S. 876 , 878]

 Justice BRENNAN dissenting: 
 Adhering to my views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the judgment below so that the court below can determine the sentence-other than death-that may be appropriate. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. [ Patten v. Florida 474 U.S. 876 (1985) ][876-Continued.] 
 I continue to adhere to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). I also continue to believe that the death penalty's cruel and unusual nature is made all the more arbitrary when it is imposed by a judge in the face of a jury determination that death is an inappropriate punishment. See Jones v. Alabama, 470 U.S. 1062, 1063, 1780 (1985) ( MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447, 481-490, 3173-3178 (1984) ( STEVENS, J., dissenting). However, even were I to believe that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances and that a jury decision for life could be accorded mere advisory status, I would grant certiorari in this case to decide whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the State from forcing a defendant to face a second sentencing jury even though the presumptive validity of his first jury's life recommendation has never been overcome. 
 I  
 Petitioner Robert Patten was convicted of first-degree murder, and the State sought the death penalty. During subsequent sentencing deliberations, the jury advised the trial judge that they were deadlocked, 6 to 6; the note concluded: ""What now?"" Over petitioner's objections, the judge responded by giving an Allen charge encouraging further deliberations. [Footnote 1] After continued deliberations, the jury returned with a 7- to-5 recommendation for death. The court imposed the death sentence. On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction. 467 
Page 474 U.S. 876 , 877
 So.2d 975 (1985). It emphasized, however, that under Florida law, ""if seven jurors do not vote to recommend death, then the recommendation is life imprisonment."" Rose v. State, 425 So.2d 521, 525 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 909 (1983). The court consequently found the giving of the Allen charge improper and vacated the death sentence. At this point, though, rather than instructing the trial judge to determine whether it would be appropriate to enter a death sentence regardless of the jury's action, the court chose to remand the case to the trial court for a new sentencing proceeding before a jury. In his motion for rehearing, petitioner urged that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred a second sentencing proceeding. That motion was denied. 
 II  
 In Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U.S. 430 (1981), this Court held that because Missouri's capital sentencing proceeding was comparable to a trial, in which a life sentence constituted a determination that the prosecution had failed to prove its case, the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from subjecting a defendant who had received a life sentence in his first trial to the ordeal of a second sentencing proceeding after his conviction had been reversed. In Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.S. 203 (1984), where a life sentence had been imposed by a judge rather than a jury, the Court found that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred resentencing even though the judge's decision to grant life had been based upon what was later held to be a misinterpretation of state law. ""[A]n acquittal on the merits by the sole decisionmaker in the proceeding is final and bars retrial on the same charge."" Id., at 211, 104 S.Ct. at 2310. 
 In Florida, the jury is not the sole decisionmaker in the sentencing proceedings; the trial judge has the power to override a jury's recommendation for life. See Spaziano v. Florida, supra. Yet the defendant who has persuaded a jury to reject the State's claim that he deserves to die has nonetheless won a significant victory, for Florida has severely limited the trial judge's power to override a life recommendation . In Tedder v. State, 322 So.2d 908 (1975), the Florida Supreme Court held an override to be appropriate only where the ""facts suggesting a sentence of death [are] so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ."" Id., at 910; accord, Odom v. State, 403 So.2d 936, 942 (Fla.1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 925 (1982). Thus, while the life recommendation of a Florida jury does not have the conclusive [474 U.S. 876 , 878]

 Charlie L. BURRv. FLORIDA.No. 84-6982 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 7, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 This petition presents the question whether the sentencing jury in a capital case may be prohibited from taking into account its own nagging doubts about the defendant's guilt as it considers whether the defendant deserves to die. The Supreme Court of Florida has squarely resolved that question in the affirmative, despite the clear message of Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978), and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104 (1982), that a capital defendant is entitled to have the jury consider ""any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death."" Lockett, supra, 438 U.S., at 604. [ Burr v. Florida 474 U.S. 879 (1985) ][879-Continued.] 
 Even if I accepted the prevailing view that the death penalty can constitutionally be imposed under certain conditions, I would grant certiorari in this case to consider the grave constitutional question it presents. Today's decision lets stand a ruling that clearly ""creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty."" Lockett, supra, at 605 (opinion of BURGER, C.J.), quoted in Eddings, supra, 455 U.S., at 118 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring). 
 I  
 Petitioner, Charlie Burr, was charged with the murder of a convenience-store clerk during a robbery of the store. At trial, the State's key witness was Burr's girlfriend, Domita Williams, who testified that she had been waiting for Burr outside the store when she heard a shot and then saw Burr come out. The State provided some circumstantial evidence in corroboration. The following day, however, Williams took the stand for the defense and recanted her testimony of the previous day. This time she swore that she had not been with Burr at all on the morning of the murder, and recited a different account of her actions that morning . The defense produced witnesses to support this testimony, including an eyewitness who placed Williams elsewhere at the time of the murder. The defense attempted to establish that Williams' first testimony had been the product of coercion by the prosecutor; the State, in turn, attempted to show that her second testimony was contrived out of fear of petitioner. Without 
Page 474 U.S. 879 , 880
 Williams' first testimony, the State would not have had a case, for while the State introduced evidence implicating Burr in similar robberies of other convenience stores, it adduced no other evidence directly linking Burr with this crime. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. 
 At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel devoted his entire closing argument to the inconclusive nature of the evidence against Burr. Counsel drove home to the jury the fact of Domita Williams' recantation, repeatedly exhorting each juror to ""ask yourself . . ., is it possible that I'm recommending death for an innocent person?"" Suggesting that the guilty verdict might have been based on the evidence of the other robberies, he admonished the jury, ""if you go back and recommend death . . . and Mr. Burr is eventually electrocuted and put to death, then it's going to be a little too late for the truth to come out. . . ."" He concluded, ""don't make a recommendation where a man is going to die when he may not have even committed the crime."" 
 The jury recommended a sentence of life imprisonment. The trial judge, however, overrode this recommendation and sentenced petitioner to death, having identified three aggravating circumstances and nothing in mitigation. Petitioner deduced, and argued on appeal, that the jury's recommendation of life had been based, legitimately, on residual doubt of Burr's guilt. The Florida Supreme Court rejected this argument, concluding that ""a 'convicted defendant cannot be ""a little bit guilty."" ' "" 466 So.2d 1051, 1054 (1985), quoting Buford v. State, 403 So.2d 943, 953 (Fla.1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1164 (1982). 
 II  
 Implicit in the Florida Supreme Court's decision is an assumption about the equation of finality and truth that transgresses law and intuition alike. For our legal system is no pretender to absolute truth. In two important ways, the factfinding process falls short of that ideal. First, the beacon of the truth-seeking process in criminal cases is not absolute certainty, but the ""reasonable doubt"" standard, which has eluded definition by the courts for centuries. See 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence 2497 ( J. Chadbourn rev. 1981). Attempts at such a definition typically, and often erroneously, include phrases such as ""substantial doubt, not a trivial doubt,"" Holland v. United States, 209 F.2d 516, 522 (CA10), aff'd, 348 U.S. 121 (1954), and ""substantial, . . . real doubt,"" Taylor [474 U.S. 879 , 881]

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Despite this Court's demand ""for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case,"" Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 305, 2991 ( 1976), the Illinois Supreme Court found there to be no error in the admission of two confessions at petitioner's capital sentencing hearing, without any inquiry having been made as to their reliability. Because those confessions had been obtained in connection with charges to which petitioner had long before pleaded guilty, the court found petitioner precluded from challenging their voluntariness later, when he was fighting for his life.

 I  
 Petitioner George Del Vecchio was convicted in 1979 of murder, rape, deviate sexual assault, and burglary, and the State sought the death penalty. At his capital sentencing hearing, the prosecutor urged as a statutory aggravating factor the fact that in 1965, when he was 16 years old, petitioner had been convicted upon a plea of guilty to charges of murder, robbery, and attempted robbery. The prosecution also sought to introduce two confessions that petitioner had made to those previous crimes; these confessions, made to a police officer and an Assistant District Attorney respectively, contained detailed statements as to petitioner's role in the 1965 crimes. Petitioner moved to suppress these statements at the sentencing hearing on the grounds that they had been induced through physical and psychological coercion and that their use was therefore barred by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The trial court denied this motion, refusing even to conduct a hearing on it. In his closing argument, the prosecutor pointed to the 1965 confessions as evidence that petitioner was a career criminal who did not deserve to live . The jury proceeded to find two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances sufficient to preclude a sentence of death. Petitioner was sentenced to die. 
 In his appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court, petitioner argued that the use of his 1965 confessions without a hearing as to their voluntariness was prejudicial error. The court rejected this claim, concluding:

In Caldwell, the prosecutor had urged the jury not to view its sentence recommendation as determining whether defendant would die because any death sentence would be reviewed by the State Supreme Court. ""The argument was inaccurate, both because it was misleading as to the nature of the appellate court's review and because it depicted the jury's role in a way fundamentally at odds with the role that a capital sentencer must perform."" Id., at 336. 
 Justice BLACKMUN would grant the petition for writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Supreme Court of South Carolina for further consideration in light of Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320 (1985). 
 I believe the facts of this case similarly demand reversal. At petitioner's sentencing hearing, the prosecutor set the stage for the trial judge's instructions, noting: 
 "" 'He will explain to you about the mitigating parts, things that the defense will say you should consider in imposing life imprisonment. 
 "" 'And even behind all of that there are many safeguards built into this law. There are many many guidelines, safeguards for the defendant's benefit. And I have no problems with that. I agree with that. I want it that way. 
 "" 'We are talking about the ultimate punishment. There are even safeguards that I can't tell you about because the law says I am not suppose [sic] to tell you about them, and I have no problems with that. I am glad it is that way.' "" App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a ( emphasis supplied). 
 The jury returned a recommendation for death, and that sentence was accordingly imposed by the trial court. On appeal, the South Carolina Supreme Court deferred to the ""wide discretion"" of the trial judge "" regarding the propriety of the argument"", id., at 6a, and refused to disturb his ruling. Seven days later, this Court handed down its decision in Caldwell. 
 In Caldwell, the prosecutor's specificity as to the alleged safeguards allowed this Court to assess the degree to which his remarks might have led the jury to ""shift its sense of responsibility to an appellate court."" 472 U.S., at 330. Such an assessment is impossible here because the prosecutor's vague assurances invited jurors to speculate freely as to the extent to which they could share their duty of deciding whether petitioner should die.

 Upon the request of counsel for the petitioner, the application for stay of execution has been considered as a petition for a writ of certiorari. The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. 
 The order of this date denying the application for stay is vacated. The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death is granted pending the sending down of the judgment of this Court. 

 Justice POWELL, concurring in the granting of the application for a stay. 
 My vote is to grant the application for a stay, although I find no merit whatever in any of the claims advanced in the petition for certiorari. All of these claims have been carefully considered and repeatedly rejected by the courts below, including as recently as this afternoon the Federal District Court for the Middle District of Florida, and this evening the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Indeed the petition for certiorari was merely the stay application that had been denied, and restyled on the request of counsel as a petition for certiorari. But in view of the unusual situation in which four Justices have voted to grant certiorari 
Page 473 U.S. 928 , 929
 (doing so without waiting for the Court of Appeals to act on Darden's second federal habeas petition that was before that court this evening), and in view of the fact that this is a capital case with petitioner's life at stake, and further in view of the fact that the Justices are scattered geographically and unable to meet for a Conference, I feel obligated to join in granting the application for a stay. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, dissenting. 
 In the 12 years since petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, the issues now raised in the petition for certiorari have been considered by this Court four times, see Darden v. Florida, 430 U.S. 704 (1977) (dismissing certiorari as improvidently granted); Darden v. Wainwright, 467 U.S. 1230 (1984) (denying certiorari); Wainwright v. Darden, 469 U.S. 1202 (1985) (vacating and remanding 725 F.2d 1526 (CA11 1984)); Darden v. Wainwright, 473 U.S. 927 (1985) (order dated September 3, 1985, denying application for stay), and have been passed upon no fewer than 95 times by federal and state court judges. Upon review of the petition and the history of this case, I conclude that no issues are presented that merit plenary review by this Court. Because we abuse our discretion when we accept meritless petitions presenting claims that we rejected only hours ago, I dissent. 
 Justice WHITE, Justice REHNQUIST, and Justice O'CONNOR would deny the application.

|473 u.s. 1315|"City of Riverside v. Rivera
No. A-122
Decided August 28, 1985
473 U.S. 1315

Syllabus 
An application by the city of Riverside and five of its current or former police officers to stay, pending disposition of their petition for certiorari, the Court of Appeals' mandate requiring applicants to pay respondents $245,456.25 in attorney's fees, is granted.  The Court of Appeals had affirmed the fees award made by the District Court, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1988, following a trial in which respondents recovered from applicants a total of $33,350 in damages based on, inter alia, violations of 42 U.S.C.  1983 arising from the conduct of the police in forcibly breaking up a private party that respondents were attending and in arresting some of the respondents.  Applicants' petition for certiorari, as well as the petition for certiorari in another case before this Court, raises a significant question as to whether, in determining the amount of ""a reasonable attorney's fee"" under  1988, the disproportionality between a large attorney's fee award and the amount of monetary damages recovered should be considered.  It is likely that four Members of the Court will vote to grant certiorari in one of the cases and to postpone consideration of the petition in the other pending plenary review of the first.  Moreover, the probability of applicants' succeeding on the merits is substantial.

Syllabus 
An application by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to stay, pending her appeal to the Court of Appeals, the District Court's ""preliminary injunction"" is granted insofar as it required her to promulgate nationwide regulations providing hospitals with rights to immediate review of their individual Medicare reimbursement rates and with enhanced reimbursement for inpatient services.  If the Court of Appeals were to affirm the District Court's use of a ""preliminary injunction"" to require the Secretary to issue nationwide regulations, at least four Members of this Court would probably vote to grant certiorari.  Moreover, it does not appear that the District Court had authority to order such sweeping ""preliminary"" relief, and the ""stay equities"" favor the Secretary.  However, it does not appear likely that four Members of this Court would grant review of the issues presented by that portion of the District Court's order granting preliminary relief to respondent operator of a hospital, which had filed the suit only to challenge the administrative determination of its own Medicare reimbursement rate and to obtain additional reimbursement.  Accordingly, the application for a stay is denied with respect to the latter portion of the District Court's preliminary injunction.

No. A-5
Decided July 5, 1985
473 U.S. 1301

Syllabus 
An application to vacate the Court of Appeals' June 29, 1985, order -- which, inter alia, directed that the July 1, 1985, effective date of certain new regulations of applicant Office of Personnel Management be stayed until further order of that court -- is granted.  A fews days before the effective date of the regulations, which allow federal agencies to give more weight to merit and less weight to seniority in personnel decisions, respondent sought a temporary restraining order blocking implementation of the regulations from the District Court, which denied the requested order but explicitly contemplated a prompt hearing on a preliminary injunction.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals, in addition to staying the effective date of the regulations, ordered that respondent's emergency motion for injunctive relief from that court be held in abeyance, and that the District Court decide by July 10, 1985, ""any motion for a preliminary injunction.""  The established rule is that denials of temporary restraining orders are ordinarily not appealable, and the Court of Appeals erred in reasoning that, because a hearing on a preliminary injunction could not be held before the regulations went into effect, the District Court's denial of the temporary restraining order was tantamount to a denial of a preliminary injunction.  The authorities relied upon by the Court of Appeals relate to grants, rather than, as here, denials of temporary restraining orders.  Thus, the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to review the District Court's denial of the temporary restraining order, and should have dismissed the appeal, thereby allowing respondent to proceed in the District Court on a motion for a preliminary injunction.

No. 83-1569
Argued March 18, 1985
Decided July 2, 1985*
473 U.S. 614

Syllabus 
Petitioner-cross-respondent (hereafter petitioner), a Japanese corporation that manufactures automobiles, is the product of a joint venture between Chrysler International, S.A. (CISA), a Swiss corporation, and another Japanese corporation, aimed at distributing through Chrysler dealers outside the continental United States automobiles manufactured by petitioner.  Respondent-cross-petitioner (hereafter respondent), a Puerto Rico corporation, entered into distribution and sales agreements with CISA.  The sales agreement (to which petitioner was also a party) contained a clause providing for arbitration by the Japan Commercial Arbitration Association of all disputes arising out of certain articles of the agreement or for the breach thereof.  Thereafter, when attempts to work out disputes arising from a slackening of the sale of new automobiles failed, petitioner withheld shipment of automobiles to respondent, which disclaimed responsibility for them.  Petitioner then brought an action in Federal District Court under the Federal Arbitration Act and the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, seeking an order to compel arbitration of the disputes in accordance with the arbitration clause.  Respondent filed an answer and counterclaims, asserting, inter alia, causes of action under the Sherman Act and other statutes.  The District Court ordered arbitration of most of the issues raised in the complaint and counterclaims, including the federal antitrust issues.  Despite the doctrine of American Safety Equipment Corp. v. J. P. & Co., 391 F.2d 821 (CA2), uniformly followed by the Courts of Appeals, that rights conferred by the antitrust laws are inappropriate for enforcement by arbitration, the District Court, relying on Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U. S. 506, held that the international character of the undertaking in question required enforcement of the arbitration clause even as to the antitrust claims.  The Court of Appeals reversed insofar as the District Court ordered submission of the antitrust claims to arbitration.
Held:
1. There is no merit to respondent's contention that, because it falls within the class for whose benefit the statutes specified in the counter-claims 
Page 473 U. S. 615
 were passed, but the arbitration clause at issue does not mention these statutes or statutes in general, the clause cannot be properly read to contemplate arbitration of these statutory claims.  There is no warrant in the Arbitration Act for implying in every contract within its ken a presumption against arbitration of statutory claims.  Nor is there any reason to depart from the federal policy favoring arbitration where a party bound by an arbitration agreement raises claims founded on statutory rights.  Pp.  473 U. S. 624-628.
2. Respondent's antitrust claims are arbitrable pursuant to the Arbitration Act.  Concerns of international comity, respect for the capacities of foreign and transnational tribunals, and sensitivity to the need of the international commercial system for predictability in the resolution of disputes, all require enforcement of the arbitration clause in question even assuming that a contrary result would be forthcoming in a domestic context.  See Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., supra.  The strong presumption in favor of freely negotiated contractual choice-of-forum provisions is reinforced here by the federal policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution, a policy that applies with special force in the field of international commerce.  The mere appearance of an antitrust dispute does not alone warrant invalidation of the selected forum on the undemonstrated assumption that the arbitration clause is tainted.  So too, the potential complexity of antitrust matters does not suffice to ward off arbitration; nor does an arbitration panel pose too great a danger of innate hostility to the constraints on business conduct that antitrust law imposes.  And the importance of the private damages remedy in enforcing the regime of antitrust laws does not compel the conclusion that such remedy may not be sought outside an American court.  Pp.  473 U.

No. 84-48
Argued March 20, 1985
Decided July 2, 1985
473 U.S. 667

Syllabus 
Respondent was indicted on charges of violating federal narcotics and firearms statutes.  Before trial, he filed a discovery motion requesting, inter alia, ""any deals, promises or inducements made to [Government] witnesses in exchange for their testimony.""  The Government's response did not disclose that any ""deals, promises or inducements"" had been made to its two principal witnesses, who had assisted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) in conducting an undercover investigation of respondent.  But the Government did produce signed affidavits by these witnesses recounting their undercover dealing with respondent and concluding with the statement that the affidavits were made without any threats or rewards or promises of reward.  Respondent waived his right to a jury trial and was tried before the District Court.  The two principal Government witnesses testified about both the firearms and narcotics charges, and the court found respondent guilty on the narcotics charges but not guilty on the firearms charges.  Subsequently, in response to requests made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act, respondent received copies of ATF contracts signed by the principal Government witnesses during the undercover investigation and stating that the Government would pay money to the witnesses commensurate with the information furnished.  Respondent then moved to vacate his sentence, alleging that the Government's failure in response to the discovery motion to disclose these contracts, which he could have used to impeach the witnesses, violated his right to due process under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, which held that the prosecution's suppression of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment.  The District Court denied the motion, finding beyond a reasonable doubt that, had the existence of the ATF contracts been disclosed to it during trial, the disclosure would not have affected the outcome, because the principal Government witnesses' testimony was primarily devoted to the firearms charges on which respondent was acquitted, and was exculpatory on the narcotics charges.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Government's failure to disclose the requested impeachment evidence that respondent could have used to conduct an effective cross-examination of the Government's principal 
Page 473 U. S. 668
 witnesses required automatic reversal.  The Court of Appeals also stated that it ""disagree[d]"" with the District Court's conclusion that the nondisclosure was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, noting that the witnesses' testimony was in fact inculpatory on the narcotics charges.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
719 F.2d 1462, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the prosecutor's failure to disclose evidence that could have been used effectively to impeach important Government witnesses requires automatic reversal.  Such nondisclosure constitutes constitutional error and requires reversal of the conviction only if the evidence is material in the sense that its suppression might have affected the outcome of the trial.  Pp.  473 U. S. 674-678.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, delivered an opinion with respect to Part III, concluding that the nondisclosed evidence at issue is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  A ""reasonable probability"" is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.  This standard of materiality is sufficiently flexible to cover cases of prosecutorial failure to disclose evidence favorable to the defense regardless of whether the defense makes no request, a general request, or a specific request.  Although the prosecutor's failure to respond fully to a specific request may impair the adversary process by having the effect of representing to the defense that certain evidence does not exist, this possibility of impairment does not necessitate a different standard of materiality.  Under the standard stated above, the reviewing court may consider directly any adverse effect that the prosecutor's failure to respond might have had on the preparation or presentation of the defendant's case.  Pp.  473 U. S. 678-684.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE REHNQUIST, being of the view that there is no reason to elaborate on the relevance of the specificity of the defense's request for disclosure, either generally or with respect to this case, concluded that reversal was mandated simply because the Court of Appeals failed to apply the ""reasonable probability"" standard of materiality to the nondisclosed evidence in question.  P.  473 U. S. 685.
BLACKMUN, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, in which BURGER, C.J., and WHITE, REHNQUIST, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part III, in which O'CONNOR, J., joined.  WHITE, J., filed

But the Government did produce signed affidavits by these witnesses recounting their undercover dealing with respondent and concluding with the statement that the affidavits were made without any threats or rewards or promises of reward.  Respondent waived his right to a jury trial and was tried before the District Court.  The two principal Government witnesses testified about both the firearms and narcotics charges, and the court found respondent guilty on the narcotics charges but not guilty on the firearms charges.  Subsequently, in response to requests made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act, respondent received copies of ATF contracts signed by the principal Government witnesses during the undercover investigation and stating that the Government would pay money to the witnesses commensurate with the information furnished.  Respondent then moved to vacate his sentence, alleging that the Government's failure in response to the discovery motion to disclose these contracts, which he could have used to impeach the witnesses, violated his right to due process under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, which held that the prosecution's suppression of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment.  The District Court denied the motion, finding beyond a reasonable doubt that, had the existence of the ATF contracts been disclosed to it during trial, the disclosure would not have affected the outcome, because the principal Government witnesses' testimony was primarily devoted to the firearms charges on which respondent was acquitted, and was exculpatory on the narcotics charges.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Government's failure to disclose the requested impeachment evidence that respondent could have used to conduct an effective cross-examination of the Government's principal 
Page 473 U. S. 668
 witnesses required automatic reversal.  The Court of Appeals also stated that it ""disagree[d]"" with the District Court's conclusion that the nondisclosure was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, noting that the witnesses' testimony was in fact inculpatory on the narcotics charges.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
719 F.2d 1462, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the prosecutor's failure to disclose evidence that could have been used effectively to impeach important Government witnesses requires automatic reversal.  Such nondisclosure constitutes constitutional error and requires reversal of the conviction only if the evidence is material in the sense that its suppression might have affected the outcome of the trial.  Pp.  473 U. S. 674-678.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, delivered an opinion with respect to Part III, concluding that the nondisclosed evidence at issue is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  A ""reasonable probability"" is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.  This standard of materiality is sufficiently flexible to cover cases of prosecutorial failure to disclose evidence favorable to the defense regardless of whether the defense makes no request, a general request, or a specific request.  Although the prosecutor's failure to respond fully to a specific request may impair the adversary process by having the effect of representing to the defense that certain evidence does not exist, this possibility of impairment does not necessitate a different standard of materiality.  Under the standard stated above, the reviewing court may consider directly any adverse effect that the prosecutor's failure to respond might have had on the preparation or presentation of the defendant's case.  Pp.  473 U. S. 678-684.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE REHNQUIST, being of the view that there is no reason to elaborate on the relevance of the specificity of the defense's request for disclosure, either generally or with respect to this case, concluded that reversal was mandated simply because the Court of Appeals failed to apply the ""reasonable probability"" standard of materiality to the nondisclosed evidence in question.  P.  473 U. S. 685.

Syllabus 
Article III of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (Agreement), a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact, establishes a procedure by which a prisoner incarcerated in one State (the sending State) may demand the speedy disposition of ""any untried indictment, information or complaint"" that is the basis of the detainer lodged against him by another State (the receiving State).  If the prisoner makes such a demand, Art. III requires the authorities in the receiving State to bring him to trial within 180 days or the court must dismiss the indictment, information, or complaint, and the detainer will cease to be of any force or effect.  Respondent was convicted on criminal charges in New Jersey Superior Court, which imposed prison sentences and a 2-year term of probation to follow imprisonment.  Thereafter, while on probation, respondent was sentenced to prison there.  While he was awaiting trial in Pennsylvania, the New Jersey authorities notified the New Jersey Superior Court that he had violated his probation by committing offenses in Pennsylvania, and that court issued an arrest warrant, which was lodged as a detainer with the corrections officials in Pennsylvania.  Although respondent requested New Jersey officials to make a final disposition of the probation violation charge, that State failed to bring him to trial within 180 days.  Respondent then brought a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court seeking dismissal of the probation violation charge on the basis of New Jersey's noncompliance with Art. III.  The District Court stayed respondent's federal action pending exhaustion of state court remedies.  After the New Jersey courts denied respondent relief under the Agreement, revoked his probation, and resentenced him to a term of imprisonment, the District Court granted respondent's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that an outstanding probation violation charge is an ""untried indictment, information or complaint"" within the meaning of Art. III. 
Page 473 U. S. 717

Held:  Article III does not apply to detainers based on probation violation charges.  Pp.  473 U. S. 724-734.
(a) The language of the Agreement indicates that Art. III applies solely to detainers based on outstanding criminal charges.  Article III, by its terms, applies to detainers based on an ""indictment,"" ""information,"" or ""complaint.""  The most natural interpretation of these terms is that they refer to documents charging an individual with having committed a criminal offense.  This interpretation is reinforced by the adjective ""untried,"" by the requirement that the prisoner promptly be ""brought to trial,"" and by the limitation that the receiving State obtains custody ""only for the purpose of permitting prosecution"" on the charges.  A probation violation charge does not accuse an individual with having committed a criminal offense in the sense of initiating a prosecution.  Although such a charge might be based on the commission of a criminal offense, it does not result in the probationer's being ""prosecuted"" or ""brought to trial"" for that offense.  Nor does it result in the probationer's being ""prosecuted"" or ""brought to trial"" on the offense for which he initially was sentenced to probation, since he already will have been tried and convicted of that offense.  Accordingly, a detainer based on a probation revocation charge does not come within the plain language of the Agreement.  Pp.  473 U. S. 724-726.
(b) The legislative history created by the Council of State Governments, the drafter of the Agreement, does not directly address the issue in this case, and does not support the inference that the Council intended Art. III to apply to detainers based on probation violation charges.  And the congressional history indicates that Congress, which adopted the Agreement, considered it to apply only to detainers based on untried criminal charges.  Pp.  473 U. S. 726-729.
(c) The purposes of the Agreement, including the purpose of enabling prisoners to obtain prompt disposition of charges underlying detainers in order to protect them from the adverse consequences that detainers have on their treatment and rehabilitation, do not compel the conclusion that, contrary to the Agreement's plain language, Art. III was intended to apply to probation violation detainers.  Such purposes are significantly less directly advanced by application of Art. III to probation violation detainers than by its application to criminal charge detainers.  Pp.  473 U. S. 729-734.

No. 83-2148
Argued February 27, 1985
Decided July 2, 1985
473 U.S. 753

Syllabus 
By an 1864 Treaty, certain Indian Tribes (now collectively known as respondent Klamath Indian Tribe) ceded their aboriginal title to certain lands in Oregon to the United States, and a reservation was created securing to the Tribe ""the exclusive right of taking fish in the streams and lakes, included in said reservation.""  The Treaty language has been construed in earlier litigation also to reserve to the Tribe the right to hunt and trap game within the reservation.  No right to hunt or fish outside the reservation was expressly preserved. Subsequently a dispute arose as to the reservation's boundaries, and after lengthy negotiations concerning the value of land that had been erroneously excluded from the reservation, the Tribe and the Government executed a 1901 Cession Agreement (ratified by Congress) under which the Tribe, upon receiving payment from the Government, ceded some of the reservation land to the Government.  The Agreement provided that the Tribe conveyed to the Government ""all their claim, right, title and interest in and to"" the ceded land, and that
""nothing in this agreement shall be construed to deprive [the Tribe] of any benefits to which they are entitled under existing treaties not inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement.""
Tribe members continued to hunt and fish on the ceded lands, apparently without any assertion of regulatory jurisdiction by the State of Oregon.  In 1982, the Tribe instituted this action in Federal District Court against petitioners Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and various state officials, seeking an injunction against interference with tribal members' hunting and fishing activities on such lands (other than ceded lands that are now privately owned).  The District Court entered summary judgment for the Tribe, declaring that the 1901 Agreement did not abrogate the Tribe's 1864 Treaty right to hunt and fish on the ceded lands free from state regulation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  In light of the terms of the 1901 Agreement and the 1864 Treaty, and certain other events in the Tribe's history, the Tribe's exclusive right to hunt and fish on the lands reserved to the Tribe by the 1864 Treaty did not survive as a special right to be free of state regulation in the ceded lands that were outside the reservation after the 1901 Agreement.  Pp.  473 U. S. 766-774. 
Page 473 U. S. 754

(a) The 1864 Treaty's language indicates that the Tribe's right to hunt and fish was restricted to the reservation, and the 1901 Agreement's broad language accomplished a diminution of the reservation boundaries.  No language in the 1901 Agreement evidenced any intent to preserve special off-reservation hunting or fishing rights for the Tribe, and, in light of the 1901 diminution, a silent preservation of off-reservation rights would have been inconsistent with the broad language of cession as well as with the Tribe's 1864 Treaty agreement to remain within the reservation ""unless temporary leave of absence be granted.""  Pp.  473 U. S. 766-770.
(b) Silence in the 1901 Agreement with regard to tribal hunting and fishing rights does not demonstrate an intent to preserve such rights in the ceded land.  The historical record of the lengthy negotiations between the Tribe and the Government provides no reason to reject the presumption that the 1901 Agreement fairly describes the entire understanding between the parties.  Nor does the absence of any payment expressly in compensation for hunting and fishing rights on the ceded lands demonstrate that the parties did not intend to extinguish such rights in 1901.  The Tribe's contention to the contrary rests on its incorrect assumption that the 1864 Treaty created hunting and fishing rights that were separate from and not appurtenant to the reservation.  Pp.  473 U. S. 770-774.

Syllabus 
By Executive Order, participation in the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), a charity drive aimed at federal employees, is limited to voluntary, tax-exempt, nonprofit charitable agencies that provide direct health and welfare services to individuals or their families, and legal defense and political advocacy organizations are specifically excluded.  Participating organizations confine their fundraising activities to a 30-word statement submitted for inclusion in the CFC literature disseminated to federal employees.  Undesignated contributions are distributed on a local level to certain participating organizations, and designated funds are paid directly to the specified recipient.  Respondent legal defense and political advocacy organizations brought an action in Federal District Court challenging their exclusion under the Executive Order on the grounds, inter alia, that the denial of the right to seek designated funds violated their First Amendment right to solicit charitable contributions.  The District Court granted summary judgment in respondents' favor and enjoined the denial of their pending or future applications to participate in the solicitation of designated contributions.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that the Government restrictions in question were not reasonable.
Held:
1. Solicitation in the context of the CFC is speech protected by the First Amendment.  The brief statements in the CFC literature directly advance the speaker's interest in informing readers about its existence and goals.  Moreover, an employee's contribution in response to a request for funds functions as a general expression of support for the recipient and its views.  Although the CFC does not entail direct discourse between the solicitor and the donor, the CFC literature facilitates the dissemination of views and ideas by directing employees to the soliciting agency to obtain more extensive information.  And without the funds obtained from solicitation in various fora, the soliciting organization's continuing ability to communicate ideas and goals may be jeopardized.  Pp.  473 U. S. 797-799.
2. The CFC, rather than the federal workplace, is the relevant forum.  Although, as an initial matter, a speaker must seek access to public property or to private property devoted to public use to evoke First Amendment 
Page 473 U. S. 789
 concerns, forum analysis is not completed merely by identifying the Government property at issue.  Rather, in defining the forum, the focus should be on the access sought by the speaker.  Here, respondents seek access to a particular means of communication, the CFC.  And the CFC is a nonpublic forum.  This conclusion is supported both by the Government's policy in creating the CFC to minimize the disturbance of federal employees while on duty formerly resulting from unlimited ad hoc solicitation activities and by the Government's practice of limiting access to the CFC to those organizations considered appropriate.  Pp.  473 U. S. 799-806.
3. The Government's reasons for excluding respondents from the CFC appear, at least facially, to satisfy the reasonableness standard.  The Government's decision to restrict access to a nonpublic forum need only be reasonable, and the reasonableness must be assessed in the light of the purpose of the forum and all surrounding circumstances.  Here, the President could reasonably conclude that a dollar directly spent on providing food and shelter to the needy is more beneficial than a dollar spent on litigation that might or might not result in aid to the needy.  Moreover, avoiding the appearance of political favoritism is a valid justification for limiting speech in a nonpublic forum.  Respondents' tax-exempt status does not determine the reasonableness of the Government's excluding them from the CFC.  And the record supports an inference that respondents' participation in the CFC would be detrimental to the CFC and disruptive of the federal workplace.  The First Amendment does not forbid a viewpoint-neutral exclusion of speakers who would disrupt a nonpublic forum and hinder its effectiveness for its intended purpose.  Pp.  473 U. S. 806-811.
4. Where the issue whether the Government impermissibly excluded respondents from the CFC because it disagreed with their viewpoints was neither decided below nor fully briefed before this Court, the issue will not be decided by this Court in the first instance, but respondents are free to pursue the issue on remand.

Syllabus 
Petitioner School District adopted two programs -- Shared Time and Community Education -- that provide classes to nonpublic school students at public expense in classrooms located in and leased from the nonpublic schools.  The Shared Time program offers classes during the regular schoolday that are intended to supplement the ""core curriculum"" courses required by the State.  The Shared Time teachers are full-time employees of the public schools, but a ""significant portion"" of them had previously taught in nonpublic schools.  The Community Education program offers classes at the conclusion of the regular schoolday in voluntary courses, some of which are not offered at the public schools but others of which are.  Community Education teachers are part-time public school employees who for the most part are otherwise employed full-time by the same nonpublic school in which their Community Education classes are held.  Of the 41 private schools involved in these programs, 40 are identifiably religious schools.  The students attending both programs are the same students who otherwise attend the particular school in which the classes are held.  Respondent taxpayers filed suit in Federal District Court against the School District and certain state officials, alleging that both programs violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court agreed, entered a judgment for respondents, and enjoined further operation of the programs.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Shared Time and Community Education programs have the ""primary or principal"" effect of advancing religion, and therefore violate the dictates of the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  473 U. S. 381-398.
(a) Even the praiseworthy, secular purpose of providing for the education of schoolchildren cannot validate government aid to parochial schools when the aid has the effect of promoting a single religion or religion generally or when the aid unduly entangles the government in matters religious.  Pp.  473 U. S. 381-383.
(b) The challenged programs have the effect of impermissibly promoting religion in three ways.  First, the state-paid teachers, influenced by the pervasively sectarian nature of the religious schools in which they 
Page 473 U. S. 374
 work, may subtly or overtly indoctrinate the students in particular religious tenets at public expense.  Second, the symbolic union of church and state inherent in the provision of secular state-provided public instruction in the religious school buildings threatens to convey a message of state support for religion to students and to the general public.  Third, the programs in effect subsidize the religious functions of the parochial schools by taking over a substantial portion of their responsibility for teaching secular subjects.  Pp.  473 U.

Syllabus 
New York City uses federal funds received under the Title I program of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to pay the salaries of public school employees who teach in parochial schools in the city.  That program authorized federal financial assistance to local educational institutions to meet the needs of educationally deprived children from low-income families.  The city makes the teacher assignments, and the teachers are supervised by field personnel who monitor the Title I classes.  Appellee city taxpayers brought an action in Federal District Court, alleging that the Title I program administered by the city violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and seeking injunctive relief.  The District Court granted appellants' motion for summary judgment based on the evidentiary record in another case that involved an identical challenge to the city's Title I program, and in which the constitutionality of the program was upheld.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The Title I program administered by New York City, which is similar in a number of respects to that held unconstitutional today in School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball, ante p.  473 U. S. 373, violates the Establishment Clause.  Although the program here could be argued to be distinguishable from that in School District of Grand Rapids on the ground that New York City has adopted a system for monitoring the religious content of publicly funded Title I classes in the religious schools, the supervision would, at best assist, in preventing the Title I program from being used, intentionally or unwittingly, to inculcate the religious beliefs of the surrounding parochial school.  And the program here would, in any event, inevitably result in the excessive entanglement of church and state.  Even where state aid to parochial institutions does not have the primary effect of advancing religion, the provision of such aid may nevertheless violate the Establishment Clause owing to the interaction of church and state in the administration of that aid.  Here, the scope

This pervasive monitoring infringes precisely those Establishment Clause values at the root of the prohibition of excessive entanglement.

473 U.S. 432

Syllabus 
Respondent Cleburne Living Center, Inc. (CLC), which anticipated leasing a certain building for the operation of a group home for the mentally retarded, was informed by petitioner city that a special use permit would be required, the city having concluded that the proposed group home should be classified as a ""hospital for the feebleminded"" under the zoning ordinance covering the area in which the proposed home would be located.  Accordingly, CLC applied for a special use permit, but the City Council, after a public hearing, denied the permit.  CLC and others (also respondents here) then filed suit against the city and a number of its officials, alleging that the zoning ordinance, on its face and as applied, violated the equal protection rights of CLC and its potential residents.  The District Court held the ordinance and its application constitutional.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that mental retardation is a ""quasi-suspect"" classification; that, under the applicable ""heightened scrutiny"" equal protection test, the ordinance was facially invalid because it did not substantially further an important governmental purpose; and that the ordinance was also invalid as applied.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in holding mental retardation a quasi-suspect classification calling for a more exacting standard of judicial review than is normally accorded economic and social legislation.  Pp.  473 U. S. 439-447.
(a) Where individuals in a group affected by a statute have distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests a State has the authority to implement, the Equal Protection Clause requires only that the classification drawn by the statute be rationally related to a legitimate state interest.  When social or economic legislation is at issue, the Equal Protection Clause allows the States wide latitude.  Pp.  473 U. S. 439-442.
(b) Mentally retarded persons, who have a reduced ability to cope with and function in the everyday world, are thus different from other persons, and the States' interest in dealing with and providing for them 
Page 473 U. S. 433
 is plainly a legitimate one.  The distinctive legislative response, both national and state, to the plight of those who are mentally retarded demonstrates not only that they have unique problems, but also that the lawmakers have been addressing their difficulties in a manner that belies a continuing antipathy or prejudice and a corresponding need for more intrusive oversight by the judiciary than is afforded under the normal equal protection standard.  Moreover, the legislative response, which could hardly have occurred and survived without public support, negates any claim that the mentally retarded are politically powerless in the sense that they have no ability to attract the attention of the lawmakers.  The equal protection standard requiring that legislation be rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose affords government the latitude necessary both to pursue policies designed to assist the retarded in realizing their full potential, and to freely and efficiently engage in activities that burden the retarded in what is essentially an incidental manner.  Pp.  473 U. S. 442-447.
2. Requiring a special use permit for the proposed group home here deprives respondents of the equal protection of the laws, and thus it is unnecessary to decide whether the ordinance's permit requirement is facially invalid where the mentally retarded are involved.  Although the mentally retarded, as a group, are different from those who occupy other facilities -- such as boarding houses and hospitals -- that are permitted in the zoning area in question without a special permit, such difference is irrelevant unless the proposed group home would threaten the city's legitimate interests in a way that the permitted uses would not.  The record does not reveal any rational basis for believing that the proposed group home would pose any special threat to the city's legitimate interests.  Requiring the permit in this case appears to rest on an irrational prejudice against the mentally retarded, including those who would occupy the proposed group home and who would live under the closely supervised and highly regulated conditions expressly provided for by state and federal law.  Pp.  473 U. S. 447-450.

Syllabus 
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.  1961-1968, which is directed at ""racketeering activity"" -- defined in  1961(1) to encompass, inter alia, acts ""indictable"" under specific federal criminal provisions, including mail and wire fraud -- provides in  1964(c) for a private civil action to recover treble damages by any person injured in his business or property ""by reason of a violation of section 1962.""  Section 1962(c) prohibits conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise ""through a pattern of racketeering activity.""  Petitioner corporation, which had entered into a joint business venture with respondent company and which believed that it was being cheated by alleged overbilling, filed suit in Federal District Court, asserting, inter alia, RICO claims against respondent company and two of its officers (also respondents) under  1964(c) for alleged violations of  1962(c), based on predicate acts of mail and wire fraud.  The court dismissed the RICO counts for failure to state a claim.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, under  1964(c), a RICO plaintiff must allege a ""racketeering injury"" -- an injury ""caused by an activity which RICO was designed to deter,"" not just an injury occurring as a result of the predicate acts themselves -- and that the complaint was also defective for not alleging that respondents had been convicted of the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud, or of a RICO violation.
Held:
1. There is no requirement that a private action under  1964(c) can proceed only against a defendant who has already been convicted of a predicate act or of a RICO violation.  A prior conviction requirement is not supported by RICO's history, its language, or considerations of policy.  To the contrary, every indication is that no such requirement exists.  Accordingly, the fact that respondents have not been convicted under RICO or the federal mail and wire fraud statutes does not bar petitioner's action.  Pp.  473 U. S. 488-493.
2. Nor is there any requirement that, in order to maintain a private action under  1964(c), the plaintiff must establish a ""racketeering injury,"" not merely an injury resulting from the predicate acts themselves.  A reading of the statute belies any ""racketeering injury"" requirement.  If the defendant engages in a pattern of racketeering activity in a manner 
Page 473 U. S. 480
 forbidden by  1962, and the racketeering activities injure the plaintiff in his business or property, the plaintiff has a claim under  1964(c).  There is no room in the statutory language for an additional, amorphous ""racketeering injury"" requirement.  Where the plaintiff alleges each element of a violation of  1962, the compensable injury necessarily is the harm caused by predicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern, for the essence of the violation is the commission of those acts in connection with the conduct of an enterprise.

There is no room in the statutory language for an additional, amorphous ""racketeering injury"" requirement.  Where the plaintiff alleges each element of a violation of  1962, the compensable injury necessarily is the harm caused by predicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern, for the essence of the violation is the commission of those acts in connection with the conduct of an enterprise.

Syllabus 
Upon her arrival at Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from Bogota, Colombia, respondent was detained by customs officials when after examination of her passport and the contents of her valise and questioning by the officials, she was suspected of being a ""balloon swallower,"" i.e., one who attempts to smuggle narcotics into this country hidden in her alimentary canal.  She was detained incommunicado for almost 16 hours before the officials sought a court order authorizing a pregnancy test (she having claimed to be pregnant), an x-ray, and a rectal examination.  During those 16 hours, she was given the option of returning to Colombia on the next available flight, agreeing to an x-ray, or remaining in detention until she produced a monitored bowel movement.  She chose the first option, but the officials were unable to place her on the next flight, and she refused to use the toilet facilities.  Pursuant to the court order, a pregnancy test was conducted at a hospital and proved negative, and a rectal examination resulted in the obtaining of 88 cocaine-filled balloons that had been smuggled in her alimentary canal.  Subsequently, after a suppression hearing, the District Court admitted the cocaine in evidence against respondent, and she was convicted of various federal narcotics offenses.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's detention violated the Fourth Amendment because the customs officials did not have a ""clear indication"" of alimentary canal smuggling at the time respondent was detained.
Held:  The detention of a traveler at the border, beyond the scope of a routine customs search and inspection, is justified at its inception if customs agents, considering all the facts surrounding the traveler and her trip, reasonably suspect that the traveler is smuggling contraband in her alimentary canal; here, the facts, and their rational inferences, known to the customs officials clearly supported a reasonable suspicion that respondent was an alimentary canal smuggler.  Pp.  473 U. S. 536-544.
(a) The Fourth Amendment's emphasis upon reasonableness is not consistent with the creation of a ""clear indication"" standard to cover a case such as this as an intermediate standard between ""reasonable suspicion"" and ""probable cause.""  Pp.  473 U. S. 537-541.
(b) The ""reasonable suspicion"" standard effects a needed balance between private and public interests when law enforcement officials must 
Page 473 U. S. 532
 make a limited intrusion on less than probable cause.  It thus fits well into situations involving alimentary canal smuggling at the border:  this type of smuggling gives no external signs, and inspectors will rarely possess probable cause to arrest or search, yet governmental interests in stopping smuggling at the border are high.  Pp.  473 U. S. 541-542.
(c) Under the circumstances, respondent's detention, while long, uncomfortable, and humiliating, was not unreasonably long.  Alimentary canal smuggling cannot be detected in the amount of time in which other illegal activity may be investigated through brief stops.  When respondent refused an x-ray as an alternative to simply awaiting her bowel movement, the customs inspectors were left with only two practical alternatives:  detain her for such time as necessary to confirm their suspicions or turn her loose into the interior of the country carrying the reasonably suspected contraband drugs.  Moreover, both the length of respondent's detention and its discomfort resulted solely from the method that she chose to smuggle illicit drugs into this country.  And in the presence of an articulable suspicion of alimentary canal smuggling, the customs officials were not required by the Fourth Amendment to pass respondent and her cocaine-filled balloons into the interior.

Syllabus 
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) requires manufacturers of pesticides, as a precondition for registering a pesticide, to submit research data to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerning the product's health, safety, and environmental effects, and authorizes EPA to use previously submitted data in considering an application for registration of a similar product by another registrant (""follow-on"" registrant).  Section 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) of FIFRA authorizes EPA to consider certain previously submitted data only if the ""follow-on"" registrant has offered to compensate the original registrant for use of the data, and provides for binding arbitration if the registrants fail to agree on compensation.  The arbitrator's decision is subject to judicial review only for ""fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct.""  Appellees, firms engaged in the development and marketing of chemicals used to manufacture pesticides, instituted proceedings in Federal District Court to challenge, inter alia, the constitutionality of the arbitration provisions on the ground that they violate Article III of the Constitution by allocating to arbitrators the functions of judicial officers and by limiting review by an Article III court.  Appellees alleged that EPA had considered their research data in support of other registration applications, that one of the appellees (Stauffer Co.) had invoked the arbitration provisions of  3(c)(1)(D)(ii) against a ""follow-on"" registrant, and that the arbitration award fell short of the compensation to which Stauffer Co. was entitled.  The District Court held that the claims challenging the arbitration provisions were ripe for decision, and that those provisions violated Article III.
Held:
1. Appellees' Article III claims demonstrate sufficient ripeness to establish a concrete case or controversy.  Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, distinguished.  Appellees have an independent right to adjudication of their compensation claims in a constitutionally proper forum; their claim does not depend on the outcome of a given arbitration.  It is sufficient for purposes of a claim under Article III challenging a tribunal's jurisdiction that the claimant demonstrate it has been or inevitably 
Page 473 U. S. 569
 will be subjected to an exercise of such unconstitutional jurisdiction.  In addition, the issue here is purely legal, and will not be clarified by further factual development.  Appellees have standing to contest EPA's issuance of ""follow-on"" registrations pursuant to what they contend is an unconstitutional statutory provision.  Pp.  473 U. S. 579-582.
2. Article III does not prohibit Congress from selecting binding arbitration with only limited judicial review as the mechanism for resolving disputes among participants in FIFRA's pesticide registration scheme.  Pp.  473 U. S. 582-593
(a) The Constitution does not require every federal question arising under the federal law to be tried in an Article III court before a judge enjoying life tenure and protection against salary reduction.  Congress is not barred from acting pursuant to its Article I powers to vest decisionmaking authority in tribunals that lack the attributes of Article III courts.  Pp.  473 U. S. 582-584.
(b) Any right to compensation from ""follow-on"" registrants under  3(c)(1)(D)(ii) for EPA's use of data arises under FIFRA, and does not depend on or replace a right to such compensation under state law.  Thus, the holding in Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50 -- that Congress may not vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate a traditional contract action arising under state law, without the litigants' consent, and subject only to ordinary appellate review -- is not controlling here.  Nor do this Court's decisions support appellees' contentions that Article III adjudication or review is required because FIFRA confers a ""private right"" to compensation (as distinguished from a ""public right""), or that the right to an Article III forum is absolute unless the Federal Government is a party of record.  Pp.  473 U. S. 584-586.
(c) Practical attention to substance, rather than doctrinaire reliance on formal categories, should inform application of Article III.  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22.  If the identity of the parties alone determined the requirements of Article III, under appellees' theory, the constitutionality of many quasi-adjudicative activities carried on by administrative agencies involving claims between individuals would be thrown into doubt.  In essence, the ""public rights"" doctrine reflects simply a pragmatic understanding that, when Congress selects a quasijudicial method of resolving matters that could be conclusively determined by the Executive and Legislative Branches, the danger of encroaching on the judicial powers is reduced.  Pp.  473 U. S. 586-589.
(d) Several aspects of FIFRA establish that the arbitration scheme adopted by Congress does not contravene Article III.  The right created by FIFRA as to use of a registrant's data to support a ""follow-on"" registration is not a purely ""private"" right, but bears many of the characteristics 
Page 473 U. S. 570
 of a ""public"" right.  Congress has the power, under Article I, to authorize an agency administering a complex regulatory scheme to allocate costs and benefits among voluntary participants in the program without providing an Article III adjudication.  The arbitration scheme is necessary as a pragmatic solution to the difficult problem of spreading the costs of generating adequate information regarding the safety, health, and environmental impact of a potentially dangerous product.  Additionally, the scheme contains its own sanctions and subjects no unwilling defendant to judicial enforcement power.  Given the nature of the right at issue and the concerns motivating Congress, the arbitration system does not threaten the independent role of the judiciary in the constitutional scheme.  In the circumstances, the limited Article III review of the arbitration proceeding preserves the appropriate exercise of the judicial function.  Pp.  473 U. S. 589-593.
3. Appellees' alternative Article I claim that FIFRA's standard for compensation is so vague as to be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers was neither adequately briefed nor argued to this Court, and was not fully litigated before the District Court.  Therefore, the issue is left open for determination on remand.  P.  473 U. S. 593.

Syllabus 
In respondents' private civil action brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.  1961-1968, they alleged that petitioner bank and several of its officers had fraudulently charged excessive interest rates on loans to respondents, and that the scheme to defraud, which was carried on through the mails, violated  1962(c), in that the mailings constituted a pattern of racketeering activity by means of which petitioners conducted, or participated in the conduct of, the bank.  The only injuries alleged were the excessive interest charges themselves.  The District Court dismissed on the ground that the complaint did not state a claim, but the Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part.
Held:
1. In their brief and at oral argument, petitioners raised the issue -- not raised or addressed below and not included in the question presented by their petition for certiorari -- that respondents' complaint did not adequately allege a violation of  1962(c) because they had not shown that the enterprise was ""conducted"" through a pattern of racketeering activity.  The issue will not be considered, in view of this Court's Rule 21.1(a) that only the question set forth in the petition for certiorari or fairly included therein will be considered.
2. There is no merit to petitioners' argument that respondents' injury must flow not from the predicate offenses, prescribed in the statute, but from the fact that they were performed as part of the conduct of an enterprise.

 DATA GENERAL CORPORATIONv. DIGIDYNE CORPORATION, et alNo. 84-761 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 1, 1985
 Rehearing Denied Aug. 28, 1985. 
 See 473 U.S. 926. 
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner in this case manufactured and sold a central processing unit for computers known as NOVA. Petitioner also created and sold a copyrighted operating system for NOVA called RDOS. RDOS was a very popular operating system, but petitioner's licensing agreement prevented customers from using it with any central processing unit other than petitioner's NOVA. [ Data General Corp. v. Digidyne Corp. 473 U.S. 908 (1985) ][908-Continued.] 
 Respondents sued, claiming that petitioner's marketing strategy amounted to an illegal tie-in in violation of the antitrust laws. After a jury trial, the District Court granted petitioner's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, defining the appropriate market as the "" market for general purpose minicomputers and microprocessors."" In re Data General Antitrust Litigation, 529 F.Supp. 801, 821 (ND Cal.1981). No reasonable juror could find, the court determined, that within this large and dynamic market with much larger competitors petitioner had the market power to restrain trade through an illegal tie-in arrangement. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and reinstated the jury verdict in favor of respondents. 734 F.2d 1336 (1984). The court concluded that the tying arrangement was illegal per se, because petitioner's RDOS operating system was sufficiently unique and desirable to an appreciable number of buyers to enable petitioner to force those consumers to buy its tied product, the NOVA central processing unit. 
 The Court of Appeals' decision in this case is suspect on several grounds. As we have consistently explained, a particular tying arrangement may have procompetitive justifications, and it is thus inappropriate to condemn such an arrangement without considerable market analysis. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 104, n. 26, 2961-2962, n. 26, 82 L. Ed.2d 70 (1984); Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 11-14, 1558-1559 (1984). Anticompetitive forcing only exists if consumers are forced to buy a tied product as a result of the

 sellers' market power, not simply because of the desirability of the package. Id., at 24-25, 104 S.Ct. at 1564-1565. The Court of Appeals looked to market power over ""locked in"" customers who had already purchased petitioner's wares, viewed the copyright on the operating system as creating a presumption of market power, and seemingly concluded that forcing power is sufficiently established to demonstrate per se antitrust liability if some buyers find the tying product unique and desirable. 
 Drawing distinctions between the permissible and the forbidden in this area is difficult, and the posture of this case-a jury verdict overturned by the District Court but reinstated on appeal-creates an additional layer of complexity, since each court below took a different view of what facts were relevant. Nonetheless, this case raises several substantial questions of antitrust law and policy, including what constitutes forcing power in the absence of a large share of the general market, whether market power over ""locked in"" customers must be analyzed at the outset of the original decision to purchase, and what effect should be given to the existence of a copyright or other legal monopoly in determining market power. 
 At stake is more than the resolution of this single controversy or even the clarification of what may seem at times to be a collection of arcane legal distinctions. In the highly competitive, multibillion dollar a year computer industry, bundling of software and hardware, or of operating systems and central processing units, is somewhat common, and any differentiated product is especially attractive to some buyers. The reach of the decision in this case is potentially enormous, and as the United States strongly urges us to do, I would grant certiorari to address the substantial issues of federal law presented.

 DATA GENERAL CORPORATIONv. DIGIDYNE CORPORATION, et alNo. 84-761 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 1, 1985
 Rehearing Denied Aug. 28, 1985. 
 See 473 U.S. 926. 
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner in this case manufactured and sold a central processing unit for computers known as NOVA. Petitioner also created and sold a copyrighted operating system for NOVA called RDOS. RDOS was a very popular operating system, but petitioner's licensing agreement prevented customers from using it with any central processing unit other than petitioner's NOVA. [ Data General Corp. v. Digidyne Corp. 473 U.S. 908 (1985) ][908-Continued.] 
 Respondents sued, claiming that petitioner's marketing strategy amounted to an illegal tie-in in violation of the antitrust laws. After a jury trial, the District Court granted petitioner's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, defining the appropriate market as the "" market for general purpose minicomputers and microprocessors."" In re Data General Antitrust Litigation, 529 F.Supp. 801, 821 (ND Cal.1981). No reasonable juror could find, the court determined, that within this large and dynamic market with much larger competitors petitioner had the market power to restrain trade through an illegal tie-in arrangement. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and reinstated the jury verdict in favor of respondents. 734 F.2d 1336 (1984). The court concluded that the tying arrangement was illegal per se, because petitioner's RDOS operating system was sufficiently unique and desirable to an appreciable number of buyers to enable petitioner to force those consumers to buy its tied product, the NOVA central processing unit. 
 The Court of Appeals' decision in this case is suspect on several grounds. As we have consistently explained, a particular tying arrangement may have procompetitive justifications, and it is thus inappropriate to condemn such an arrangement without considerable market analysis. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 104, n. 26, 2961-2962, n. 26, 82 L. Ed.2d 70 (1984); Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v.

 CITY OF NORTH MUSKEGON et al.v. Richard BRIGGSNo. 84-1230 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 1, 1985
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 In 1977, respondent Briggs, then a married police officer separated from his wife, maintained an intimate relationship with a woman married to another man, and moved into an apartment 
Page 473 U.S. 909 , 910
 with her. After this living arrangement was brought to the attention of the Police Chief, respondent was suspended from the Police Department for conduct unbecoming an officer. When respondent continued his conduct, he was informed that it violated state law, and he was discharged. The disciplinary sanctions were upheld by petitioner city's City Council. 
 Respondent sued, claiming that his discharge amounted to an unlawful violation of his civil rights. 563 F.Supp. 585 (WD Mich.1984). The District Court and Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejected the argument that respondent's activities were prohibited by state statutes forbidding adultery and lewd and lascivious cohabitation. Those courts also found that respondent's fundamental right of sexual privacy was infringed. Respondent was awarded $35,000 in compensatory damages, and this award was upheld on appeal. 746 F.2d 1475 (1984). 
 The decision below stands in marked contrast to that issued by another Federal Court of Appeals. In Shawgo v. Spradlin, 701 F.2d 470 (5 Cir.1983), cert. denied sub nom., Whisenhunt v. Spradlin, 464 U.S. 965 (1983), the Fifth Circuit held that unmarried police officers could be disciplined for cohabiting with each other. Despite that in Shawgo there was no allegation of violation of state law, the Court of Appeals there ruled that any right to privacy implicated was qualified and was overridden by the governmental interests at stake in running a police department. 
 The difference between the approaches of these two federal courts is evidence of a broader disagreement over whether extra-marital sexual activity, including allegedly unlawful adulterous activity, is constitutionally protected in a way that forbids public employers to discipline employees who engage in such activity. Compare, e.g., Baron v. Meloni, 556 F.Supp. 796 (WD NY 1983); Suddarth v. Slane, 539 F.Supp. 612 ( WD Va.1982); Johnson v. San Jacinto Junior College, 498 F.Supp. 555 (SD Tex.1980), with Baker v. Wade, 553 F.Supp. 1121, 1140 (ND Tex.1982); New York v. Onofre, 51 N.Y.2d 476, 487, 434 N.Y.S.2d 947, 949, 415 N.E.2d 936, 940 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 987 ( 1981); Drake v. Covington County Board of Education, 371 F.Supp. 974, 978- 979 (MD Ala.1974) (three-judge court). 
 This case presents an important issue of constitutional law regarding the contours of the right of privacy afforded individuals for sexual matters. It is an issue over which courts are divided, and I would grant certiorari to address it squarely.

 July 1, 1985
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Tennessee, Eastern Division. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 At the sentencing stage of a capital proceeding, Tennessee requires a capital defendant to prove that any mitigating circum- 
Page 473 U.S. 911 , 912
 stances he has established outweigh any aggravating circumstances the State has proved. State law provides: 
 Sentencing juries are instructed that the defendant's failure to carry this burden requires automatic imposition of a death sentence. As the State Supreme Court has held: ""[I]f the State does prove an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, then unless the jury finds that mitigation exists and outweighs the aggravating circumstance, it can only impose the death penalty."" State v. Melson, 638 S.W.2d 342, 366 (Tenn.1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1137 (1983). The jury in this case was so instructed. 
 I continue to believe such instructions and statutes are inconsistent with the Court's Eighth Amendment precedents.* They impermissibly suggest to the jury a more limited role than the Eighth Amendment requires it to play. A jury must always be free to confront the ultimate question whether "" 'death is the appropriate punishment' "" in the specific case, even where mitigating factors do not outweigh aggravating factors. Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 601, 2963 ( 1978) (plurality opinion) (quoting Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 305, 2991 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.). The jury may wish to vote for life out of a desire to render mercy, or it may believe that the death penalty is simply inappropriate for the specific crime the defendant has committed. These factors are properly part of the sentencing process. ""[T]he sentencing process must permit consideration of the 'character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death.'""

 Allen Lee DAVISv. FLORIDANo. 84-6520 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 1, 1985
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was charged with the brutal beating and shooting of a woman and her two young daughters in Duval County, Florida. The murders and petitioner's arrest were the subject of enormous pretrial publicity in the Duval County area. The major local newspapers carried numerous stories on the crime and the details of petitioner's arrest, and many minutes of prime-time news coverage were devoted to the subject. Among the specific and prejudicial facts disclosed by this pretrial publicity were that petitioner had failed a lie detector test, that he had a history of violent crime, that he was on parole at the time of his arrest, that he had admitted being in the victim's home around the time of the murders, and that particular pieces of evidence appeared to link petitioner to the crimes. 
 Based on the substantial showing of prejudicial pretrial publicity he had made, petitioner moved for a change of venue. Attached to this motion were affidavits from 15 Duval County attorneys who believed the extent and nature of the pretrial publicity would make it impossible for petitioner to receive a fair and impartial jury in Duval County. Petitioner also moved for individual and sequestered voir dire, and the trial judge deferred ruling on the change-of-venue motion until after voir dire was completed. During voir dire, at least 10 of the 40 veniremen admitted having prior knowledge about the case. The trial judge, however, re- 
Page 473 U.S. 913 , 914
 fused to allow these jurors to be questioned individually and, as a result, defense counsel was precluded from learning the specific information they had heard or read. To have pursued such a line of questioning in front of the entire jury pool undoubtedly would have contaminated the remainder of the venire. After the group voir dire, the trial court denied the change- of-venue motion. Four of the veniremen who admitted to prior knowledge of the case ultimately sat on the jury that convicted petitioner and sentenced him to death. 
 Petitioner argues that the refusal to grant individual voir dire in the circumstances of this case violated his Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury. I recognize that ""exposure to information about a state defendant's prior convictions or to news accounts of the crime with which he is charged [does not] alone presumptively depriv[e] the defendant of due process."" Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794, 799, 2036 (1975). ""It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court."" Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 723, 1643 (1961). The question here, however, is not whether the jury actually was biased against petitioner, but whether he was unconstitutionally deprived of the opportunity to uncover such bias and to exercise his for-cause challenges to root it out. The right to an impartial jury encompasses the right to take reasonable steps designed to insure that the jury is impartial. See, e.g., Groppi v. Wisconsin, 400 U.S. 505 (1971); Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333 (1966); Aldridge v. United States, 283 U.S. 308 (1931); see also Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.S. 524, 532, 853 (1973) ( opinion of MARSHALL, J.). Moreover, the informed exercise of jury challenges is an essential element in insuring jury impartiality. Indeed, the first Justice Harlan, speaking for a unanimous Court, called the right to challenge ""one of the most important of the rights secured to the accused"" and concluded that ""[a]ny system for the empanelling of a jury that prevents or embarrasses the full, unrestricted exercise by the accused of that right, must be condemned."" Pointer v. United States, 151 U.S. 396, 408, 414 (1894); see also Lewis v. United States, 146 U.S. 370, 376, 138 (1892); Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356, 379, 1642 (1972) (opinion of POWELL, J.). 
 This Court has not addressed whether, and upon what threshold showing, individual voir dire is constitutionally required to guarantee a defendant's right to ""have sufficient information brought out on voir dire to enable him to exercise his challenges in a rea- [473 U.S. 913 , 915]

 Robert Dale HENDERSON v. FLORIDANo. 84-6681 Supreme Court of the United States July 1, 1985
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, after contacting police and admitting involvement in a series of murders, unambiguously asserted his right to counsel and his desire to have no discussions with the police concerning his case outside the presence of counsel. The legal import of this assertion, made while in police custody, is clear; our cases establish a "" 'bright-line rule' that all questioning must cease after an accused requests counsel."" Smith v. Illinois, 469 U.S. 91, 98, 494 (1984); see also Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477 ( 1981); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 471, 474, 1626, 1628 (1966). The reason for this rule is also clear from our cases, for ""[i]n the absence of such a bright-line prohibition, the authorities through 'badger[ing]' or 'overreaching'-explicit or subtle, deliberate or unintentional-might otherwise wear down the accused and persuade him to incriminate himself notwithstanding his earlier request for counsel's assistance."" Smith v. Illinois, supra, 469 U.S. at 98. This ""bright-line rule"" is thus an essential ""protective devic[e] . . . employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings"" and to thereby assure that any statements by an accused are the product of free will rather than subtle coercion.

 Robert Dale HENDERSON v. FLORIDANo. 84-6681 Supreme Court of the United States July 1, 1985
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, after contacting police and admitting involvement in a series of murders, unambiguously asserted his right to counsel and his desire to have no discussions with the police concerning his case outside the presence of counsel. The legal import of this assertion, made while in police custody, is clear; our cases establish a "" 'bright-line rule' that all questioning must cease after an accused requests counsel."" Smith v. Illinois, 469 U.S. 91, 98, 494 (1984); see also Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477 ( 1981); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 471, 474, 1626, 1628 (1966). The reason for this rule is also clear from our cases, for ""[i]n the absence of such a bright-line prohibition, the authorities through 'badger[ing]' or 'overreaching'-explicit or subtle, deliberate or unintentional-might otherwise wear down the accused and persuade him to incriminate himself notwithstanding his earlier request for counsel's assistance."" Smith v. Illinois, supra, 469 U.S. at 98. This ""bright-line rule"" is thus an essential ""protective devic[e] . . . employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings"" and to thereby assure that any statements by an accused are the product of free will rather than subtle coercion. Miranda v. Arizona, supra, at 458.

 Harvey and Rebecca RUMBAUGH, Individually and as Next Friends of Charles Rumbaughv. O.L. McCOTTER, Director, Texas Department of CorrectionsNo. 84-6689 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 1, 1985
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioners, Harvey and Rebecca Rumbaugh, are the parents of Charles Rumbaugh, who has been sentenced to death. They seek to present a next friend petition for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of their son, while their son refuses to seek collateral review of his conviction or death sentence and resists his parents' efforts to secure such review. The son's reason for wanting no review is that he desires to die as quickly as possible so as to end feelings of intolerable depression that plague him. A Federal District Court found that Charles Rumbaugh was mentally competent to waive his rights and thus to assure his own death, and it accordingly dismissed the petition for writ of habeas corpus. Rumbaugh v. Estelle, 558 F.Supp. 651 (ND Tex.1983). The Court of Appeals affirmed. Rumbaugh v. Procunier, 753 F.2d 395 (CA5 1985). The issue presented is whether those determinations comported with the standard for waiver set forth in Rees v. Peyton, 384 U.S. 312 (1966 ). Because the decisions below substantially strayed from the Rees standard, so that they, in essence, allow a state capital punishment scheme to become an instrument for the effectuation of a suicide by a mentally ill man, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. 
 Rees specified the findings necessary to a determination that one who seeks to waive further review of a criminal conviction is competent to make such a grave choice. Under Rees the courts 
Page 473 U.S. 919 , 920
 below were required to determine ""whether [Charles Rumbaugh] has [the] capacity to appreciate his position and make a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation or on the other hand whether he is suffering from a mental disease, disorder, or defect which may substantially affect his capacity in the premises."" Id., at 314. Rumbaugh was examined by numerous psychiatrists, and based on their testimony and reports, a Federal District Court found Rumbaugh competent. 
 This conclusion, however, was not based on a finding that Rumbaugh's choice was uninfluenced by mental illness. To the contrary, the court found that Rumbaugh suffered from severe mental illness and that this illness was a major influence on his choice. The courts below relied on a determination that Rumbaugh ""logically"" chose death because he had become a victim of mental illness, suffering from ""frequent bouts of paranoia,"" "" auditory hallucinations,"" and severe ""depression."" Rumbaugh seeks death because he knows himself to be mentally ill and has lost hope of obtaining treatment. If not for his illness and his pessimism regarding access to treatment, he would probably continue to challenge his death sentence; but faced with his vision of life without treatment for severe mental illness, Rumbaugh chooses to die. 
 The choice the courts below describe is a choice of a desperate man seeking to use the State's machinery of death as a tool of suicide. It is no more nor less rational than the tragic choices of those driven to suicide by their tormented inner lives in a myriad of contexts. Although the District Court and the divided panel of the Fifth Circuit determined that Rumbaugh was rational in his calculation that continued life would for him bring misery, this was not the sort of free and uncoerced "" rational"" choice that we required in Rees. As Circuit Judge Goldberg said in dissent below:

No. 84-849
Argued April 16, 1985
Decided June 28, 1985
473 U.S. 159

Syllabus 
Respondents were arrested following the warrantless raid of a house in Kentucky by local and state police officers who were seeking a murder suspect.  Claiming a deprivation of federal rights allegedly resulting from the police's use of excessive force and other constitutional violations accompanying the raid, respondents filed suit in Federal District Court under, inter alia, 42 U.S.C.  1983, seeking money damages.  Among the named defendants were the Commissioner of the Kentucky State Police, ""individually and as Commissioner,"" and the Commonwealth of Kentucky, which was sued only for attorney's fees should respondents eventually prevail.  The District Court, relying on the Eleventh Amendment, dismissed the Commonwealth as a party.  On the second day of trial, the case was settled in favor of respondents, who then moved that the Commonwealth pay their costs and attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1988, which provides that, in any action to enforce  1983, the court may allow ""the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.""  The District Court granted the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 1988 does not allow attorney's fees to be recovered from a governmental entity when a plaintiff sues governmental employees only in their personal capacities and prevails; accordingly, since this case was necessarily litigated as a personal-capacity and not as an official-capacity action, it was error to award fees against the Commonwealth.  Pp.  473 U. S. 163-171.
(a) While  1988 does not define the parties who must bear the costs, the logical place to look for recovery of fees is to the losing party.  Liability on the merits and responsibility for fees go hand in hand.  Where a defendant has not been prevailed against, either because of legal immunity or on the merits,  1988 does not authorize a fee award against that defendant.  Pp.  473 U. S. 163-165.
(b) Personal-capacity suits seek to impose personal liability upon a government officer for actions he takes under color of state law, whereas official-capacity suits against an officer are generally treated as suits against the governmental entity of which the officer is an agent.  With this distinction in mind, it is clear that a suit against a government officer 
Page 473 U. S. 160
 in his or her personal capacity cannot lead to imposition of fee liability upon the governmental entity.  Pp.  473 U. S. 165-168.
(c) To hold that fees can be recovered from a governmental entity following victory in a personal-capacity action against government officials would be inconsistent with the rule that the entity cannot be made liable on the merits under  1983 on a respondeat superior basis.  Nothing in  1988's history suggests that fee liability was intended to be imposed on that basis.  Section 198 simply does not create fee liability where merits liability is nonexistent.  P.  473 U. S. 168.
(d) Although the State Police Commissioner was named as a defendant in both his ""individual"" and ""official"" capacities and the Commonwealth was named as a defendant for the limited purpose of a fee award, there can be no doubt, given Eleventh Amendment doctrine, that the action did not seek to impose monetary liability on the Commonwealth.  Absent waiver by a State or valid congressional override, the Eleventh Amendment bars a damages action against a State in federal court, a bar that remains in effect when state officials are sued for damages in their official capacity.  Accordingly, an official-capacity damages action could not have been maintained against the Commissioner in federal court.  Respondents cannot seek damages from the Commonwealth simply by suing Commonwealth officials in their official capacity, nor did respondents' action on the merits become a suit against the Commonwealth by simply naming it as a defendant on the limited issue of fee liability.  Pp.  473 U. S. 168-170.
(e) Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678, did not alter the basic philosophy of  1988 that fees and merits liability run together, nor did it hold or suggest that fees are available from a governmental entity simply because a government official has been prevailed against in his or her personal capacity.  Pp.  473 U. S. 170-171.

v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City
No. 84-4
Argued February 19, 1985
Decided June 28, 1985
473 U.S. 172

Syllabus 
As required under Tennessee law, in 1973 respondent's predecessor in interest, a land developer, obtained petitioner Planning Commission's approval of a preliminary plat for development of a tract.  The tract was to be developed in accord with the requirements of a county zoning ordinance for ""cluster"" development of residential areas and the Commission's implementing regulations.  In 1977, the county zoning ordinance was changed so as to reduce the allowable density of dwelling units, but the Commission continued to apply the 1973 ordinance and regulations to the developer's tract.  In 1979, however, the Commission decided that further development of the tract should be governed by the ordinance and regulations then in effect.  The Commission thereafter disapproved plats proposing further development of the remainder of the tract on various grounds, including failure to comply with current density requirements.  Respondent filed suit against the Commission and its members and staff (also petitioners) in Federal District Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that the Commission had taken its property without just compensation by refusing to approve the proposed development.  The jury found that respondent had been denied the ""economically viable"" use of its property in violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and awarded damages for the temporary taking of respondent's property.  The District Court entered an injunction requiring the Commission to apply the 1973 ordinance and regulations to the project, but granted judgment notwithstanding the jury's verdict for the Commission on the taking claim, concluding that the temporary deprivation of economic benefit from respondent's property, as a matter of law, could not constitute a taking.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that application of government regulations affecting an owner's use of property may constitute a taking, and that the evidence supported the jury's finding that the property had no economically feasible use during the time between the Commission's refusal to approve the plat and the jury's verdict.
Held:
1. Even assuming, arguendo, that government regulation may effect a taking for which the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation, 
Page 473 U. S. 173
 and assuming further that the Fifth Amendment requires the payment of money damages to compensate for such a taking, the jury verdict in this case cannot be upheld because respondent's claim is premature.  Respondent has not yet obtained a final decision regarding the application of the ordinance and regulations to its property, nor utilized the procedures Tennessee provides for obtaining just compensation, and its claim therefore is not ripe.  Pp.  473 U. S. 186-197.
(a) Although respondent's plan for developing its property was rejected, it did not then seek variances that would have allowed it to develop the property according to its proposed plat.  Cf. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264.  The record does not support respondent's claim that the Commission's denial of approval for respondent's plat was equivalent to a denial of variances.  Thus, respondent has not yet obtained a final decision regarding how it will be allowed to develop its property.  Respondent's contention that it should not be required to seek variances because its suit is predicated upon 42 U.S.C.  1983 is without merit.  While there is no requirement that a plaintiff exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a  1983 action, the question whether administrative remedies must be exhausted is conceptually distinct from the question whether an administrative action must be final before it is judicially reviewable.  Pp.  473 U. S. 186-194.
(b) The Fifth Amendment does not require that just compensation be paid in advance of, or contemporaneously with, the taking.  If a State provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation, the property owner cannot claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.  Under Tennessee law, a property owner may bring an inverse condemnation action to obtain just compensation for an alleged taking of property under certain circumstances.  Respondent has not shown that the inverse condemnation procedure is unavailable or inadequate, and until it has utilized that procedure, its taking claim is premature.  Pp.  473 U. S. 194-197.
2. Respondent's claim also is premature if viewed under the theory that government regulation that goes so far that it has the same effect as a physical taking, must be viewed not as a Fifth Amendment ""taking,"" but as an invalid exercise of the police power, violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Resolution of the due process question depends, in significant part, upon an analysis of the effect the Commission's application of the ordinance and regulations had on the value of respondent's property and investment-backed profit expectations.  That effect cannot be measured until a final decision is made as to how the regulations will be applied to respondent's property.  No such decision had been made at the time respondent filed its  1983 action, 
Page 473 U. S. 174
 because respondent failed to apply for variances from the regulations.  Pp.  473 U. S. 197-200.

			"|"Williamson County Regional Planning Commission
v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City
No. 84-4
Argued February 19, 1985
Decided June 28, 1985
473 U.S. 172

Syllabus 
As required under Tennessee law, in 1973 respondent's predecessor in interest, a land developer, obtained petitioner Planning Commission's approval of a preliminary plat for development of a tract.  The tract was to be developed in accord with the requirements of a county zoning ordinance for ""cluster"" development of residential areas and the Commission's implementing regulations.  In 1977, the county zoning ordinance was changed so as to reduce the allowable density of dwelling units, but the Commission continued to apply the 1973 ordinance and regulations to the developer's tract.  In 1979, however, the Commission decided that further development of the tract should be governed by the ordinance and regulations then in effect.  The Commission thereafter disapproved plats proposing further development of the remainder of the tract on various grounds, including failure to comply with current density requirements.  Respondent filed suit against the Commission and its members and staff (also petitioners) in Federal District Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that the Commission had taken its property without just compensation by refusing to approve the proposed development.  The jury found that respondent had been denied the ""economically viable"" use of its property in violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and awarded damages for the temporary taking of respondent's property.  The District Court entered an injunction requiring the Commission to apply the 1973 ordinance and regulations to the project, but granted judgment notwithstanding the jury's verdict for the Commission on the taking claim, concluding that the temporary deprivation of economic benefit from respondent's property, as a matter of law, could not constitute a taking.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that application of government regulations affecting an owner's use of property may constitute a taking, and that the evidence supported the jury's finding that the property had no economically feasible use during the time between the Commission's refusal to approve the plat and the jury's verdict.
Held:
1. Even assuming, arguendo, that government regulation may effect a taking for which the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation, 
Page 473 U. S. 173
 and assuming further that the Fifth Amendment requires the payment of money damages to compensate for such a taking, the jury verdict in this case cannot be upheld because respondent's claim is premature.  Respondent has not yet obtained a final decision regarding the application of the ordinance and regulations to its property, nor utilized the procedures Tennessee provides for obtaining just compensation, and its claim therefore is not ripe.  Pp.  473 U. S. 186-197.
(a) Although respondent's plan for developing its property was rejected, it did not then seek variances that would have allowed it to develop the property according to its proposed plat.  Cf. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264.  The record does not support respondent's claim that the Commission's denial of approval for respondent's plat was equivalent to a denial of variances.  Thus, respondent has not yet obtained a final decision regarding how it will be allowed to develop its property.  Respondent's contention that it should not be required to seek variances because its suit is predicated upon 42 U.S.C.  1983 is without merit.  While there is no requirement that a plaintiff exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a  1983 action, the question whether administrative remedies must be exhausted is conceptually distinct from the question whether an administrative action must be final before it is judicially reviewable.  Pp.  473 U. S. 186-194.
(b) The Fifth Amendment does not require that just compensation be paid in advance of, or contemporaneously with, the taking.  If a State provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation, the property owner cannot claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.  Under Tennessee law, a property owner may bring an inverse condemnation action to obtain just compensation for an alleged taking of property under certain circumstances.  Respondent has not shown that the inverse condemnation procedure is unavailable or inadequate, and until it has utilized that procedure, its taking claim is premature.  Pp.  473 U. S. 194-197.
2. Respondent's claim also is premature if viewed under the theory that government regulation that goes so far that it has the same effect as a physical taking, must be viewed not as a Fifth Amendment ""taking,"" but as an invalid exercise of the police power, violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Resolution of the due process question depends, in significant part, upon an analysis of the effect the Commission's application of the ordinance and regulations had on the value of respondent's property and investment-backed profit expectations.  That effect cannot be measured until a final decision is made as to how the regulations will be applied to respondent's property.  No such decision had been made at the time respondent filed its  1983 action, 
Page 473 U. S. 174
 because respondent failed to apply for variances from the regulations.  Pp.  473 U. S. 197-200.

473 U.S. 207

Syllabus 
Title 18 U.S.C.  2314 provides criminal penalties for any person who
""transports in interstate or foreign commerce any goods, wares, merchandise, securities or money, of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud.""
Petitioner was convicted in Federal District Court of violating, inter alia,  2314, arising from the interstate transportation of ""bootleg"" phonorecords that were manufactured and distributed without the consent of the copyright owners of the musical compositions performed on the records.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 2314 does not reach petitioner's conduct.  Pp.  473 U. S. 213-229.
(a) The language of  2314 does not ""plainly and unmistakably"" cover such conduct.  The phonorecords in question were not ""stolen, converted or taken by fraud"" for purposes of  2314.  The section's language clearly contemplates a physical identity between the items unlawfully obtained and those eventually transported, and hence some prior physical taking of the subject goods.  Since the statutorily defined property rights of a copyright holder have a character distinct from the possessory interest of the owner of simple ""goods, wares, [or] merchandise,"" interference with copyright does not easily equate with theft, conversion, or fraud.  The infringer of a copyright does not assume physical control over the copyright, nor wholly deprive its owner of its use.  Infringement implicates a more complex set of property interests than does run-of-the-mill theft, conversion, or fraud.  Pp.  473 U. S. 214-218.
(b) The purpose of  2314 to fill with federal action an enforcement gap created by limited state jurisdiction over interstate transportation of stolen property does not apply to petitioner's conduct.  No such need for supplemental federal action has ever existed with respect to copyright infringement, since Congress has the power under the Constitution to legislate directly in this area.  Pp.  473 U. S. 218-221.
(c) The history of the criminal infringement provisions of the Copyright Act indicates that Congress had no intention to reach copyright infringement when it enacted  2314.  Pp.  473 U. S. 221-226.
(d) To apply  2314 to petitioner's conduct would support its extension to significant areas, such as interstate transportation of patent

Syllabus 
Respondent, who suffers from diabetes and has no sight in one eye, brought an action in Federal District Court against petitioners, alleging that petitioner California State Hospital denied him employment because of his physical handicap, in violation of  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and seeking compensatory, injunctive, and declaratory relief.  Section 504 provides that no handicapped person shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be subjected to discrimination under any program receiving federal financial assistance under the Act.  Section 505(a) makes available to any person aggrieved by any act of any recipient of federal assistance under the Act the remedies for employment discrimination set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that respondent's claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  Ultimately, after initially affirming on other grounds and upon remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the action because the State by receiving funds under the Act had implicitly consented to be sued as a recipient under  504.
Held:  Respondent's action is proscribed by the Eleventh Amendment.  Pp.  473 U. S. 237-247.
(a) Article III,  5, of the California Constitution, which provides that ""[s]uits may be brought against the State in such manner and in such courts as shall be directed by law"" does not constitute a waiver of the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court.  In order for a state statute or constitutional provision to constitute such a waiver, it must specify the State's intent to subject itself to suit in federal court.  Article III,  5, does not specifically indicate the State's willingness to be sued in federal court, but appears simply to authorize the legislature to waive the State's sovereign immunity.  P.  473 U. S. 241.
(b) The Rehabilitation Act does not abrogate the Eleventh Amendment bar to suits against the States.  Congress must express its intention to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment in unmistakable language in the statute itself.  Here, the general authorization for suit in federal court is not the kind of unequivocal statutory language sufficient to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment.  Pp.  473 U. S. 242-246. 
Page 473 U. S. 235

(c) The State's acceptance of funds and participation in programs funded under the Rehabilitation Act are insufficient to establish that it consented to suit in federal court.  The Act falls far short of manifesting a clear intention to condition participation in programs under the Act on a State's consent to waive its constitutional immunity.  Pp.  473 U. S. 246-247.

Title 38 U.S.C.  3404(C) limits to $10 the fee that may be paid an attorney or agent who represents a veteran seeking benefits from the Veterans' Administration (VA) for service-connected death or disability.  Appellees (two veterans' organizations, three individual veterans, and a veteran's widow) brought an action in Federal District Court claiming that the fee limitation denied them any realistic opportunity to obtain legal representation in presenting their claims to the VA, and hence violated their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and under the First Amendment.  The District Court agreed and entered a nationwide ""preliminary injunction"" barring appellants from enforcing the fee limitation.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction of the appeal under 28 U.S.C.  1252, which grants the Court jurisdiction over an appeal
""from an interlocutory or final judgment, decree or order of any court of the United States . . . holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional in any civil action . . . to which the United States or any of its agencies, or any officer or employee thereof, as such officer or employee, is a party.""
McLucas v. DeChamplain, 421 U. S. 21.  The injunction at issue creates precisely the problem to which  1252 was addressed -- to have this Court directly review decisions involving the exercise of judicial power to impair the enforcement of an Act of Congress on constitutional grounds, where the decision has effects beyond the controversy before the court below -- since it enjoins the operation of the fee limitation on constitutional grounds across the country and under all circumstances.  Whether or not the injunction is framed as a ""holding"" of unconstitutionality is irrelevant, as long as it enjoined the statute's operation.  Pp.  473 U. S. 316-319.
2. The fee limitation provision of  3404(c) does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  473 U. S. 319-334.
(a) Invalidation of the fee limitation would frustrate Congress' principal goal of wanting the veteran to get the entirety of the benefits award without having to divide it with an attorney.  Invalidation would 
Page 473 U. S. 306
 also complicate a process that Congress wished to be as informal and nonadversarial as possible.  Pp.  473 U. S. 321-326.
(b) It would take an extraordinarily strong showing of probability of error in the VA's present benefits claim procedures -- and the probability that the presence of attorneys would sharply diminish that possibility -- to warrant a holding that the fee limitation denies claimants due process of law.  No such showing was made out on the record before the District Court in this case.  In light of the Government interests at stake, the evidence before the District Court as to the success rates in claims handled with or without lawyers shows no such great disparity as to warrant the inference that the fee limitation violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  And what evidence there is regarding complex cases falls far short of the kind that would warrant upsetting Congress' judgment that the present system is the manner in which it wished claims for veterans' benefits adjudicated.

No. 83-1437
Argued December 5, 1984
Decided June 27, 1985
473 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Petitioner police officers, in answering a call on a domestic disturbance, shot and killed respondent's adult son. Respondent, in his own behalf and as administrator of his son's estate, filed suit against petitioners in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and state tort law.  Prior to trial, petitioners made a timely offer of settlement of $100,000, expressly including accrued costs and attorney's fees, but respondent did not accept the offer.  The case went to trial and respondent was awarded $5,000 on the state law claim, $52,000 for the  1983 violation, and $3,000 in punitive damages.  Respondent then filed a request for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988, which provides that a prevailing party in a  1983 action may be awarded attorney's fees ""as part of the costs.""  The claimed attorney's fees included fees for work performed subsequent to the settlement offer.  The District Court declined to award these latter fees pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, which provides that, if a timely pretrial offer of settlement is not accepted and ""the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.""  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Petitioners are not liable for the attorney's fees incurred by respondent after petitioners' offer of settlement.  Pp.  474 U. S. 5-12. 
Page 473 U. S. 2

(a) Petitioners' offer was valid under Rule 68.  The Rule does not require that a defendant's offer itemize the respective amounts being tendered for settlement of the underlying substantive claim and for costs.  The drafters' concern was not so much with the particular components of offers, but with the judgments to be allowed against defendants.  Whether or not the offer recites that costs are included or specifies an amount for costs, the offer has allowed judgment to be entered against the defendant both for damages caused by the challenged conduct and for costs.

			"|"Marek v. Chesney
No. 83-1437
Argued December 5, 1984
Decided June 27, 1985
473 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Petitioner police officers, in answering a call on a domestic disturbance, shot and killed respondent's adult son. Respondent, in his own behalf and as administrator of his son's estate, filed suit against petitioners in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and state tort law.  Prior to trial, petitioners made a timely offer of settlement of $100,000, expressly including accrued costs and attorney's fees, but respondent did not accept the offer.  The case went to trial and respondent was awarded $5,000 on the state law claim, $52,000 for the  1983 violation, and $3,000 in punitive damages.  Respondent then filed a request for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988, which provides that a prevailing party in a  1983 action may be awarded attorney's fees ""as part of the costs.""  The claimed attorney's fees included fees for work performed subsequent to the settlement offer.  The District Court declined to award these latter fees pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, which provides that, if a timely pretrial offer of settlement is not accepted and ""the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.""  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Petitioners are not liable for the attorney's fees incurred by respondent after petitioners' offer of settlement.  Pp.  474 U. S. 5-12. 
Page 473 U. S. 2

(a) Petitioners' offer was valid under Rule 68.  The Rule does not require that a defendant's offer itemize the respective amounts being tendered for settlement of the underlying substantive claim and for costs.  The drafters' concern was not so much with the particular components of offers, but with the judgments to be allowed against defendants.  Whether or not the offer recites that costs are included or specifies an amount for costs, the offer has allowed judgment to be entered against the defendant both for damages caused by the challenged conduct and for costs.  This construction of Rule 68 furthers its objective of encouraging settlements.  Pp.  473 U. S. 5-7.
(b) In view of the Rule 68 drafters' awareness of the various federal statutes which, as an exception to the ""American Rule,"" authorize an award of attorney's fees to prevailing parties as part of the costs in particular cases, the most reasonable inference is that the term ""costs"" in the Rule was intended to refer to all costs properly awardable under the relevant substantive statute.  Thus, where the underlying statute defines ""costs"" to include attorney's fees, such fees are to be included as costs for purposes of Rule 68.  Here, where  1988 expressly includes attorney's fees as ""costs"" available to a prevailing plaintiff in a  1983 suit, such fees are subject to the cost-shifting provision of Rule 68.

473 U.S. 52

Syllabus 
Respondent's decedent, her son who was an Army private, was off duty at Fort Bliss and away from the base when he was kidnaped and murdered by another serviceman, who was convicted of the murder in a New Mexico court and who had also been convicted by a German court of manslaughter in 1977 while assigned to an Army base in Germany.  Respondent brought this action against the Government in Federal District Court under the Federal Tort Claims Act (Act), claiming that the Army's negligence caused her son's death.  Respondent alleged that, although the Army knew that the other serviceman was dangerous, it ""negligently and carelessly failed to exert a reasonably sufficient control over"" him, ""failed to warn other persons that he was at large, [and] negligently and carelessly failed to . . . remove [him] from active military duty.""  The District Court granted summary judgment for the Government, but the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding, inter alia, that Feres v. United States, 340 U. S. 135 -- which held that a soldier may not recover under the Act for injuries that ""arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service,"" id. at  340 U. S. 146 -- did not bar respondent's suit.
Held:  Recovery under the Act is barred by the Feres doctrine, which is based, inter alia, on the special relationship of the soldier to his superiors, the effects of the maintenance of suits under the Act on discipline, and the extreme results that might obtain if such suits were allowed for negligent orders given or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty.  The Court of Appeals erroneously placed great weight on the fact that respondent's son was off duty and away from the base when he was murdered; the situs of the murder is not nearly as important as whether the suit requires the civilian court to second-guess military decisions, and whether the suit might impair essential military discipline.  Respondent's complaint strikes at the core of these concerns; her allegations go directly to the ""management"" of the military, calling into question basic choices about the discipline, supervision, and control of a serviceman.  To permit this type of suit would mean that commanding officers would have to stand prepared to convince a civilian court of the wisdom of a wide range of military and disciplinary decisions.  Nor is the Feres doctrine rendered inapplicable by respondent's focusing only

No. 84-861
Argued April 23, 1985

473 U.S. 61

Syllabus 
The Rules on Containers (Rules) require that some cargo containers owned or leased by marine shipping companies that otherwise would be loaded or unloaded within the local port area (defined as anywhere within a 50-mile radius of the port) instead must be loaded or unloaded by longshoremen at the pier.  These Rules were collectively bargained for by respondent union after the advent of ""containerization"" had drastically reduced the amount of longshoremen's on-pier work involved in cargo handling.  In this case, the National Labor Relations Board (Board) held that the Rules constituted unlawful secondary activity under  8(b) (4)(B) and 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act when applied to containers destined for ""shortstopping"" truckers (truckers who stop in the vicinity of a pier to load and unload cargo for reasons related to trucking requirements) and ""traditional"" warehousers (warehousers who perform loading and unloading of cargo at the warehouse for reasons unrelated to marine transportation).  The Board reasoned that, because the Rules, as so applied, sought to preserve longshoremen's work that had been ""eliminated"" by containerization, the Rules had ""an illegal work acquisition objective.""  The Court of Appeals refused to enforce the Board's decision, holding that the Board had failed to make any factual finding that the Rules actually operated to deprive ""shortstopping"" truckers or ""traditional"" warehousers of any work, and that, as a matter of law, an agreement that preserves duplicative or technologically ""eliminated"" work does not constitute unlawful ""work acquisition.""
Held:  The Board's partial invalidation of the Rules as applied in the contexts in question is inconsistent with National Woodwork Manufacturers Assn. v. NLRB, 386 U. S. 612, and NLRB v. Longshoremen, 447 U. S. 490 (ILA I).  Pp.  473 U. S. 73-84.
(a) National Woodwork, supra, concluded that  8(b)(4)(B) and 8(e) were intended by Congress to ""reach only secondary pressures,"" and that agreements negotiated with the objective of preserving work in the face of a threat to union members' jobs are lawful primary activity.  These conclusions were reaffirmed in NLRB v. Pipefitters, 429 U. S. 507, and ILA I, supra.  Pp.  473 U. S. 74-78. 
Page 473 U. S. 62

(b) By focusing on the effect that the Rules might have on ""shortstopping"" truckers and ""traditional"" warehousers, the Board contravened this Court's direction in ILA I, supra, at  447 U. S. 507, n. 22, that such extra-unit effects, ""no matter how severe,"" are ""irrelevant"" to the analysis.  Given the Rules' primary objective to preserve longshoremen's work in the face of a threat to jobs, extra-unit effects of a work preservation agreement alone provide an insufficient basis for concluding that the agreement has an unlawful secondary objective.   473 U. S.  78-9.
(c) The Board misconstrued this Court's cases in suggesting that ""eliminated work"" can never be the object of a work preservation agreement.  ""Elimination"" of work, in the sense that it is made unnecessary by innovation, is not, of itself, a reason to condemn work preservation agreements under  8(b)(4)(B) and 8(e); to the contrary, such elimination provides the very premise for such agreements.  The relevant inquiry is whether a union's activity is primary or secondary, and no talismanic tests may substitute for analysis.  When the objective of an agreement and its enforcement is so clearly one of work preservation, as is the one involved here, the lawfulness of the agreement under  8(b)(4)(B) and 8(e) is secure, absent some other evidence of secondary purpose.

Petitioner national labor union's constitution provides that resignations from the union are not permitted during a strike.  The union fined 10 members who, in violation of this provision, resigned during a strike by petitioner local unions and returned to work.  Respondent employer representative thereafter filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board (Board), claiming that such levying of fines constituted an unfair labor practice under  8(b)(1)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their  7 rights.  The Board agreed, and the Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order.
Held:  In related cases this Court has invariably yielded to Board decisions on whether fines imposed by a union ""restrained or coerced"" employees.  Moreover, the Board has consistently construed  8(b)(1)(A) as prohibiting the fining of employees who have resigned from a union contrary to a restriction in the union constitution.  Therefore, the Board's decision in this case is entitled to this Court's deference.  Pp.  473 U. S. 100-116.
(a) The Board was justified in concluding that, by restricting the right of employees to resign, the provision in question impaired the congressional policy of voluntary unionism implicit in  8(a)(3) of the Act.  Pp.  473 U. S. 104-107.
(b) The proviso to  8(b)(1)(A), which states that nothing in  8(b) (1)(A) shall
""impair the right of a labor organization to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership therein,""
was intended to protect union rules involving admission and expulsion, and not to allow unions to make rules restricting the right to resign.  Accordingly, the Board properly concluded that the provision in question is not a ""rule with respect to the retention of membership.""  Pp.  473 U. S. 108-110.

Respondent, a claims examiner for petitioner insurance company (petitioner), is a beneficiary under employee benefit plans administered by petitioner and governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  In May, 1979, respondent became disabled with a back ailment, and received plan benefits until October 17, 1979, when petitioner's disability committee terminated her benefits based on an orthopedic surgeon's report.  Respondent then requested review of that decision, and on March 11, 1980, the plan administrator reinstated her benefits based on further medical reports, and retroactive benefits were paid in full.  But claiming that she had been injured by the improper refusal to pay benefits from October 17, 1979, to March 11, 1980, respondent sued petitioner in California Superior Court, alleging various causes of action based on state law and on ERISA.  Petitioner removed the case to Federal District Court, which granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment, holding, inter alia, that ERISA barred any claims for extracontractual damages arising out of the original denial of respondent's claim for benefits.  The Court of Appeals reversed in pertinent part, holding that the 132 days that petitioner took to process respondent's claim violated the plan fiduciary's obligation to process claims in good faith and in a fair and diligent manner, and that this violation gave rise to a cause of action for damages under  409(a) of ERISA that could be asserted by a plan beneficiary pursuant to  502(a)(2) authorizing civil enforcement of ERISA.  Section 409(a) provides that
""[a]ny person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this title shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from such breach, and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary, and shall be subject to such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate, including removal of such fiduciary.""
Held:  Section 409(a) does not provide a cause of action for extracontractual damages to a beneficiary caused by improper or untimely processing of benefit claims.  Pp.  473 U. S. 139-148. 
Page 473 U. S. 135

(a) The text of  409(a) contains no express authority for an award of such damages, and there is nothing in the text to support the conclusion that a delay in processing a disputed claim gives rise to a private cause of action for compensatory or punitive relief.  Rather, the text shows that Congress did not intend to authorize any relief except for the plan itself.  Not only is the relevant fiduciary relationship characterized at the outset of  409(a) as one ""with respect to a plan,"" but the fiduciary's potential personal liability is
""to make good to such plan any losses to the plan . . . and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan.""
Pp.  473 U. S. 139-144.
(b) Nor can a private cause of action for extra-contractual damages be implied.  While respondent is a member of the class for whose benefit ERISA was enacted and, in view of the preemptive effect of ERISA, there is no state law impediment to implying a remedy, legislative intent and consistency with the legislative scheme support the conclusion that Congress did not intend the judiciary to imply such a cause of action.  The civil enforcement provisions of  502(a) provide strong evidence that Congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it did not incorporate expressly.  Pp.  473 U. S. 145-148.

473 U.S. 134

Syllabus 
Respondent, a claims examiner for petitioner insurance company (petitioner), is a beneficiary under employee benefit plans administered by petitioner and governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  In May, 1979, respondent became disabled with a back ailment, and received plan benefits until October 17, 1979, when petitioner's disability committee terminated her benefits based on an orthopedic surgeon's report.  Respondent then requested review of that decision, and on March 11, 1980, the plan administrator reinstated her benefits based on further medical reports, and retroactive benefits were paid in full.  But claiming that she had been injured by the improper refusal to pay benefits from October 17, 1979, to March 11, 1980, respondent sued petitioner in California Superior Court, alleging various causes of action based on state law and on ERISA.  Petitioner removed the case to Federal District Court, which granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment, holding, inter alia, that ERISA barred any claims for extracontractual damages arising out of the original denial of respondent's claim for benefits.  The Court of Appeals reversed in pertinent part, holding that the 132 days that petitioner took to process respondent's claim violated the plan fiduciary's obligation to process claims in good faith and in a fair and diligent manner, and that this violation gave rise to a cause of action for damages under  409(a) of ERISA that could be asserted by a plan beneficiary pursuant to  502(a)(2) authorizing civil enforcement of ERISA.  Section 409(a) provides that
""[a]ny person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this title shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from such breach, and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary, and shall be subject to such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate, including removal of such fiduciary.""

No. 83-1158
Argued November 7, 1984
Decided June 26, 1985
472 U.S. 703

Syllabus 
Petitioner's decedent, Donald E. Thornton, worked in a managerial position at a Connecticut store owned by respondent, which operated a chain of New England retail stores.  In 1979, Thornton informed respondent that he would no longer work on Sundays, as was required by respondent as to managerial employees.  Thornton invoked the Connecticut statute which provides:
""No person who states that a particular day of the week is observed as his Sabbath may be required by his employer to work on such day.  An employee's refusal to work on his Sabbath shall not constitute grounds for his dismissal.""
Thornton rejected respondent's offer either to transfer him to a management job in a Massachusetts store that was closed on Sundays, or to transfer him to a nonsupervisory position in the Connecticut store at a lower salary.  Subsequently, respondent transferred Thornton to a clerical position in the Connecticut store; Thornton resigned two days later and filed a grievance with the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration, alleging that he was discharged from his manager's position in violation of the Connecticut statute.  The Board sustained the grievance, ordering respondent to reinstate Thornton, and the Connecticut Superior Court affirmed the Board's ruling, concluding that the statute did not offend the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  The Connecticut Supreme Court reversed.
Held:  The Connecticut statute, by providing Sabbath observers with an absolute and unqualified right not to work on their chosen Sabbath, violates the Establishment Clause.  To meet constitutional requirements under that Clause, a statute must not only have a secular purpose and not foster excessive entanglement of government with religion, its primary effect must not advance or inhibit religion.  Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602.  The Connecticut statute imposes on employers and employees an absolute duty to conform their business practices to the particular religious practices of an employee by enforcing observance of the Sabbath that the latter unilaterally designates.  The State thus commands that Sabbath religious concerns automatically control over all secular interests at the workplace; the statute takes no account of the convenience or interests of the employer or those of other employees who do not observe a Sabbath.  In granting unyielding weighting in favor of Sabbath observers over all other interests, the statute has a

Syllabus 
Section 6331(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides that the Government may collect taxes of a delinquent taxpayer ""by levy upon all property and rights to property . . . belonging to such person.""  Section 6332(a) then provides that
""any person in possession of (or obligated with respect to) property or rights to property subject to levy upon which a levy has been made shall, upon demand of the Secretary [of the Treasury or his delegate], surrender such property or rights . . . to the Secretary, except such part of the property or rights as is . . . subject to an attachment or execution.""
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) levied on two joint accounts in respondent bank in Arkansas for delinquent income taxes owed by only one of the persons in whose names the accounts stood.  When respondent, contending that it did not know how much of the money on deposit belonged to the delinquent taxpayer as opposed to his codepositors, refused to comply with the levy, the United States brought an action in Federal District Court, seeking judgment against respondent for the amount of the delinquent taxes.  The District Court granted respondent's motion to dismiss.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, because under Arkansas garnishment law a creditor of a bank depositor is not subrogated to the depositor's power to withdraw the account, the IRS, too, could not stand in the depositor's shoes, and that the Government could not make use of the administrative procedure without negating or quantifying the claims that the delinquent taxpayer's codepositors might have to the funds in question.  The court reasoned that the delinquent taxpayer did not possess a sufficient property interest in the funds to support the levy, that the codepositors might possess competing claims to the funds, and that an IRS levy is not normally intended for use against property in which third parties have an interest or which bears on its face the names of third parties.
Held:  The IRS had a right to levy on the joint accounts in question.  Pp.  472 U. S. 719-733.
(a) A bank served with an IRS notice of levy has only two defenses for failure to comply with the demand:  that it is neither ""in possession of "" nor ""obligated with respect to"" property or rights to property belonging to the delinquent taxpayer, or that the taxpayer's property is ""subject 
Page 472 U. S. 714
 to a prior judicial attachment or execution.""  Here, the latter defense was not available, and so respondent's only defense was that the joint accounts did not constitute ""property or rights to property"" of the delinquent taxpayer.  Pp.  472 U. S. 721-722.
(b) In applying the Internal Revenue Code, state law controls in determining the nature of the legal interest which the taxpayer has in property.  In this case, the delinquent taxpayer had an absolute right under state law to withdraw from the joint accounts, and such state law right constitutes ""property [or] rights to property"" belonging to him within the meaning of  6331(a).  Respondent, in its turn, was ""obligated with respect to"" the taxpayer's right to that property under  6332(a), since state law required it to honor any withdrawal request he might make.  Respondent thus had no basis for refusing to honor the levy.  In a levy proceeding, the IRS acquires whatever right the taxpayer himself possesses.  Pp.  472 U. S. 722-726.
(c) The question whether a state law right constitutes ""property"" or ""right to property"" for federal tax collection purposes is a matter of federal law.  Thus, the facts that, under Arkansas law, the delinquent taxpayer's creditors could not exercise his right to withdrawal in their favor, and in a garnishment proceeding would have to join his codepositors, are irrelevant.  That other parties may have competing claims to the account is not a legitimate statutory defense to the levy.  A  6331(a) administrative levy is only a provisional remedy, which does not determine the rights of third parties until after the levy is made, in postseizure administrative or judicial hearings.  Pp.  472 U. S. 726-733.

No. 83-18
Argued March 21, 1984
Decided June 26, 1985
472 U.S. 749

Syllabus 
Petitioner credit reporting agency sent a report to five subscribers indicating that respondent construction contractor had filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy.  The report was false, and grossly misrepresented respondent's assets and liabilities.  Thereafter, petitioner issued a corrective notice, but respondent was dissatisfied with this notice and brought a defamation action in Vermont state court, alleging that the false report had injured its reputation and seeking damages.  After trial, the jury returned a verdict in respondent's favor and awarded both compensatory or presumed damages and punitive damages.  But the trial court believed that Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, controlled, and granted petitioner's motion for a new trial on the ground that the instructions to the jury permitted it to award damages on a lesser showing than ""actual malice.""  The Vermont Supreme Court reversed, holding that Gertz was inapplicable to nonmedia defamation actions.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
143 Vt. 66, 461 A.2d 414, affirmed.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by JUSTICE REHNQUIST and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded that:
1. The fact that the jury instructions in question referred to ""malice,"" ""lack of good faith,"" and ""actual malice,"" did not require the jury to find ""actual malice,"" as respondent contends, where the instructions failed to define any of these terms.  Consequently, the trial court correctly concluded that the instructions did not satisfy Gertz.  Pp.  472 U. S. 753-755.
2. Permitting recovery of presumed and punitive damages in defamation cases absent a showing of ""actual malice"" does not violate the First Amendment when the defamatory statements do not involve matters of public concern.  Pp.  472 U. S. 755-763.
(a) In light of the reduced constitutional value of speech on matters of purely private concern, as opposed to speech on matters of public concern, the state interest in compensating private individuals for injury to their reputation adequately supports awards of presumed and punitive damages -- even absent a showing of ""actual malice.""  Cf. Gertz.  Pp.  472 U. S. 755-761.
(b) Gertz, supra, does not apply to this case.  Petitioner's credit report concerned no public issue but was speech solely in the individual 
Page 472 U. S. 750
 interest of the speaker and its specific business audience.  This particular interest warranted no special protection when it was wholly false and damaging to the victim's business reputation.  Moreover, since the credit report was made available to only five subscribers, who, under the subscription agreement, could not disseminate it further, it cannot be said that the report involved any strong interest in the free flow of commercial information.  And the speech here, like advertising, being solely motivated by a desire for profit, is hardy and unlikely to be deterred by incidental state regulation.  In any event, the market provides a powerful incentive to a credit reporting agency to be accurate, since false reporting is of no use to creditors.  Pp.  472 U. S. 761-763.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE concluded that Gertz is inapplicable to this case, because the allegedly defamatory expression involved did not relate to a matter of public concern, and that no other reason was needed to dispose of the case.  Pp.  472 U. S. 763-764.
JUSTICE WHITE concluded that Gertz should not be applied to this case either because Gertz should be overruled or because the defamatory publication in question did not deal with a matter of public importance.  P.  472 U. S. 774.

During the 1970's, petitioner produced or purchased natural gas from leased land located in 11 States.  Respondents, royalty owners possessing rights to leases from which petitioner produced the gas, brought a class action against petitioner in a Kansas state court, seeking to recover interest on royalty payments that had been delayed by petitioner.  The trial court certified a class consisting of 33,000 royalty owners.  Respondents provided each class member with a notice by first-class mail describing the action and informing each member that he could appear in person or by counsel, that otherwise he would be represented by respondents, and that class members would be included in the class and bound by the judgment unless they ""opted out"" of the action by returning a ""request for exclusion.""  The final class consisted of some 28,000 members, who reside in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and several foreign countries.  Notwithstanding that over 99% of the gas leases in question and some 97% of the plaintiff class members had no apparent connection to Kansas except for the lawsuit, the trial court applied Kansas contract and equity law to every claim, and found petitioner liable for interest on the suspended royalties to all class members.  The Kansas Supreme Court affirmed over petitioner's contentions that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevented Kansas from adjudicating the claims of all the class members, and that that Clause and the Full Faith and Credit Clause prohibited application of Kansas law to all of the transactions between petitioner and the class members.
Held:
1. Petitioner has standing to assert the claim that Kansas did not have jurisdiction over the class members who were not Kansas residents and had no connection to Kansas.  Whether it wins or loses on the merits, petitioner has a distinct and personal interest in seeing the entire plaintiff class bound by res judicata just as petitioner is bound.  The only way petitioner can assure itself of this binding effect is to ascertain that the forum court has jurisdiction over every plaintiff whose claim it seeks to adjudicate, sufficient to support a res judicata defense in a later suit by class members.  The alleged injury petitioner would incur if the class action judgment against it became final without binding the plaintiff class is sufficient to give petitioner standing on its own right to raise the jurisdiction claim in this Court.  Pp.  472 U. S. 803-806. 
Page 472 U. S. 798

2. The Kansas trial court properly asserted personal jurisdiction over the absent plaintiff class members and their claims against petitioner.  The Due Process Clause requires notice, an opportunity to appear in person or by counsel, an opportunity to ""opt out,"" and adequate representation.  It does not require that absent class members affirmatively ""opt in"" to the class, rather than be deemed members of the class if they did not ""opt out.""  The procedure followed by Kansas, where a fully descriptive notice is sent by first-class mail to each class member, with an explanation of the right to ""opt out,"" satisfies due process.  The interests of the absent plaintiff class members are sufficiently protected by the forum State when those plaintiffs are provided with a request for exclusion that can be returned within a reasonable time to the trial court.  Pp.  472 U. S. 806-814.
3. The Kansas Supreme Court erred in deciding that the application of Kansas law to all claims would be constitutional.  Kansas must have a ""significant contact or aggregation of contacts"" to the claims asserted by each plaintiff class member in order to ensure that the choice of Kansas law was not arbitrary or unfair.  Given Kansas' lack of ""interest"" in claims unrelated to that State, and the substantive conflict between Kansas law and the law of other States, such as Texas, where some of the leased land in question is located, application of Kansas law to every claim in this case was sufficiently arbitrary and unfair as to exceed constitutional limits.  Pp.  472 U. S. 814-823.

472 U.S. 846

Syllabus 
Petitioner named representatives of a class of undocumented and unadmitted aliens from Haiti filed suit in Federal District Court alleging that the change by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) from a policy of general parole for undocumented aliens seeking admission to a policy, based on no statute or regulation, of detention without parole for aliens who could not present a prima facie case for admission was unlawful because it did not comply with the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  It was further alleged that the restrictive parole policy, as executed by INS officers in the field, violated the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment because it discriminated against petitioners on the basis of race and national origin.  The District Court held for petitioners on the APA claim, but concluded that they had failed to prove discrimination on the basis of race or national origin.  The court then enjoined future use of the restrictive parole policy, but stayed the injunction to permit the INS to promulgate a new parole policy in compliance with the APA.  The INS promptly promulgated a new rule that prohibits the consideration of race or national origin.  Ultimately, the Court of Appeals held that the APA claim was moot because the Government was no longer detaining any class members under the invalidated policy, and that the Fifth Amendment did not apply to the consideration of unadmitted aliens for parole.  The court then remanded the case to the District Court to permit review of the INS officials' discretion under the new nondiscriminatory rule.
Held:  Because the current statutes and regulations provide petitioners with nondiscriminatory parole consideration, there was no need for the Court of Appeals to address the constitutional issue, but it properly remanded the case to the District Court.  On remand, the District Court must consider (1) whether INS officials exercised their discretion under the statute to make individualized parole determinations, and (2) whether they exercised this discretion under the statutes and regulations without regard to race or national origin.  Such remand protects the class members from the very conduct they fear, and the fact that the protection results from a regulation or statute, rather than from a constitutional

No. 84-231
Argued February 20, 1985
Decided June 24, 1985
472 U.S. 612

Syllabus 
A New Mexico statute exempts from the State's property tax $2,000 of the taxable value of property of honorably discharged veterans who served on active duty during the Vietnam War for at least 90 continuous days, but limits the exemption to veterans who were New Mexico residents before May 8, 1976.  Appellants, an otherwise qualified Vietnam veteran and his wife, established residence in New Mexico in 1981 and applied for the tax exemption for the 1983 tax year with respect to their jointly held real property in Bernalillo County.  Appellee County Assessor denied the claim because of the residence requirement, and the County Valuation Board upheld the denial, rejecting appellants' contention that the residence requirement violated their Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the law.  The New Mexico Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The New Mexico statute's residence requirement violates the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  472 U. S. 616-624.
(a) By dividing resident Vietnam veterans into two groups, based on whether they were residents before May 8, 1976, the statute creates a fixed permanent distinction between classes of concededly bona fide residents.  When a state distributes benefits unequally, the distinctions it makes are subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  Under the minimum-rationality test, a law will survive scrutiny if the distinction rationally furthers a legitimate state purpose.  Pp.  472 U. S. 616-618.
(b) The distinction New Mexico makes between veterans who established residence before May 8, 1976, and those veterans who arrived in the State thereafter bears no rational relationship to the State's asserted objective of encouraging Vietnam veterans to move to New Mexico.  The legislature did not set the eligibility date until 1983, long after the triggering event occurred, and thus cannot plausibly encourage veterans to move to the State by passing such retroactive legislation.  Pp.  472 U. S. 619-620.
(c) With regard to the asserted purpose of the statute to reward veterans who resided in the State before May 8, 1976, for their military service, the component of compensating veterans for past contributions is plainly legitimate.  Consistent with this policy, a state may award certain benefits to all its bona fide veterans, because it then is making neither an invidious nor an irrational distinction among its residents.  The New Mexico statute, however, confers a benefit only on ""established"" resident veterans -- those who resided in the State before May 8, 
Page 472 U. S. 613
 1976 -- and the State seeks to justify this distinction on the basis that those veterans who left their homes in New Mexico to fight in Vietnam, as well as those who settled in the State within the few years after the war ended, deserve to be treated differently from veterans who establish New Mexico residence after May 8, 1976.  Even assuming that the State may legitimately grant benefits on the basis of a coincidence between military service and past residence, the New Mexico statute's distinction as between two categories of resident veterans is not rationally related to the State's asserted legislative goal.  Pp.  472 U. S. 620-622.
(d) The New Mexico statute, by singling out previous residents for the tax exemption, rewards only those citizens for their ""past contributions"" toward the Nation's military effort in Vietnam.  Such an objective is not a legitimate state purpose.  Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55.  The State may not favor established residents over new residents based on the view that the State may take care of ""its own,"" if such is defined by prior residence.  Newcomers, by establishing bona fide residence in the State, become the State's ""own"" and may not be discriminated against solely on the basis of their arrival in the State after May 8, 1976.  Pp.  472 U. S. 622-623.
(e) This Court will not rule on the severability of the unconstitutional residence requirement from the balance of the New Mexico veterans' tax-exemption statute.  It is for the New Mexico courts to decide, as a matter of state law, whether the legislature would have enacted the statute without the invalid portion.  Pp.  472 U. S. 623-624.

No. 84-310
Argued April 16, 1985
June 24, 1985
472 U.S. 634

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who was appointed by the Federal District Court for the District of North Dakota to represent a defendant under the Criminal Justice Act (Act), was awarded almost $1,800 by the court for services and expenses in handling the assignment.  As required by the Act with regard to expenditures for compensation in excess of $1,000, the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reviewed the claim, found it to be insufficiently documented, and returned it with a request for additional documentation.  Because of computer problems, petitioner could not readily provide the information in the requested form, but filed a supplemental application.  The Chief Judge's secretary again returned the application, stating that petitioner's documentation was unacceptable; petitioner then discussed the matter with the District Judge's secretary, who suggested that he write a letter expressing his views.  In October, 1983, petitioner wrote a letter to the District Judge's secretary in which (in an admittedly ""harsh"" tone) he declined to submit further documentation, refused to accept further assignments under the Act, and criticized the administration of the Act.  Viewing the letter as seeking changes in the process for providing fees, the District Judge discussed those concerns with petitioner and then forwarded the letter to the Chief Judge.  In subsequent correspondence with the District Judge, the Chief Judge of the Circuit stated, inter alia, that he considered petitioner's October letter to be ""totally disrespectful to the federal courts and to the judicial system,"" and that, unless petitioner apologized, an order would be issued directing petitioner to show cause why he should not be suspended from practice in the Circuit.  After petitioner declined to apologize, an order was issued directing petitioner to show cause why he should not be suspended for his ""refusal to carry out his obligations as a practicing lawyer and officer of [the] court"" because of his refusal to accept assignments under the Act; however, at the subsequent hearing, the Court of Appeals focused on whether petitioner's October letter was disrespectful, and petitioner again refused to apologize for the letter.  Ultimately, the Court of Appeals suspended petitioner from the practice of law in the federal courts in the Circuit for six months, indicating that its action was based on petitioner's ""refusal to show continuing respect for the court,"" and specifically finding that petitioner's ""disrespectful statements"" in his October letter as to the court's 
Page 472 U. S. 635
 administration of the Act constituted ""contumacious conduct"" rendering him ""not presently fit to practice law in the federal courts.""
Held:  Petitioner's conduct and expressions did not warrant his suspension from practice.  Pp.  472 U. S. 642-647.
(a) Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 46, which sets forth the standard for disciplining attorneys practicing before the courts of appeals, an attorney may be suspended or disbarred if found guilty of ""conduct unbecoming a member of the bar of the court.""  The quoted phrase must be read in light of the complex code of behavior to which attorneys are subject, reflecting the burdens inherent in the attorney's dual obligations to clients and to the system of justice.  In this light, ""conduct unbecoming a member of the bar"" is conduct contrary to professional standards that shows an unfitness to discharge continuing obligations to clients or the courts, or conduct inimical to the administration of justice.  Pp.  472 U. S. 642-645.
(b) Petitioner's refusal to submit further documentation in support of his fee request could afford a basis for declining to award a fee, but the record does not support the Court of Appeals' action suspending petitioner from practice; the submission of adequate documentation was only a prerequisite to the collection of his fee, not an affirmative obligation required by his duties to a client or the court.  Nor, as the Court of Appeals ultimately concluded, was petitioner legally obligated under the terms of the local plan to accept cases under the Act.  A lawyer's criticism of the administration of the Act or of inequities in assignments under the Act does not constitute cause for suspension; as officers of the court, members of the bar may appropriately express criticism on such matters.  Even assuming that petitioner's October letter exhibited an unlawyerlike rudeness, a single incident of rudeness or lack of professional courtesy -- in the context here -- does not support a finding of contemptuous or contumacious conduct, or a finding that a lawyer is not presently fit to practice law in the federal courts; nor does it rise to the level of ""conduct unbecoming a member of the bar"" warranting suspension from practice.  Pp.  472 U. S. 645-647.

No. 84-310

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who was appointed by the Federal District Court for the District of North Dakota to represent a defendant under the Criminal Justice Act (Act), was awarded almost $1,800 by the court for services and expenses in handling the assignment.  As required by the Act with regard to expenditures for compensation in excess of $1,000, the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reviewed the claim, found it to be insufficiently documented, and returned it with a request for additional documentation.  Because of computer problems, petitioner could not readily provide the information in the requested form, but filed a supplemental application.  The Chief Judge's secretary again returned the application, stating that petitioner's documentation was unacceptable; petitioner then discussed the matter with the District Judge's secretary, who suggested that he write a letter expressing his views.  In October, 1983, petitioner wrote a letter to the District Judge's secretary in which (in an admittedly ""harsh"" tone) he declined to submit further documentation, refused to accept further assignments under the Act, and criticized the administration of the Act.  Viewing the letter as seeking changes in the process for providing fees, the District Judge discussed those concerns with petitioner and then forwarded the letter to the Chief Judge.  In subsequent correspondence with the District Judge, the Chief Judge of the Circuit stated, inter alia, that he considered petitioner's October letter to be ""totally disrespectful to the federal courts and to the judicial system,"" and that, unless petitioner apologized, an order would be issued directing petitioner to show cause why he should not be suspended from practice in the Circuit.  After petitioner declined to apologize, an order was issued directing petitioner to show cause why he should not be suspended for his ""refusal to carry out his obligations as a practicing lawyer and officer of [the] court"" because of his refusal to accept assignments under the Act; however, at the subsequent hearing, the Court of Appeals focused on whether petitioner's October letter was disrespectful, and petitioner again refused to apologize for the letter.  Ultimately, the Court of Appeals suspended petitioner from the practice of law in the federal courts in the Circuit for six months, indicating that its action was based on petitioner's ""refusal to show continuing respect for the court,"" and specifically finding that petitioner's ""disrespectful statements"" in his October letter as to the court's 
Page 472 U. S. 635
 administration of the Act constituted ""contumacious conduct"" rendering him ""not presently fit to practice law in the federal courts.""
Held:  Petitioner's conduct and expressions did not warrant his suspension from practice.  Pp.  472 U. S. 642-647.
(a) Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 46, which sets forth the standard for disciplining attorneys practicing before the courts of appeals, an attorney may be suspended or disbarred if found guilty of ""conduct unbecoming a member of the bar of the court.""  The quoted phrase must be read in light of the complex code of behavior to which attorneys are subject, reflecting the burdens inherent in the attorney's dual obligations to clients and to the system of justice.  In this light, ""conduct unbecoming a member of the bar"" is conduct contrary to professional standards that shows an unfitness to discharge continuing obligations to clients or the courts, or conduct inimical to the administration of justice.  Pp.  472 U. S. 642-645.
(b) Petitioner's refusal to submit further documentation in support of his fee request could afford a basis for declining to award a fee, but the record does not support the Court of Appeals' action suspending petitioner from practice; the submission of adequate documentation was only a prerequisite to the collection of his fee, not an affirmative obligation required by his duties to a client or the court.  Nor, as the Court of Appeals ultimately concluded, was petitioner legally obligated under the terms of the local plan to accept cases under the Act.  A lawyer's criticism of the administration of the Act or of inequities in assignments under the Act does not constitute cause for suspension; as officers of the court, members of the bar may appropriately express criticism on such matters.  Even assuming that petitioner's October letter exhibited an unlawyerlike rudeness, a single incident of rudeness or lack of professional courtesy -- in the context here -- does not support a finding of contemptuous or contumacious conduct, or a finding that a lawyer is not presently fit to practice law in the federal courts; nor does it rise to the level of ""conduct unbecoming a member of the bar"" warranting suspension from practice.  Pp.  472 U. S. 645-647.
734 F.2d 334, reversed.

472 U.S. 648

Syllabus 
Under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (Act), a federal employee may challenge agency disciplinary action by appealing the agency's decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board), or, if he is a member of a federal employees' labor union, he may, in the alternative, challenge the action through any grievance and arbitration procedure provided by the collective bargaining agreement between the agency and the union.  Under 5 U.S.C.  7701(c)(2)(A), the Board may not sustain the agency's action if the employee ""shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision.""  The Act also requires an arbitrator to apply this ""harmful error"" rule in grievance and arbitration procedures under a bargaining agreement.  Two employees of the General Services Administration (GSA), members of a union having a bargaining agreement with the GSA, were removed from their jobs for falsification of records and other reasons.  When the employees were first interrogated about the wrongdoing, and later when they admitted it in sworn affidavits, they were not advised that they were entitled to have a union representative present.  The employees also did not receive notices of proposed removal until almost three months after the wrongdoing.  The employees challenged their removals under the bargaining agreement's grievance and arbitration procedures.  The arbitrator, while finding that the wrongdoing normally would justify removal, also found that the GSA had committed procedural errors in violation of the bargaining agreement by failing to give the employees an opportunity to have a union representative present during interrogation and by unreasonably delaying issuance of the notices of proposed removal.  The arbitrator concluded that, although the errors did not prejudice the employees, the removals were not for just cause.  Accordingly, the arbitrator reduced the penalties to two weeks' suspension without pay.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in substantial part, holding that although the employees were not prejudiced, the arbitrator, in making the ultimate award, could take into account significant violations of the bargaining agreement that were important to the union, because such violations were tantamount to ""harmful error"" to the union within the scope of  7701(c)(2)(A).  The Court of Appeals also ruled that the 
Page 472 U. S. 649
 reduction of the penalties was a proper means of ""penalizing the agency"" for disregarding the agreement's procedural protections.
Held:  Under  7701(c)(2)(A), the employee-grievant must show error that caused substantial prejudice to his individual rights by possibly affecting the agency's decision.  Pp.  472 U. S. 657-665.
(a) The Board has so interpreted  7701(c)(2)(A) in its regulation defining ""harmful error,"" and its interpretation is entitled to deference.  To apply a different definition of ""harmful error"" in an arbitral context than in a Board proceeding, so as to permit an arbitrator to overturn agency disciplinary action on the basis of a violation of a bargaining agreement that is harmful only to the union, would directly contravene the Act's purpose of promoting consistency in resolving federal employee grievances and avoiding forum shopping.  Pp.  472 U. S. 657-662.
(b) Moreover, the ""harmful error"" rule must be interpreted as the Board interprets it if the underlying purpose of the Act of maintaining an effective and efficient Government, and the particular purpose of  7701 to give agencies greater ability to remove or discipline erring employees expeditiously, are to be carried out.  The purpose of the Act of strengthening federal employee unions and making the collective bargaining process more effective is not undermined by application of the Board's interpretation of the ""harmful error"" rule in the arbitral context.  Under any interpretation of the rule, unions are free to bargain for procedures to govern agency actions, and agencies must follow agreed-upon procedures.  If the agency violates these procedures with prejudice to the individual employee's rights, any resulting agency disciplinary decision will be reversed.  Whether or not there is prejudice to the individual employee, the union may file a grievance in its own behalf and, in the case of a clear breach of the agreement, may file an unfair labor practice charge with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.  Thus, the union has adequate remedies of its own for enforcing agency compliance with the procedural requirements of the bargaining agreement.  Pp.  472 U. S. 662-665.

Syllabus 
Title 18 U.S.C.  1382 makes it unlawful to reenter a military base after having been ""ordered not to reenter by any officer in command or charge thereof.""  In 1972, respondent received from the commanding officer of Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii a letter (bar letter) forbidding him to reenter the base without written permission from the commanding officer or his designate.  The letter was issued after respondent and a companion entered the base and destroyed Government property.  In 1981, respondent, with some friends, entered Hickam again during the base's annual open house for Armed Forces Day.  Respondent's companions engaged in a peaceful demonstration criticizing the nuclear arms race, but respondent only took photographs of the displays at the open house, and did not disrupt the activities there.  The commanding officer directed the chief of the security police to have the individuals cease their demonstration, and further informed him that he believed one of the individuals involved had been barred from Hickam.  Respondent and his companions were escorted off the base, and respondent was subsequently convicted in Federal District Court of violating  1382.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent had a First Amendment right to enter Hickam during the open house because the base had been transformed into a temporary public forum.
Held:
1. Section 1382 applies to respondent's conduct.  Viewed in light of the ordinary meaning of the statutory language, respondent violated  1382 when he reentered Hickam in 1981.  Moreover,  1382's legislative history and its purpose of protecting Government property in relation to the national defense support the statute's application to respondent.  There is no merit to respondent's contentions that  1382 does not allow indefinite exclusion from a military base, but instead applies only to reentry that occurs within some ""reasonable"" period of time after a person's ejection; that  1382 does not apply when a military base is open to the general public for purposes of attending an open house; and that reentry is unlawful under  1382 only if a person knows that his conduct violates an extant order not to return, whereas respondent did not subjectively believe that his attendance at the open house was contrary to a valid order barring reentry.  And the assertion that respondent lacked 
Page 472 U. S. 676
 notice that his reentry was prohibited is implausible, since the bar letter did not indicate that it applied only when public access to Hickam was restricted, and any uncertainty he had in this regard might have been eliminated had he sought, in accord with the bar letter, permission to reenter from the commanding officer.  Pp.  472 U. S. 679-684.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the First Amendment bars respondent's conviction for violating  1382 by his reentry during the open house.  Flower v. United States, 407 U. S. 197, distinguished.  A military base generally is not a public forum, and Hickam did not become a public forum merely because the base was used to communicate ideas or information during the open house.  Moreover, regardless of whether Hickam constituted a public forum on the day of the open house, respondent's exclusion did not violate the First Amendment.  The fact that respondent had previously received a valid bar letter distinguished him from the general public and provided a reasonable ground for excluding him from the base.  Nor does the general exclusion of recipients of bar letters from military open houses violate the First Amendment on the asserted ground that such exclusion is greater than is essential to the furtherance of Government interests in the security of military installations.  Exclusion of holders of bar letters in such circumstances promotes an important Government interest in assuring the security of military installations.  Nothing in the First Amendment requires military commanders to wait until persons subject to a valid bar order have entered a military base to see if they will conduct themselves properly during an open house.  Pp.  472 U. S. 684-690.
3. Since the Court of Appeals did not address whether, on the facts of this case, application of the 1972 bar letter to respondent was so patently arbitrary as to violate due process, this Court does not decide that issue.  P.  472 U. S. 690.

Syllabus 
Respondent filed a libel action against petitioner in a North Carolina state court under the common law of that State, alleging that while respondent was being considered for the position of United States Attorney, petitioner wrote two letters to President Reagan (and sent copies to other Government officials) containing ""false, slanderous, libelous, inflammatory and derogatory statements"" concerning respondent, and that petitioner knew that the statements were false and maliciously intended to injure respondent by undermining his prospect of being appointed United States Attorney.  Seeking compensatory and punitive damages, respondent also alleged, inter alia, that the letters had their intended effect, resulting in his not being appointed, and that his reputation and career as an attorney were injured.  Petitioner removed the case to Federal District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship and then moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the Petition Clause of the First Amendment -- which guarantees ""the right of the people . . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances"" -- provided absolute immunity from liability.  The District Court held that the Clause does not grant absolute immunity, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The Petition Clause does not provide absolute immunity to defendants charged with expressing libelous and damaging falsehoods in petitions to Government officials.  Although the value in the right of petition as an important aspect of self-government is beyond question, it does not follow that the Framers of the First Amendment believed that the Petition Clause provided absolute immunity from damages for libel.  In 1845, this Court, after reviewing the common law, held in White v. Nicholls, 3 How. 266, that a petition to a Government official was actionable if prompted by ""express malice,"" which was defined as ""falsehood and the absence of probable cause,"" and nothing has been presented to suggest that that holding should be altered.  Nor do the Court's decisions interpreting the Petition Clause in contexts other than defamation indicate that the right to petition is absolute.  The Clause was inspired by the same ideals of liberty and democracy that resulted in the First Amendment freedoms to speak, publish, and assemble, and there is no

 sound basis for granting greater constitutional protection to statements made in a petition than other First Amendment expressions.  Pp.  472 U. S. 482-485.
2. Under North Carolina common law, damages may be recovered only if petitioner is shown to have acted with ""malice,"" as defined in terms that the North Carolina Court of Appeals considered to be consistent with New York Times Co. v.

Held:
The Court of Appeals erred in facially invalidating the statute in its entirety.  Pp.  472 U. S. 496-507.
(a) These cases are governed by the normal rule that partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course.

(b) Since prurience may be constitutionally defined for the purposes of identifying obscenity as that which appeals to a shameful or morbid interest in sex, Roth v. United States, 354 U.

Moreover, if the Court of Appeals thought that ""lust"" refers only to normal

 sexual appetites, it could have excised the word from the statute, since the definition also refers to ""lasciviousness.""  Pp.  472 U. S. 504-505.
(c) Even if the statute had not defined prurience at all, there would have been no satisfactory ground for striking it down in its entirety.  The statute itself contains a severability clause, and it is evident that, if the statute were invalidated insofar as it proscribes materials that appeal to normal sexual appetites, the remainder of the statute would retain its effectiveness as a regulation of obscenity.  In these circumstances, the issue of severability is no obstacle to partial invalidation.  Pp.  472 U. S. 506-507.

Argued February 27, 1985

472 U.S. 511

Syllabus 
In 1970, petitioner, who was then the Attorney General, authorized a warrantless wiretap for the purpose of gathering intelligence regarding the activities of a radical group that had made tentative plans to take actions threatening the Nation's security.  During the time the wiretap was installed, the Government intercepted three conversations between a member of the group and respondent.  Thereafter, this Court in United States v. United States District Court, 407 U. S. 297 (Keith), ruled that the Fourth Amendment does not permit warrantless wiretaps in cases involving domestic threats to the national security.  Respondent then filed a damages action in Federal District Court against petitioner and others, alleging that the surveillance to which he had been subjected violated the Fourth Amendment and Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act.  Ultimately, the District Court, granting respondent's motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability, held that petitioner was not entitled to either absolute or qualified immunity.  The Court of Appeals agreed with the denial of absolute immunity, but held, with respect to the denial of qualified immunity, that the District Court's order was not appealable under the collateral order doctrine.
Held:
1. Petitioner is not absolutely immune from suit for damages arising out of his allegedly unconstitutional conduct in performing his national security functions.  His status as a Cabinet officer is not in itself sufficient to invest him with absolute immunity.  The considerations of separation of powers that call for absolute immunity for state and federal legislators and for the President do not demand a similar immunity for Cabinet officers or other high executive officials.  Nor does the nature of the Attorney General's national security functions -- as opposed to his prosecutorial functions -- warrant absolute immunity.  Petitioner points to no historical or common law basis for absolute immunity for officers carrying out tasks essential to national security, such as pertains to absolute immunity for judges, prosecutors, and witnesses.  The performance of national security functions does not subject an official to the same risks of entanglement in vexatious litigation as does the carrying out of the judicial or ""quasijudicial"" tasks that have been the primary wellsprings of absolute immunities.  And the danger that high federal officials will disregard constitutional rights in their zeal to protect the 
Page 472 U. S. 512
 national security is sufficiently real to counsel against affording such officials an absolute immunity.  Pp.  472 U. S. 520-524.
2. The District Court's denial of qualified immunity, to the extent it turned on a question of law, is an appealable ""final decision"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.  Qualified immunity, similar to absolute immunity, is an entitlement not to stand trial under certain circumstances.  Such entitlement is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability; and like absolute immunity, it is effectively lot if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.  Accordingly, the reasoning that underlies the immediate appealability of the denial of absolute immunity indicates that the denial of qualified immunity should be similarly appealable under the ""collateral order"" doctrine;  in each case, the district court's decision is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.  The denial of qualified immunity also meets the additional criteria for an appealable interlocutory order:  it conclusively determines the disputed question, and it involves a claim of rights separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action.  Pp.  472 U. S. 524-530.
3. Petitioner is entitled to qualified immunity from suit for his authorization of the wiretap in question notwithstanding his actions violated the Fourth Amendment.  Under Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, petitioner is immune unless his actions violated clearly established law.  In 1970, when the wiretap took place, well over a year before Keith, supra, was decided, it was not clearly established that such a wiretap was unconstitutional.  Pp.  472 U. S. 530-535.

Syllabus 
Petitioners are multiemployer benefit plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The plans operate under trust agreements for the purpose of providing health, welfare, and pension benefits to employees performing work that is covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated between a labor union and respondent trucking companies.  Under these collective bargaining agreements, each employer must make weekly contributions to petitioners for each such employee, and each employer agrees to be bound by the trust agreements.  Because they are so large, petitioners rely on employer self-reporting to determine the extent of an employer's contribution liability, and police this self-reporting system by conducting random audits of the participating employers' records.  When respondents refused to allow petitioners' requested audit of respondents' payroll, tax, and personnel records, including records of employees who respondents claimed were not plan participants, petitioners filed an action in Federal District Court seeking an order permitting the audit.  The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of petitioners.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that petitioners had to show ""reasonable cause"" to believe that a specific employee was covered by the plans before gaining a right of access to that employee's records.
Held:  Respondents must allow petitioners to conduct the requested audit.  Pp.  472 U. S. 565-581.
(a) Various provisions of the trust agreements granting the trustees power to enable them to administer the trusts properly, including a provision granting power to demand and examine pertinent employer records, support the right to audit claimed by petitioners.  Moreover, petitioners' assertion that the requested audit is highly relevant to the trust agreements' legitimate interests fully conforms to generally accepted auditing standards.  Pp.  472 U. S. 565-568.
(b) Petitioners' trustees' interpretation of the trust agreements as authorizing the requested audit is not inconsistent with ERISA, and indeed, is entirely reasonable in light of ERISA's policies.  Rather 
Page 472 U. S. 560
 than explicitly enumerating all of the powers and duties of trustees, Congress invoked the common law of trusts to define the scope of their authority and responsibility.  Under the common law, trustees have all such powers as are necessary or appropriate for the carrying out of the trust purposes, and an examination of ERISA's structure in light of the common law leaves no doubt as to the validity and weight of the audit goals on which petitioners rely.  Both the concerns for fully informing participants of their rights and status under a plan and for assuring the financial integrity of the plans by determining the class of potential benefit claimants and by holding employers to the full and prompt fulfillment of their contribution obligations are proper and weighty within ERISA's framework.  Pp.  472 U. S. 568-574.
(c) A benefit plan should not have to rely on union monitoring of an employer's compliance with its trust obligations as an alternative to audits by the plans themselves.  Cf. Schneider Moving & Storage Co. v. Robbins, 466 U. S. 364.  A trustee's duty extends to all participants and beneficiaries of a multiemployer plan, whereas a union's duty is confined to current employees employed in the bargaining unit in which it has representational rights.  Nor would the Department of Labor's policing of employer compliance be an acceptable alternative.  That Department has insufficient resources for such policing, and neither ERISA's structure nor its legislative history shows any congressional intent that benefit plans should rely primarily on centralized federal monitoring of employer contributions requirements.  Pp.  472 U. S. 575-579.
(d) To rely on covered employees themselves to come forward to assure that employers make the required contributions would not be feasible.  While ERISA's reporting requirements are designed to assure that participants receive information about their status and rights, they do so by placing a reporting duty on the plans.  Thus, to give participants initial notice of their status, the plans would need to know the participants' identities, the very information that the requested audit here sought to verify.  P.  472 U. S. 579.
(e) The fact that a benefit plan could bring an action against a delinquent employer as the employer's breaches of its obligations are discovered does not foreclose the plan from seeking to deter such breaches or discover them early.  To suggest that a plan should be so foreclosed ignores the trustees' various fiduciary duties under ERISA and conflicts with ERISA's concern that plans should assure themselves of adequate funding by promptly collecting employer contributions.

No. 84-510
Argued March 27, 1985
Decided June 19, 1985
472 U.S. 585

Syllabus 
Respondent, which owns one of the four major mountain facilities for downhill skiing at Aspen, Colo., filed a treble-damages action in Federal District Court in 1979 against petitioner, which owns the other three major facilities, alleging that petitioner had monopolized the market for downhill skiing services at Aspen in violation of  2 of the Sherman Act.  The evidence showed that in earlier years, when there were only three major facilities operated by three independent companies (including both petitioner and respondent), each competitor offered both its own tickets for daily use of its mountain and an interchangeable 6-day all-Aspen ticket, which provided convenience to skiers who visited the resort for weekly periods but preferred to remain flexible about what mountain they might ski each day.  Petitioner, upon acquiring its second of the three original facilities and upon opening the fourth, also offered, during most of the ski seasons, a weekly multiarea ticket covering only its mountains, but eventually the all-Aspen ticket outsold petitioner's own multiarea ticket.  Over the years, the method for allocation of revenues from the all-Aspen ticket to the competitors developed into a system based on random-sample surveys to determine the number of skiers who used each mountain.  However, for the 1977-1978 ski season, respondent, in order to secure petitioner's agreement to continue to sell all-Aspen tickets, was required to accept a fixed percentage of the ticket's revenues.  When respondent refused to accept a lower percentage -- considerably below its historical average based on usage -- for the next season, petitioner discontinued its sale of the all-Aspen ticket; instead sold 6-day tickets featuring only its own mountains; and took additional actions that made it extremely difficult for respondent to market its own multiarea package to replace the joint offering.  Respondent's share of the market declined steadily thereafter.  The jury returned a verdict against petitioner, fixing respondent's actual damages, and the court entered a judgment for treble damages.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contention that there cannot be a requirement of cooperation between competitors, even when one possesses monopoly powers. 
Page 472 U. S. 586

Held:
1. Although even a firm with monopoly power has no general duty to engage in a joint marketing program with a competitor (and the jury was so instructed here), the absence of an unqualified duty to cooperate does not mean that every time a firm declines to participate in a particular cooperative venture, that decision may not have evidentiary significance, or that it may not give rise to liability in certain circumstances.  Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U. S. 143.  The question of intent is relevant to the offense of monopolization in determining whether the challenged conduct is fairly characterized as ""exclusionary,"" ""anticompetitive,"" or ""predatory.""  In this case, the monopolist did not merely reject a novel offer to participate in a cooperative venture that had been proposed by a competitor, but instead elected to make an important change in a pattern of distribution of all-Aspen tickets that had originated in a competitive market and had persisted for several years.  It must be assumed that the jury, as instructed by the trial court, drew a distinction
""between practices which tend to exclude or restrict competition, on the one hand, and the success of a business which reflects only a superior product, a well-run business, or luck, on the other,""
and that the jury concluded that there were no ""valid business reasons"" for petitioner's refusal to deal with respondent.  Pp.  472 U. S. 600-605.
2. The evidence in the record, construed most favorably in support of respondent's position, is adequate to support the verdict under the instructions given.

			"|"Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.
No. 84-510
Argued March 27, 1985
Decided June 19, 1985
472 U.S. 585

Syllabus 
Respondent, which owns one of the four major mountain facilities for downhill skiing at Aspen, Colo., filed a treble-damages action in Federal District Court in 1979 against petitioner, which owns the other three major facilities, alleging that petitioner had monopolized the market for downhill skiing services at Aspen in violation of  2 of the Sherman Act.  The evidence showed that in earlier years, when there were only three major facilities operated by three independent companies (including both petitioner and respondent), each competitor offered both its own tickets for daily use of its mountain and an interchangeable 6-day all-Aspen ticket, which provided convenience to skiers who visited the resort for weekly periods but preferred to remain flexible about what mountain they might ski each day.  Petitioner, upon acquiring its second of the three original facilities and upon opening the fourth, also offered, during most of the ski seasons, a weekly multiarea ticket covering only its mountains, but eventually the all-Aspen ticket outsold petitioner's own multiarea ticket.  Over the years, the method for allocation of revenues from the all-Aspen ticket to the competitors developed into a system based on random-sample surveys to determine the number of skiers who used each mountain.  However, for the 1977-1978 ski season, respondent, in order to secure petitioner's agreement to continue to sell all-Aspen tickets, was required to accept a fixed percentage of the ticket's revenues.  When respondent refused to accept a lower percentage -- considerably below its historical average based on usage -- for the next season, petitioner discontinued its sale of the all-Aspen ticket; instead sold 6-day tickets featuring only its own mountains; and took additional actions that made it extremely difficult for respondent to market its own multiarea package to replace the joint offering.  Respondent's share of the market declined steadily thereafter.  The jury returned a verdict against petitioner, fixing respondent's actual damages, and the court entered a judgment for treble damages.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contention that there cannot be a requirement of cooperation between competitors, even when one possesses monopoly powers. 
Page 472 U. S. 586

Held:
1. Although even a firm with monopoly power has no general duty to engage in a joint marketing program with a competitor (and the jury was so instructed here), the absence of an unqualified duty to cooperate does not mean that every time a firm declines to participate in a particular cooperative venture, that decision may not have evidentiary significance, or that it may not give rise to liability in certain circumstances.  Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U. S. 143.  The question of intent is relevant to the offense of monopolization in determining whether the challenged conduct is fairly characterized as ""exclusionary,"" ""anticompetitive,"" or ""predatory.""  In this case, the monopolist did not merely reject a novel offer to participate in a cooperative venture that had been proposed by a competitor, but instead elected to make an important change in a pattern of distribution of all-Aspen tickets that had originated in a competitive market and had persisted for several years.  It must be assumed that the jury, as instructed by the trial court, drew a distinction
""between practices which tend to exclude or restrict competition, on the one hand, and the success of a business which reflects only a superior product, a well-run business, or luck, on the other,""
and that the jury concluded that there were no ""valid business reasons"" for petitioner's refusal to deal with respondent.  Pp.  472 U. S. 600-605.
2. The evidence in the record, construed most favorably in support of respondent's position, is adequate to support the verdict under the instructions given.  In determining whether petitioner's conduct may properly be characterized as exclusionary, it is appropriate to examine the effect of the challenged pattern of conduct on consumers, on respondent, and on petitioner itself.   472 U. S.  605-611.
(a) The evidence showed that, over the years, skiers developed a strong demand for the all-Aspen ticket, and that they were adversely affected by its elimination.   472 U. S.  605-607.

Syllabus 
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of age against employees who are between the ages of 40 and 70 by, inter alia, discharging them or requiring them to retire involuntarily, except when age is shown to be ""a bona fide occupational qualification [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business.""  When the ADEA was amended in 1974 and 1978 to extend it to federal employees and to eliminate substantially all federal age limits on employment, the provision of the federal civil service statute, 5 U.S.C.  8335(b), which requires most federal firefighters to retire at age 55, was left untouched.  Petitioners, firefighters employed by the city of Baltimore, brought an action in Federal District Court, challenging, on the ground that they violated the ADEA, the city's code provisions that establish for firefighters a mandatory retirement age lower than 70.  The city defended on the ground that age is a BFOQ for the position of firefighters.  After a trial, the District Court, holding that the city had failed to produce sufficient evidence to make out this defense, invalidated the challenged provisions.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Relying on EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, in which this Court observed that the ADEA tests a State's discretion to impose a mandatory retirement age ""against a reasonable federal standard,"" the Court of Appeals held that 5 U.S.C.  8335(b) furnished such a standard, that, since Congress had selected age 55 as the retirement age for most federal firefighters, as a matter of law the same age constitutes a BFOQ for all state and local firefighters as well, and that therefore the city was not required to make any factual showing as to the need for the mandatory retirement age.
Held:  Title 5 U.S.C.  8335(b) does not, as a matter of law, establish that age 55 is a BFOQ for nonfederal firefighters within the meaning of the ADEA.  Pp.  472 U. S. 360-371. 
Page 472 U. S. 354

(a) The ""reasonable federal standard"" to which this Court referred in EEOC v. Wyoming, supra, is the standard supplied by the ADEA itself, i.e., whether the age limit is a BFOQ.  Nothing in the ADEA or the decision in EEOC v. Wyoming warrants the conclusion that a federal rule, not found in the ADEA, and by its terms applicable only to federal employees, necessarily authorizes a state or local government to maintain a mandatory retirement age as a matter of law.  The mere fact that some federal firefighters are required to cease work at age 55 does not provide an absolute defense to an ADEA action challenging state and local age limits for firefighters.  Pp.  472 U. S. 360-362.
(b) Neither the language nor the legislative history of the civil service provision indicates that the retirement age for federal firefighters is based on a congressional determination that age 55 is a BFOQ for firefighters within the meaning of the ADEA.  Instead, the provision represents nothing more than a congressional decision that federal firefighters must retire, as a general matter, at age 55.  The history of  8335(b) makes clear that the decision to retire certain federal employees, including firefighters, at an early age was not based on actual occupational qualifications for the covered employment, but rather, in significant part, on an attempt to maintain the image of a youthful workforce by making early retirement attractive and financially rewarding.  Accordingly, it would be error for a court, faced with a challenge under the ADEA to an age limit for nonfederal firefighters, to give any weight to  8335(b).  Pp.  472 U. S. 362-370.

Syllabus 
Alabama's 1975 Death Penalty Act (later repealed) required a jury that convicted a defendant of any one of a number of specified aggravated crimes to ""fix the punishment at death.""  However, the ""sentence"" fixed by the jury was not dispositive, because the Act provided that,
""[n]otwithstanding the fixing of the punishment at death by the jury, the court, after weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances""
brought out at a required sentencing hearing, could refuse to accept the death penalty and, instead, could impose a life sentence, or, after weighing such circumstances, ""and the fixing of the punishment at death by the jury,"" could sentence the defendant to death.  Petitioner was convicted under the Act of a specified capital offense, and the jury's verdict fixed his punishment at death.  After conducting the required sentencing hearing and weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the judge accepted the death penalty as fixed by the jury.  The Alabama Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the conviction and sentence, rejecting petitioner's contention that the Act was facially unconstitutional.  The court held that, even though the jury had no discretion regarding the ""sentence"" it would impose, the sentencing procedure was saved by the fact that it was the trial judge who was the true sentencing authority, and he considered aggravating and mitigating circumstances before imposing sentence.
Held:  Alabama's requirement that the jury return a ""sentence"" of death along with its guilty verdict did not render unconstitutional the death sentence the trial judge imposed after independently considering petitioner's background and character and the circumstances of his crime.  Pp.  472 U. S. 379-389.
(a) Although the Alabama scheme would have been unconstitutional if the jury's mandatory death ""sentence"" were dispositive, there is no merit to petitioner's contention that the trial judge's sentence was unconstitutional because the Act required the judge to consider, and accord some deference to, the jury's ""sentence.""  While the Act's language did not expressly preclude, and might seem to have authorized, the sentencing judge's consideration of the jury's ""sentence"" in determining whether the death penalty was appropriate, the Alabama appellate courts have interpreted the Act to mean that the sentencing judge was to impose a sentence without regard to the jury's mandatory ""sentence.""  Moreover, 
Page 472 U. S. 373
 it was clear that the sentencing judge here did not interpret the statute as requiring him to consider the jury's ""sentence,"" because he never described the ""sentence"" as a factor in his deliberations.  Pp.  472 U. S. 382-386.
(b) Nor is there merit to the contention that a trial judge's decision to impose the death penalty must have been swayed by the fact that the jury returned a ""sentence"" of death.  Beck v.

Syllabus 
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) generally prohibits mandatory retirement before age 70, but  4(f)(1) of the Act provides an exception ""where age is a bona fide occupational qualification [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business.""  Petitioner airline company requires that its flight engineers, who are members of the cockpit crews of petitioners' aircraft but do not operate flight controls unless both the pilot and the copilot become incapacitated, retire at age 60.  A Federal Aviation Administration regulation prohibits any person from serving as a pilot or copilot after reaching his 60th birthday.  Certain of the respondents, who include flight engineers forced to retire at age 60 and pilots who, upon reaching 60, were denied reassignment as flight engineers, brought suit in Federal District Court against petitioner, contending that the age 60 retirement requirement for flight engineers violated the ADEA.  Petitioner defended, in part, on the theory that the requirement is a BFOQ ""reasonably necessary"" to the safe operation of the airline.  The physiological and psychological capabilities of persons over age 60, and the ability to detect disease or a precipitous decline in such capabilities on the basis of individual medical examinations, were the subject of conflicting expert testimony presented by the parties.  The jury instructions included statements that the ""BFOQ defense is available only if it is reasonably necessary to the normal operation or essence of [petitioner's] business""; ""the essence of [petitioner's] business is the safe transportation of [its] passengers""; and petitioner could establish a BFOQ by proving both that
""it was highly impractical for [petitioner] to deal with each [flight engineer] over age 60 on an individualized basis to determine his particular ability to perform his job safely""
and that some flight engineers
""over age 60 possess traits of a physiological, psychological or other nature which preclude safe and efficient job performance that cannot be ascertained by means other than knowing their age.""
The District Court entered judgment based on the jury's verdict for the plaintiffs, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contention that the BFOQ instruction was insufficiently deferential to petitioner's legitimate concern for the safety of its passengers. 
Page 472 U. S. 401

Held:
1. The ADEA's restrictive language, its legislative history, and the consistent interpretation of the administrative agencies charged with enforcing the statute establish that the BFOQ exception was meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of age discrimination contained in the ADEA.  Pp.  472 U. S. 409-412.
2. The relevant considerations for resolving a BFOQ defense to an age-based qualification purportedly justified by safety interests are whether the job qualification is ""reasonably necessary"" to the overriding interest in public safety, and whether the employer is compelled to rely on age as a proxy for the safety-related job qualification validated in the first inquiry.  The latter showing may be made by the employer's establishing either (a) that it had reasonable cause to believe that all or substantially all persons over the age qualification would be unable to perform safely the duties of the job, or (b) that it is highly impractical to deal with the older employees on an individualized basis.  Pp.  472 U. S. 412-417.
3. The jury here was properly instructed on the elements of the BFOQ defense under the above standard, and the instructions were sufficiently protective of public safety.  Pp.  472 U. S. 417-423.
(a) Petitioner's contention that the jury should have been instructed to defer to petitioner's selection of job qualifications for flight engineers ""that are reasonable in light of the safety risks"" is at odds with Congress' decision, in adopting the ADEA, to subject such decisions to a test of objective justification in a court of law.  The BFOQ standard adopted in the statute is one of ""reasonable necessity,"" not reasonableness.  The public interest in safety is adequately reflected in instructions that track the statute's language.  Pp.  472 U. S. 418-420.
(b) The instructions were not defective for failing to inform the jury that an airline must conduct its operations ""with the highest possible degree of safety.""  Viewing the record as a whole, the jury's attention was adequately focused on the importance of safety to the operation of petitioner's business.  Pp.  472 U. S. 420-421.
(c) There is no merit to petitioner's contention that the jury should have been instructed under the standard that the ADEA only requires that the employer establish ""a rational basis in fact"" for believing that identification of those persons lacking suitable qualifications cannot be made on an individualized basis.  Such standard conveys a meaning that is significantly different from that conveyed by the statutory phrase ""reasonably necessary,"" and is inconsistent with the preference for individual evaluation expressed in the language and legislative history of the ADEA.  Nor can such standard be justified on the ground that an employer must be allowed to resolve the controversy in a conservative 
Page 472 U. S. 402
 manner when qualified experts disagree as to whether persons over a certain age can be dealt with on an individual basis.  Such argument incorrectly assumes that all expert opinion is entitled to equal weight, and virtually ignores the function of the trier of fact in evaluating conflicting testimony.  Pp.  472 U.

Pp.  472 U. S. 412-417.
3. The jury here was properly instructed on the elements of the BFOQ defense under the above standard, and the instructions were sufficiently protective of public safety.  Pp.  472 U. S. 417-423.
(a) Petitioner's contention that the jury should have been instructed to defer to petitioner's selection of job qualifications for flight engineers ""that are reasonable in light of the safety risks"" is at odds with Congress' decision, in adopting the ADEA, to subject such decisions to a test of objective justification in a court of law.  The BFOQ standard adopted in the statute is one of ""reasonable necessity,"" not reasonableness.  The public interest in safety is adequately reflected in instructions that track the statute's language.  Pp.  472 U. S. 418-420.
(b) The instructions were not defective for failing to inform the jury that an airline must conduct its operations ""with the highest possible degree of safety.""  Viewing the record as a whole, the jury's attention was adequately focused on the importance of safety to the operation of petitioner's business.  Pp.  472 U. S. 420-421.
(c) There is no merit to petitioner's contention that the jury should have been instructed under the standard that the ADEA only requires that the employer establish ""a rational basis in fact"" for believing that identification of those persons lacking suitable qualifications cannot be made on an individualized basis.  Such standard conveys a meaning that is significantly different from that conveyed by the statutory phrase ""reasonably necessary,"" and is inconsistent with the preference for individual evaluation expressed in the language and legislative history of the ADEA.  Nor can such standard be justified on the ground that an employer must be allowed to resolve the controversy in a conservative 
Page 472 U. S. 402
 manner when qualified experts disagree as to whether persons over a certain age can be dealt with on an individual basis.  Such argument incorrectly assumes that all expert opinion is entitled to equal weight, and virtually ignores the function of the trier of fact in evaluating conflicting testimony.  Pp.  472 U. S. 421-423.

Syllabus 
Respondent Anne Koller was born without normal arms or legs.  She filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that, during pregnancy, her mother had taken an antinausea drug manufactured by petitioner, and that this drug had caused respondent's birth defects.  Respondent was initially represented by Miami and Washington law firms, but a Los Angeles law firm later took the lead in trial preparation.  Before trial, the District Court disqualified the Los Angeles firm and revoked the appearances of two of its attorneys because of misconduct.  Respondent appealed the disqualification to the Court of Appeals, which stayed all proceedings in the District Court pending the outcome of the appeal.  The Court of Appeals thereafter held that 28 U.S.C.  1291 -- which grants courts of appeals jurisdiction of appeals from all ""final decisions of the district courts,"" except where a direct appeal lies to this Court -- confers jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals of orders disqualifying counsel in a civil case.  The Court of Appeals then held that the disqualification in question was invalid.
Held:  Orders disqualifying counsel in a civil case are not collateral orders subject to immediate appeal as ""final judgments"" within the meaning of  1291, and hence the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to entertain respondent's appeal.  Pp.  472 U. S. 429-441.
(a) To fall within the ""collateral order"" exception to the ""final judgment"" rule, an order must ""conclusively determine the disputed question,"" ""resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,"" and ""be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.""  Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463,  437 U. S. 468.  Pp.  472 U. S. 429-432.
(b) One purpose of the ""final judgment"" rule embodied in  1291 is to avoid delay that inherently accompanies time-consuming interlocutory appeals.  When an appellate court accepts jurisdiction of an order disqualifying counsel, the practical effect is to delay proceedings on the merits until the appeal is decided.  A disqualified attorney's personal desire for vindication does not constitute an independent justification for a interlocutory appeal, but, as a matter of professional ethics, the decision to appeal should turn entirely on the client's interest.  Nor does the 
Page 472 U. S. 425
 use of disqualification motions to harass opposing counsel constitute an independent justification for an immediate appeal of the disqualification order, since implicit in  1291 is Congress' judgment that the district judge has primary responsibility to police litigants' prejudgment tactics.  The possibility that a ruling may be erroneous and may impose additional litigation expense is not sufficient to set aside the finality requirement.  Pp.  472 U. S. 433-436.
(c) Civil disqualification orders do not meet the requirements of the ""collateral order"" exception.  If prejudice is not a prerequisite to reversal of a judgment following disqualification of counsel, the propriety of the disqualification order can be reviewed as effectively on appeal of a final judgment as on a interlocutory appeal. If prejudice is a prerequisite to reversal, disqualification orders are not sufficiently separate from the merits to qualify for interlocutory appeal.  Flanagan v. United States, 465 U. S. 259.

Syllabus 
Respondent inmates in a Massachusetts state prison each received disciplinary reports charging them with assaulting another inmate.  At separate hearings, a prison disciplinary board heard testimony from a prison guard and received his written report.  According to this evidence, the guard heard some commotion in a prison walkway and, upon investigating, discovered an inmate who evidently had just been assaulted, and saw three other inmates, including respondents, fleeing down the walkway.  The board found respondents guilty and revoked their good time credits.  After an unsuccessful appeal to the prison superintendent, respondents filed a complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court alleging that the board's decisions violated their constitutional rights because there was no evidence to support the board's findings.  The Superior Court granted summary judgment for respondents, holding that the board's findings of guilt rested on no evidence constitutionally adequate to support the findings, and ordered that the lost good time be restored.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed.
Held:
1. Since the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court interpreted a state statute as providing for judicial review of respondents' claims, there is no need to decide whether due process would require judicial review.  Pp.  472 U. S. 449-453.
2. Assuming that good time credits constitute a protected liberty interest, the revocation of such credits must be supported by some evidence in order to satisfy the minimum requirements of procedural due process.  Such a requirement will help to prevent arbitrary deprivation without threatening institutional interests or imposing undue administrative burdens.  Ascertaining whether the ""some evidence"" standard is satisfied does not require examination of the entire record, independent assessment of witnesses' credibility, or weighing of the evidence, but, instead, the relevant question is whether there is any evidence in the record to support the disciplinary board's conclusion.  Pp.  472 U. S. 453-456.
3. In this case, the evidence before the disciplinary board was sufficient to meet the requirements imposed by the Due Process Clause 
Page 472 U. S. 446
 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Although the evidence might be characterized as meager, and there was no direct evidence identifying any one of the three fleeing inmates as the assailant, the record is not so devoid of evidence that the board's findings were without support or otherwise arbitrary.

472 U.S. 463

Syllabus 
A county detective, who was not in uniform, entered an adult bookstore, browsed for several minutes, and purchased two magazines from respondent salesclerk with a marked $50 bill.  The detective then left the store and showed the magazines to fellow officers who were waiting nearby.  Upon concluding that the magazines were obscene, the detectives returned to the store, arrested respondent, and retrieved the marked $50 bill from the cash register, neglecting to return the change received at the time of the purchase.  Prior to trial on a charge of distributing obscene materials in violation of a Maryland statute, the trial court denied respondent's motion to suppress the magazines and the $50 bill, holding that the purchase was not a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and that the warrantless arrest was lawful.  The magazines, but not the $50 bill, were introduced in evidence, and the jury found respondent guilty.  The Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed, holding that a warrant was required both to seize allegedly obscene materials and to arrest the distributor in order to provide a procedural safeguard for the First Amendment freedom of expression.
Held:
The detectives did not obtain possession of the allegedly obscene magazines by means of an unreasonable search or seizure, and the magazines were not the fruit of an arrest, lawful or otherwise.  Thus the magazines were properly admitted in evidence.  Pp.  472 U. S. 467-471.
(a) Absent some action taken by government agents that can properly be classified as a ""search"" or a ""seizure,"" the Fourth Amendment rules designed to safeguard First Amendment freedoms do not apply.  The officer's action in entering the bookstore and examining the wares that were intentionally exposed to all who frequented the place of business did not infringe a legitimate expectation of privacy, and hence did not constitute a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  And the subsequent purchase was not a Fourth Amendment seizure, since a seizure occurs when there is some meaningful interference with an individual's possessory interests in the property seized, and here respondent voluntarily transferred any possessory interest he may have had in the magazines to the purchaser upon the receipt of the funds.  The risk of prior restraint, which is the underlying basis for the special Fourth Amendment protections accorded searches for and seizures of First Amendment materials, does not come into play in cases where an under-cover 
Page 472 U. S. 464
 officer, by purchasing a few magazines, merely accepts an offer to do business that is freely made to the public.  Nor was the bona fide nature of the purchase changed, so as to become tantamount to a warrantless seizure, when the officers later seized the marked $50 bill and failed to return the change.  Objectively viewed, the transaction was a sale in the ordinary course of business, and the sale was not retrospectively transformed into a warrantless seizure by virtue of the officers' subjective intent to retrieve the purchase money to use as evidence.  Pp.  472 U. S. 468-471.
(b) Even assuming, arguendo, that respondent's warrantless arrest after the purchase of the magazines was an unreasonable seizure, it would not require exclusion of the magazines at trial.  The exclusionary rule does not reach backward to taint information that was in official hands prior to any illegality.

Pacific Stationery & Printing Co.
No. 83-1368
Argued February 19, 1985
Decided June 11, 1985
472 U.S. 284

Syllabus 
Petitioner is a wholesale purchasing cooperative whose membership consists of office supply retailers in the Pacific Northwest States.  Nonmember retailers can purchase supplies from petitioner at the same price as members, but since petitioner annually distributes its profits to members in the form of a percentage rebate, members effectively purchase supplies at a lower price than do nonmembers.  Petitioner expelled respondent from membership without any explanation, notice, or hearing.  Thereafter, respondent brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the expulsion without procedural protections was a group boycott that limited its ability to compete and should be considered per se violative of  1 of the Sherman Act.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court rejected application of the per se rule and held, instead, that rule of reason analysis should govern the case.  Finding no anticompetitive effect on the basis of the record, the court granted summary judgment for petitioner.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although  4 of the Robinson-Patman Act expressly approves price discrimination occasioned by such an expulsion as the one in question, and thus provides a mandate for self-regulation, nevertheless, because petitioner had not provided any procedural safeguards, the expulsion of respondent was not shielded by  4, and therefore constituted a per se group boycott in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.
Held:  Petitioner's expulsion of respondent does not fall within the category of activity that is conclusively presumed to be anticompetitive so as to mandate per se invalidation under  1 of the Sherman Act as a group boycott or concerted refusal to deal.  Pp.  472 U. S. 289-298.
(a) Section 4 of the Robinson-Patman Act, which is no more than a narrow immunity from the price discrimination prohibitions of that Act, cannot properly be construed as an exemption from or repeal of any portion of the Sherman Act or as a broad mandate for industry self-regulation.  Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U. S. 341, distinguished.  In any event, the absence of procedural safeguards in this case can in no sense determine the antitrust analysis, since if the challenged expulsion amounted to a per se violation of  1, no amount of procedural protection would save it, whereas, if the expulsion did not amount to a 
Page 472 U. S. 285
 violation of  1, no lack of procedural protections would convert it into a per se violation.  Pp.  472 U. S. 291-293.
(b) The act of expulsion from a wholesale cooperative does not necessarily imply anticompetitive animus so as to raise a probability of anticompetitive effect.  Unless it is shown that the cooperative possesses market power or exclusive access to an element essential to effective competition, the conclusion that expulsion is virtually always likely to have an anticompetitive effect is not warranted.  Absent such a showing with respect to a cooperative buying arrangement, courts should apply a rule of reason analysis. Here, respondent, focusing on the argument that the lack of procedural safeguards required per se liability, made no such showing.  But because the Court of Appeals applied an erroneous per se analysis, it never evaluated the District Court's rule of reason analysis rejecting respondent's claim, and therefore a remand is appropriate to permit appellate review of that determination.  Pp.  472 U. S. 293-298.

			"|"Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v.
Pacific Stationery & Printing Co.
No. 83-1368
Argued February 19, 1985
Decided June 11, 1985
472 U.S. 284

Syllabus 
Petitioner is a wholesale purchasing cooperative whose membership consists of office supply retailers in the Pacific Northwest States.  Nonmember retailers can purchase supplies from petitioner at the same price as members, but since petitioner annually distributes its profits to members in the form of a percentage rebate, members effectively purchase supplies at a lower price than do nonmembers.  Petitioner expelled respondent from membership without any explanation, notice, or hearing.  Thereafter, respondent brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the expulsion without procedural protections was a group boycott that limited its ability to compete and should be considered per se violative of  1 of the Sherman Act.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court rejected application of the per se rule and held, instead, that rule of reason analysis should govern the case.  Finding no anticompetitive effect on the basis of the record, the court granted summary judgment for petitioner.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although  4 of the Robinson-Patman Act expressly approves price discrimination occasioned by such an expulsion as the one in question, and thus provides a mandate for self-regulation, nevertheless, because petitioner had not provided any procedural safeguards, the expulsion of respondent was not shielded by  4, and therefore constituted a per se group boycott in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.
Held:  Petitioner's expulsion of respondent does not fall within the category of activity that is conclusively presumed to be anticompetitive so as to mandate per se invalidation under  1 of the Sherman Act as a group boycott or concerted refusal to deal.  Pp.  472 U. S. 289-298.
(a) Section 4 of the Robinson-Patman Act, which is no more than a narrow immunity from the price discrimination prohibitions of that Act, cannot properly be construed as an exemption from or repeal of any portion of the Sherman Act or as a broad mandate for industry self-regulation.  Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U. S. 341, distinguished.  In any event, the absence of procedural safeguards in this case can in no sense determine the antitrust analysis, since if the challenged expulsion amounted to a per se violation of  1, no amount of procedural protection would save it, whereas, if the expulsion did not amount to a 
Page 472 U. S. 285
 violation of  1, no lack of procedural protections would convert it into a per se violation.  Pp.  472 U. S. 291-293.
(b) The act of expulsion from a wholesale cooperative does not necessarily imply anticompetitive animus so as to raise a probability of anticompetitive effect.  Unless it is shown that the cooperative possesses market power or exclusive access to an element essential to effective competition, the conclusion that expulsion is virtually always likely to have an anticompetitive effect is not warranted.  Absent such a showing with respect to a cooperative buying arrangement, courts should apply a rule of reason analysis. Here, respondent, focusing on the argument that the lack of procedural safeguards required per se liability, made no such showing.  But because the Court of Appeals applied an erroneous per se analysis, it never evaluated the District Court's rule of reason analysis rejecting respondent's claim, and therefore a remand is appropriate to permit appellate review of that determination.  Pp.  472 U. S. 293-298.

Syllabus 
Respondent investors (hereafter respondents) filed a damages action in Federal District Court, alleging that they incurred substantial trading losses after a securities broker (employed by petitioner) and the officer of a corporation fraudulently induced respondents to purchase stock in the corporation by divulging false and materially incomplete information about the corporation on the pretext that it was accurate inside information.  Respondents contended that this alleged scheme violated, inter alia,  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that, because respondents themselves had violated the same laws under which recovery was sought by trading on what they believed was inside information, they were in pari delicto with the broker and corporate insider, and thus were barred from recovery.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  There is no basis at this stage of the litigation for applying the in pari delicto defense to bar respondents' action.  Pp.  472 U. S. 306-319.
(a) An implied private damages action under the federal securities laws may be barred on the grounds of the plaintiff's own culpability only where (i) as a direct result of his own actions, the plaintiff bears at least substantially equal responsibility for the violations he seeks to redress, and (ii) preclusion of suit would not significantly interfere with the effective enforcement of the securities laws and protection of the investing public.  Cf. Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U. S. 134.  Pp.  472 U. S. 306-311.
(b) Because a tippee's duty to disclose material nonpublic information typically is derivative from the insider-tipper's duty, the tippee in these circumstances cannot be said to be as culpable as the tipper whose breach of duty gave rise to the tippee's liability in the first place.  Moreover, insiders and broker-dealers who selectively disclose material nonpublic information about the issuer commit a potentially broader range of violations than do tippees who trade on the basis of that information.  Absent other culpable actions by a tippee that can fairly be said to outweigh these violations by insiders and broker-dealers, the tippee cannot 
Page 472 U. S. 300
 properly be characterized as being of substantially equal culpability as his tippers.  Pp.  472 U. S. 311-314.
(c) Denying the in pari delicto defense in such circumstances will best promote protection of the investing public and the national economy.  First, allowing a defrauded tippee to bring suit against his defrauding tipper promotes the important goal of exposing wrongdoers and rendering them more easily subject to civil, administrative, and criminal penalties.  Second, deterrence of insider trading most frequently will be maximized by bringing enforcement pressures to bear on the sources of such information -- corporate insiders and broker-dealers.  Third, insiders and broker-dealers will in many circumstances be more responsive to the deterrent pressures of potential sanctions.  Finally, there are means other than the in pari delicto defense to deter tippee trading.  Although there might well be situations in which the relative culpabilities of tippees and their sources merit a different mix of deterrent incentives, in cases such as the instant one, the public interest will most frequently be advanced if defrauded tippees are permitted to bring suit and to expose illegal practices by corporate insiders and broker-dealers to full public view for appropriate sanctions.

No. 83-6607
Argued February 25, 1985
Decided June 11, 1985
472 U.S. 320

Syllabus 
In a bifurcated proceeding conducted pursuant to Mississippi's capital punishment statute, petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.  Petitioner's lawyers, in their closing argument at the sentencing stage, referred to petitioner's youth, family background, and poverty, as well as to general character evidence, and they asked the jury to show mercy, emphasizing that the jury should confront the gravity and responsibility of calling for another's death.  In response, the prosecutor urged the jury not to view itself as finally determining whether petitioner would die, because a death sentence would be reviewed for correctness by the Mississippi Supreme Court.  That court unanimously affirmed the conviction, but affirmed the death sentence by an equally divided court, rejecting, in reliance on California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, the contention that the prosecutor's comments violated the Eighth Amendment.
Held:  The death sentence is vacated.
443 So.2d 806, reversed in part and remanded.
JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to all but Part IV-A, concluding that:
1. Where an examination of the decision below as to the issue of the prosecutor's comments does not indicate that it rested on adequate and independent state grounds, namely, petitioner's failure to comply with a Mississippi procedural rule as to raising the issue on appeal, this Court does not lack jurisdiction to decide the issue.  Pp.  472 U. S. 326-328.
2. It is constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe, as the jury was in this case, that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant's death rests elsewhere.  Belief in the truth of the assumption that sentencers treat their power to determine the appropriateness of death as an ""awesome responsibility"" has allowed this Court to view sentencer discretion as consistent with and indispensable to the Eighth Amendment's ""need for reliability in the determination that death is appropriate punishment in a specific case.""  Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280,  428 U. S. 305 (plurality opinion).  Pp.  472 U. S. 328-330.
3. There are several reasons to fear substantial unreliability, as well as bias in favor of death sentences, when there are state-induced suggestions 
Page 472 U. S. 321
 that the sentencing jury may shift its sense of responsibility to an appellate court.  Pp.  472 U. S. 330-334.
(a) The ""delegation"" of sentencing responsibility that the prosecutor here encouraged would not simply postpone petitioner's right to a fair determination of the appropriateness of his death; rather, it would deprive him of that right, for an appellate court, unlike the sentencing jury, is ill-suited to evaluate the appropriateness of death in the first instance.  Pp.  472 U. S. 330-331.
(b) Even when a sentencing jury is unconvinced that death is the appropriate punishment, it might nevertheless wish to ""send a message"" of extreme disapproval for the defendant's acts.  This desire might make the jury very receptive to the prosecutor's assurance that it can err because the error can be corrected on appeal.  A defendant might then be executed, although no sentencer had ever determined that death was the appropriate sentence.  Pp.  472 U. S. 331-332.
(c) If a jury understands that only a death sentence, and not a life sentence, will be reviewed, it will also understand that any decision to ""delegate"" responsibility for sentencing can only be effectuated by returning a death sentence.  This presents the specter of the imposition of death based on an irrelevant factor, and would also create the danger of a defendant's being executed without any determination that death was the appropriate punishment.  P.  472 U. S. 332.
(d) The uncorrected suggestion that the jury's responsibility for any ultimate determination of death will rest with others presents the danger that the jury will choose to minimize the importance of its role, especially where, as here, the jury is told that the alternative decisionmaker is the State's highest court.  Pp.  472 U. S. 332-333.
4. As to the State's contention that the prosecutor's argument was an ""invited"" response to defense counsel's argument, and thus was not unreasonable, neither the State nor the court below explains how the prosecutor's argument was less likely to have distorted the jury's deliberations because of anything defense counsel said.  Pp.  472 U. S. 336-337.
5. Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U. S. 637, does not preclude a finding of constitutional error based on the sort of impropriety that the prosecutor's argument contains.  Although that case warned against holding every improper and unfair argument of a state prosecutor to be a federal constitutional violation, it did not insulate all prosecutorial comments from federal constitutional objections.  Pp.  472 U. S. 337-340.
JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, delivered an opinion with respect to Part IV-A, concluding that California v. Ramos, supra, is not authority for holding that States are free to expose capital sentencing juries to any 
Page 472 U. S. 322
 information and argument concerning postsentencing procedures.  In Ramos, the Court, in upholding a state statutory requirement that capital sentencing juries be instructed that the Governor could commute a life sentence without possibility of parole into a lesser sentence, rested on a determination that the instruction was both accurate and relevant to a legitimate state penological interest.  In contrast, here the argument was neither accurate nor relevant to such an interest, but was misleading and was not linked to any valid sentencing consideration.  Pp.  472 U. S. 335-336.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, being of the view that the prosecutor's remarks were impermissible because they were inaccurate and misleading in a manner that diminished the jury's sense of responsibility, concluded that Ramos, supra, does not sanction a misleading picture of the jury's role, nor does it suggest that the Constitution prohibits the giving of accurate and nonmisleading instructions regarding postsentencing procedures.  Pp.  472 U. S. 341-342.
MARSHALL, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, IV-B, IV-C, and V, in which BRENNAN, BLACKMUN, STEVENS, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part IV-A, in which BRENNAN, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.

|472 u.s. 159|"Northeast Bancorp, Inc. v. Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System
No. 84-363
Argued April 15, 1985
Decided June 10, 1985
472 U.S. 159

Syllabus 
The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) requires a bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board (Board) before it may acquire a bank.  Section 3(d) of the Act (known as the Douglas Amendment) prohibits the Board from approving an application of a bank holding company located in one State to acquire a bank located in another State unless the acquisition
""is specifically authorized by the statute laws of the State in which such bank is located, by language to that effect and not merely by implication.""
Substantially similar Connecticut and Massachusetts statutes provide that an out-of-state bank holding company with its principal place of business in one of the other New England States may acquire an in-state bank, provided that the other State accords equivalent reciprocal privileges to the enacting State's banking organizations.  Certain bank holding companies (respondents here) applied to the Board as out-of-state companies for purposes of either the Connecticut or Massachusetts statute, seeking approval for acquisitions of banks located in one or the other of those States. Petitioners, prospective competitors, opposed the proposed acquisitions in proceedings before the Board, contending that the acquisitions were not authorized by the Douglas Amendment and that, if they were, the applicable Connecticut or Massachusetts statute, by discriminating against non-New England out-of-state bank holding companies, violated the Commerce, Compact, and Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal Constitution.  Rejecting petitioners' contentions, the Board approved the applications, and the Court of Appeals, in consolidated review proceedings, affirmed.
Held:
1. The Connecticut and Massachusetts statutes are of the kind contemplated by the Douglas Amendment to lift its ban on interstate acquisitions.  The Amendment's language plainly permits States to lift the federal ban entirely, and although it does not specifically indicate that a State may partially lift the ban, neither does it specifically indicate that a State is allowed only the alternatives of leaving the federal ban in place or lifting it completely.  The Amendment's legislative history indicates 
Page 472 U. S. 160
 that Congress intended to allow each State flexibility in its approach, contemplating that some States might partially lift the ban on interstate banking without opening themselves up to interstate banking from everywhere in the Nation.  Moreover, the Connecticut and Massachusetts statutes, by allowing only regional acquisitions, are consistent with the Amendment's and the BHCA's purpose of retaining local, community-based control over banking.  Pp.  472 U. S. 168-173.
2. The Connecticut and Massachusetts statutes do not violate the Commerce Clause.  Congress' commerce power is not dormant here, but has been exercised by enactment of the BHCA and the Douglas Amendment, authorizing the challenged state statutes.  State actions that Congress plainly authorizes are invulnerable to constitutional attack under the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  472 U. S. 174-175.
3. The challenged state statutes do not violate the Compact Clause, which provides that no State, without Congress' consent, shall enter into an agreement or compact with another State.  Even assuming, arguendo, that the state statutes (along with statutes of other New England States under petitioners' theory) constitute an agreement or compact,
""application of the Compact Clause is limited to agreements that are""
""directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States.""
New Hampshire v. Maine, 426 U. S. 363,  426 U. S. 369, quoting Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U. S. 503,  148 U. S. 519.  In view of the Douglas Amendment, the challenged state statutes, which comply with the BHCA, cannot possibly infringe federal supremacy.  Nor do the state statutes in question either enhance the political power of the New England States at the expense of other States or have an impact on the federal structure.  Pp.  472 U. S. 175-176.
4. The Connecticut and Massachusetts statutes do not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  The statutes favor out-of-state corporations within the New England region over corporations from other parts of the country.  However, Connecticut and Massachusetts, in enacting their statutes, considered that interstate banking on a regional basis combined the beneficial effect of increasing the number of banking competitors with the need to preserve a close relationship between those in the community who need credit and those who provide credit, and that acquisition of in-state banks by holding companies headquartered outside the New England region would threaten the independence of local banking institutions.  These concerns meet the traditional rational basis for judging equal protection claims.  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869, distinguished.  Pp.  472 U. S. 176-178.

			"|"Northeast Bancorp, Inc. v. Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System
No. 84-363
Argued April 15, 1985
Decided June 10, 1985
472 U.S. 159

Syllabus 
The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) requires a bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board (Board) before it may acquire a bank.  Section 3(d) of the Act (known as the Douglas Amendment) prohibits the Board from approving an application of a bank holding company located in one State to acquire a bank located in another State unless the acquisition
""is specifically authorized by the statute laws of the State in which such bank is located, by language to that effect and not merely by implication.""
Substantially similar Connecticut and Massachusetts statutes provide that an out-of-state bank holding company with its principal place of business in one of the other New England States may acquire an in-state bank, provided that the other State accords equivalent reciprocal privileges to the enacting State's banking organizations.  Certain bank holding companies (respondents here) applied to the Board as out-of-state companies for purposes of either the Connecticut or Massachusetts statute, seeking approval for acquisitions of banks located in one or the other of those States. Petitioners, prospective competitors, opposed the proposed acquisitions in proceedings before the Board, contending that the acquisitions were not authorized by the Douglas Amendment and that, if they were, the applicable Connecticut or Massachusetts statute, by discriminating against non-New England out-of-state bank holding companies, violated the Commerce, Compact, and Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal Constitution.  Rejecting petitioners' contentions, the Board approved the applications, and the Court of Appeals, in consolidated review proceedings, affirmed.
Held:
1. The Connecticut and Massachusetts statutes are of the kind contemplated by the Douglas Amendment to lift its ban on interstate acquisitions.  The Amendment's language plainly permits States to lift the federal ban entirely, and although it does not specifically indicate that a State may partially lift the ban, neither does it specifically indicate that a State is allowed only the alternatives of leaving the federal ban in place or lifting it completely.  The Amendment's legislative history indicates 
Page 472 U. S. 160
 that Congress intended to allow each State flexibility in its approach, contemplating that some States might partially lift the ban on interstate banking without opening themselves up to interstate banking from everywhere in the Nation.  Moreover, the Connecticut and Massachusetts statutes, by allowing only regional acquisitions, are consistent with the Amendment's and the BHCA's purpose of retaining local, community-based control over banking.  Pp.  472 U. S. 168-173.
2. The Connecticut and Massachusetts statutes do not violate the Commerce Clause.  Congress' commerce power is not dormant here, but has been exercised by enactment of the BHCA and the Douglas Amendment, authorizing the challenged state statutes.  State actions that Congress plainly authorizes are invulnerable to constitutional attack under the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  472 U. S. 174-175.
3. The challenged state statutes do not violate the Compact Clause, which provides that no State, without Congress' consent, shall enter into an agreement or compact with another State.  Even assuming, arguendo, that the state statutes (along with statutes of other New England States under petitioners' theory) constitute an agreement or compact,
""application of the Compact Clause is limited to agreements that are""
""directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States.""
New Hampshire v. Maine, 426 U. S. 363,  426 U. S. 369, quoting Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U. S. 503,  148 U. S. 519.  In view of the Douglas Amendment, the challenged state statutes, which comply with the BHCA, cannot possibly infringe federal supremacy.  Nor do the state statutes in question either enhance the political power of the New England States at the expense of other States or have an impact on the federal structure.  Pp.  472 U. S. 175-176.
4. The Connecticut and Massachusetts statutes do not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  The statutes favor out-of-state corporations within the New England region over corporations from other parts of the country.  However, Connecticut and Massachusetts, in enacting their statutes, considered that interstate banking on a regional basis combined the beneficial effect of increasing the number of banking competitors with the need to preserve a close relationship between those in the community who need credit and those who provide credit, and that acquisition of in-state banks by holding companies headquartered outside the New England region would threaten the independence of local banking institutions.  These concerns meet the traditional rational basis for judging equal protection claims.  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869, distinguished.  Pp.  472 U. S. 176-178.

No. 83-1911
Argued January 7, 1986
Decided June 10, 1985
472 U.S. 181

Syllabus 
Petitioner Lowe is the president and principal shareholder of a corporation (also a petitioner) that was registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Act).  Because Lowe was convicted of various offenses involving investments, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), after a hearing, ordered that the corporation's registration be revoked and that Lowe not associate with any investment adviser.  Thereafter, the SEC brought an action in Federal District Court, alleging that Lowe, the corporation, and two other unregistered corporations (also petitioners) were violating the Act, and that Lowe was violating the SEC's order by publishing, for paid subscribers, purportedly semimonthly newsletters containing investment advice and commentary.  After determining that petitioners' publications were protected by the First Amendment, the District Court, denying for the most part the SEC's requested injunctive relief, held that the Act must be construed to allow a publisher who is willing to comply with the Act's reporting and disclosure requirements to register for the limited purpose of publishing such material and to engage in such publishing.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Act does not distinguish between person-to-person advice and impersonal advice given in publications, that petitioners were engaged in business as ""investment advisers"" within the meaning of the Act, and that the exclusion in  202(a)(11)(D) of the Act from the Act's definition of covered ""investment advisers"" for ""the publisher of any bona fide newspaper, news magazine, or business or financial publication of general and regular circulation"" did not apply to petitioners.  Rejecting petitioners' constitutional claim, the court further held that Lowe's history of criminal conduct justified the characterization of petitioners' publications ""as potentially deceptive commercial speech.""
Held:  Petitioners' publications fall within the statutory exclusion for bona fide publications, none of the petitioners is an ""investment adviser"" as defined in the Act, and therefore neither petitioners' unregistered status nor the SEC order against Lowe provides a justification for restraining the future publication of their newsletters.  Pp.  472 U. S. 190-211. 
Page 472 U. S. 182

(a) The Act's legislative history plainly demonstrates that Congress was primarily interested in regulating the business of rendering personalized investment advice, including publishing activities that are a normal incident thereto.  On the other hand, Congress, plainly sensitive to First Amendment concerns, wanted to make clear that it did not seek to regulate the press through the licensing of nonpersonalized publishing activities.  Pp.  472 U. S. 203-204.
(b) Because the content of petitioners' newsletters was completely disinterested, and because they were offered to the general public on a regular schedule, they are described by the plain language of  202(a)(11)(D)'s exclusion.  The mere fact that a publication contains advice and comment about specific securities does not give it the personalized character that identifies a professional investment adviser.  Thus, petitioners' newsletters do not fit within the Act's central purpose, because they do not offer individualized advice attuned to any specific portfolio or to any client's particular needs.  On the contrary, they circulate for sale to the public in a free, open market.  Lowe's unsavory history does not prevent the newsletters from being ""bona fide"" within the meaning of the exclusion.  In light of the legislative history, the term ""bona fide"" translates best to ""genuine""; petitioners' publications meet this definition.  Moreover, the publications are ""of general and regular circulation.""  Although they have not been published on a regular semimonthly basis as advertised, and thus have not been ""regular"" in the sense of consistent circulation, they have been ""regular"" in the sense important to the securities market.

No. 84-262
Argued February 20, 1985
Decided June 10, 1985
472 U.S. 237

Syllabus 
The Pueblo Lands Act of 1924 was enacted to adjudicate and settle conflicting titles affecting lands claimed by respondent Pueblo Indian Tribe.  Section 17 of the Act provides:
""No right, title, or interest in or to the lands of the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico to which their title has not been extinguished as hereinbefore determined shall hereafter be acquired or initiated by virtue of the laws of the State of New Mexico, or in any other manner except as may hereafter be provided by Congress, and no sale, grant, lease of any character, or other conveyance of lands, or any title or claim thereto, made by any pueblo as a community, or any Pueblo Indian living in a community of Pueblo Indians, in the State of New Mexico, shall be of any validity in law or in equity unless the same be first approved by the Secretary of the Interior.""
In 1928, while an action by the United States, as guardian for respondent, to quiet title to respondent's lands was pending in Federal District Court, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) approved an agreement between petitioner and respondent granting petitioner an easement for a telephone line on land owned by respondent.  As a result, the District Court dismissed petitioner (whose predecessor had allegedly acquired a right-of-way) from the quiet title action on the ground that it had acquired a valid title to the easement.  After petitioner removed the telephone line in 1980, respondent brought an action in Federal District Court, claiming trespass damages for the period prior to the removal of the line on the asserted ground that the 1928 conveyance was not authorized by  17 because Congress had not enacted legislation approving it.  The District Court granted partial summary judgment for respondent on the issue of liability, holding that the 1928 conveyance was not authorized by  17.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that respondent's lands were protected by the Nonintercourse Act, which prohibits any purchase, grant, lease, or other conveyance of lands from any Indian tribe, and that  17 did not authorize any conveyance of such lands.  The court reasoned that, since the two clauses of  17 are joined by the conjunctive ""and,"" two things were required to make a conveyance of respondent's lands valid -- first, the lands must be conveyed in a manner provided 
Page 472 U. S. 238
 by Congress and, second, the Secretary must approve -- and that, since Congress had provided nothing with respect to the 1928 agreement, the first requirement was not met, and hence the Secretary's approval was meaningless.
Held:  The conveyance of the easement was valid under  17 of the Pueblo Lands Act.  Pp.  472 U. S. 249-255.
(a) While the word ""hereafter"" in the first clause of  17 supports the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the Act, such interpretation renders the requirement of the Secretary's approval a nullity until Congress acts.  In light of the canon of statutory construction that a statute should be interpreted so as not to render one part inoperative, the second clause of  17 cannot be read as limiting Congress' power to legislate in the ""hereafter.""  The Court of Appeals' interpretation of  17 would also nullify the effect of  16 of the Act, which authorizes the Secretary, with respondent's consent, to sell any of respondent's lands that are located among lands adjudicated or otherwise determined in favor of non-Indian claimants and apart from the main body of the Indian lands as part of the claim settlement program established by the Act.  Moreover, the practical effect of the Court of Appeals' interpretation is to apply the requirement of the Nonintercourse Act to voluntary transfers of respondent's lands.  A review of the structure of the Pueblo Lands Act leads to the conclusion that Congress, when it enacted that Act, rather than leaving the matter of voluntary transfers to be decided by the courts or applying the rule of the Nonintercourse Act, adopted a new rule of law in view of the unique history of respondent's lands.  Pp.  472 U. S. 249-251.
(b) To harmonize  17's two clauses with the Act's entire structure and with ""its contemporary legal context,"" the first clause should be read as a flat prohibition against reliance on New Mexico law in connection with future transactions involving respondent's lands, and to make voluntary or involuntary alienation of those lands after 1924 occur only if sanctioned by federal law.  And the second clause should be interpreted as providing a firm command, as a matter of federal law, that no future conveyance should be valid without the Secretary's approval.  This interpretation of  17 gives both clauses a meaning that is consistent with the remainder of the Act, with respondent's historical situation, and with the legislative history, and is supported by the Secretary's contemporaneous opinion and by the District Judge who gave his stamp of approval to the transaction originally and other similar ones after enactment of the Pueblo Lands Act.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 10, 1985
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 The North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Act, N.C.Gen.Stat. 105-164.1 to 105-164.44A (1979 and Supp.1983), exempts ""[s]ales of newspapers by newspaper street vendors and by newspaper carriers making door-to-door deliveries and sales of magazines by magazine vendors making door-to-door sales."" 105-164.13(28). The provision offers newspapers using this means of delivery a tax benefit denied other members of the press. A publisher distributing a newspaper free of charge must pay a sales or use tax on personal property that it purchases and incorporates into its newspaper (or on purchases of the printed newspaper itself if it is purchased in completed form from the printer), for such property is ""not sold but used, consumed, distributed, or stored for consumption"" in North Carolina. 105.164.6(1). A publisher selling a newspaper at retail other than through street vendors or paper- 
Page 472 U.S. 1001 , 1002
 boys escapes sales or use taxation on personal property that goes into the production of the newspaper, for that property is resold, see 105-164.13( 8); however, a sales tax must be paid on the final retail sale of such a newspaper. A newspaper that is sold through street vendors or newsboys escapes both forms of taxation: the publisher's purchase of personal property that goes into its final product is exempt, as such property is resold, and its retail sales are also exempt under 105-164.13(28). 
 In this case, the Supreme Court of North Carolina held that this tax scheme, as applied to newspapers ineligible for the exemption, neither abridged the freedom of the press nor violated the Equal Protection Clause . The court pointed out that the North Carolina sales and use tax scheme did not single out the press for special treatment, but applied to retail sales generally. In re Assessment of Taxes Against Village Pub. Corp., 312 N.C. 211, 322 S.E.2d 155 (1984). Thus, it was free from one of the primary defects of the tax struck down by this Court in Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575 (1983). That the statute contained an exemption for newspapers sold through street vendors and newsboys did not make it invalid: such an exemption required only a rational basis. The court found such a rational basis in the difficulty of requiring street vendors and newsboys-many of them children-to collect the sales tax. This difficulty, not present when a paper was sold through other means or given away free, justified the special exemption. 
 This case is within our mandatory appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S. C. 1257(2). Appellant argues that the North Carolina tax scheme, by singling out one segment of the press for a special exemption from taxation, violates the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. In summarily dismissing the appeal, the Court today holds these arguments "" insubstantial."" In view of Minneapolis Star, supra, I cannot agree. 
 The statute at issue in Minneapolis Star not only singled out the press for special treatment, but also drew distinctions among members of the press, subjecting some to a tax while exempting others. The Court found both features objectionable. Concerning the second defect, we stated, ""recognizing a power in the State not only to single out the press but also to tailor the tax so that it singles out a few members of the press presents such a potential for abuse that no interest suggested by Minnesota can jus- [472 U.S. 1001 , 1003]

Thus, it was free from one of the primary defects of the tax struck down by this Court in Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575 (1983). That the statute contained an exemption for newspapers sold through street vendors and newsboys did not make it invalid: such an exemption required only a rational basis. The court found such a rational basis in the difficulty of requiring street vendors and newsboys-many of them children-to collect the sales tax. This difficulty, not present when a paper was sold through other means or given away free, justified the special exemption. 
 This case is within our mandatory appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S. C. 1257(2). Appellant argues that the North Carolina tax scheme, by singling out one segment of the press for a special exemption from taxation, violates the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. In summarily dismissing the appeal, the Court today holds these arguments "" insubstantial."" In view of Minneapolis Star, supra, I cannot agree. 
 The statute at issue in Minneapolis Star not only singled out the press for special treatment, but also drew distinctions among members of the press, subjecting some to a tax while exempting others. The Court found both features objectionable. Concerning the second defect, we stated, ""recognizing a power in the State not only to single out the press but also to tailor the tax so that it singles out a few members of the press presents such a potential for abuse that no interest suggested by Minnesota can jus- [472 U.S. 1001 , 1003]

No. 83-2129
Argued January 9, 1985
Decided June 4, 1985
472 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
In December 1982, respondent Burlington Northern, Inc., made a hostile tender offer for El Paso Gas Co. to which a majority of El Paso's shareholders ultimately subscribed.  Burlington did not accept the tendered shares, and instead, in January, 1983, after negotiations with El Paso, announced a new and friendly takeover agreement.  Pursuant to this agreement, Burlington undertook to rescind the December tender offer and substitute a new tender offer.  The January tender offer was soon oversubscribed.  The rescission of the first tender offer caused a diminished payment to those shareholders who had tendered during the first offer, because those shareholders who retendered were subject to substantial proration.  Petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court on behalf of herself and similarly situated shareholders, alleging that Burlington, El Paso, and members of El Paso's board of directors had violated  14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits ""fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices . . . in connection with any tender offer.""  She claimed that Burlington's withdrawal of the December tender offer, coupled with the substitution of the January tender offer, was a ""manipulative"" distortion of the market for El Paso stock.  The District Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim, holding that the alleged manipulation did not involve a misrepresentation, and so did not violate  14(e).  The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
Page 472 U. S. 2

Held:
1. ""Manipulative"" acts under  14(e) require misrepresentation or nondisclosure.  To read the term ""manipulative"" in  14(e) to include acts that, although fully disclosed, ""artificially"" affect the price of the takeover target's stock conflicts with the normal meaning of the term as connoting conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities.  Pp.  472 U. S. 5-8.
2. This interpretation of the term ""manipulative"" as used in  14(e) is supported by the provision's purpose and legislative history.  The purpose of the Williams Act, which added  14(e) to the Securities Exchange Act, was to ensure that public shareholders who are confronted with a tender offer will not be required to respond without adequate information.  Nowhere in the legislative history is there any suggestion that  14(e) serves any purpose other than disclosure, or that the term ""manipulative"" should be read as an invitation to the courts to oversee the substantive fairness of tender offers; the quality of any offer is a matter for the marketplace.

Syllabus 
Vermont collects a use tax when cars are registered with it, but the tax is not imposed if the car was purchased in Vermont and a sales tax has been paid.  The tax is also reduced by the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another State if that State would afford a credit for taxes paid to Vermont in similar circumstances. The credit is available, however, only if the registrant was a Vermont resident at the time he paid the taxes.  Appellants, who bought and registered cars outside of Vermont before becoming Vermont residents, were required to pay the full use tax in order to register their cars in Vermont.  In proceedings in the Vermont Superior Court, appellants alleged that Vermont's failure to afford them credit for the out-of-state sales taxes they had paid violated, inter alia, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the credit was provided in the case of vehicles acquired outside the State by Vermont residents.  Rejecting appellants' contention, the court dismissed the complaint.  The Vermont Supreme Court affirmed by citation to another decision handed down the same day, Leverson v. Conway, 144 Vt. 523, 481 A.2d 1029, in which it rejected a similar equal protection challenge to the tax credit, concluding that the Vermont statute was rationally related to the legitimate state interest in raising revenue to maintain and improve the highways, and rationally placed the burden on those who used them.
Held:  When the Vermont statute is viewed on its face, appellants have stated a claim of discrimination prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  472 U. S. 18-28.
(a) While the State asserts that the tax credit applies only to Vermont residents who register their cars in Vermont without first having registered them elsewhere, and that a resident who purchases, pays a sales or use tax on, and registers a car in another State must also pay the Vermont use tax upon his return, it does not appear that the Vermont Supreme Court, in ruling on the equal protection claim in Leverson, supra, construed the exemption in such a manner.  Instead, every indication is that a Vermont resident enjoys a credit for any sales taxes paid to a reciprocating State, even if he registered and used the car there before registering it in Vermont.  Pp.  472 U. S. 18-21.
(b) An exemption such as that challenged here will be sustained if the legislature could have reasonably concluded that the challenged classification 
Page 472 U. S. 15
 would promote a legitimate state purpose.  No legitimate purpose is furthered by the discriminatory exemption here.  Residence at the time of purchase is a wholly arbitrary basis on which to distinguish among present Vermont registrants -- at least among those who used their cars elsewhere before coming to Vermont.  The distinction between them bears no relation to the statutory purpose of raising revenue for the maintenance and improvement of Vermont roads.  The customary rationale for a use tax -- relating to protecting local merchants from out-of-state competition which, because of its lower or nonexistent tax burdens, can offer lower prices -- has no application to purchases made out-of-state by those who were not residents of the taxing State at the time of purchase.  Nor can the distinction here be justified by a state policy of making those who use the highways contribute to their maintenance and improvement, or as encouraging interstate commerce by enabling Vermont residents, faced with limited automobile offerings at home, to shop outside the State without penalty.

Syllabus 
In proceedings instituted in Federal District Court, appellees challenged the constitutionality of, inter alia, a 1981 Alabama Statute ( 16-1-20.1) authorizing a 1-minute period of silence in all public schools ""for meditation or voluntary prayer.""  Although finding that  16-1-20.1 was an effort to encourage a religious activity, the District Court ultimately held that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment does not prohibit a State from establishing a religion.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Section 16-1-20.1 is a law respecting the establishment of religion, and thus violates the First Amendment.  Pp.  472 U. S. 48-61.
(a) The proposition that the several States have no greater power to restrain the individual freedoms protected by the First Amendment than does Congress is firmly embedded in constitutional jurisprudence.  The First Amendment was adopted to curtail Congress' power to interfere with the individual's freedom to believe, to worship, and to express himself in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience, and the Fourteenth Amendment imposed the same substantive limitations on the States' power to legislate.  The individual's freedom to choose his own creed is the counterpart of his right to refrain from accepting the creed established by the majority.  Moreover, the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to select any religious faith or none at all.  Pp.  472 U. S. 48-55.
(b) One of the well-established criteria for determining the constitutionality of a statute under the Establishment Clause is that the statute must have a secular legislative purpose.  Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602,  403 U. S. 612-613.  The First Amendment requires that a statute must be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion.  Pp.  472 U. S. 55-56.
(c) The record here not only establishes that  16-1-20.1's purpose was to endorse religion, it also reveals that the enactment of the statute was not motivated by any clearly secular purpose.  In particular, the statements of  16-120.1's sponsor in the legislative record and in his 
Page 472 U. S. 39
 testimony before the District Court indicate that the legislation was solely an ""effort to return voluntary prayer"" to the public schools.  Moreover, such unrebutted evidence of legislative intent is confirmed by a consideration of the relationship between  16-1-20.1 and two other Alabama statutes -- one of which, enacted in 1982 as a sequel to  16-1-20.1, authorized teachers to lead ""willing students"" in a prescribed prayer, and the other of which, enacted in 1978 as  16-1-20. l's predecessor, authorized a period of silence ""for meditation"" only.  The State's endorsement, by enactment of  16-1-20.1, of prayer activities at the beginning of each schoolday is not consistent with the established principle that the government must pursue a course of complete neutrality toward religion.

Syllabus 
In 1981, Congress amended the Food Stamp Act to reduce from 20 percent to 18 percent the earned income disregard used in computing eligibility for food stamps.  Thereafter, the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare (Department) mailed a notice to all food stamp recipients in the State with earned income advising them that the reduction in the earned income disregard might result in either a reduction or termination of their benefits, that they had a right to request a hearing, and that their benefits would be reinstated if a hearing was requested within 10 days of the notice.  Petitioners in No. 83-6381 (hereafter petitioners), recipients of the notice, brought a class action in Federal District Court, alleging that the notice was inadequate and seeking injunctive relief.  After the court issued a temporary injunction, the Department sent a second notice similar to, but somewhat more extensive than, the first notice.  Petitioners also attacked the adequacy of this notice.  The court again ruled in petitioners' favor and held that the notice violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals agreed.
Held:
1. The second notice complied with the statute and regulations.  The relevant language of 7 U.S.C.  2020(e)(10) -- which does not itself mandate any notice at all, but merely assumes that a hearing request by a household aggrieved by a state agency's action will be preceded by ""individual notice of agency action"" -- cannot be fairly construed as a command to give notice of a general change in the law.  The legislative history does not suggest that Congress intended to eliminate the distinction between requiring advance notice of an ""adverse action"" based on the particular facts of an individual case and the absence of any requirement of individual notice of a ""mass change"" in the law.  And the notice in question complied with the applicable regulation requiring individual 
Page 472 U. S. 116
 notices of a ""mass change,"" but not an adverse action notice when benefits are reduced or terminated as a result of a ""mass change.""  Pp.  472 U. S. 123-127.
2. The second notice did not violate the Due Process Clause.  Pp.  472 U. S. 127-131.
(a) Even if it is assumed that the mass change increased the risk of erroneous reductions in benefits, that assumption does not support the claim that the notice was inadequate.  The notice plainly informed each household of the opportunity to request a fair hearing and the right to have its benefit level frozen if a hearing was requested.  Pp.  472 U. S. 127-128.
(b) This case does not concern the procedural fairness of individual eligibility determinations, but rather involves a legislatively mandated substantive change in the scope of the entire food stamp program.  The procedural component of the Due Process Clause does not impose a constitutional limitation on Congress' power to make such a change.  A welfare recipient is not deprived of due process when Congress adjusts benefit levels; the legislative process provides all the process that is due.  Here, the participants in the food stamp program had no greater right to advance notice of the change in the law than did any other voters.  Because the substantive reduction in the level of petitioners' benefits was the direct result of the statutory amendment, they have no basis for challenging the procedure that caused them to receive a different, less valuable property interest after the amendment became effective.  As a matter of constitutional law, there can be no doubt concerning the sufficiency of the notice describing the effect of the amendment in general terms.  Pp.  472 U. S. 128-131.

The legislative history does not suggest that Congress intended to eliminate the distinction between requiring advance notice of an ""adverse action"" based on the particular facts of an individual case and the absence of any requirement of individual notice of a ""mass change"" in the law.  And the notice in question complied with the applicable regulation requiring individual 
Page 472 U. S. 116
 notices of a ""mass change,"" but not an adverse action notice when benefits are reduced or terminated as a result of a ""mass change.""  Pp.  472 U. S. 123-127.
2. The second notice did not violate the Due Process Clause.  Pp.  472 U. S. 127-131.
(a) Even if it is assumed that the mass change increased the risk of erroneous reductions in benefits, that assumption does not support the claim that the notice was inadequate.  The notice plainly informed each household of the opportunity to request a fair hearing and the right to have its benefit level frozen if a hearing was requested.  Pp.  472 U. S. 127-128.
(b) This case does not concern the procedural fairness of individual eligibility determinations, but rather involves a legislatively mandated substantive change in the scope of the entire food stamp program.  The procedural component of the Due Process Clause does not impose a constitutional limitation on Congress' power to make such a change.  A welfare recipient is not deprived of due process when Congress adjusts benefit levels; the legislative process provides all the process that is due.  Here, the participants in the food stamp program had no greater right to advance notice of the change in the law than did any other voters.  Because the substantive reduction in the level of petitioners' benefits was the direct result of the statutory amendment, they have no basis for challenging the procedure that caused them to receive a different, less valuable property interest after the amendment became effective.  As a matter of constitutional law, there can be no doubt concerning the sufficiency of the notice describing the effect of the amendment in general terms.  Pp.  472 U. S. 128-131.

471 U.S. 707

Syllabus 
In 1980, appellant Hillsborough County adopted ordinances and promulgated implementing regulations governing blood plasma centers within the county.  One ordinance requires that blood donors be tested for hepatitis, that they donate at only one center, and that they be given a breath-analysis test for alcohol content before each donation.  Pursuant to  351 of the Public Health Service Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated federal regulations establishing minimum standards for the collection of blood plasma.  Appellee operator of a blood plasma center located in appellant county filed suit in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the ordinances and implementing regulations on the ground, inter alia, that they violated the Supremacy Clause, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court upheld the ordinances and regulations, except the requirement that the donor be subject to a breath-analysis test.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the FDA's regulations preempted all provisions of the ordinances and implementing regulations.
Held:  Appellant county's ordinances and implementing regulations are not preempted by the federal regulations.  Pp.  471 U. S. 712-723.
(a) No intent to preempt may be inferred from the comprehensiveness of the federal regulations.  While the regulations when issued in 1973 covered only plasma to be used in injections, the FDA has not indicated that regulations issued since that time expanding coverage to other uses have affected its express disavowal in 1973 of any intent to preempt state and local regulation, and such expansion of coverage does not cast doubt on the continued validity of that disavowal.  Even in the absence of the disavowal, the comprehensiveness of the FDA's regulations would not justify preemption.  To infer preemption whenever a federal agency deals with a problem comprehensively would be tantamount to saying that, whenever the agency decides to step into a field, its regulations will be exclusive.  Such a rule would be inconsistent with the federal-state balance embodied in this Court's Supremacy Clause jurisprudence.  The adoption of the National Blood Policy in 1974, which 
Page 471 U. S. 708
 sets forth a broad statement of goals with respect to blood collection and distribution and calls for cooperation between the Federal Government and the private sector, does not support the claim that the federal regulations have grown so comprehensive since 1973 as to justify the inference of complete preemption.  Pp.  471 U. S. 716-719.
(b) Nor can an intent to preempt be inferred from the purported dominant federal interest in the field of blood plasma regulation.  The factors indicating federal dominance are absent here.  The regulation of health and safety matters is primarily and historically a matter of local concern, and the National Blood Policy is not a sufficient indication of federal dominance.  Pp.  471 U. S. 719-720.
(c) Any concern that the challenged ordinances impose on plasma centers and donors requirements more stringent than those imposed by the federal regulations, and therefore present a serious obstacle to the federal goal of ensuring an ""adequate supply of plasma,"" is too speculative to support preemption.  The District Court's findings rejecting appellee's factual assertions with respect to this concern, the lack of evidence of a threat to the ""adequacy"" of the plasma supply, and the lack of any statement by the FDA on the subject of ""adequacy,"" all lead to the conclusion that appellant county's requirements do not imperil the federal goal.  And where the record does not indicate that appellee has received the necessary federal exemption from the good-health requirement needed to collect plasma from individuals with hepatitis, appellee lacks standing to challenge the ordinances on the ground that they conflict with the federal regulations because they prevent individuals with hepatitis from donating their plasma.  Pp.  471 U. S. 720-722.

No. 84-325
Argued February 26, 1985

471 U.S. 724

Syllabus 
A Massachusetts statute ( 47B) requires that certain minimum mental health care benefits be provided a Massachusetts resident who is insured under a general health insurance policy or an employee health care plan that covers hospital and surgical expenses.  Appellant insurer in No. 84-325 contends that  47B, as applied to insurance policies purchased by employee health care plans regulated by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), is preempted by that Act.  Section 514(a) of ERISA provides that the statute shall ""supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.""  But  514(b)(2)(A) provides that, with one exception, nothing in ERISA ""shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance.""  The one exception is found in  514(b)(2)(B), which states that no employee benefit plan
""shall be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer . . . or to be engaged in the business of insurance . . . for purposes of any law of any State purporting to regulate insurance companies [or] insurance contracts.""
Appellant insurer in No. 84-356 contends that  47B, as applied to insurance policies purchased pursuant to collective bargaining agreements regulated by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), is preempted by that Act, because it effectively imposes a contract term on the parties that otherwise would be a mandatory subject of collective bargaining.  Massachusetts brought an action in Massachusetts Superior Court to enforce  47B against appellant insurers, and that court issued an injunction requiring the insurers to provide the coverage mandated by  47B.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed, finding no preemption under either ERISA or the NLRA.
Held:
1. Section 47B, as applied, is a law ""which regulates insurance"" within the meaning of  514(b)(2)(A), and therefore is not preempted by 
Page 471 U. S. 725
  514(a) as it applies to insurance contracts purchased for plans subject to ERISA.  Section 514(b)(2)(A)'s plain language, its relationship to the other ERISA preemption provisions, and the traditional understanding of insurance regulations, all lead to the conclusion that mandated benefit laws such as  47B are saved from preemption by the operation of  514(b)(2)(A).  Nothing in ERISA's legislative history suggests a different result.  Pp.  471 U. S. 739-747.
2. Nor is  47B, as applied to a plan negotiated pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement subject to the NLRA, preempted by the NLRA.  Pp.  471 U. S. 747-758.
(a) The NLRA preemption involved here is the one that protects against state interference with policies implicated by the structure of the NLRA itself, by preempting state law and state causes of action concerning conduct that Congress intended to be unregulated.  Pp.  471 U. S. 747-751.
(b) Such preemption rests on a sound understanding of the NLRA's purpose and operation that is incompatible with the view that the NLRA preempts any state attempt to impose minimum benefit terms on the parties to a collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  471 U. S. 751-753.
(c) Minimum state labor standards affect union and nonunion employees equally, and neither encourage nor discourage the collective bargaining processes that are the subject of the NLRA.  Nor do they have any but the most indirect effect on the right of self-organization established in the NLRA.  Unlike the NLRA, mandated benefit laws such as  47B are not designed to encourage or discourage employees in the promotion of their interests collectively; rather, they are in part designed to give minimum protections to individual employees and to ensure that each employee covered by the NLRA receives mandated health insurance coverage.  These laws are minimum standards independent of the collective bargaining process.  Pp.  471 U. S. 753-756.
(d) There is no suggestion in the NLRA's legislative history that Congress intended to disturb the state laws that set minimum labor standards but were unrelated to the collective bargaining or self-organization processes.  To the contrary, Congress in the NLRA developed the framework for self-organization and collective bargaining within the larger body of state law promoting public health and safety.  When a state law establishes a minimal employment standard not inconsistent with the NLRA's general goals, it conflicts with none of the NLRA's purposes.  Section 47B is an insurance regulation designed to implement the Commonwealth's policy on mental health care, and as such is a valid and unexceptional exercise of the Commonwealth's police power.  Though  47B potentially limits any employee's right to choose one thing by requiring that he be provided with something else, it does 
Page 471 U. S. 726
 not limit the right of self-organization or collective bargaining protected by the NLRA.  Pp.  471 U. S. 756-758.

The 1891 Act that first authorized mineral leasing of Indian lands was amended by a 1924 Act that provided that ""the production of oil and gas and other minerals on such lands may be taxed by the State in which said lands are located.""  The Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, which was enacted to obtain uniformity of Indian mineral leasing laws, also permitted mineral leasing of Indian lands, but contained no provision authorizing state taxation, nor did it repeal specifically such authorization in the 1924 Act.  A general repealer clause of the 1938 Act, however, provides that ""[a]ll Act[s] or parts of Acts inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed.""  Respondent Indian Tribe filed suit in Federal District Court challenging the application of several Montana taxes to respondent's royalty interests under oil and gas leases issued to non-Indian lessees pursuant to the 1938 Act, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the State, holding that the taxes were authorized by the 1924 Act, and that the 1938 Act did not repeal this authorization.  The Court of Appeals reversed in pertinent part.
Held:  Montana may not tax respondent's royalty interests from leases issued pursuant to the 1938 Act.  Pp.  471 U. S. 764-768.

(b) When the 1924 and 1938 Acts are considered in light of these principles, it is clear that the 1924 Act does not authorize Montana to impose the taxes in question.  Nothing in either the text or legislative history of the 1938 Act suggests that Congress intended to permit States to tax tribal royalty income generated by leases issued pursuant to that Act.  The Act contains no explicit consent to state taxation, nor is there any indication that it was intended to incorporate implicitly the 1924 Act's taxing authority.  The 1938 Act's general repealer clause cannot be taken to incorporate consistent provisions of earlier laws, and surely does not satisfy the requirement that Congress clearly consent to state taxation.

471 U.S. 773

Syllabus 
In March, 1981, petitioner was charged in a multicount indictment in the Western District of Washington for his role in the off-loading and landing of marihuana from a ""mother ship"" at a Washington location on specified days in October, 1979, and August, 1980.  He pleaded guilty to one count of importation of marihuana and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and a $15,000 fine.  The remaining counts were dismissed without prejudice to the Government's right to prosecute petitioner on any other offenses he might have committed.  Thereafter, in July, 1981, petitioner was indicted in the Northern District of Florida on several drug counts, including a count for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) from January, 1976, to July, 1981, in violation of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C.  848.  The District Court denied petitioner's pretrial motion to dismiss the CCE charge on the asserted ground that it encompassed the Washington importation operation in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  At trial, evidence underlying petitioner's prior conviction was introduced to prove one of three predicate offenses that must be shown to make out a CCE violation, and petitioner was convicted on the CCE count and on other counts.  He was sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment and a $100,000 fine on the CCE count, the prison term being concurrent with the prison terms on the other counts but consecutive to the prison term from the Washington conviction.  Rejecting petitioner's contention that his Washington conviction barred the subsequent CCE prosecution in Florida, the Court of Appeals held that the Washington offense and the CCE offense were not the same under the Double Jeopardy Clause, and hence that successive prosecutions and cumulative sentences for these offenses were permissible.
Held:
1. The language, structure, and legislative history of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 show that Congress intended the CCE offense to be a separate offense that is punishable in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the predicate offenses.

2. It did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause to prosecute the CCE offense after the prior conviction for one of the predicate offenses.  The CCE offense is not the ""same"" offense as one or more of its predicate offenses within the meaning of that Clause.  Nor was the Washington offense a ""lesser included"" offense of the CCE offense.  Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, distinguished.  The conduct with which petitioner was charged in Florida, when compared with that with which he was charged in Washington, does not lend itself to the simple analogy of a single course of conduct comprising a lesser included misdemeanor within a felony.  The CCE was alleged to have spanned more than five years, whereas the acts charged in Washington were alleged to have occurred on single days in 1979 and 1980.  But even assuming that the Washington offense was a lesser included offense, petitioner's double jeopardy claim is not sustainable.  The CCE charge in Florida had not been completed at the time the Washington indictment was returned, and evidence of the importation in Washington could be used to show one of the predicate offenses.  Diaz v. United States, 223 U. S. 442.  Pp.  471 U. S. 786-793.
3. The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the cumulative punishments.  The presumption when Congress creates two distinct defenses, as it did here, is that it intended to permit cumulative sentences.  To disallow cumulative sentences would have the anomalous effect in many cases of converting into ceilings the large fines provided by 21 U.S.C.  848 to deprive big-time drug dealers of their enormous profits.  Logic, as well as the legislative history, supports the conclusion that Congress intended separate punishments for the underlying substantive predicate offenses and for the CCE offense.  Pp.  471 U.

No. 83-1842
Argued January 16, 1985
Decided June 3, 1985
471 U.S. 773

Syllabus 
In March, 1981, petitioner was charged in a multicount indictment in the Western District of Washington for his role in the off-loading and landing of marihuana from a ""mother ship"" at a Washington location on specified days in October, 1979, and August, 1980.  He pleaded guilty to one count of importation of marihuana and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and a $15,000 fine.  The remaining counts were dismissed without prejudice to the Government's right to prosecute petitioner on any other offenses he might have committed.  Thereafter, in July, 1981, petitioner was indicted in the Northern District of Florida on several drug counts, including a count for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) from January, 1976, to July, 1981, in violation of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C.  848.  The District Court denied petitioner's pretrial motion to dismiss the CCE charge on the asserted ground that it encompassed the Washington importation operation in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  At trial, evidence underlying petitioner's prior conviction was introduced to prove one of three predicate offenses that must be shown to make out a CCE violation, and petitioner was convicted on the CCE count and on other counts.  He was sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment and a $100,000 fine on the CCE count, the prison term being concurrent with the prison terms on the other counts but consecutive to the prison term from the Washington conviction.  Rejecting petitioner's contention that his Washington conviction barred the subsequent CCE prosecution in Florida, the Court of Appeals held that the Washington offense and the CCE offense were not the same under the Double Jeopardy Clause, and hence that successive prosecutions and cumulative sentences for these offenses were permissible.
Held:
1. The language, structure, and legislative history of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 show that Congress intended the CCE offense to be a separate offense that is punishable in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the predicate offenses.  It would be illogical for Congress to intend that a choice be made between the predicate offenses and the CCE offense in pursuing major drug dealers.  Pp.  471 U. S. 777-786.

No. 83-1919
Argued January 8, 1985
Decided June 3, 1985
471 U.S. 808

Syllabus 
An officer on petitioner city's police force shot and killed respondent's husband outside a bar in which a robbery had been reported in progress.  Respondent brought suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against the officer and petitioner, alleging that their actions had deprived her husband of certain constitutional rights.  With respect to the liability of petitioner city, the trial judge informed the jury that petitioner could be held liable only if a municipal ""policy"" had caused the deprivation, and further instructed the jury that it could ""infer,"" from
""a single, unusually excessive use of force . . . that it was attributable to inadequate training or supervision amounting to 'deliberate indifference' or 'gross negligence' on the part of the officials in charge.""
The jury returned a verdict in favor of the officer but against petitioner, and awarded respondent damages.  Rejecting petitioner's claim that the jury instruction was improper, the Court of Appeals held that proof of a single incident of unconstitutional activity by a police officer could suffice to establish municipal liability.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
728 F.2d 456, reversed.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II, concluding that, where the question was not raised until she mentioned it in her brief on the merits in this Court and later at oral argument, it was too late for respondent to argue that the jury instruction issue was not properly preserved because petitioner failed to object at trial to the instruction in question with sufficient specificity to satisfy Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51.  Nonjurisdictional defects of this sort should be brought to the Court's attention no later than in respondent's brief in opposition; if not, it is within the Court's discretion to deem the defect waived.  Pp.  471 U. S. 815-816.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, delivered an opinion with respect to Part III, concluding that the instruction at issue improperly instructed the jury concerning the standard for imposing liability on municipalities under  1983.  The inference in the instruction was unwarranted in its assumption 
Page 471 U. S. 809
 that the act at issue arose from inadequate training and in its further assumption concerning the state of mind of the municipal policymakers.  More importantly, the inference allowed a  1983 plaintiff to establish municipal liability without submitting proof of a single action taken by a municipal policymaker.  The requirement of Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658, that municipal liability under  1983 can only be imposed for injuries inflicted pursuant to government ""policy or custom"" makes it clear that, at the least, that requirement was intended to prevent the imposition of municipal liability under circumstances where no wrong could be ascribed to municipal decisionmakers.  The fact that in this case respondent introduced independent evidence of inadequate training makes no difference, because the instruction allowed the jury to impose liability even if it did not believe respondent's expert witness' testimony that the police officer's training was inadequate.  There must at the very least be an affirmative link between the municipality's policy and the particular constitutional violation alleged.  Here, the jury instruction allowed the jury to infer a thoroughly nebulous ""policy"" of ""inadequate training"" on petitioner's part from the single incident in question, and at the same time sanctioned the inference that the ""policy"" was the cause of the incident.  Pp.  471 U. S. 816-824.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that to infer the existence of a city policy from the misconduct of a single, low-level officer, as the jury instruction here allowed, and then to hold the city liable on the basis of that policy, would amount to permitting precisely the theory of strict respondeat superior liability rejected in Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, supra.  There may be many ways of proving the existence of a municipal policy or custom that can cause a deprivation of a constitutional right, but the scope of  1983 liability does not permit such liability to be imposed merely on evidence of the wrongful actions of a single city employee not authorized to make city policy.  Pp.  471 U. S. 827-833.

No. 84-320
Argued April 16, 1985
Decided June 3, 1985
471 U.S. 845

Syllabus 
Respondent Crow Indian minor was struck by a motorcycle in the parking lot of a school located within the Crow Indian Reservation but on land owned by the State of Montana.  Through his guardian, the minor brought a damages action in the Crow Tribal Court against petitioner School District, a political subdivision of the State, and obtained a default judgment.  Thereafter, the School District and its insurer, also a petitioner, brought an action in Federal District Court for injunctive relief, invoking as a basis for federal jurisdiction 28 U.S.C.  1331, which provides that a federal district court ""shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.""  The District Court held that the Tribal Court had no jurisdiction over a civil action against a non-Indian, and accordingly entered an injunction against execution of the Tribal Court judgment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court had no jurisdiction to enter such an injunction.
Held:
1. Section 1331 encompasses the federal question whether the Tribal Court exceeded the lawful limits of its jurisdiction.  Since petitioners contend that federal law has divested the Tribe of its power to compel a non-Indian property owner to submit to the civil jurisdiction of the Tribal Court, it is federal law on which petitioners rely as a basis for the asserted right of freedom from Tribal Court interference.  They have, therefore, filed an action ""arising under"" federal law within the meaning of  1331.  Pp.  471 U. S. 850-853.
2. Exhaustion of Tribal Court remedies is required, however, before petitioners' claim may be entertained by the District Court.  The existence and extent of the Tribal Court's jurisdiction requires a careful examination of tribal sovereignty and the extent to which that sovereignty has been altered, divested, or diminished, as well as a detailed study of relevant statutes, Executive Branch policy as embodied in treaties and elsewhere, and administrative or judicial decisions.  Such an examination and study should be conducted in the first instance by the Tribal Court.  Pp.  471 U. S. 853-857.
3. Until petitioners have exhausted the available remedies in the Tribal Court, it would be premature for the District Court to consider 
Page 471 U. S. 846
 any relief.  Whether the federal action should be dismissed or merely held in abeyance pending the development of the Tribal Court proceedings is a question that should be addressed in the first instance by the District Court.  P.  471 U. S. 857.

 CHEVRON U.S.A., INC., et al. v. William J. SHEFFIELD, Governor of Alaska, et alNo. 84-634 Supreme Court of the United States June 3, 1985
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Opinion of Justice STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
 Reasonable Justices can certainly differ on whether certiorari should be granted in this case. Justice WHITE, in dissent, has explained why he favors a grant of the petition for writ of certiorari. There is, of course, no reason why that dissent should identify the reasons supporting a denial of the petition. Matters such as the fact that apparently only one 26-year-old vessel may be affected by the Ninth Circuit's ruling,1 that apparently no other State has enacted a deballasting prohibition similar to Alaska's, and that the Coast Guard retains the power to modify its regulations relating to deballasting lend support to the Court's discretionary determination that review in this Court is not necessary even if the Court of Appeals' decision is arguably incorrect. I add these few words only because of my concern that unanswered dissents from denial of certiorari sometimes lead the uninformed reader to conclude that the Court is not managing its discretionary docket in a responsible manner. See Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 940, 942, 945, 337, 338 (1978) (opinion of STEVENS, J., respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari).2 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the State of Alaska's Tanker Act, former Alaska Stat.Ann . 46.03.750(e) (Supp.1977), amended in 1980 and cur- 
Page 471 U.S. 1140 , 1141
 rently Alaska Stat.Ann. 46.03.750(a), (b) (1982), which restricts deballasting by oil tankers in Alaskan waters, was not preempted by regulations promulgated by the Coast Guard under Title II of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 (PWSA).1 Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Hammond, 726 F.2d 483 (1984). I believe that in so holding, the court arguably "" decided a federal question in a way in conflict with applicable decisions of this Court."" This Court's Rule 17.1(c). Accordingly, I would grant certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
 In Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U.S. 151d 179 (1978), we held that federal regulations governing oil tanker design and construction promulgated under Title II of the PWSA preempt more stringent state regulations covering the same subject matter. Our holding was based in large part on our conclusion that Title II was intended to authorize comprehensive standards ""[t]o implement the twin goals of providing for vessel safety and protecting the marine environment ."" Id., at 161. Under the statute, we observed, ""the Secretary [of Transportation] must issue all design and construction regulations that he deems necessary for these ends, after considering the specified statutory standards."" Id., at 165. When a State has imposed a more stringent standard than the Secretary but the state and federal standards ""ai[m] at precisely the same ends,"" we concluded, ""[t]he Supremacy Clause dictates that the federal judgment . . . prevail over the contrary state judgment."" Ibid. 
 As the court below pointed out, Ray dealt with federal standards for tanker design and construction, whereas this case involves standards governing tanker operations-specifically, standards governing the discharge of seawater loaded into cargo compartments and used as ballast. [Footnote 2] The need for national uniformity in the area of standards for tanker operations, the court concluded, is not so great as the need for uniformity in standards governing [471 U.S. 1140 , 1142]

 CHEVRON U.S.A., INC., et al. v. William J. SHEFFIELD, Governor of Alaska, et alNo. 84-634 Supreme Court of the United States June 3, 1985
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Opinion of Justice STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
 Reasonable Justices can certainly differ on whether certiorari should be granted in this case. Justice WHITE, in dissent, has explained why he favors a grant of the petition for writ of certiorari. There is, of course, no reason why that dissent should identify the reasons supporting a denial of the petition. Matters such as the fact that apparently only one 26-year-old vessel may be affected by the Ninth Circuit's ruling,1 that apparently no other State has enacted a deballasting prohibition similar to Alaska's, and that the Coast Guard retains the power to modify its regulations relating to deballasting lend support to the Court's discretionary determination that review in this Court is not necessary even if the Court of Appeals' decision is arguably incorrect. I add these few words only because of my concern that unanswered dissents from denial of certiorari sometimes lead the uninformed reader to conclude that the Court is not managing its discretionary docket in a responsible manner. See Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 940, 942, 945, 337, 338 (1978) (opinion of STEVENS, J., respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari).2 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the State of Alaska's Tanker Act, former Alaska Stat.Ann . 46.03.750(e) (Supp.1977), amended in 1980 and cur- 
Page 471 U.S. 1140 , 1141
 rently Alaska Stat.Ann. 46.03.750(a), (b) (1982), which restricts deballasting by oil tankers in Alaskan waters, was not preempted by regulations promulgated by the Coast Guard under Title II of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 (PWSA).1 Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Hammond, 726 F.2d 483 (1984). I believe that in so holding, the court arguably "" decided a federal question in a way in conflict with applicable decisions of this Court."" This Court's Rule 17.1(c). Accordingly, I would grant certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
 In Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U.S. 151d 179 (1978), we held that federal regulations governing oil tanker design and construction promulgated under Title II of the PWSA preempt more stringent state regulations covering the same subject matter. Our holding was based in large part on our conclusion that Title II was intended to authorize comprehensive standards ""[t]o implement the twin goals of providing for vessel safety and protecting the marine environment ."" Id., at 161. Under the statute, we observed, ""the Secretary [of Transportation] must issue all design and construction regulations that he deems necessary for these ends, after considering the specified statutory standards."" Id., at 165. When a State has imposed a more stringent standard than the Secretary but the state and federal standards ""ai[m] at precisely the same ends,"" we concluded, ""[t]he Supremacy Clause dictates that the federal judgment . . . prevail over the contrary state judgment."" Ibid. 
 As the court below pointed out, Ray dealt with federal standards for tanker design and construction, whereas this case involves standards governing tanker operations-specifically, standards governing the discharge of seawater loaded into cargo compartments and used as ballast. [Footnote 2] The need for national uniformity in the area of standards for tanker operations, the court concluded, is not so great as the need for uniformity in standards governing [471 U.S. 1140 , 1142]

No. 83-2166
Argued January 7, 1985
Decided May 28, 1985
471 U.S. 626

Syllabus 
Appellant, an attorney practicing law in Ohio, ran a newspaper advertisement advising readers that his firm would represent defendants in drunken driving cases and that his clients' ""full legal fee [would be] refunded if [they were] convicted of DRUNK DRIVING.""  Later, appellant ran another newspaper advertisement publicizing his willingness to represent women who had suffered injuries resulting from their use of a contraceptive known as the Dalkon Shield Intrauterine Device.  The advertisement featured a line drawing of the device and stated that the Dalkon Shield had generated a large amount of lawsuits; that appellant was currently handling such lawsuits and was willing to represent other women asserting similar claims; that readers should not assume that their claims were time-barred; that cases were handled on a contingent fee basis; and that, ""[i]f there is no recovery, no legal fees are owed by our clients.""  This advertisement attracted 106 clients.  Appellee Office of Disciplinary Counsel of the Supreme Court of Ohio filed a complaint charging that appellant's advertisements violated a number of Disciplinary Rules of the Ohio Code of Professional Responsibility.  The complaint alleged that the drunken driving advertisement was deceptive because it purported to propose a transaction that would violate a rule prohibiting contingent fee representation in criminal cases, and that the Dalkon Shield advertisement violated rules prohibiting the use of illustrations in advertisements and the soliciting of legal employment.  The complaint also alleged that the Dalkon Shield advertisement violated a rule prohibiting false or deceptive statements because it failed to inform clients that they would be liable for costs (as opposed to legal fees) even if their claims were unsuccessful.  Rejecting appellant's contentions that the Ohio rules restricting the content of advertising by attorneys were unconstitutional, the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Ohio Supreme Court concluded that the advertisements violated a number of the rules, and recommended disciplinary action.  With respect to the drunken driving advertisement, the Board, differing from the theory advanced in appellee's complaint, found that the advertisement's failure to mention the common practice of plea bargaining might be deceptive to potential clients who would be unaware of the possibility that they would both be found guilty of a lesser offense and be liable for 
Page 471 U. S. 627
 attorney's fees because they had not been convicted of drunken driving.  The Ohio Supreme Court ultimately adopted the Board's findings and issued a public reprimand.
Held:  The reprimand is sustainable to the extent that it is based on appellant's advertisement involving his terms of representation in drunken driving cases and on the omission of information regarding his contingent fee arrangements in his Dalkon Shield advertisement.  But insofar as the reprimand is based on appellant's use of an illustration in his advertisement and his offer of legal advice, the reprimand violated his First Amendment rights.  Pp.  471 U. S. 637-656.
(a) The speech at issue is ""commercial speech"" entitled to First Amendment protection.  Commercial speech that is not false or deceptive and does not concern unlawful activities may be restricted only in the service of a substantial governmental interest, and only through means that directly advance that interest.  Pp.  471 U. S. 637-638.
(b) The reprimand cannot be sustained on the ground that the Dalkon Shield advertisement violated rules against soliciting or accepting legal employment through advertisements containing information or advice regarding a specific legal problem.  The advertisement's statements concerning the Dalkon Shield were neither false nor deceptive, and the governmental interests that were found to be sufficient to justify a ban on in-person solicitation of legal business in Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn, 436 U. S. 447, are not present here.  Nor can a prohibition on the use of legal advice and information in attorney advertising be sustained on the ground that a prophylactic rule is needed to ensure that attorneys, in an effort to secure legal business for themselves, do not use false or misleading advertising to stir up meritless litigation.  And the contention that a prophylactic rule is necessary because the regulatory problems in distinguishing deceptive and nondeceptive legal advertising are different in kind from the problems presented by the advertising of other types of goods and services is unpersuasive.  Pp.  471 U. S. 639-647.
(c) Ohio's ban on the use of illustrations in attorney advertisements cannot stand.  Because the illustration in appellant's Dalkon Shield advertisement was an accurate representation, the burden is on the State to present a substantial governmental interest justifying the restriction as applied to appellant and to demonstrate that the restriction vindicates that interest through the least restrictive available means.  The State's interest in preserving the dignity of the legal profession is insufficient to justify the ban on all use of illustrations in advertising.  Nor can the rule be sustained on unsupported assertions that the use of illustrations in attorney advertising creates unacceptable risks that the public will be misled, manipulated, or confused, or that, because illustrations may produce their effects by operating on a subconscious level, it 
Page 471 U. S. 628
 would be difficult for the State to point to any particular illustration and prove that it is misleading or manipulative.  Pp.  471 U. S. 647-649.
(d) The Ohio Supreme Court's decision to discipline appellant for his failure to include in the Dalkon Shield advertisement the information that clients might be liable for litigation costs even if their lawsuits were unsuccessful does not violate the First Amendment.  Because the extension of First Amendment protection to commercial speech is justified principally by the value to consumers of the information such speech provides, appellant's constitutionally protected interest in not providing any particular factual information in his advertising is minimal.  An advertiser's rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers.  The State's position that it is deceptive to employ advertising that refers to contingent fee arrangements without mentioning the client's liability for costs is reasonable enough to support the disclosure requirement.  Pp.  471 U. S. 650-653.
(e) The constitutional guarantee of due process was not violated by the discrepancy between the theory relied on by both the Ohio Supreme Court and its Board of Commissioners as to how the drunken driving advertisement was deceptive and the theory asserted by appellee in its complaint.  Under Ohio law, bar discipline is the Ohio Supreme Court's responsibility, and the Ohio rules provide ample opportunity for response to the Board's recommendations to the court that put appellant on notice of the charges he had to answer to the court's satisfaction.  Such notice and opportunity to respond satisfy the demands of due process.  Pp.  471 U. S. 654-655.

Syllabus 
Respondents father and sons, who owned all of the common stock of a lumber business that they operated, offered their stock for sale through brokers.  The company's sawmill was subsequently damaged by fire, but potential purchasers were told that the mill would be rebuilt and modernized.  Thereafter, a stock purchase agreement for all of the stock was executed, and ultimately petitioner company was formed by the purchasers.  Respondent father agreed to stay on as a consultant for some time to help with the daily operations of the mill.  After the acquisition was completed, the mill did not live up to the purchasers' expectations.  Eventually, petitioner sold the mill at a loss and went into receivership.  Petitioner then filed suit in Federal District Court for rescission of the sale of stock and damages, alleging that respondents had violated the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) and the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act).  The court granted summary judgment for respondents, holding that, under the ""sale of business"" doctrine, the stock could not be considered a ""security"" for purposes of the Acts because managerial control of the business had passed into the hands of the purchasers, who bought 100% of the stock.  The court concluded that the transaction thus was a commercial venture, rather than a typical investment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The stock at issue here is a ""security"" within the definition of the Acts, United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, 421 U. S. 837, distinguished, and the ""sale of business"" doctrine does not apply.  Pp.  471 U. S. 685-697.
(a) Section 2(1) of the 1933 Act and  3(a)(10) of the 1934 Act define a ""security"" as including ""stock"" and other listed types of instruments.  Although the fact that instruments bear the label ""stock"" is not of itself sufficient to invoke the Acts' coverage, when an instrument is both called ""stock"" and bears stock's usual characteristics as identified in Forman, supra, a purchaser justifiably may assume that the federal securities laws apply.  The stock involved here possesses all of the characteristics traditionally associated with common stock.  Moreover, reading the securities laws to apply to the sale of stock at issue here comports with Congress' remedial purpose in enacting the legislation to protect investors.  Pp.  471 U. S. 685-688. 
Page 471 U. S. 682

(b) When an instrument is labeled ""stock"" and possesses all of the traditional characteristics of stock, a court is not required to look to the economic substance of the transaction to determine whether the stock is a ""security"" within the meaning of the Acts.  A contrary rule is not supported by this Court's prior decisions involving unusual instruments not easily characterized as ""securities.""  Nor were the Acts intended, as asserted by respondents, to cover only ""passive investors,"" and not privately negotiated transactions involving the transfer of control to ""entrepreneurs.""  Pp.  471 U. S. 688-692.
(c) An instrument bearing both the name and all of the usual characteristics of stock presents the clearest case for coverage by the plain language of the definition.  ""Stock"" is distinguishable from most if not all of the other listed categories, and may be viewed as being in a category by itself for purposes of interpreting the Acts' definition of ""security.""  Pp.  471 U. S. 693-694.
(d) Application of the ""sale of business"" doctrine depends on whether control has passed to the purchaser.  Even though the transfer of 100% of a corporation's stock normally transfers control, the purchasers here had no intention of running the sawmill themselves.  Moreover, if the doctrine were applied here, it would also have to be applied to cases in which less than 100% of a company's stock was sold, thus inevitably leading to difficult questions of line-drawing.  As explained in Gould v. Ruefenacht, post, p.  471 U. S. 701, coverage by the Acts would in most cases be unknown and unknowable to the parties at the time the stock was sold.

Argued March 26, 1985
Decided May 28, 1985
471 U.S. 701

Syllabus 
Respondent Ruefenacht (hereinafter respondent) purchased 50% of the stock of a company whose president previously had owned all of the stock.  Respondent allegedly purchased the stock in reliance on financial documents and oral representations made by various individuals, including petitioner Gould, the company's corporate counsel.  Part of the consideration for the deal was respondent's promise that he would participate in the company's management, which he did, but his actions were at all times subject to the president's veto.  Respondent subsequently began to doubt the accuracy of some of the representations that had been made to him.  He ultimately filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging violations of, inter alia, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The court granted summary judgment for the defendants, holding that the stock respondent purchased was not a ""security"" within the meaning of the Acts, and that the ""sale of business"" doctrine prevented application of the Acts.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The stock purchased by respondent is a ""security"" within the meaning of the Acts, and the ""sale of business"" doctrine does not apply.  Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth, ante, p.  471 U. S. 681.  Pp.  471 U. S. 704-706.
(a) Where an instrument bears the label ""stock"" and possesses all of the characteristics typically associated with stock, a court is not required to look beyond the character of the instrument to the economic substance of the transaction to determine whether the stock is a ""security"" within the meaning of the Acts.  The instruments involved here were called ""stock,"" and possessed all of the characteristics that are usually associated with traditional stock.  P.  471 U. S. 704.
(b) There are sound policy reasons for rejecting the ""sale of business"" doctrine as a rule of decision in cases involving the sale of traditional stock in a closely held corporation.  The doctrine's application depends primarily on whether control has passed to the purchaser, which may not be determined simply by ascertaining what percentage of the company's stock has been purchased.

			"|"Gould v. Ruefenacht
No. 84-165
Argued March 26, 1985
Decided May 28, 1985
471 U.S. 701

Syllabus 
Respondent Ruefenacht (hereinafter respondent) purchased 50% of the stock of a company whose president previously had owned all of the stock.  Respondent allegedly purchased the stock in reliance on financial documents and oral representations made by various individuals, including petitioner Gould, the company's corporate counsel.  Part of the consideration for the deal was respondent's promise that he would participate in the company's management, which he did, but his actions were at all times subject to the president's veto.  Respondent subsequently began to doubt the accuracy of some of the representations that had been made to him.  He ultimately filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging violations of, inter alia, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The court granted summary judgment for the defendants, holding that the stock respondent purchased was not a ""security"" within the meaning of the Acts, and that the ""sale of business"" doctrine prevented application of the Acts.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The stock purchased by respondent is a ""security"" within the meaning of the Acts, and the ""sale of business"" doctrine does not apply.  Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth, ante, p.  471 U. S. 681.  Pp.  471 U. S. 704-706.
(a) Where an instrument bears the label ""stock"" and possesses all of the characteristics typically associated with stock, a court is not required to look beyond the character of the instrument to the economic substance of the transaction to determine whether the stock is a ""security"" within the meaning of the Acts.  The instruments involved here were called ""stock,"" and possessed all of the characteristics that are usually associated with traditional stock.  P.  471 U. S. 704.
(b) There are sound policy reasons for rejecting the ""sale of business"" doctrine as a rule of decision in cases involving the sale of traditional stock in a closely held corporation.  The doctrine's application depends primarily on whether control has passed to the purchaser, which may not be determined simply by ascertaining what percentage of the company's stock has been purchased.  Acquisition of more than 50% of a company's stock may or may not effect a transfer of operational control, while in some instances de facto operational control may be obtained by the acquisition of less than 50%.  Such seemingly inconsistent results stem from

Therefore, the Acts' applicability to a sale of stock such as that involved here would rarely be certain at the time of the transaction.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 28, 1985
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death scheduled for Wednesday, May 29, 1985, presented to Justice POWELL and by him referred to the Court is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), I would grant Francois' application for a stay of execution. 
 Even if I believed otherwise, however, I would grant the application. The Court's decision to send Francois to his death tomorrow morning is particularly disturbing because we have granted a writ of certiorari in a case raising the identical legal claim. Cabana v. Bullock, cert. granted, 471 U.S. 1052 (1985), poses the question whether a capital sentence may be carried out despite the fact that the sentencing jury was instructed on an imputed intent felony-murder theory of the type condemned in Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782 (1982).1 Francois was sen- 
Page 471 U.S. 1121 , 1122
 tenced to death based on his role in six murders committed in the course of a robbery. Four persons were arrested for the crime; two were triggermen, one accompanied the triggermen into the house, and the fourth stayed in a car outside. Francois claims that he argued at his trial, and has argued consistently since trial, that he was not the triggerman and did not realize that lethal force was likely to be used by his companions. In the rush to execution, we have not yet received the record in this case, and must assume that Francois accurately describes his defense. 
 It is undisputed that Francois' jury was instructed that ""[a]ny person who knowingly aids [or] abets . . . the commission of [a felony ] . . . is equally guilty of the crime of first degree murder with the one who actually performs the act,"" and that a killing in the course of a felony ""is murder in the first degree even though there is no premeditated design or intent to kill."" Application for Stay 27 (emphasis added). Thus, even if the jury had believed Francois' defense that he did not specifically intend to kill, they could have returned their death sentence against him under these instructions, which concededly were faulty under Enmund. 
 The jury instructions used in Cabana v. Bullock, supra, are indistinguishable. The jury there was told that capital murder included any killing ""when done with or without any design to effect death, by any person engaged in the commission of the crime of . . . robbery."" Bullock v. Lucas, 743 F.2d 244, 247 (CA5 1984) (emphasis added). Applying Enmund, supra, the Fifth Circuit concluded that although there had been some evidence introduced at trial that Bullock had intended the killing at issue, ""the penalty of death may not stand in light of the jury instruction which would permit the imposition of the death penalty merely because Bullock participated in the robbery"" without any intent to kill. 743 F.2d, at 248. See Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359 (1931); cf. Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 322-325, ___, ___ (1985); Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 526, 2460 (1979). 
 Until we have decided Cabana v. Bullock, supra, there can be no doubt that a death sentence imposed for a conviction based on such instructions is of doubtful validity, unless facts that would justify a finding of intent to kill under Enmund are undisputed. The Eleventh Circuit denied Francois' claim on this issue only today. We have no record before us on which to evaluate Francois' claim, nor has he ever had an opportunity fully to present his [471 U.S. 1121 , 1123]

 In The committee's recommendation proved to be highly controversial, largely because petitioner was an avowed Marxist. Petitioner's appointment was approved by the Provost of the University and the Chancellor of the College Park Campus, but was eventually overruled by the President of the University. 
 While this controversy was going on, respondents, nationally syndicated columnists, devoted one of their columns to it. In the course of the article, they made a number of statements about petitioner, including a description of his principal scholarly work as ""a ponderous tome in adoration of the master,"" and then went on to say: 
 ""Such pamphleteering is hooted at by one political scientist in a major eastern university, whose scholarship and reputation as a liberal are well known. 'Ollman has no status within the profession, but is a pure and simple activist,' he said."" 
 Petitioner sued respondents for libel in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and that court granted summary judgment for respondents. 479 F.Supp. 292 (1979). On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sitting en banc affirmed the judgment by a vote of six to five, producing three separate opinions concurring in the affirmance, and four dissenting opinions. 242 U.S.App.D. C. 381, 750 F.2d 970 (1984). 
 The Court of Appeals rested its decision entirely on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and held that this statement about petitioner-that he had no status within his profession-could simply not form the basis of an action for defamation in the light of that Amendment. There was no question as to whether petitioner could meet the requirement of ""malice"" under New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), since the case had never been tried to a jury. The Court of Appeals majority relied upon a brief passage from our opinion in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 339-340, 3006-07 (1974). I think that the result reached by the Court of Appeals in this case is nothing less than extraordinary.

471 U.S. 462

Syllabus 
Appellant is a Florida corporation whose principal offices are in Miami.  It conducts most of its restaurant business through a franchise operation, under which franchisees are licensed to use appellant's trademarks and service marks in leased standardized restaurant facilities for a period of 20 years.  The governing contracts provide that the franchise relationship is established in Miami and governed by Florida law, and call for payment of all required monthly fees and forwarding of all relevant notices to the Miami headquarters.  The Miami headquarters sets policy and works directly with the franchisees in attempting to resolve major problems.  Day-to-day monitoring of franchisees, however, is conducted through district offices that, in turn, report to the Miami headquarters.  Appellee is a Michigan resident who, along with another Michigan resident, entered into a 20-year franchise contract with appellant to operate a restaurant in Michigan.  Subsequently, when the restaurant's patronage declined, the franchisees fell behind in their monthly payments.  After extended negotiations among the franchisees, the Michigan district office, and the Miami headquarters proved unsuccessful in solving the problem, headquarters terminated the franchise and ordered the franchisees to vacate the premises.  They refused, and continued to operate the restaurant.  Appellant then brought a diversity action in Federal District Court in Florida, alleging that the franchisees had breached their franchise obligations and requesting damages and injunctive relief.  The franchisees claimed that, because they were Michigan residents and because appellant's claim did not ""arise"" within Florida, the District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.  But the court held that the franchisees were subject to personal jurisdiction pursuant to Florida's long-arm statute, which extends jurisdiction to any person, whether or not a citizen or resident of the State, who breaches a contract in the State by failing to perform acts that the contract requires to be performed there.  Thereafter, the court entered judgment against the franchisees on the merits.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that ""[j]urisdiction under these circumstances would offend the fundamental fairness which is the touchstone of due process.""
Held:  The District Court's exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to Florida's long-arm statute did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  471 U. S. 471-487.

(a) A forum may assert specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant where an alleged injury arises out of or relates to actions by the defendant himself that are purposeful directed toward forum residents, and where jurisdiction would not otherwise offend ""fair play and substantial justice.""

Syllabus 
Respondent, a Massachusetts prison inmate, as a result of a fight that occurred in a prison office, was charged with violation of prison regulations.  At the hearing on these charges, the disciplinary board refused to allow respondent to call witnesses whom he had requested, but the record of the hearing does not indicate the board's reason for such refusal.  The board found respondent guilty, and 150 days of his ""good time"" credits were forfeited.  Respondent then sought a writ of habeas corpus in a Massachusetts trial court, which sustained his claim that petitioner prison Superintendent had deprived him of the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, because petitioner advanced no reasons in court as to why respondent was not allowed to call the requested witnesses.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed, holding that there must be some support in the administrative record to justify a decision not to call witnesses, and that, since the administrative record in this case contained no such support, the state regulations governing presentation of proof in disciplinary hearings were unconstitutional to the extent that they did not require the administrative record to contain reasons supporting the board's denial of an inmate's witness request.
Held:  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require that prison officials' reasons for denying an inmate's witness request appear in the administrative record of the disciplinary hearing.  While the Due Process Clause does require that the officials at some point state their reasons for refusing to call witnesses, they may do so either by making the explanation part of the administrative record or by later presenting testimony in court if the deprivation of a ""liberty"" interest, such as that afforded by ""good time"" credits, is challenged because of the refusal to call the requested witnesses.

Decided May 20, 1985
471 U.S. 491

Syllabus 
Respondent, a Massachusetts prison inmate, as a result of a fight that occurred in a prison office, was charged with violation of prison regulations.  At the hearing on these charges, the disciplinary board refused to allow respondent to call witnesses whom he had requested, but the record of the hearing does not indicate the board's reason for such refusal.  The board found respondent guilty, and 150 days of his ""good time"" credits were forfeited.  Respondent then sought a writ of habeas corpus in a Massachusetts trial court, which sustained his claim that petitioner prison Superintendent had deprived him of the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, because petitioner advanced no reasons in court as to why respondent was not allowed to call the requested witnesses.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed, holding that there must be some support in the administrative record to justify a decision not to call witnesses, and that, since the administrative record in this case contained no such support, the state regulations governing presentation of proof in disciplinary hearings were unconstitutional to the extent that they did not require the administrative record to contain reasons supporting the board's denial of an inmate's witness request.
Held:  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require that prison officials' reasons for denying an inmate's witness request appear in the administrative record of the disciplinary hearing.  While the Due Process Clause does require that the officials at some point state their reasons for refusing to call witnesses, they may do so either by making the explanation part of the administrative record or by later presenting testimony in court if the deprivation of a ""liberty"" interest, such as that afforded by ""good time"" credits, is challenged because of the refusal to call the requested witnesses.

Syllabus 
The Medicaid Act does not cover services performed for patients between the ages of 21 and 65 in an ""institution for mental diseases"" (IMD).  In the absence of a statutory definition, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) has promulgated a regulation defining an IMD as ""an institution that is primarily engaged in providing diagnosis, treatment or care of persons with mental diseases,"" and providing that whether an institution is an IMD is determined by its ""overall character.""  The Middletown Haven Rest Home in Connecticut is an ""intermediate care facility"" (ICF) that provides care for persons with mental illness as well as other diseases.  Between January, 1977, and September, 1979, Connecticut paid Middletown Haven for services it provided to Medicaid eligible patients, including those between the ages of 21 and 65 who had been transferred there from state mental hospitals.  Under the Medicaid program, the State received federal reimbursement for those payments.  At the completion of an audit by the Department of Health and Human Services, the State was notified that the federal reimbursement was not allowable because Middletown Haven had been identified as an IMD.  On administrative review, the Department's Grant Appeals Board upheld the disallowance.  The State then filed an action in Federal District Court, which set aside the disallowance, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  An ICF may be an IMD, and the terms are not mutually exclusive.  The Act's express authorization for coverage of services performed for individuals 65 or over uses language that plainly indicates that a hospital, a skilled nursing facility, or an ICF may be an IMD.  Moreover, the Secretary's interpretation of the Act comports with the Act's plain language.  And the legislative history does not reveal any clear expression of contrary congressional intent.

Syllabus 
In 1977, former President Ford contracted with petitioners to publish his as yet unwritten memoirs.  The agreement gave petitioners the exclusive first serial right to license prepublication excerpts.  Two years later, as the memoirs were nearing completion, petitioners, as the copyright holders, negotiated a prepublication licensing agreement with Time Magazine under which Time agreed to pay $25,000 ($12,500 in advance and the balance at publication) in exchange for the right to excerpt 7,500 words from Mr. Ford's account of his pardon of former President Nixon.  Shortly before the Time article's scheduled release, an unauthorized source provided The Nation Magazine with the unpublished Ford manuscript.  Working directly from this manuscript, an editor of The Nation produced a 2,250-word article, at least 300 to 400 words of which consisted of verbatim quotes of copyrighted expression taken from the manuscript.  It was timed to ""scoop"" the Time article.  As a result of the publication of The Nation's article, Time canceled its article and refused to pay the remaining $12,500 to petitioners.  Petitioners then brought suit in Federal District Court against respondent publishers of The Nation, alleging, inter alia, violations of the Copyright Act (Act).  The District Court held that the Ford memoirs were protected by copyright at the time of The Nation publication, and that respondents' use of the copyrighted material constituted an infringement under the Act, and the court awarded actual damages of $12,500.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that The Nation's publication of the 300 to 400 words it identified as copyrightable expression was sanctioned as a ""fair use"" of the copyrighted material under  107 of the Act.  Section 107 provides that, notwithstanding the provisions of  106 giving a copyright owner the exclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work and to prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted work, the fair use of a copyrighted work for purposes such as comment and news reporting is not an infringement of copyright.  Section 107 further provides that, in determining whether the use was fair, the factors to be considered shall include:  (1) the purpose and character of the use; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the substantiality of the portion used in relation to the 
Page 471 U. S. 540
 copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
Held:  The Nation's article was not a ""fair use"" sanctioned by  107.  Pp.  471 U. S. 542-569.
(a) In using generous verbatim excerpts of Mr. Ford's unpublished expression to lend authenticity to its account of the forthcoming memoirs, The Nation effectively arrogated to itself the right of first publication, an important marketable subsidiary right.  Pp.  471 U. S. 545-549.
(b) Though the right of first publication, like other rights enumerated in  106, is expressly made subject to the fair use provisions of 107, fair use analysis must always be tailored to the individual case.  The nature of the interest at stake is highly relevant to whether a given use is fair.  The unpublished nature of a work is a key, though not necessarily determinative, factor tending to negate a defense of fair use.  And under ordinary circumstances, the author's right to control the first public appearance of his undisseminated expression will outweigh a claim of fair use.  Pp.  471 U. S. 549-555.
(c) In view of the First Amendment's protections embodied in the Act's distinction between copyrightable expression and uncopyrightable facts and ideas, and the latitude for scholarship and comment traditionally afforded by fair use, there is no warrant for expanding, as respondents contend should be done, the fair use doctrine to what amounts to a public figure exception to copyright.  Whether verbatim copying from a public figure's manuscript in a given case is or is not fair must be judged according to the traditional equities of fair use.  Pp.  471 U. S. 555-560.
(d) Taking into account the four factors enumerated in  107 as especially relevant in determining fair use leads to the conclusion that the use in question here was not fair.  (i) The fact that news reporting was the general purpose of The Nation's use is simply one factor.  While The Nation had every right to be the first to publish the information, it went beyond simply reporting uncopyrightable information and actively sought to exploit the headline value of its infringement, making a ""news event"" out of its unauthorized first publication.  The fact that the publication was commercial, as opposed to nonprofit, is a separate factor tending to weigh against a finding of fair use.  Fair use presupposes good faith.  The Nation's unauthorized use of the undisseminated manuscript had not merely the incidental effect, but the intended purpose, of supplanting the copyright holders' commercially valuable right of first publication.  (ii) While there may be a greater need to disseminate works of fact than works of fiction, The Nation's taking of copyrighted expression exceeded that necessary to disseminate the facts, and infringed the copyright holders' interests in confidentiality and creative control over the first public appearance of the work.  (iii) Although the verbatim quotes 
Page 471 U. S. 541
 in question were an insubstantial portion of the Ford manuscript, they qualitatively embodied Mr. Ford's distinctive expression, and played a key role in the infringing article.  (iv) As to the effect of The Nation's article on the market for the copyrighted work, Time's cancellation of its projected article and its refusal to pay $12,500 were the direct effect of the infringing publication.  Once a copyright holder establishes a causal connection between the infringement and loss of revenue, the burden shifts to the infringer to show that the damage would have occurred had there been no taking of copyrighted expression.  Petitioners established a prima facie case of actual damage that respondents failed to rebut.  More important, to negate a claim of fair use, it need only be shown that, if the challenged use should become widespread, it would adversely affect the potential market for the copyrighted work.  Here, The Nation's liberal use of verbatim excerpts posed substantial potential for damage to the marketability of first serialization rights in the copyrighted work.  Pp.  471 U. S. 560-569.

Syllabus 
Respondent, upon pleading guilty in a Missouri state court to controlled substance offenses, was put on probation and given suspended prison sentences.  Two months later, he was arrested for and subsequently charged with leaving the scene of an automobile accident, a felony.  After a hearing, the judge who had sentenced respondent, finding that respondent had violated his probation conditions by committing a felony, revoked probation and ordered execution of the previously imposed sentences.  After unsuccessfully seeking postconviction relief in state court, respondent filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, alleging that the state judge had violated due process requirements by revoking probation without considering alternatives to incarceration.  The District Court agreed and ordered respondent released from custody.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not generally require a sentencing court to indicate that it has considered alternatives to incarceration before revoking probation.  The procedures for revocation of probation -- written notice to the probationer of the claimed probation violations, disclosure of the evidence against him, an opportunity for the probationer to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence, a neutral hearing body, a written statement by the factfinder as to the evidence relied on and the reasons for revoking probation, the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses unless the hearing body finds good cause for not allowing confrontation, and the right to assistance of counsel, Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471; Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778 -- do not include an express statement by the factfinder that alternatives to incarceration were considered and rejected.  The specified procedures adequately protect the probationer against revocation of probation in a constitutionally unfair manner.  Pp.  471 U. S. 610-614.
2. The procedures required by the Due Process Clause were afforded in this case, even though the state judge did not explain on the record his consideration and rejection of alternatives to incarceration.  The revocation 
Page 471 U. S. 607
 of probation did not violate due process simply because the offense of leaving the scene of all accident was unrelated to the offense for which respondent was previously convicted or because, after the revocation proceeding, the charges arising from the automobile accident were reduced to the misdemeanor of reckless and careless driving.

Syllabus 
A Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent, who had information that respondent's mobile motor home was being used to exchange marihuana for sex, watched respondent approach a youth who accompanied respondent to the motor home, which was parked in a lot in downtown San Diego.  The agent and other agents then kept the vehicle under surveillance, and stopped the youth after he left the vehicle.  He told them that he had received marihuana in return for allowing respondent sexual contacts.  At the agents' request, the youth returned to the motor home and knocked on the door; respondent stepped out.  Without a warrant or consent, one agent then entered the motor home and observed marihuana.  A subsequent search of the motor home at the police station revealed additional marihuana, and respondent was charged with possession of marihuana for sale.  After his motion to suppress the evidence discovered in the motor home was denied, respondent was convicted in California Superior Court on a plea of nolo contendere.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed.  The California Supreme Court reversed, holding that the search of the motor home was unreasonable and that the motor vehicle exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment did not apply, because expectations of privacy in a motor home are more like those in a dwelling than in an automobile.
Held:  The warrantless search of respondent's motor home did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  471 U. S. 390-395.
(a) When a vehicle is being used on the highways or is capable of such use and is found stationary in a place not regularly used for residential purposes, the two justifications for the vehicle exception come into play.  First, the vehicle is readily mobile, and, second, there is a reduced expectation of privacy stemming from the pervasive regulation of vehicles capable of traveling on highways.  Here, while respondent's vehicle possessed some attributes of a home, it clearly falls within the vehicle exception.  To distinguish between respondent's motor home and an ordinary sedan for purposes of the vehicle exception would require that the exception be applied depending on the size of the vehicle and the quality of its appointments.  Moreover, to fail to apply the exception to vehicles such as a motor home would ignore the fact that a motor home lends itself easily to use as an instrument of illicit drug traffic or other illegal activity.  Pp.  471 U. S. 390-394. 
Page 471 U. S. 387

(b) The search in question was not unreasonable.  It was one that a magistrate could have authorized if presented with the facts.  The DEA agents, based on uncontradicted evidence that respondent was distributing a controlled substance from the vehicle, had abundant probable cause to enter and search the vehicle.  Pp.  471 U.

(a) When a vehicle is being used on the highways or is capable of such use and is found stationary in a place not regularly used for residential purposes, the two justifications for the vehicle exception come into play.  First, the vehicle is readily mobile, and, second, there is a reduced expectation of privacy stemming from the pervasive regulation of vehicles capable of traveling on highways.  Here, while respondent's vehicle possessed some attributes of a home, it clearly falls within the vehicle exception.  To distinguish between respondent's motor home and an ordinary sedan for purposes of the vehicle exception would require that the exception be applied depending on the size of the vehicle and the quality of its appointments.  Moreover, to fail to apply the exception to vehicles such as a motor home would ignore the fact that a motor home lends itself easily to use as an instrument of illicit drug traffic or other illegal activity.  Pp.  471 U. S. 390-394. 
Page 471 U. S. 387

(b) The search in question was not unreasonable.  It was one that a magistrate could have authorized if presented with the facts.  The DEA agents, based on uncontradicted evidence that respondent was distributing a controlled substance from the vehicle, had abundant probable cause to enter and search the vehicle.  Pp.  471 U. S. 394-395.

Syllabus 
At respondent's Tennessee state court trial for murder, the State relied on a confession that respondent made to the Sheriff.  Respondent testified that his confession was coercively derived from an accomplice's written confession, claiming that the Sheriff read from the accomplice's confession and directed respondent to say the same thing.  In rebuttal, the State called the Sheriff, who denied that respondent was read the accomplice's confession and who read that confession to the jury after the trial judge had instructed the jury that the confession was not admitted for the purpose of proving its truthfulness, but for the purpose of rebuttal only.  The prosecutor then elicited from the Sheriff testimony emphasizing the differences between respondent's confession and the accomplice's confession.  Respondent was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.  The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals reversed, holding that the introduction of the accomplice's confession denied respondent his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses, even though the confession was introduced for the nonhearsay purpose of rebutting respondent's testimony.
Held:  Respondent's rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment were not violated by the introduction of the accomplice's confession for rebuttal purposes.  Pp.  471 U. S. 413-417.
(a) The nonhearsay aspect of the accomplice's confession -- not to prove what happened at the murder scene but to prove what happened when respondent confessed -- raises no Confrontation Clause concerns.  The Clause's fundamental role in protecting the right of cross-examination was satisfied by the Sheriff's presence on the witness stand.  Pp.  471 U. S. 413-414.
(b) If the prosecutor had been denied the opportunity to present the accomplice's confession in rebuttal so as to enable the jury to make the relevant comparison with respondent's confession, the jury would have been impeded in evaluating the truth of respondent's testimony and in weighing the reliability of his confession.  Such a result would have been at odds with the Confrontation Clause's mission of advancing the accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials.  There were no alternatives that would have both assured the integrity of the trial's truth-seeking function and eliminated the risk of the jury's improper use of evidence.  Pp.  471 U. S. 414-416. 
Page 471 U. S. 410

(c) The trial judge's instructions to the jury as to the limited purpose of admitting the accomplice's confession were the appropriate way to limit the use of that evidence in a manner consistent with the Confrontation Clause.  P.  471 U. S. 417.

The federal statute governing food stamp fraud provides in 7 U.S.C.  2024(b)(1) that
""whoever knowingly uses, transfers, acquires, alters, or possesses coupons or authorization cards in any manner not authorized by [the statute] or the regulations""
shall be guilty of a criminal offense.  Petitioner was indicted for violation of  2024(b)(1).  At a jury trial in Federal District Court, the Government proved that petitioner on three occasions had purchased food stamps from an undercover Department of Agriculture agent for substantially less then their face value.  The court refused petitioner's proposed jury instruction that the Government must prove that petitioner knowingly did an act that the law forbids, purposely intending to violate the law.  Rather, over petitioner's objection, the court instructed the jury that the Government had to prove that petitioner acquired and possessed the food stamps in a manner not authorized by statute or regulations, and that he knowingly and willfully acquired the stamps.  Petitioner was convicted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Absent any indication of a contrary purpose in the statute's language or legislative history, the Government in a prosecution for violation of  2024(b)(1) must prove that the defendant knew that his acquisition or possession of food stamps was in a manner unauthorized by statute or regulations.  Pp.  471 U. S. 423-434.
(a) Criminal offenses requiring no mens rea have a generally disfavored status.  The failure of Congress explicitly and unambiguously to indicate whether mens rea is required does not signal a departure from this background assumption of our criminal law.  Moreover, to interpret the statute to dispense with mens rea would be to criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent conduct.  In addition, requiring mens rea in this case is in keeping with the established principle that ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.  Pp.  471 U. S. 425-428.
(b) The fact that  2024(c), which is directed primarily at stores authorized to accept food stamps from program participants, differs in wording and structure from  2024(b)(1), and provides that
""[w]hoever presents, or causes to be presented, coupons for payment or redemption . . . knowing the same to have been received, transferred, or used in any 
Page 471 U. S. 420
 manner in violation of [the statute] or the regulations,""
fails to show a congressional purpose not to require proof of the defendant's knowledge of illegality in a  2024(b)(1) prosecution.  Nor has it been shown that requiring knowledge of illegality in a  2024(c), but not a  2024(b)(1), prosecution is supported by such obvious and compelling policy reasons that it should be assumed that Congress intended to make such a distinction.

Syllabus 
Section 244(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows the Attorney General to suspend an alien's deportation if the alien has been present in the United States for a continuous period of at least seven years, is of good moral character, and demonstrates that deportation would result in extreme hardship to the alien or to the alien's spouse or child, who is a United States citizen.  Even if these prerequisites are satisfied, the Attorney General has discretion to refuse to suspend deportation.  While the Act itself does not provide for reopening suspension proceedings once suspension has been denied, the Attorney General has promulgated regulations under the Act providing that a motion to reopen will be denied unless reopening is sought on the basis of circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the original deportation hearing.  The Attorney General has delegated his authority and discretion to suspend deportation to special inquiry officers of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), whose decisions are subject to review by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).  Respondents husband and wife, citizens of Mexico, were smuggled illegally into the United States in 1974.  Respondent husband was apprehended in 1978, and, although at his request he was granted permission to return voluntarily to Mexico in lieu of deportation, he refused to leave as promised.  Deportation proceedings were then instituted against respondents, who by that time had a child, who, being born in the United States, was a United States citizen.  Following a December, 1978, hearing, an Immigration Judge denied respondents' request for suspension of deportation and ordered their deportation, and the BIA dismissed an appeal.  After the Court of Appeals in 1982 had reversed the BIA's decision and remanded the case for further proceedings because respondents had accrued the requisite seven years' presence in the United States during the pendency of the appeal, respondents moved the BIA to reopen and requested suspension of deportation, in the meantime having had a second child born in the United States.  The BIA denied the motion to reopen on the grounds, inter alia, that the seven years' presence and an additional child were available only because respondents had delayed departure by frivolous appeals, and that respondents' conduct had shown a blatant disregard for 
Page 471 U. S. 445
 the immigration laws.  The Court of Appeals reversed and directed the BIA to reopen the proceeding, holding, inter alia, that respondents had made out a prima facie case of hardship, and that the factors relied on by the BIA did not justify its refusal to reopen.
Held:  The refusal to reopen the suspension proceeding was within the Attorney General's discretion.  If, as was required by the regulations, respondents' motion to reopen was based on intervening circumstances demonstrating 7-year residence and extreme hardship, the Attorney General, acting through the BIA, nevertheless had the authority to deny the motion.  Although, by the time the BIA denied the motion, respondents had been in the United States for seven years, that was not the case when suspension of deportation was first denied; the seven years accrued during the pendency of respondents' baseless appeals.  And the Attorney General did not abuse his discretion in denying reopening based on respondents' flagrant violation of the immigration laws in entering the United States, as well as respondent husband's willful failure to depart voluntarily after his request to do so was honored by the INS.

In 1976, respondent pleaded guilty in Federal District Court to a charge of mail fraud, pursuant to a plea bargain whereby the Government agreed to recommend probation on condition that restitution be made.  However, the court disregarded the recommendation and sentenced respondent to six years of treatment and supervision under the Youth Corrections Act.  After serving 18 months of his sentence, he was arrested for parole violation, but, a few days before his arrest, he moved to withdraw his guilty plea or, in the alternative, to have his sentence vacated and be resentenced to the time already served, claiming that the Government had failed to comply with its part of the plea bargain.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Government had breached its plea bargain because, although the Assistant United States Attorney, at the sentencing hearing, had agreed with defense counsel's statement that the Government recommended probation with restitution, he did not explain his reasons for the recommendation, and left the impression of less than enthusiastic support for leniency.
Held:  The Court of Appeals misconceived the effect of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(e), which governs plea bargaining, and of the applicable case law.  Even assuming that the Government, in a particular case, may commit itself to make a certain recommendation to the sentencing court ""enthusiastically"" or to explain to the court its reasons for making the recommendation, there is no contention or finding that the Government had, in fact, undertaken to do either of such things here.  The Court of Appeals erred in holding that, under Rule 11(e), such an undertaking is to be implied as a matter of law from the Government's agreement to recommend a particular sentence.  There was simply no default on the Government's part here.

 PARK AVENUE INVESTMENT & DEVELOPMENT, INC., et al.v. Donald I. BARKHEIMER, II, et alNo. 84-1291 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 13, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the District Court of Appeal of Florida, Fourth District. 
 The motion of respondents for attorneys' fees and costs is denied. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Justice REHNQUIST and Justice O'CONNOR join. 
 I agree that we should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari, but I would also grant respondents' motion for costs and fees. This petition is an attempt to invoke the Court's jurisdiction on an utterly frivolous claim, and on this record I believe that the purpose of the petition is to delay collection of a debt. This use of the Court's processes should subject the attorney who filed the petition to the sanction of Rule 49.2 of this Court. [Footnote 1] 

 Park Avenue Investment & Development, Inc., was formed to develop and convert oceanfront buildings into time-share resorts. Petitioners solicited the respondents to invest in Park Avenue under a profit-sharing plan. Park Avenue later defaulted on its obligations under the profit- sharing plan. It then executed a series of promissory notes to the respondents for the deficiencies due under the plan, but defaulted on the notes as well. Respondents initiated five separate lawsuits to collect on the promissory notes. On September 17, 1981, the parties entered into a stipulation for the settlement of the lawsuits. The stipulation set out 
Page 471 U.S. 1108 , 1109
 the amounts petitioners owed to respondents and established a timetable for repayment. When Park Avenue failed to make any of the payments under the stipulation, respondents attempted to foreclose on their debts, but petitioners prevented them from doing so. 
 Respondents then filed suit in state court. In response to a motion for summary judgment filed by respondents, petitioners moved to set aside the stipulation on the ground that it was usurious and unenforceable under Florida's criminal usury statute, Fla.Stat. 687.071(7) (1983). The trial court denied petitioners' motion to set aside the stipulation, granted respondents' motion for summary judgment, and, a few weeks later, entered judgment for respondents. The court based its decisions on Gunn Plumbing, Inc. v. Dania Bank, 252 So.2d 1 (Fla.1971), in which the Florida Supreme Court held that ""usury is purely a personal defense created by statute for the protection of borrowers and, therefore, any borrower may waive his right to claim the benefit of such statute."" Id., at 4. The trial court held that the parties' stipulation constituted a waiver of whatever usury defense petitioners may have had to the promissory notes. 
 Petitioners appealed to the District Court of Appeal. That court affirmed in a per curiam order, simply citing Gunn Plumbing, supra, and Sherman v. Field Clinic, 74 Ill.App.3d 21, 29 Ill.Dec. 597, 392 N.E.2d 154 ( 1979). Petitioners then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Florida Supreme Court and at the same time attempted to take a direct appeal to that court, invoking its appellate jurisdiction on the obviously meritless ground that the District Court of Appeal had held 687.071(7) invalid as applied. See generally Fla. Const. Art. V, 3(b)(1). The State Supreme Court denied certiorari and dismissed the appeal. Petitioners then filed a motion for reinstatement of the appeal. The Florida Supreme Court denied this motion. 
 Petitioners next filed their petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court, asserting that the state courts' failure to apply 687.071(7) infringed their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioners' equal protection ""argument"" is raised here for the first time. In reviewing judgments of state courts, of course, we do not consider constitutional arguments that were not properly presented in the state courts. 
 Moreover, the claim is patently frivolous. Besides the wholly conclusory assertion that the decisions of the state courts have violated petitioners' right to equal protection, the arguments [471 U.S. 1108 , 1110]

 PARK AVENUE INVESTMENT & DEVELOPMENT, INC., et al.v. Donald I. BARKHEIMER, II, et alNo. 84-1291 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 13, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the District Court of Appeal of Florida, Fourth District. 
 The motion of respondents for attorneys' fees and costs is denied. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Justice REHNQUIST and Justice O'CONNOR join. 
 I agree that we should deny the petition for a writ of certiorari, but I would also grant respondents' motion for costs and fees. This petition is an attempt to invoke the Court's jurisdiction on an utterly frivolous claim, and on this record I believe that the purpose of the petition is to delay collection of a debt. This use of the Court's processes should subject the attorney who filed the petition to the sanction of Rule 49.2 of this Court. [Footnote 1] 

 Park Avenue Investment & Development, Inc., was formed to develop and convert oceanfront buildings into time-share resorts. Petitioners solicited the respondents to invest in Park Avenue under a profit-sharing plan. Park Avenue later defaulted on its obligations under the profit- sharing plan. It then executed a series of promissory notes to the respondents for the deficiencies due under the plan, but defaulted on the notes as well.

No. 83-1590
Argued November 28, 1984
Decided April 29, 1985
471 U.S. 307

Syllabus 
Respondent state prisoner, while attempting to escape after receiving treatment at a local dentist's office, shot and killed the resident of a nearby house with a stolen pistol when, at the moment the resident slammed the front door as respondent demanded the key to the resident's car, the pistol fired and a bullet pierced the door, hitting the resident in the chest.  Respondent was tried in Georgia Superior Court on a charge of malice murder.  His sole defense was a lack of the requisite intent to kill, claiming that the killing was an accident.  The trial judge instructed the jury on the issue of intent as follows:
""The acts of a person of sound mind and discretion are presumed to be the product of the person's will, but the presumption may be rebutted.  A person of sound mind and discretion is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts, but the presumption may be rebutted.  A person will not be presumed to act with criminal intention, but the trier of facts . . . may find criminal intention upon a consideration of the words, conduct, demeanor, motive and all of the circumstances connected with the act for which the accused is prosecuted.""
The jury was also instructed that the respondent was presumed innocent and that the State was required to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  The jury returned a guilty verdict, and respondent was sentenced to death.  After an unsuccessful appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court, and after exhausting state postconviction remedies, respondent sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court.  That court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the jury charge on intent could have been interpreted by a reasonable juror as a mandatory presumption that shifted to respondent a burden of persuasion on the intent element of the offense, and accordingly violated the Fourteenth Amendment due process guarantees set forth in Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510.
Held:  The instruction on intent, when read in the context of the jury charge as a whole, violated the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement that the State prove every element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  Sandstrom v. Montana, supra.  Pp.  471 U. S. 313-327.
(a) A jury instruction that creates a mandatory presumption whereby the jury must infer the presumed fact if the State proves certain predicate 
Page 471 U. S. 308
 facts violates the Due Process Clause if it relieves the State of the burden of persuasion on an element of an offense.  If a specific portion of the jury charge, considered in isolation, could reasonably have been understood as creating such a presumption, the potentially offending words must be considered in the context of the charge as a whole.  Pp.  471 U. S. 313-315.
(b) Here, a reasonable juror could have understood that the first two sentences of the instruction on intent created a mandatory presumption that shifted to respondent the burden of persuasion on the element of intent once the State had proved the predicate acts.  The fact that the jury was informed that the presumption ""may be rebutted"" does not cure the infirmity in the charge, since, when combined with the immediately preceding language, the instruction could be read as telling the jury that it was required to infer intent to kill as a natural and probable consequence of the act of firing the pistol unless respondent persuaded the jury that such an inference was unwarranted.  Pp.  471 U. S. 315-318.
(c) The general instructions as to the prosecution's burden and respondent's presumption of innocence did not dissipate the error in the challenged portion of the instruction on intent, because such instructions are not necessarily inconsistent with language creating a mandatory presumption of intent.  Nor did the more specific ""criminal intention"" instruction following the challenged sentences provide a sufficient corrective, since it may well be that it was not directed to the element of intent at all, but to another element of malice murder in Georgia -- the absence of provocation or justification.  That is, a reasonable juror may well have thought that the instructions related to different elements of the crime, and were therefore not contradictory -- that he could presume intent to kill, but not the absence of provocation or justification.  But even if a juror could have understood the ""criminal intention"" instruction as applying to the element of intent, that instruction did no more than contradict the immediately preceding instructions.  Language that merely contradicts, and does not explain, a constitutionally infirm instruction does not suffice to absolve the infirmity.  Pp.  471 U. S. 318-325.
(d) Whether or not Sandstrom error can ever be harmless, the constitutional infirmity in this jury charge was not harmless error, because intent was plainly at issue, and was not overwhelmingly proved by the evidence.  Pp.  471 U. S. 325-326.

No. 84-261
Argued March 19, 1985
Decided April 29, 1985
471 U.S. 343

Syllabus 
Petitioner filed a complaint in Federal District Court alleging violations of the Commodity Exchange Act by Chicago Discount Commodity Brokers (CDCB), and respondent Frank McGhee, acting as sole director and officer of CDCB, entered into a consent decree that resulted in the appointment of a receiver who was ultimately appointed trustee in bankruptcy after he filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy on behalf of CDCB.  Respondent Weintraub, CDCB's former counsel, appeared for a deposition pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum served by petitioner as part of its investigation of CDCB, but refused to answer certain questions, asserting CDCB's attorney-client privilege.  Petitioner then obtained a waiver of the privilege from the trustee as to any communications occurring on or before the date of his initial appointment as a receiver.  The District Court upheld a Magistrate's order directing Weintraub to testify, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a bankruptcy trustee does not have the power to waive a corporate debtor's attorney-client privilege with respect to communications that occurred before the filing of the bankruptcy petition.
Held:  The trustee of a corporation in bankruptcy has the power to waive the corporation's attorney-client privilege with respect to prebankruptcy communications.  Pp.  471 U. S. 348-358.
(a) The attorney-client privilege attaches to corporations as well as to individuals, and with regard to solvent corporations, the power to waive the privilege rests with the corporation's management, and is normally exercised by its officers and directors.  When control of the corporation passes to new management, the authority to assert and waive the privilege also passes, and the new managers may waive the privilege with respect to corporate communications made by former officers and directors.  Pp.  471 U. S. 348-349.
(b) The Bankruptcy Code does not explicitly address the question whether control of the privilege of a corporation in bankruptcy with respect to prebankruptcy communications passes to the bankruptcy trustee or, as respondents assert, remains with the debtor's directors.  Respondents' contention that the issue is controlled by  542(e) of the Code -- which provides that ""[s]ubject to any applicable privilege,"" the 
Page 471 U. S. 344
 court may order an attorney who holds recorded information relating to the debtor's property or financial affairs to disclose such information to the trustee -- is not supported by the statutory language or the legislative history.  Instead, the history makes clear that Congress intended the courts to deal with privilege questions.  Pp.  471 U. S. 349-351.
(c) The Code gives the trustee wide-ranging management authority over the debtor, whereas the powers of the debtor's directors are severely limited.  Thus, the trustee plays the role most closely analogous to that of a solvent corporation's management, and the directors should not exercise the traditional management function of controlling the corporation's privilege unless a contrary arrangement would be inconsistent with policies of the bankruptcy laws.  Pp.  471 U. S. 352-353.
(d) No federal interests would be impaired by the trustee's control of the corporation's attorney-client privilege with respect to prebankruptcy communications.  On the other hand, vesting such power in the directors would frustrate the Code's goal of empowering the trustee to uncover insider fraud and recover misappropriated corporate assets.  Pp.  471 U. S. 353-354.
(e) There is no merit to respondents' contention that the trustee should not obtain control over the privilege because, unlike the management of a solvent corporation, the trustee's primary loyalty goes not to shareholders, but to creditors.  When a trustee is appointed, the privilege must be exercised in accordance with the trustee's fiduciary duty to all interested parties.  Even though, in some cases, the trustee's exercise of the privilege will benefit only creditors, such a result is in keeping with the hierarchy of interests created by the bankruptcy laws.  Pp.  471 U. S. 354-356.
(f) Nor is there any merit to other arguments of respondents, including the contentions that giving the trustee control over the privilege would have an undesirable chilling effect on attorney-client communications, and would discriminate against insolvent corporations.  The chilling effect is no greater here than in the case of a solvent corporation, and, by definition, corporations in bankruptcy are treated differently from solvent corporations.  Pp.  471 U. S. 356-358.

Department of Education of Massachusetts
No. 84-433.
Argued March 26, 1985
Decided April 29, 1985
471 U.S. 359

Syllabus 
The Education of the Handicapped Act requires participating state and local educational agencies to assure that handicapped children and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of free appropriate public education for such children.  These procedures include the parents' right to participate in the development of an ""individualized education program"" (IEP) for the child and to challenge in administrative and court proceedings a proposed IEP with which they disagree.  With respect to judicial review, the Act in 20 U.S.C.  1415(e)(2) authorizes the reviewing court to ""grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.""  Section 1415(e)(3) provides that, during the pendency of any review proceedings, unless the state or local educational agency and the parents otherwise agree, ""the child shall remain in the then current educational placement of such child.""  Respondent father of a handicapped child rejected petitioner town's proposed IEP for the 1979-1980 school year calling for placement of the child in a certain public school, and sought review by respondent Massachusetts Department of Education's Bureau of Special Education Appeals (BSEA).  Meanwhile, the father, at his own expense, enrolled the child in a state-approved private school for special education.  The BSEA thereafter decided that the town's proposed IEP was inappropriate, and that the private school was better suited for the child's educational needs, and ordered the town to pay the child's expenses at the private school for the 1979-1980 school year.  The town then sought review in Federal District Court.  Ultimately, after the town in the meantime had agreed to pay for the child's private school placement for the 1980-1981 school year but refused to reimburse the father for the 1979-1980 school year as ordered by the BSEA, the court overturned the BSEA's decision, holding that the appropriate 1979-1980 placement was the one proposed in the IEP, and that the town was not responsible for the costs at the private school for the 1979-1980 through 1981-1982 school years.  The Court of Appeals, remanding, held that the father's unilateral change of the child's placement during the pendency of the 
Page 471 U. S. 360
 administrative proceedings would not be a bar to reimbursement if such change were held to be appropriate.
Held:
1. The grant of authority to a reviewing court under  1415(e)(2) includes the power to order school authorities to reimburse parents for their expenditures on private special education for a child if the court ultimately determines that such placement, rather than a proposed IEP, is proper under the Act.  The ordinary meaning of the language in  1415(e)(2) directing the court to ""grant such relief as [it] determines is appropriate"" confers broad discretion on the court.  To deny such reimbursement would mean that the child's right to a free appropriate public education, the parents' right to participate fully in developing a proper IEP, and all of the procedural safeguards of the Act would be less than complete.  Pp.  471 U. S. 369-371.
2. A parental violation of  1415(e)(3) by changing the ""then current educational placement"" of their child during the pendency of proceedings to review a challenged proposed IEP does not constitute a waiver of the parents' right to reimbursement for expenses of the private placement.

			"|"School Committee of the Town of Burlington v.
Department of Education of Massachusetts
No. 84-433.
Argued March 26, 1985
Decided April 29, 1985
471 U.S. 359

Syllabus 
The Education of the Handicapped Act requires participating state and local educational agencies to assure that handicapped children and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of free appropriate public education for such children.  These procedures include the parents' right to participate in the development of an ""individualized education program"" (IEP) for the child and to challenge in administrative and court proceedings a proposed IEP with which they disagree.  With respect to judicial review, the Act in 20 U.S.C.  1415(e)(2) authorizes the reviewing court to ""grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.""  Section 1415(e)(3) provides that, during the pendency of any review proceedings, unless the state or local educational agency and the parents otherwise agree, ""the child shall remain in the then current educational placement of such child.""  Respondent father of a handicapped child rejected petitioner town's proposed IEP for the 1979-1980 school year calling for placement of the child in a certain public school, and sought review by respondent Massachusetts Department of Education's Bureau of Special Education Appeals (BSEA).  Meanwhile, the father, at his own expense, enrolled the child in a state-approved private school for special education.  The BSEA thereafter decided that the town's proposed IEP was inappropriate, and that the private school was better suited for the child's educational needs, and ordered the town to pay the child's expenses at the private school for the 1979-1980 school year.  The town then sought review in Federal District Court.  Ultimately, after the town in the meantime had agreed to pay for the child's private school placement for the 1980-1981 school year but refused to reimburse the father for the 1979-1980 school year as ordered by the BSEA, the court overturned the BSEA's decision, holding that the appropriate 1979-1980 placement was the one proposed in the IEP, and that the town was not responsible for the costs at the private school for the 1979-1980 through 1981-1982 school years.  The Court of Appeals, remanding, held that the father's unilateral change of the child's placement during the pendency of the 
Page 471 U. S. 360
 administrative proceedings would not be a bar to reimbursement if such change were held to be appropriate.
Held:
1. The grant of authority to a reviewing court under  1415(e)(2) includes the power to order school authorities to reimburse parents for their expenditures on private special education for a child if the court ultimately determines that such placement, rather than a proposed IEP, is proper under the Act.  The ordinary meaning of the language in  1415(e)(2) directing the court to ""grant such relief as [it] determines is appropriate"" confers broad discretion on the court.  To deny such reimbursement would mean that the child's right to a free appropriate public education, the parents' right to participate fully in developing a proper IEP, and all of the procedural safeguards of the Act would be less than complete.  Pp.  471 U. S. 369-371.
2. A parental violation of  1415(e)(3) by changing the ""then current educational placement"" of their child during the pendency of proceedings to review a challenged proposed IEP does not constitute a waiver of the parents' right to reimbursement for expenses of the private placement.  Otherwise, the parents would be forced to leave the child in what may turn out to be an inappropriate educational placement or to obtain the appropriate placement only by sacrificing any claim for reimbursement.  But if the courts ultimately determine that the proposed IEP was appropriate, the parents would be barred from obtaining reimbursement for any interim period in which their child's placement violated  1415(e)(3).  Pp.  471 U. S. 371-374.

 Virgil Raymond CATLETT, III, et al. petitioners,v. UNITED STATESNo. 84-1209 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 29, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 Petitioners were convicted and fined for hunting doves in a ""baited"" field contrary to the Federal Migratory Bird Act, 16 U.S.C. 703, and the regulations issued thereunder, despite their claim that they were unaware of the baiting and that they could not reasonably have been aware of it, since the remaining bait on the property was hidden from view at the time of the hunt. 
 The Court of Appeals affirmed, observing that petitioners ""were apparently unaware of, and had not participated in, the baiting of the field."" 747 F.2d 1102, 1103 (CA6 1984). Nonetheless, the panel applied prior law of the Circuit to hold that scienter is not an element of the crime charged, and thus that petitioners could be convicted even if they could not have reasonably known that the field was baited. 
 The rule applied is that adopted by several Circuits, reading the regulation in question to impose strict liability on those who hunt over baited fields. See, e.g., United States v. Chandler, 753 F.2d 360, 363 ( CA4 1985); United States v. Brandt, 717 F.2d 955, 958-959 (CA6 1983); United States v. Jarman, 491 F.2d 764, 766-767 (CA4 1974); Rogers v. United States, 367 F.2d 998, 1001 (CA8 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 943 (1967). Nevertheless, as the Court of Appeals below recognized, the rule applied here is contrary to the holding of a case from another Federal Circuit which requires proof of at least the minimum scienter, that hunters should have known of the baited condition. United States v. Delahoussaye, 573 F.2d 910, 912 (CA5 1978). 
Page 471 U.S. 1074 , 1075
 There is a clear and recognized division between Circuits on the elements of a federal criminal offense. As the court explained in Delahoussaye, the regulation at issue here ""is a national one, founded on a treaty, and [it] should not mean one thing in one state and another elsewhere."" Id, at 913. I would grant certiorari to resolve the split among the Courts of Appeals.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act limits the time for filing an unfair labor practice charge with the National 
Page 471 U.S. 1075 , 1076
 Labor Relations Board. It provides that ""no complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board and the service of a copy thereof upon the person against whom such charge is made."" 29 U.S.C. 160(b). The plain words require that a charge be both filed and served within six months of the challenged conduct, and such has long been the Board's interpretation. See, e.g., Old Colony Box Co., 81 N.L.R.B. 1025, 1027 ( 1949). Service may be accomplished merely by mailing a copy of the charge . See 29 CFR 102.113(a) (1984). 
 In DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151 (1983), we held that 10(b) governs an employee's suit against his employer for breach of contract and his union for breach of its duty of fair representation. We did not discuss whether that section's requirement of service, as well as filing, within the 6-month period also applies in such a suit. That is the question raised in this petition. 
 The Kroger Co. (Kroger) discharged petitioner on February 18, 1982. Grievance procedures were unsuccessful, and on July 6, 1982, the union notified petitioner that it would not proceed to arbitration. The following January 3, just within the 6-month period, petitioner filed this 301 action in Federal District Court. See 29 U.S.C. 185. On January 12, after the 6-month period had run, he served a copy of the complaint on Kroger; and on January 25 he served the union. Applying DelCostello, and relying on the plain words of 10(b), the District Court granted both defendants' motions for summary judgment on the ground that the action was time-barred. It also found that petitioner had not filed a timely response to Kroger's motion for summary judgment and that under a local rule he would be deemed not to oppose it. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 743 F.2d 1544 (1984). Referring to the ""intent, spirit, and plain language of section 10(b),"" it held that a 301 complaint must be both filed and served within the 6-month period. Id., at 1546. It also found that the District Court had properly applied its local rule in treating Kroger's motion for summary judgment as unopposed. 
 The lower courts agree that a suit in federal court on a federal cause of action is commenced, and the statute of limitations tolled, upon the filing of the complaint. See, e.g., Hobson v. Wilson, 237 U.S.App.D.C. 219, 262, 737 F.2d 1, 44 (1984); Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 3; 2 J. Moore & J. Lucas, Moore's Federal Practice [471 U.S. 1075 , 1077]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner sued respondent prison officials in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging the use of excessive force in preventing his escape from Holmesburg County Prison in Philadelphia and the denial of access to legal assistance. Respondents prevailed on both claims. At trial, the District Court permitted respondents' counsel to prove that petitioner had been convicted of murder, bank robbery, attempted prison escape, and criminal conspiracy within the 10 years preceding the date of trial. In so doing the trial judge relied on Rule 609(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which provides that evidence of such felony convictions "" shall be admitted"" to attack the credibility ""of a witness,"" if ""the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant."" 1 The trial judge interpreted the Rule to require the evidence to be admitted since the Rule's provision for assessing the prejudicial import of the evidence applied only in regard to the defendant, not to a plaintiff witness against whom such evidence was sought to be introduced. Moreover, under the trial judge's view, Rule 609( a) precluded any resort to the balancing test of Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which permits the exclusion of relevant evidence if its probative value is ""substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.""2 [ Diggs v. Lyons 471 U.S. 1078 (1985) ][1078-Continued.] 
Page 471 U.S. 1078 , 1079
 A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed on appeal. 741 F.2d 577 (1984). The Court of Appeals found the District Court's interpretation of Rule 609(a) to be strongly supported by the Rule's legislative history. Although acknowledging that congressional attention in enacting the Rule had been focused largely on criminal cases and on the defendants in those cases, the Court of Appeals concluded that its broad language was nevertheless applicable to a civil case such as the one before it. And, like the District Court, the Court of Appeals held that Rule 403 had no application where, as here, a more specific rule of admissibility applied. Admission of prior convictions to impeach a plaintiff witness in a civil case was therefore mandatory. The Court of Appeals recognized that this reading of the Rule ""may in some cases produce unjust and even bizarre results,"" but suggested that the remedy lay with ""those who have the authority to amend the rules, the Supreme Court and the Congress."" Id., at 582.3 
 As the Court of Appeals recognized, its reading of Rule 609(a) directly conflicts with the interpretation of two other Circuits. Both the Eighth Circuit and the Fifth Circuit have ruled that, assuming the applicability of Rule 609(a) to civil cases, it does not relieve courts of the duty to assess the prejudicial effect of evidence of prior convictions against a plaintiff witness under Rule 403. See Czajka v. Hickman, 703 F.2d 317 (CA8 1983); Shows v. M/V Red Eagle, 695 F.2d 114 (CA5 1983). This disagreement concerning the Rule's meaning now affects litigants in three large Circuits, and the issue will undoubtedly arise elsewhere before long . See Furtado v.

 Rehearing Denied June 24, 1985. 
 See 472 U.S. 1033. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Louisiana. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 The petitioner Jimmy L. Glass has been condemned to death by electrocution-""that is, causing to pass through the body of the person convicted a current of electricity of sufficient intensity to cause death, and the application and continuance of such current through the body of the person convicted until such person is dead."" La.Rev.Stat.Ann. 15: 569 (West 1981). Glass contends that ""electrocution causes the gratuitous infliction of unnecessary pain and suffering and does not comport with evolving standards of human dignity,"" [ Glass v. Louisiana 471 U.S. 1080 (1985) ][1080-Continued.] 
and that this method of officially sponsored execution therefore violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Pet. for Cert. 27. The Supreme Court of Louisiana held that this claim must summarily be rejected pursuant to ""clearly established principles of law"" and observed that, in any event, the claim is wholly lacking in medical or scientific merit. 455 So.2d 659, 660, 671 (1984).

Kemmler, however, was grounded on a number of constitutional premises that have long since been rejected and on factual assumptions that appear not to have withstood the test of experience. I believe the time has come to measure electrocution against well-established contemporary Eighth Amendment principles. [471 U.S. 1080 , 1082]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 29, 1985
 Rehearing Denied June 24, 1985. 
 See 472 U.S. 1033. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Louisiana. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 The petitioner Jimmy L. Glass has been condemned to death by electrocution-""that is, causing to pass through the body of the person convicted a current of electricity of sufficient intensity to cause death, and the application and continuance of such current through the body of the person convicted until such person is dead."" La.Rev.Stat.Ann. 15: 569 (West 1981). Glass contends that ""electrocution causes the gratuitous infliction of unnecessary pain and suffering and does not comport with evolving standards of human dignity,"" [ Glass v. Louisiana 471 U.S. 1080 (1985) ][1080-Continued.] 
and that this method of officially sponsored execution therefore violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Pet. for Cert. 27.

No. 83-1935
Argued March 25, 1985
Decided April 23, 1985
471 U.S. 290

Syllabus 
Petitioner Foundation is a nonprofit religious organization that derives its income largely from the operation of commercial businesses staffed by the Foundation's ""associates,"" most of whom were drug addicts, derelicts, or criminals before their rehabilitation by the Foundation.  These workers receive no cash salaries, but the Foundation provides them with food, clothing, shelter, and other benefits.  The Secretary of Labor filed an action in Federal District Court against the Foundation and petitioner officers thereof, alleging violations of the minimum wage, overtime, and recordkeeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (Act).  The District Court held that the Foundation was an ""enterprise"" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C.  203(r), which defines that term as ""the related activities performed . . . by any person or persons for a common business purpose,"" that the Foundation's businesses serve the general public in competition with ordinary commercial enterprises, and that, under the ""economic reality"" test of employment, the associates were ""employees"" of the Foundation protected by the Act.  The court rejected petitioners' arguments that application of the Act to the Foundation violated the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed as to liability.
Held:
1. The Foundation's businesses constitute an ""enterprise"" within the meaning of the Act, and are not beyond the Act's reach because of the Foundation's religious character.  This Court has consistently construed the Act liberally in recognition that broad coverage is essential to accomplish the goal of outlawing from interstate commerce goods produced under conditions that fall below minimum standards of decency.  The Act contains no express or implied exception for commercial activities conducted by religious or other nonprofit organizations, and the Labor Department has consistently interpreted the Act to reach such businesses.  And this interpretation is supported by the legislative history.  Pp.  471 U. S. 295-299.
2. The Foundation's associates are ""employees"" within the meaning of the Act, because they work in contemplation of compensation.  Walling v. Portland Terminal Co., 330 U. S. 148, distinguished.  The fact that 
Page 471 U. S. 291
 the associates themselves protest coverage under the Act is not dispositive, since the test of employment under the Act is one of ""economic reality.""  And the fact that the compensation is primarily in the form of benefits, rather than cash, is immaterial in this context, such benefits simply being wages in another form.  Pp.  471 U. S. 299-303.
3. Application of the Act to the Foundation does not infringe on rights protected by the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.  The Free Exercise Clause does not require an exemption from a governmental program unless, at a minimum, inclusion in the program actually burdens the claimant's freedom to exercise religious rights.  Here, since the Act does not require the payment of cash wages and the associates received wages in the form of benefits in exchange for working in the Foundation's businesses, application of the Act works little or no change in the associates' situation; they may simply continue to be paid in the form of benefits.  But even if they were paid in cash and their religious beliefs precluded them from accepting the statutory amount, there is nothing in the Act to prevent them from voluntarily returning the amounts to the Foundation.  And since the Act's recordkeeping requirements apply only to commercial activities undertaken with a ""business purpose,"" they would have no impact on petitioners' own evangelical activities or on individuals engaged in volunteer work for other religious organizations.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 22, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 In 1982, the city of Norfolk sought permission from the Army Corps of Engineers to construct a 298-slip marina at the site of an abandoned ferry and near two existing marinas. [ Gee v. Boyd 471 U.S. 1058 (1985) ][1058-Continued.] 
The Corps issued an ""environmental assessment"" 1 concerning the project, which concluded that the socioeconomic benefits of the project outweighed its likely adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem. The Corps further concluded that the project would not ""significantly affect . . . the quality of the human environment,"" see 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C), thereby making unnecessary the preparation of an environmental impact statement ( EIS). On the same day, the Corps issued a permit to the city clearing the project. 
 Petitioner, a partner in a venture that owns property near the site of the proposed marina, subsequently filed suit, challenging, inter alia, the Corps' failure to prepare an EIS.2 The District Court granted summary judgment to respondents and denied petitioner's cross-motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, like the District Court, employed an ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard in reviewing the agency's determination that the proposed marina would have no significant effect on the environment. Gee v. Hudson, 746 F.2d 1471 ( 1984). See also Webb v. Gorsuch, 699 F.2d 157, 160 (CA4 1983); Providence Road Community Assn. v. EPA, 683 F.2d 80, 82 (CA4 1982). The court held that neither this finding, nor the agency's failure to consider the effect of possible future marinas on the environment, was arbitrary or capricious. 
Page 471 U.S. 1058 , 1059
 The decision below is the most recent in a long line of cases that have used divergent standards of review to assess an agency's failure to prepare an EIS. The First, Second, and Seventh Circuits, like the Fourth, will reverse such agency action only if it is arbitrary or capricious. See Grazing Fields Farm v. Goldschmidt, 626 F.2d 1068, 1072 (CA1 1980); Hanly v. Kleindienst, 471 F.2d 823, 828-829 (CA2 1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 908 (1973); Nucleus of Chicago Homeowners Assn. v. Lynn, 524 F.2d 225, 229 (CA7 1975), cert. denied sub nom. Nucleus of Chicago Homeowners Assn. v. Hill, 424 U.S. 967 (1976). Four other Circuits have employed a "" reasonableness"" standard of review. See Save Our Ten Acres v. Kreger, 472 F.2d 463, 466 (CA5 1973); Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska v. Ray, 621 F.2d 269, 271 (CA8), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 836 ( 1980); Foundation for North American Wild Sheep v.

Butz, 484 F.2d 1244, 1248-1249 (CA10 1973).3 The Third Circuit has assumed, without deciding, that a ""reasonableness"" standard is appropriate, Township of Lower Alloways Creek v. Public Service Electric & Gas Co., 687 F.2d 732, 741-742 (CA3 1982), and the Sixth Circuit has similarly declined to choose between the two standards. Boles v. Onton Dock, Inc., 659 F.2d 74, 75 (CA6 1981). The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has developed a four-part test to determine whether the agency action is arbitrary and capricious.

|471 u.s. 234|"Webb v. Board of Education of Dyer County, Tennessee
No. 83-1360
Argued October 29, 1984
Decided April 17, 1985
471 U.S. 234

Syllabus 
After respondent Board of Education of Dyer County, Tennessee, terminated petitioner's employment as a schoolteacher in 1974, he retained counsel to represent him in administrative proceedings before the Board.  Petitioner contended, inter alia, that his discharge was racially motivated and that his constitutional rights had been violated.  In 1978, the Board ultimately decided to adhere to its decision.  In 1979, petitioner instituted this action in Federal District Court, seeking relief under various civil rights statutes, including 42 U.S.C.  1983.  The case was subsequently settled in 1981 by the entry of a consent order awarding petitioner damages and other relief, and reserving the matter of an award of attorney's fees for future resolution by the parties or by the court.  After negotiations proved unsuccessful, petitioner filed a motion for an award of fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.  1988, which provides that, ""[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce"" certain statutes, including  1983, ""the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.""  The District Court awarded a fee, but rejected petitioner's contention that it should cover services performed by counsel in the administrative proceedings.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Petitioner is not entitled to a fee award for counsel's services during the Board hearings on the theory that they were ""proceeding[s] to enforce""  1983 within the meaning of  1988.  The reasoning in New York Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, 447 U. S. 54 which held that a provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorized fees for counsel's work performed pursuing a state administrative remedy -- is not applicable, since the statute involved in Carey expressly required the claimant to pursue state administrative remedies before commencing proceedings in a federal forum, whereas there is no comparable requirement in  1983.  Cf. Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992.  The Board proceedings here simply do not have the same integral function under  1983 that state administrative proceedings have under Title VII.  Pp.  471 U. S. 240-241. 
Page 471 U. S. 235

2. Nor is petitioner entitled to recover on the theory that the time spent by counsel in the Board proceedings was ""reasonably expended"" in preparation for the court action, and therefore compensable under the rationale of Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424.  The Court in Hensley emphasized that the amount to be awarded under  1988 necessarily depends on the facts of each case, and that the exercise of discretion by the district court must be respected.  The time that is compensable under  1988 is that ""reasonably expended on the litigation.""  Id. at  461 U. S. 433 (emphasis added).  In this case, there is no difficulty in identifying the dividing line between the administrative proceedings and the judicial proceeding.  Petitioner did not suggest that any discrete portion of the work product from the administrative proceedings was work that was both useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the civil rights litigation to the stage it reached before settlement.  Thus, the District Court's decision to deny any fees for time spent between 1974 and 1979 pursuing optional administrative remedies was well within the range of reasonable discretion.  Pp.  471 U. S. 241-244.
715 F.2d 254, affirmed.
STEVENS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and WHITE, POWELL, REHNQUIST, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined.  BRENNAN, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which BLACKMUN, J., joined, post, p.  471 U. S. 244.

2. Nor is petitioner entitled to recover on the theory that the time spent by counsel in the Board proceedings was ""reasonably expended"" in preparation for the court action, and therefore compensable under the rationale of Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424.  The Court in Hensley emphasized that the amount to be awarded under  1988 necessarily depends on the facts of each case, and that the exercise of discretion by the district court must be respected.  The time that is compensable under  1988 is that ""reasonably expended on the litigation.""  Id. at  461 U. S. 433 (emphasis added).  In this case, there is no difficulty in identifying the dividing line between the administrative proceedings and the judicial proceeding.  Petitioner did not suggest that any discrete portion of the work product from the administrative proceedings was work that was both useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the civil rights litigation to the stage it reached before settlement.  Thus, the District Court's decision to deny any fees for time spent between 1974 and 1979 pursuing optional administrative remedies was well within the range of reasonable discretion.  Pp.  471 U. S. 241-244.

Syllabus 
Respondent brought an action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioners, a New Mexico State Police officer and the Chief of the State Police, seeking damages for deprivation of respondent's constitutional rights allegedly caused by an unlawful arrest and brutal beating by the officer.  The complaint was filed two years and nine months after the claim purportedly arose.  Petitioners moved to dismiss on the ground that the action was barred by the 2-year statute of limitations of the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.  The District Court denied the motion, holding that the New Mexico statute providing a 4-year limitations period for ""all other actions not herein otherwise provided for"" applied to  1983 actions brought in the State.  On an interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of the motion to dismiss, but held that the appropriate statute of limitations for  1983 actions brought in New Mexico was the New Mexico statute providing a 3-year limitations period for personal injury actions.
Held:  Section 1983 claims are best characterized as personal injury actions, and hence the Court of Appeals correctly applied the 3-year statute of limitations applicable to such actions.  Pp.  471 U. S. 266-280.
(a) Federal rather than state law governs the characterization of a  1983 claim for statute of limitations purposes.  This conclusion is supported by the federal interest in uniformity and the interest in having firmly defined, easily applied rules.  The language of 42 U.S.C.  1988 that the law to be applied in adjudicating civil rights claims shall be in ""conformity with the laws of the United States, so far as such laws are suitable,"" directs that the matter of characterization should be treated as a federal question.  Only the length of the limitations period, and related questions of tolling and application, are to be governed by state law.  This interpretation is also supported by the instruction in  1988 that state law shall only apply ""so far as the same is not inconsistent with"" federal law.  Pp.  471 U. S. 268-271.
(b) A simple, broad characterization of all  1983 claims for statute of limitation purposes, rather than differing evaluations depending upon the varying factual circumstances and legal theories presented in each case, best fits the statute's remedial purposes.  The statute is fairly construed as a directive to select, in each State, the one most appropriate statute of limitations for all  1983 claims.  The federal interests in 
Page 471 U. S. 262
 uniformity, certainty, and the minimization of unnecessary litigation all support the conclusion that Congress favored such a simple approach.  Pp.  471 U. S. 271-275.
(c) In this case, the characterization of the  1983 claim as a personal injury action for statute of limitations purposes is supported by the nature of the  1983 remedy and by the federal interest in ensuring that the borrowed limitations period not discriminate against the federal civil rights remedy.  The characterization of all  1983 actions as involving claims for personal injuries minimizes the risk that the choice of a state statute of limitations would not fairly serve the federal interests vindicated by 1983.

No. 83-1075
Argued December 4, 1984
Decided April 16, 1985*
Syllabus 
Between 1953 and 1966, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) financed a research project, code-named MKULTRA, that was established to counter Soviet and Chinese advances in brainwashing and interrogation techniques.  Subprojects were contracted out to various universities, research foundations, and similar institutions.  In 1977, respondents in No. 83-1075 (hereafter respondents) filed a request with the CIA under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), seeking, inter alia, the names of the institutions and individuals who had performed the research under MKULTRA.  Citing Exemption 3 of the FOIA -- which provides that an agency need not disclose
""matters that are . . . specifically exempted from disclosure by statute . . . provided that such statute . . . refers to particular types of matters to be withheld""
-- the CIA declined to disclose the requested information.  The CIA invoked, as the exempting statute referred to in Exemption 3,  102(d)(3) of the National Security Act of 1947, which states that
""the Director of Central Intelligence shall be responsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.""
Respondents then filed suit under the FOIA in Federal District Court.  Applying, as directed by the Court of Appeals on an earlier appeal, a definition of ""intelligence sources"" as meaning only those sources to which the CIA had to guarantee confidentiality in order to obtain the information, the District Court held that the identities of researchers who had received express guarantees of confidentiality need not be disclosed, and also exempted from disclosure other researchers on the ground that their work for the CIA, apart from MKULTRA, required that their identities remain secret.  The court further held that there was no need to disclose the institutional affiliations of the individual researchers whose identities were exempt from disclosure.  The Court of Appeals affirmed this latter holding, but reversed the District Court's ruling with respect to which individual researchers satisfied ""the need-for-confidentiality"" aspect of its formulation 
Page 471 U. S. 160
 of exempt ""intelligence sources.""  The Court of Appeals held that it was error automatically to exempt from disclosure those researchers to whom confidentiality had been promised, and that an individual qualifies as an ""intelligence source"" exempt from disclosure under the FOIA only when the CIA offers sufficient proof that it needs to protect its efforts in confidentiality in order to obtain the type of information provided by the researcher.
Held:
1. Section 102(d)(3) qualifies as a withholding statute under Exemption 3.  Section 102(d)(3) clearly refers to ""particular types of matters"" within the meaning of Exemption 3.  Moreover, the FOIA's legislative history confirms that Congress intended  102(d)(3) to be a withholding statute under that Exemption.  And the plain meaning of  102(d)(3)'s language, as well as the National Security Act's legislative history, indicates that Congress vested in the Director of Central Intelligence broad authority to protect all sources of intelligence information from disclosure.  To narrow this authority by limiting the definition of ""intelligence sources"" to sources to which the CIA had to guarantee confidentiality in order to obtain the information not only contravenes Congress' express intention but also overlooks the practical necessities of modern intelligence gathering.  Pp.  471 U. S. 166-173.
2. MKULTRA researchers are protected ""intelligence sources"" within  102(d)(3)'s broad meaning, because they provided, or were engaged to provide, information that the CIA needed to fulfill its statutory obligations with respect to foreign intelligence.  To force the CIA to disclose a source whenever a court determines, after the fact, that the CIA could have obtained the kind of information supplied without promising confidentiality, could have a devastating impact on the CIA's ability to carry out its statutory mission.  The record establishes that the MKULTRA researchers did in fact provide the CIA with information related to its intelligence function, and therefore the Director was authorized to withhold these researchers' identities from disclosure under the FOIA.  Pp.  471 U. S. 173-177.
3. The FOIA does not require the Director to disclose the institutional affiliations of the exempt researchers.  This conclusion is supported by the record.  The Director reasonably concluded that an observer who is knowledgeable about a particular intelligence research project, such as MKULTRA, could, upon learning that the research was performed at a certain institution, deduce the identities of the protected individual researchers.  Pp.  471 U. S. 177-181.

The Tribal Council of respondent Navajo Tribe enacted ordinances imposing taxes on the value of leasehold interests in tribal lands and on receipts from the sale of property produced or extracted or the sale of services within those lands.  Petitioner, a mineral lessee on the Navajo Reservation, brought an action in Federal District Court, claiming that the taxes were invalid without approval of the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary).  The District Court agreed, and enjoined the Tribe from enforcing the tax laws against petitioner.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that no federal statute or principle of law mandated approval by the Secretary.
Held:  The Secretary's approval of the taxes in question is not required.  Pp. 471 U. S. 198-201.
(a) While  16 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 requires a tribal constitution written under the Act to be approved by the Secretary, the Act does not require the constitution to condition the power to tax on the Secretary's approval.  In any event, the Act does not govern tribes, like the Navajo, that declined to accept its provisions.  And there is nothing to indicate that Congress intended to recognize as legitimate only those tribal taxes authorized by constitutions written under the Act.  Pp. 471 U. S. 198-199.
(b) Nor does the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 require the Secretary's approval of the Navajo taxes.  While  4 of the Act subjects mineral leases issued under the Act to regulations promulgated by the Secretary, the regulations have not required that tribal taxes on mineral production be submitted for his approval.  In enacting  4, Congress could properly make a distinction between a tribe acting as a commercial partner in selling the right to use its land for mineral production and acting as a sovereign in imposing taxes on activities within its jurisdiction.  And even assuming that the Secretary could review tribal taxes on mineral production, it does not follow that he must do so.  Pp.  471 U. S. 199-200.
(c) Nor do statutes requiring the Secretary's supervision in other contexts indicate that Congress has limited the Navajo Tribal Council's authority to tax non-Indians.  The power to tax members and non-members

Syllabus 
The bad-faith handling of an insurance claim, including a claim under a disability insurance plan included in a collective bargaining agreement, is a tort under Wisconsin law.  Petitioner and a labor union, of which respondent employee of petitioner is a member, are parties to a collective bargaining agreement that incorporates a self-funded disability plan administered by an insurance company and providing benefits for nonoccupational injuries to employees.  The agreement establishes a disability grievance procedure that culminates in final and binding arbitration.  Respondent, after suffering a nonoccupational injury, entered into a dispute over the manner in which petitioner and the insurer handled his disability claim.  Rather than utilizing the grievance procedure, respondent brought a tort suit against petitioner and the insurer in a Wisconsin state court, alleging bad faith in the handling of his claim and seeking damages.  The trial court ruled in favor of petitioner and the insurer, holding that respondent had stated a claim under  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, which provides that suits for violations of collective bargaining agreements may be brought in federal district court.  In the alternative, if the claim were deemed to arise under state law, rather than  301, it was preempted by federal labor law.  The Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed, holding that the claim did not arise under  301 as constituting a violation of a labor contract, but was a tort claim of bad faith.  The court reasoned that, under Wisconsin law, the tort of bad faith is distinguishable from a bad-faith breach-of-contract claim, and that, although a breach of duty is imposed as a consequence of the relationship established by contract, it is independent from that contract.
Held:  When resolution of a state law claim is substantially dependent upon analysis of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, that claim must either be treated as a  301 claim or dismissed as preempted by federal labor contract law.  Here, respondent's claim should have been dismissed for failure to make use of the grievance procedure or as preempted by  301.  The right asserted by respondent is rooted in contract, and the bad faith claim could have been pleaded as a contract claim under  301.  Unless federal law governs that claim, the meaning of the disability benefit provisions of the collective bargaining agreement 
Page 471 U. S. 203
 would be subject to varying interpretations, and the congressional goal of a unified body of labor contract law would be subverted.  Preemption is also necessary to preserve the central role of arbitration in the resolution of labor disputes.  Pp.  471 U. S. 208-221.

No. 83-1748
Argued January 16, 1985
Decided April 16, 1985
471 U.S. 202

Syllabus 
The bad-faith handling of an insurance claim, including a claim under a disability insurance plan included in a collective bargaining agreement, is a tort under Wisconsin law.  Petitioner and a labor union, of which respondent employee of petitioner is a member, are parties to a collective bargaining agreement that incorporates a self-funded disability plan administered by an insurance company and providing benefits for nonoccupational injuries to employees.  The agreement establishes a disability grievance procedure that culminates in final and binding arbitration.  Respondent, after suffering a nonoccupational injury, entered into a dispute over the manner in which petitioner and the insurer handled his disability claim.  Rather than utilizing the grievance procedure, respondent brought a tort suit against petitioner and the insurer in a Wisconsin state court, alleging bad faith in the handling of his claim and seeking damages.  The trial court ruled in favor of petitioner and the insurer, holding that respondent had stated a claim under  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, which provides that suits for violations of collective bargaining agreements may be brought in federal district court.  In the alternative, if the claim were deemed to arise under state law, rather than  301, it was preempted by federal labor law.  The Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed, holding that the claim did not arise under  301 as constituting a violation of a labor contract, but was a tort claim of bad faith.  The court reasoned that, under Wisconsin law, the tort of bad faith is distinguishable from a bad-faith breach-of-contract claim, and that, although a breach of duty is imposed as a consequence of the relationship established by contract, it is independent from that contract.
Held:  When resolution of a state law claim is substantially dependent upon analysis of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, that claim must either be treated as a  301 claim or dismissed as preempted by federal labor contract law.  Here, respondent's claim should have been dismissed for failure to make use of the grievance procedure or as preempted by  301.  The right asserted by respondent is rooted in contract, and the bad faith claim could have been pleaded as a contract claim under  301.  Unless federal law governs that claim, the meaning of the disability benefit provisions of the collective bargaining agreement 
Page 471 U. S. 203
 would be subject to varying interpretations, and the congressional goal of a unified body of labor contract law would be subverted.  Preemption is also necessary to preserve the central role of arbitration in the resolution of labor disputes.  Pp.  471 U. S. 208-221.

Syllabus 
Article VIII,  182, of the Alabama Constitution of 1901 provides for the disenfranchisement of persons convicted of certain enumerated felonies and misdemeanors, including ""any . . . crime involving moral turpitude.""  Appellees, one of whom is black and the other white, were disenfranchised by County Registrars under  182 because each had been convicted of the misdemeanor of presenting a worthless check, determined by the Registrars to be a crime involving moral turpitude.  Appellees brought an action in Federal District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief.  The case was tried on a claim, inter alia, that the misdemeanors encompassed within  182 were intentionally adopted to disenfranchise blacks on account of race, and that their inclusion in  182 has had the intended effect.  The District Court found that disenfranchisement of blacks was a major purpose for the Convention at which the Alabama Constitution of 1901 was adopted, but that there was no showing that  182 was based upon racism, and that proof of an impermissible motive for  182 would not warrant its invalidation in face of the permissible motive of disenfranchising those convicted of crimes.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, under the evidence, discriminatory intent was a motivating factor in adopting  182, that there could be no finding of a permissible intent, that, accordingly, it would not have been adopted in the absence of the racially discriminatory motivation, and that the section, as applied to misdemeanants, violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court also implicitly found the evidence of discriminatory impact indisputable.
Held:  Section 182 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252.  That  182 may have been adopted to discriminate against poor whites as well as against blacks would not render nugatory the purpose to discriminate against blacks, it being clear that the latter was a ""but-for"" motivation for adopting  182.  There is no evidence that the disenfranchisement of those convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude was a motivating purpose of the 1901 Convention.  Events occurring since  182 was adopted cannot validate the section.  Nor can the Tenth Amendment save legislation prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.  And the implicit authorization in  2 of the Fourteenth

 Amendment to deny the vote to citizens ""for participation in rebellion, or other crime,"" does not except  182 from the operation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  471 U. S. 227-233.

See 42 U.S.C. 2000e-16(c). Choosing the latter route, petitioner filed this suit on October 29, 1982, the day before the 30-day limit expired. She did not serve copies of the complaint on the United States Attorney or the Attorney General until January 1983, and did not serve the Postmaster General until February.

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was sentenced to death after a hearing in which the judge prevented the jury from considering evidence that it might well have considered highly relevant to petitioner's motive at the time of his crime and to the relationship of his character and record to the offense he had committed. As a result, the jury was called on to decide whether death was the appropriate punishment but was deprived of the evidence petitioner offered in mitigation of his crime. The death sentence must thus be vacated, for it stands in glaring conflict with one of the most basic requirements of the Eighth Amendment-"" 'that the sentencer . . . not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of

 Petitioner Boyd was convicted of murdering his former girlfriend after unsuccessfully attempting a reconciliation. They had lived together for three years but had separated several months prior to the murder. On the day of the murder, Boyd met the victim at a local shopping mall. They sat and talked quietly for some time, sitting in the midst of a church- sponsored event run by the victim's father, a local pastor. Eventually, the victim's mother approached her daughter and said it was time to leave, but Boyd asked the daughter to stay and talk to him a little longer. After talking some more, the victim said she would leave. She was also reported to have said that if Boyd was going to kill her ""he should hurry up and get it over with.""

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 15, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Although the State of Florida has adopted a system of capital sentencing that allows a trial judge to overturn a sentencing jury's finding as to the inappropriateness of death-and although this Court has upheld that system as constitutional, see Spaziano v.

In Florida, as in other States, a capital defendant has a right to a sentencer who is free to consider and weigh, within the broadest bounds of relevance, "" 'any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.'

 This principle must govern judges responsible for sentencing, Eddings, supra, just as it must govern juries. In Florida, it must govern both, for the state scheme purports to split sentencing authority between the two. Although the judge has the power to override, that power is limited, for the judge may not exercise plenary discretion as to the issue of mitigation. To the contrary, the State has repeatedly purported to limit the judicial override to those cases where ""the facts suggesting a sentence of death are so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ."" Tedder v. State, 322 So.2d 908, 910 (Fla.1975). Unfortunately, regardless of this supposed limit-a limit that the State cited to this Court when arguing for the constitutionality of its sentencing process, Spaziano, supra, 468 U.S., at 465- the State has administered capital sentencing in a manner that allows the override to repeatedly denigrate the principle of Lockett and Eddings. See e.g., Heiney v. Florida, 469 U.S. 920 ( 1984) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). 
 In this case, the Florida Supreme Court took another step in the erosion of Lockett and Eddings, affirming a judge's sentence of death over a jury's finding for life on the ground that certain miti- 
Page 471 U.S. 1045 , 1046
 gating factors that likely stood behind the jury's finding were simply invalid as a matter of law, and the jury's verdict was therefore reversible within the Tedder rule. Under Lockett and Eddings that legal determination is simply wrong as a matter of federal law. It embodies a view of mitigation that is violative of the Eighth Amendment. To prevent this denigration of one of the most important aspects of our Eighth Amendment law, I would grant review in this case. [Footnote 1]

 The facts of this case are not complicated. Petitioner was found guilty of murdering a taxi driver. There were no witnesses, nor was there evidence of robbery; and petitioner's sister-in-law, who testified against petitioner at trial, may have played some uncertain role in the crime. The jury returned a verdict of life in prison, and the trial judge, finding that there were three aggravating circumstances but no mitigating circumstances, overrode that verdict and imposed a death sentence. The trial judge did not attempt to analyze the jury's thought process when he reversed it, nor did he make any Tedder finding. He simply expressed disagreement with the jury determination. His sentence was affirmed by the State Supreme Court. 458 So.2d 755 (1984).

 The State Supreme Court's analysis of the case began with a determination that at least one of the aggravating circumstances found by the trial judge was inapplicable to this case as a matter of law, but it nevertheless affirmed the death sentence because it agreed that there were no valid mitigating circumstances. It held that this situation satisfied the Tedder standard. However, [471 U.S. 1045 , 1047]

 William EUTZY, petitioner,v. FLORIDANo. 84-6182 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 15, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Although the State of Florida has adopted a system of capital sentencing that allows a trial judge to overturn a sentencing jury's finding as to the inappropriateness of death-and although this Court has upheld that system as constitutional, see Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447 (1984)-that system nevertheless remains subject to the dictates of Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978), and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 102 S. Ct. 869 (1982).

Decided April 1, 1985
471 U.S. 84

Syllabus 
Section 314 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) establishes a federal recording system that is designed to rid federal lands of stale mining claims and to provide federal land managers with up-to-date information that allows them to make informed land management decisions.  Section 314(b) requires that mining claims located prior to FLPMA's enactment be initially recorded with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) within three years of the enactment, and  314(a) requires that the claimant, in the year of initial recording and ""prior to December 31"" of every year after that, file with state officials and the BLM a notice of intention to hold a claim, an affidavit of assessment work performed on the claim, or a detailed reporting form.  Section 314(c) provides that failure to comply with either of these requirements ""shall be deemed conclusively to constitute an abandonment"" of the claim.  Appellees, who had purchased mining claims before 1976, complied with the initial recording requirement but failed to meet on time their first annual filing requirement, not filing with the BLM until December 31.  Subsequently, the BLM notified appellees that their claims had been declared abandoned and void due to their tardy filing.  After an unsuccessful administrative appeal, appellees filed an action in Federal District Court, alleging that  314(c) effected an unconstitutional taking of their property without just compensation and denied them due process.  The District Court issued summary judgment in appellees' favor, holding that  314(c) created an impermissible irrebuttable presumption that claimants who fail to make a timely filing intended to abandon their claims.  Alternatively, the court held that the 1-day late filing ""substantially complied"" with  314(a) and the implementing regulations.
Held:
1. Section 314(a)'s plain language -- ""prior to December 31"" -- read in conjunction with BLM regulations makes clear that the annual filings must be made on or before December 30.  Thus, the BLM did not act ultra vires in concluding that appellees' filing was untimely.  Pp.  471 U. S. 93-96.
2. Congress intended in  314(c) to extinguish those claims for which timely filings were not made.  Specific evidence of intent to abandon is made irrelevant by  314(c); the failure to file on time, in and of itself, causes a claim to be lost.  Pp.  471 U. S. 97-100. 
Page 471 U. S. 85

3. The annual filing deadline cannot be complied with, substantially or otherwise, by filing late -- even by one day.  Pp.  471 U. S. 100-102.
4. Section 314(c) is not unconstitutional.  Pp.  471 U. S. 103-110.
(a) Congress was well within its affirmative powers in enacting the filing requirement, in imposing the penalty of extinguishment in  314(c), and in applying the requirement and sanction to claims located before FLPMA was enacted.  Pp.  471 U. S. 104-107.
(b) Appellees' property loss was one they could have avoided with minimal burden; it was their failure to file on time, not Congress' action, that caused their property rights to be extinguished.  Regulation of property rights does not ""take"" private property when an individual's reasonable, investment-backed expectations can continue to be realized as long as he complies with reasonable regulations.  Pp. 107-108.
(c) FLPMA provides appellees with all the process that is their constitutional due.  The Act's recording provisions clearly afford those within the Act's reach a reasonable opportunity both to familiarize themselves with the general requirements imposed and to comply with those requirements.  As the Act constitutes purely economic regulation, Congress was entitled to conclude that it was preferable to place a substantial portion of the burden on claimants to make the national recording system work.

No. 83-1750
Argued January 16, 1985
Decided April 1, 1985
471 U.S. 130

Syllabus 
A federal grand jury returned a multicount indictment charging respondent with mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1341.  He was alleged to have defrauded his insurer in connection with a burglary at his place of business both by consenting to the burglary in advance and by lying to the insurer about the value of his loss.  The proof at his jury trial, however, concerned only the latter allegation, and he was convicted.  Respondent appealed on the basis that the trial proof had fatally varied from the scheme alleged in the indictment.  The Court of Appeals agreed and vacated the conviction, holding that, under the Fifth Amendment's grand jury guarantee, a conviction could not stand where the trial proof corresponded to a fraudulent scheme much narrower than, though included in, the scheme that the indictment alleged.
Held:  Respondent's Fifth Amendment grand jury right was not violated.  Pp.  471 U. S. 135-145.
(a) As long as the crime and the elements thereof that sustain the conviction are fully and clearly set out in the indictment, the right to a grand jury is not normally violated by the fact that the indictment alleges more crimes or other means of committing the same crime.  Convictions generally have been sustained as long as the proof upon which they are based corresponds to an offense that was clearly set out in the indictment.  A part of the indictment unnecessary to and independent of the allegations of the offense proved may normally be treated as a useless averment that may be ignored.  Pp.  471 U. S. 135-138.
(b) Respondent has shown no deprivation of his substantial right to be tried only on charges presented in a grand jury indictment.  He was tried on an indictment that clearly set out the offense for which he was ultimately convicted.  Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212, distinguished.  Pp.  471 U. S. 138-140.
(c) The proposition that a narrowing of an indictment constitutes an ""amendment"" that renders the indictment void, Ex parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1, is now explicitly rejected.  Pp.  471 U. S. 140-145.
(d) The variance complained of here added nothing new to the indictment and constituted no broadening, and what was removed from the case was in no way essential to the offense on which respondent was convicted.  P.  471 U. S. 145.

No. 84-436
Decided April 1, 1985
471 U.S. 148

Syllabus 
Respondents, students of the California School for the Blind, brought suit in Federal District Court against petitioner state officials, claiming that the school's physical plant did not meet applicable seismic safety standards and alleging rights of action under federal statutes.  After trial, the court issued a ""preliminary injunction"" requiring the State to conduct additional tests of school grounds to aid in assessment of the school's seismic safety.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the issuance of the injunction, noting that it was not finally deciding the merits of the action.  Petitioners sought certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' judgment, but in the meantime the tests ordered by the District Court's preliminary injunction were completed.
Held:  Since petitioners have complied with the terms of the preliminary injunction, the only question of law ruled on by the Court of Appeals -- that is, whether the District Court abused its discretion in applying the complicated calculus for determining whether the preliminary injunction should have issued -- is moot.  However, other claims for relief still remain to be resolved by the District Court.  Thus, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the Court of Appeals' judgment is vacated, with instructions to remand the case to the District Court.
Certiorari granted; 736 F.2d 538, vacated and remanded.

 MOBIL OIL CORPORATIONv. Jerry A. BLANTON and Roy H. HealeyNo. 83-1896 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 1, 1985
 Rehearing Denied May 20, 1985. 
 See 471 U.S. 1120. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a jury verdict that petitioner had attempted to monopolize in violation of 2 of the Sherman Act, ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 2, and was therefore liable to respondents for treble damages. 721 F.2d 1207 (1983). Ordinarily, a finding of attempted monopolization depends on a showing that there was a dangerous probability that the defendant would succeed in monopolizing a relevant market. See Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 177, 350 (1965); Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 396, 279 (1905); Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 271-275 (CA2 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1093 (1980). In this case, the jury found that the relevant submarket that petitioner had attempted to monopolize consisted of sales of ""Mobil-branded and non-Mobil- branded oil, lubricants, and [tires, batteries, accessories and specialties] to Mobil dealers."" 
 On appeal, petitioner contended that, as a matter of law, sales to Mobil dealers only could not constitute a relevant submarket. The Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to address this contention, for it concluded that the finding of attempted monopolization could be sustained without reference to the effects of petitioner's conduct in any relevant market. The court relied in part on the Ninth Circuit's earlier ruling in Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327 
Page 471 U.S. 1007 , 1008
 F.2d 459, cert. denied, 377 U.S. 993 (1964 ), in which the court had held that the relevant market was not an issue in an attempted monopoly case. In subsequent cases, the Ninth Circuit had refined the holding of Lessig to allow avoidance of the issue of effects in a relevant market only in cases where the plaintiff had proved ""either predatory conduct or a per se violation of 1 [of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S. C. 1]."" Gough v. Rossmoor Corp., 585 F.2d 381, 390 (1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 936 (1979). Relying on the "" Lessig doctrine"" as modified in Gough, the court held that because respondents had proved that petitioner had engaged in practices that constitute per se violations of 1 of the Sherman Act, the attempted monopolization verdict could be sustained without reference to the probability that petitioner's conduct would lead to monopolization of any relevant market. 
 Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act are directed to different sorts of threats to competition in our economy. Section 1 proscribes concerted action-contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in restraint of trade. Such concerted action is so inherently threatening to competition that in certain instances it is forbidden without regard to whether it has actually damaged competition in a particular market. Section 2 regulates unilateral conduct by outlawing monopolization and attempted monopolization. Because unilateral conduct is far less likely than concerted action to pose a threat to competition, ""[t]he conduct of a single firm is governed by 2 alone and is unlawful only when it threatens actual monopolization."" Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 767, 2739 (1984). 
 Because the Lessig doctrine allows a violation of 2 to be found on the basis of a per se violation of 1, without regard to the effect of a defendant's conduct in any relevant market, it appears to be in tension with these principles. In addition, the doctrine, although accepted within the Ninth Circuit for over 20 years, has been explicitly rejected by a number of Courts of Appeals outside the Ninth Circuit. See Edward J. Sweeney & Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc., 637 F.2d 105, 117 (CA3 1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 911 (1981); Photovest Corp. v. Fotomat Corp., 606 F.2d 704, 711-712 (CA7 1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 917 (1980); Spectrofuge Corp. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 575 F.2d 256, 276, and n. 69 (CA5 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 939 (1979); FLM Collision Parts, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 543 F.2d 1019, [471 U.S. 1007 , 1009]

||"Tennessee v. Garner
No. 83-1035
Argued October 30, 1984
Decided March 27, 1985*
471 U.S. 1
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
Syllabus
A Tennessee statute provides that, if, after a police officer has given notice of an intent to arrest a criminal suspect, the suspect flees or forcibly resists, ""the officer may use all the necessary means to effect the arrest.""  Acting under the authority of this statute, a Memphis police officer shot and killed appellee-respondent Garner's son as, after being told to halt, the son fled over a fence at night in the backyard of a house he was suspected of burglarizing.  The officer used deadly force despite being ""reasonably sure"" the suspect was unarmed and thinking that he was 17 or 18 years old, and of slight build.  The father subsequently brought an action in Federal District Court, seeking damages under 42 U.S.C.  1983 for asserted violations of his son's constitutional rights.  The District Court held that the statute and the officer's actions were constitutional.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The Tennessee statute is unconstitutional insofar as it authorizes the use of deadly force against, as in this case, an apparently unarmed, nondangerous fleeing suspect; such force may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.  Pp.  7-22. 
[2]
(a) Apprehension by the use of deadly force is a seizure subject to the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement.  To determine whether such a seizure is reasonable, the extent of the intrusion on the suspect's rights under that Amendment must be balanced against the governmental interests in effective law enforcement.  This balancing process demonstrates that, notwithstanding probable cause to seize a suspect, an officer may not always do so by killing him.  The use of deadly force to prevent the escape of all felony suspects, whatever the circumstances, is constitutionally unreasonable.  Pp.  7-12.
(b) The Fourth Amendment, for purposes of this case, should not be construed in light of the common law rule allowing the use of whatever force is necessary to effect the arrest of a fleeing felon.  Changes in the legal and technological context mean that that rule is distorted almost beyond recognition when literally applied.  Whereas felonies were formerly capital crimes, few are now, or can be, and many crimes classified as misdemeanors, or nonexistent, at common law are now felonies.  Also, the common law rule developed at a time when weapons were rudimentary.  And, in light of the varied rules adopted in the States indicating a long-term movement away from the common law rule, particularly in the police departments themselves, that rule is a dubious indicium of the constitutionality of the Tennessee statute.  There is no indication that holding a police practice such as that authorized by the statute unreasonable will severely hamper effective law enforcement.  Pp.  12-20.
(c) While burglary is a serious crime, the officer in this case could not reasonably have believed that the suspect -- young, slight, and unarmed -- posed any threat.  Nor does the fact that an unarmed suspect has broken into a dwelling at night automatically mean he is dangerous.  Pp.  20-22.
710 F.2d 240, affirmed and remanded.

No. 82-1832
Argued November 26, 1984
Decided March 27, 1985
471 U.S. 34

Syllabus 
Petitioners, unincorporated townships located in Wisconsin adjacent to respondent city, filed suit against respondent in Federal District Court, alleging that petitioners were potential competitors of respondent in the collection and transportation of sewage, and that respondent had violated the Sherman Act by acquiring a monopoly over the provision of sewage treatment services in the area and by tying the provision of such services to the provision of sewage collection and transportation services.  Respondent refused to supply sewage treatment services to petitioners, but supplied the services to individual landowners in petitioners' areas if a majority of the individuals in the area voted by referendum election to have their homes annexed by respondent and to use its sewage collection and transportation services.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, finding, inter alia, that Wisconsin statutes regulating the municipal provision of sewage services expressed a clear state policy to replace competition with regulation.  The court concluded that respondent's allegedly anticompetitive conduct fell within the ""state action"" exemption to the federal antitrust laws established by Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Respondent's anticompetitive activities are protected by the state action exemption to the federal antitrust laws.  Pp.  471 U. S. 38-47.
(a) Before a municipality may claim the protection of the state action exemption, it must demonstrate that it is engaging in the challenged activity pursuant to a ""clearly articulated"" state policy.  Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U. S. 389.  Pp.  471 U. S. 38-40.
(b) Wisconsin statutes grant authority to cities to construct and maintain sewage systems, to describe the district to be served, and to refuse to serve unannexed areas.  The statutes are not merely neutral on state policy but, instead, clearly contemplate that a city may engage in anticompetitive conduct.  To pass the ""clear articulation"" test, the legislature need not expressly state in a statute or the legislative history that it intends for the delegated action to have anticompetitive effects.  The Wisconsin statutes evidence a clearly articulated state policy to displace competition with regulation in the area of municipal provision of sewage services.  Pp. 40-44. 
Page 471 U. S. 35

(c) The ""clear articulation"" requirement of the state action test does not require that respondent show that the State ""compelled"" it to act.  Although compulsion affirmatively expressed may be the best evidence of state policy, it is by no means a prerequisite to a finding that a municipality acted pursuant to clearly articulated state policy.  Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U. S. 579, and Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, distinguished.  Pp.  471 U. S. 45-46.
(d) Active state supervision of anticompetitive conduct is not a prerequisite to exemption from the antitrust laws where the actor is a municipality, rather than a private party.  The requirement of active state supervision serves essentially the evidentiary function of ensuring that the actor is engaging in the challenged conduct pursuant to state policy.  Where the actor is a municipality, rather than a private party, there is little or no danger that it is involved in a private price-fixing arrangement.  The danger that a municipality will seek to further purely parochial public interests at the expense of more overriding state goals is minimal, because of the requirement that the municipality act pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy.

No. 82-1922
Argued November 26, 1984
Decided March 27, 1985
471 U.S. 48

Syllabus 
Petitioner Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference and petitioner North Carolina Motor Carriers Association (petitioners), ""rate bureaus"" composed of motor common carriers operating in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Mississippi, submit, on behalf of their members, joint rate proposals to the Public Service Commission in each State.  This collective ratemaking is authorized, but not compelled, by the respective States.  The United States, contending that petitioners' collective ratemaking violates the federal antitrust laws, filed an action in Federal District Court to enjoin it.  Petitioners responded that their conduct was immune from the federal antitrust laws by virtue of the ""state action"" doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341.  The District Court entered a summary judgment in the Government's favor.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that compulsion is a threshold requirement to a finding of Parker immunity.  The court reasoned that the two-pronged test of California Retail Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97, for determining whether state regulation of private parties is shielded from the federal antitrust laws -- the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as a state policy, and the State must supervise actively any private anticompetitive conduct -- is inapplicable to suits against private parties; that even if Midcal is applicable, private conduct that is not compelled cannot be taken pursuant to a ""clearly articulated state policy"" within the meaning of Midcal's first prong; and that, because Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, which held that a State Bar, acting alone, could not immunize from the federal antitrust laws its anticompetitive conduct in fixing minimum fees for lawyers -- was cited with approval in Midcal, the Midcal Court endorsed the continued validity of a ""compulsion requirement.""
Held:  Petitioners' collective ratemaking activities, although not compelled by the respective States, are immune from federal antitrust liability under the state action doctrine.  The Midcal test should be used to determine whether the private rate bureaus' collective ratemaking activities are protected under the federal antitrust laws.  Moreover, the actions of a private party can be attributed to a ""clearly articulated state 
Page 471 U. S. 49
 policy,"" within the meaning of the Midcal test's first prong, even in the absence of compulsion.  The anticompetitive conduct is taken pursuant to a ""clearly articulated state policy"" under the first prong of the Midcal test.  Here, North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee statutes expressly permit collective ratemaking.  Mississippi, while not expressly approving of collective ratemaking, has clearly articulated its intent to displace price competition among common carriers with a regulatory structure.  Because the Government conceded that there was adequate state supervision, both prongs of the Midcal test are satisfied.  Pp.  471 U. S. 55-66.

S. 97, for determining whether state regulation of private parties is shielded from the federal antitrust laws -- the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as a state policy, and the State must supervise actively any private anticompetitive conduct -- is inapplicable to suits against private parties; that even if Midcal is applicable, private conduct that is not compelled cannot be taken pursuant to a ""clearly articulated state policy"" within the meaning of Midcal's first prong; and that, because Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, which held that a State Bar, acting alone, could not immunize from the federal antitrust laws its anticompetitive conduct in fixing minimum fees for lawyers -- was cited with approval in Midcal, the Midcal Court endorsed the continued validity of a ""compulsion requirement.""
Held:  Petitioners' collective ratemaking activities, although not compelled by the respective States, are immune from federal antitrust liability under the state action doctrine.  The Midcal test should be used to determine whether the private rate bureaus' collective ratemaking activities are protected under the federal antitrust laws.  Moreover, the actions of a private party can be attributed to a ""clearly articulated state 
Page 471 U. S. 49
 policy,"" within the meaning of the Midcal test's first prong, even in the absence of compulsion.  The anticompetitive conduct is taken pursuant to a ""clearly articulated state policy"" under the first prong of the Midcal test.  Here, North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee statutes expressly permit collective ratemaking.  Mississippi, while not expressly approving of collective ratemaking, has clearly articulated its intent to displace price competition among common carriers with a regulatory structure.  Because the Government conceded that there was adequate state supervision, both prongs of the Midcal test are satisfied.  Pp.  471 U. S. 55-66.

No. 84-5004
Argued January 9, 1985
Decided March 26, 1985
470 U.S. 856

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a previously convicted felon, was arrested when the police found him in possession of another person's revolver that was reported missing; he reportedly threatened a neighbor with the revolver, and tried unsuccessfully to sell it.  Petitioner was then indicted on charges of receiving a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(h)(1) and for possessing it in violation of 18 U.S.C.App.  1202(a)(1).  He was convicted in Federal District Court on both counts and sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment on the respective counts.  The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to modify the sentences to make them concurrent.
Held:  Congress did not intend a convicted felon, in petitioner's position, to be punished under both  922(h) and  1202(a)(1).  Congress recognized that a felon who receives a firearm inevitably also possesses it, and therefore did not intend to subject that person to two convictions for the same criminal act; the legislative history supports this reading of congressional intent.  While the Government may seek a multiple-count indictment against a felon for violations of  922(h) and 1202(a)(1) involving the same weapon where a single act establishes the receipt and the possession, the defendant may not suffer two convictions or sentences on that indictment.  If the jury returns guilty verdicts for each count, the trial court should enter judgment on only one count.  The remedy of ordering one of the sentences to be served concurrently with the other cannot be squared with Congress' intention.  Pp.  470 U. S. 859-865.

No. 83-1274
Argued October 31, 1984
Decided March 26, 1985
470 U.S. 869

Syllabus 
An Alabama statute imposes a substantially lower gross premiums tax rate on domestic insurance companies than on out-of-state (foreign) insurance companies.  The statute permits foreign companies to reduce but not to eliminate the differential by investing in Alabama assets and securities.  Appellant foreign insurance companies filed claims for refunds of taxes paid, contending that the statute, as applied to them, violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The State Commissioner of Insurance denied the claims.  On consolidated appeals to a county Circuit Court, in which several domestic companies intervened, the statute was upheld on summary judgment.  The court ruled that the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because, in addition to raising revenue, it served the legitimate state purposes of encouraging the formation of new insurance companies in Alabama and capital investment by foreign insurance companies in Alabama assets and securities, and that the distinction between foreign and domestic companies was rationally related to those purposes.  The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the finding as to legitimate state purposes, but remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of rational relationship.  On certiorari to the Alabama Supreme Court, appellants waived their rights to such an evidentiary hearing, and the court entered judgment for the State and the intervenors on appellants' equal protection challenge to the statute.
Held:  The Alabama domestic preference tax statute violates the Equal Protection Clause as applied to appellants.  Pp.  470 U. S. 874-883.
(a) Under the circumstances of this case, promotion of domestic business by discriminating against nonresidents is not a legitimate state purpose.  Western & Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Board of Equalization of California, 451 U. S. 648, distinguished.  Alabama's aim to promote domestic industry is purely and completely discriminatory, designed only to favor domestic industry within the State, no matter what the cost to foreign corporations also seeking to do business there.  Alabama's purpose constitutes the very sort of parochial discrimination that the Equal Protection Clause was intended to prevent.  A State may not constitutionally favor its own residents by taxing foreign corporations at a higher rate solely because of their residence.  Although the McCarran-Ferguson Act exempts the insurance industry from Commerce Clause 
Page 470 U. S. 870
 restrictions, it does not purport to limit the applicability of the Equal Protection Clause.  Equal protection restraints are applicable even though the effect of the discrimination is similar to the type of burden with which the Commerce Clause also would be concerned.  Pp.  470 U. S. 876-882.
(b) Nor is the encouragement of the investment in Alabama assets and securities a legitimate state purpose.  Domestic insurers remain entitled to the more favorable tax rate regardless of whether they invest in Alabama assets. Moreover, since the investment incentive provision does not enable foreign insurers to eliminate the statute's discriminatory effect, it does not cure, but reaffirms, the impermissible classification based solely on residence.

 Florence TALAMINI, Administratrix of Estate of John A. Talaminiv. ALLSTATE INSURANCE COMPANYNo. 84-18 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 25, 1985
 The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Treating the papers whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for writ of certiorari, certiorari is denied. 

 Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice BRENNAN, Justice MARSHALL, and Justice BLACKMUN join, concurring. 
 Appellant filed a two-count complaint against appellee seeking to recover damages under two Pennsylvania statutes. [Footnote 1] The Dis- 
Page 470 U.S. 1067 , 1068
 trict Court granted a motion to dismiss Count II and appellant tried to appeal from that order under 28 U.S.C. 1291. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit dismissed the appeal, presumably because the District Court's dismissal of only one count of the complaint was not a final order . Appellant has invoked our appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254, arguing that Pennsylvania courts would treat the District Court's dismissal as a final order and that the federal courts should also treat the dismissal as final under the collateral-order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949).

 The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Treating the papers whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for writ of certiorari, certiorari is denied. 

 Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice BRENNAN, Justice MARSHALL, and Justice BLACKMUN join, concurring. 
 Appellant filed a two-count complaint against appellee seeking to recover damages under two Pennsylvania statutes. [Footnote 1] The Dis-

 trict Court granted a motion to dismiss Count II and appellant tried to appeal from that order under 28 U.S.C. 1291. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit dismissed the appeal, presumably because the District Court's dismissal of only one count of the complaint was not a final order . Appellant has invoked our appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1254, arguing that Pennsylvania courts would treat the District Court's dismissal as a final order and that the federal courts should also treat the dismissal as final under the collateral-order doctrine of Cohen v.

 Owen W. CRUMPACKER, appellant,v. INDIANA SUPREME COURT DISCIPLINARY COMMISSIONNo. 84-337 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 25, 1985
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 

 Chief Justice BURGER. 
 I agree that we should dismiss this appeal for want of a substantial federal question, but I would go beyond that. This effort to invoke the Court's jurisdiction on an utterly frivolous claim should subject the attorney who filed the jurisdictional statement to the sanction of Rule 49. 2 of this Court. 
 Appellant Owen W. Crumpacker, formerly a licensed attorney in a Hammond, Indiana, law firm was disbarred by order of the Indiana Supreme Court on November 29, 1978. In re Crumpacker, 269 Ind. 630, 383 N.E.2d 36 ( 1978), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 979 (1979). Appellant continued to practice law despite his disbarment. On February 11, 1982, following a hearing, the Indiana Supreme Court held appellant in contempt for defying the 1978 disbarment order; appellant was also held in contempt as a result of his disruptive behavior during the hearing and served a 90-day sentence for the contempt. In re Crumpacker, Ind., 431 N. E.2d 91. His appeal was dismissed for want of a substantial federal question, 459 U.S. 803 (1982). 
 On release, appellant continued to ignore the Indiana Supreme Court's disbarment order. On July 25, 1983, the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission filed another complaint against appellant, alleging that he was again practicing law without a license. After appellant failed to appear at the hearing scheduled for November 15, 1983, despite being duly notified, the Indiana Supreme Court ordered that a warrant issue for appellant's arrest. Appellant was apprehended on April 4, 1984, and brought before the Indiana Supreme Court to show cause why he should not be found in contempt for his failure to appear. After a hearing, in which appellant offered no reasonable explanation for his failure to abide by the disbarment order, the Indiana Supreme Court once again 
Page 470 U.S. 1074 , 1075
 found appellant in contempt and ordered him confined to 30 days in prison. 
 Appellant's jurisdictional statement filed in this Court launches an utterly frivolous constitutional attack on the Indiana Supreme Court's power to hold him in contempt for ignoring its orders and for disbarring him in 1978. The Indiana Supreme Court's authority over unauthorized practitioners of law is beyond dispute. See, e.g., Ind.Code 33-2-3-1 and 34-4-7-3 (1982). On this record there is no conceivable basis for raising any challenge to the order of the Indiana Supreme Court holding appellant in contempt for failing to appear at the November 15 hearing. 
 I would award appellee $1,000 against Andrew G. Kohlan, Esq., appellant's attorney, pursuant to this Court's Rule 49.2.* 
 Justice POWELL took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. 
[Footnote *] Rule 49.2 provides: ""When an appeal or petition for writ of certiorari is frivolous, the Court may award the appellee or respondent appropriate damages.""

 The motion of Edison Electric Institute for leave to file a brief as amicus curiae is granted. The request of counsel for appellant to delete Brooklyn Union Gas Company as a party to this case is denied. The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting. 
 The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, Pub.L. 95-617, 92 Stat. 3117 (PURPA), is part of a broad congressional 
Page 470 U.S. 1075 , 1076
 response to the energy crisis. One of its provisions, 210 of Title II, 16 U.S.C. 824a-3, is designed to promote the development of alternative energy resources by overcoming the historical reluctance of electric utilities to purchase power from nontraditional facilities. FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742, 750, 2132 (1982 ). Section 210(a) authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC) to promulgate ""such rules as it determines necessary to encourage cogeneration and small power production,"" including rules requiring utilities to offer to purchase electricity from qualifying small power production facilities. Section 210(b) requires that the rates for such purchases be ""just and reasonable"" and nondiscriminatory, and that no FERC rule ""shall provide for a rate which exceeds the incremental cost to the electric utility of alternative electric energy."" 
 Pursuant to 210(a), FERC requires utilities to purchase electricity from qualifying facilities. See 18 CFR 292.303(a) (1984). In an apparent effort to encourage decentralized power production as much as possible, FERC adopted the maximum rate allowed by the statute-the incremental, or ""full avoided cost,"" standard-for such purchases. See 292.304(b)(2); see also 45 Fed.Reg. 12214, 12222 (1980). We upheld its choice in American Paper Institute, Inc. v. American Electric Power Service Corp., 461 U.S. 402 (1983). 
 Though PURPA is a federal statute whose administration lies with FERC , ""implementation"" of the statute is left in large measure to the States. See 210(f), 16 U.S.C. 824a-3(f); 18 CFR 292.401 (1984). Thus, a State can, under certain circumstances, set rates that are lower than full avoided costs, 18 CFR 292.304(b)(3) (1984); a qualifying facility and a utility can negotiate for lower rates, 292.301(b)(1); and the state regulatory authority or any non-regulated utility may apply to FERC for a waiver, 292.403. The question in the present case is just how far a State can go in the other direction. In particular, the question is whether a State can require utilities to pay more than the full avoided cost rate for their mandatory purchases. 
 New York has set a minimum rate of six cents per kilowatt hour for utility purchases from qualifying facilities. N.Y.Pub.Serv.Law 66-c ( McKinney Supp.1984-1985). Appellant challenged the law, arguing that it could not be required to pay six cents per kilowatt hour for the times when its avoided costs fell below that amount.

No. 83-529
Argued November 27, 1984
Decided March 20, 1985
470 U.S. 675

Syllabus 
A Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent, while patrolling a highway in an area under surveillance for suspected drug trafficking, noticed an apparently overloaded pickup truck with an attached camper traveling in tandem with a Pontiac.  Respondent Savage was driving the truck, and respondent Sharpe was driving the Pontiac.  After following the two vehicles for about 20 miles, the agent decided to make an ""investigative stop,"" and radioed the South Carolina State Highway Patrol for assistance.  An officer responded, and he and the DEA agent continued to follow the two vehicles.  When they attempted to stop the vehicles, the Pontiac pulled over to the side of the road, but the truck continued on, pursued by the state officer.  After identifying himself and obtaining identification from Sharpe, the DEA agent attempted to radio the State Highway Patrol officer.  The DEA agent was unable to contact the state officer to see if he had stopped the truck, so he radioed the local police for help.  In the meantime, the state officer had stopped the truck, questioned Savage, and told him that he would be held until the DEA agent arrived.  The agent, who had left the local police with the Pontiac, arrived at the scene approximately 15 minutes after the truck had been stopped.  After confirming his suspicion that the truck was overloaded and upon smelling marihuana, the agent opened the rear of the camper without Savage's permission and observed a number of burlap-wrapped bales resembling bales of marihuana that the agent had seen in previous investigations.  The agent then placed Savage under arrest and, returning to the Pontiac, also arrested Sharpe.  Chemical tests later showed that the bales contained marihuana.  Respondents were charged with federal drug offenses, and, after the District Court denied their motion to suppress the contraband, were convicted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, because the investigative stops failed to meet the Fourth Amendment's requirement of brevity governing detentions on less than probable cause, the marihuana should have been suppressed as the fruit of unlawful seizures.
Held:   The detention of Savage clearly met the Fourth Amendment's standard of reasonableness.  Pp.  470 U. S. 682-688.
(a) In evaluating the reasonableness of an investigative stop, this Court examines
""whether the officer's action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances 
Page 470 U. S. 676
 which justified the interference in the first place.""
Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1,  392 U. S. 20.  As to the first part of the inquiry, the Court of Appeals assumed that the officers had an articulable and reasonable suspicion that respondents were engaged in marihuana trafficking, and the record abundantly supports that assumption, given the circumstances when the officers attempted to stop the Pontiac and the truck.  As to the second part of the inquiry, while the brevity of an investigative detention is an important factor in determining whether the detention is unreasonable, courts must also consider the purposes to be served by the stop, as well as the time reasonably needed to effectuate those purposes.  The Court of Appeals' decision would effectively establish a per se rule that a 20-minute detention is too long to be justified under the Terry doctrine.  Such a result is clearly and fundamentally at odds with this Court's approach in this area.  Pp. 682-686.
(b) In assessing whether a detention is too long in duration to be justified as an investigative stop, it is appropriate to examine whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time it was necessary to detain the defendant.  Here, the DEA agent diligently pursued his investigation, and clearly no delay unnecessary to the investigation was involved.  Pp.  470 U. S. 686-688.

|470 u.s. 729|"Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion
No. 83-703
Argued October 29, 1984
Decided March 20, 1985*
470 U.S. 729

Syllabus 
Under 28 U.S.C.  2342(4), a provision of the Hobbs Act, the courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction over petitions for review of ""all final orders"" of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ""made reviewable by"" 42 U.S.C.  2239.  Section 2239(b), in turn, provides that the Hobbs Act governs review of ""[a]ny final order entered in any proceeding of the kind specified in subsection (a) of this section.""  Subsection (a)(1) provides that,
""[i]n any proceeding under this chapter, for the granting, suspending, revoking, or amending of any license . . . the Commission shall grant a hearing upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected by the proceeding.""
Respondent Lorion (hereafter respondent) wrote a detailed letter to the Commission expressing fears about potential safety threats at Florida Power & Light Co.'s nuclear reactor near her home, and urging the Commission to suspend the reactor's operating license.  The Commission treated the letter as a citizen petition, under its rules, requesting the institution of administrative proceedings to suspend the license.  After the Commission ultimately denied the request, respondent petitioned the Court of Appeals for review.  The court decided sua sponte that it lacked initial subject matter jurisdiction to review the Commission's denial of respondent's citizen petition, concluding that such a denial was not an order in a ""proceeding"" within the meaning of  2239(a)(1).
Held:   Section 2239 vests in the courts of appeals initial subject matter jurisdiction over Commission orders denying citizen petitions made pursuant to Commission rules.  Pp.  470 U. S. 734-746.
(a) The language of  2239 is ambiguous, because subsection (b) refers to ""proceeding[s] of the kind specified in subsection (a),"" but the pertinent sentence in subsection (a)(1) sets forth both the scope of Commission licensing proceedings and a hearing requirement for such proceedings.  Thus,  2239 may be read to authorize initial court of appeals 
Page 470 U. S. 730
 review either by reference to whether a hearing was held pursuant to the hearing requirement (as the Court of Appeals did here), or by reference to the subject matter of the agency action, that is, whether the order was issued in a licensing proceeding.  Pp.  470 U. S. 735-737.
(b) Relevant evidence of congressional intent in the legislative history supports the interpretation that Congress intended to provide for initial court of appeals review of all final orders in licensing proceedings whether or not a hearing before the Commission occurred or could have occurred.  Pp.  470 U. S. 737-740.
(c) Whether subject matter jurisdiction over denials of citizens petitions properly lies in the district courts or the courts of appeals must also be considered in light of the basic congressional choice of Hobbs Act review in  2239(b).  The Hobbs Act specifically contemplates initial courts of appeals review of agency orders resulting from proceedings in which no hearing took place.  Pp.  470 U. S. 740-741.
(d) Adopting a rule that would vest the courts of appeals with initial subject matter jurisdiction of challenges to Commission denials of citizen petitions only when an administrative hearing occurred or could have occurred would result in irrational consequences that could not be squared with general principles respecting judicial review of agency action.

			"|"Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion
No. 83-703
Argued October 29, 1984
Decided March 20, 1985*
470 U.S. 729

Syllabus 
Under 28 U.S.C.  2342(4), a provision of the Hobbs Act, the courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction over petitions for review of ""all final orders"" of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ""made reviewable by"" 42 U.S.C.  2239.  Section 2239(b), in turn, provides that the Hobbs Act governs review of ""[a]ny final order entered in any proceeding of the kind specified in subsection (a) of this section.""  Subsection (a)(1) provides that,
""[i]n any proceeding under this chapter, for the granting, suspending, revoking, or amending of any license . . . the Commission shall grant a hearing upon the request of any person whose interest may be affected by the proceeding.""
Respondent Lorion (hereafter respondent) wrote a detailed letter to the Commission expressing fears about potential safety threats at Florida Power & Light Co.'s nuclear reactor near her home, and urging the Commission to suspend the reactor's operating license.  The Commission treated the letter as a citizen petition, under its rules, requesting the institution of administrative proceedings to suspend the license.  After the Commission ultimately denied the request, respondent petitioned the Court of Appeals for review.  The court decided sua sponte that it lacked initial subject matter jurisdiction to review the Commission's denial of respondent's citizen petition, concluding that such a denial was not an order in a ""proceeding"" within the meaning of  2239(a)(1).
Held:   Section 2239 vests in the courts of appeals initial subject matter jurisdiction over Commission orders denying citizen petitions made pursuant to Commission rules.  Pp.  470 U. S. 734-746.
(a) The language of  2239 is ambiguous, because subsection (b) refers to ""proceeding[s] of the kind specified in subsection (a),"" but the pertinent sentence in subsection (a)(1) sets forth both the scope of Commission licensing proceedings and a hearing requirement for such proceedings.  Thus,  2239 may be read to authorize initial court of appeals 
Page 470 U. S. 730
 review either by reference to whether a hearing was held pursuant to the hearing requirement (as the Court of Appeals did here), or by reference to the subject matter of the agency action, that is, whether the order was issued in a licensing proceeding.  Pp.  470 U. S. 735-737.
(b) Relevant evidence of congressional intent in the legislative history supports the interpretation that Congress intended to provide for initial court of appeals review of all final orders in licensing proceedings whether or not a hearing before the Commission occurred or could have occurred.  Pp.  470 U. S. 737-740.
(c) Whether subject matter jurisdiction over denials of citizens petitions properly lies in the district courts or the courts of appeals must also be considered in light of the basic congressional choice of Hobbs Act review in  2239(b).  The Hobbs Act specifically contemplates initial courts of appeals review of agency orders resulting from proceedings in which no hearing took place.  Pp.  470 U. S. 740-741.
(d) Adopting a rule that would vest the courts of appeals with initial subject matter jurisdiction of challenges to Commission denials of citizen petitions only when an administrative hearing occurred or could have occurred would result in irrational consequences that could not be squared with general principles respecting judicial review of agency action.  Pp.  470 U. S. 741-745.

Syllabus 
A shopkeeper was wounded by gunshot during an attempted robbery but, also being armed with a gun, apparently wounded his assailant in his left side, and the assailant then ran from the scene.  Shortly after the victim was taken to a hospital, police officers found respondent, who was suffering from a gunshot wound to his left chest area, eight blocks away from the shooting.  He was also taken to the hospital, where the victim identified him as the assailant.  After an investigation, the police charged respondent with, inter alia, attempted robbery and malicious wounding.  Thereafter the Commonwealth of Virginia moved in state court for an order directing respondent to undergo surgery to remove a bullet lodged under his left collarbone, asserting that the bullet would provide evidence of respondent's guilt or innocence.  On the basis of expert testimony that the surgery would require an incision of only about one-half inch, could be performed under local anesthesia, and would result in ""no danger on the basis that there's no general anesthesia employed,"" the court granted the motion, and the Virginia Supreme Court denied respondent's petition for a writ of prohibition and/or a writ of habeas corpus.  Respondent then brought an action in Federal District Court to enjoin the pending operation on Fourth Amendment grounds, but the court refused to issue a preliminary injunction.  Subsequently, X rays taken just before surgery was scheduled showed that the bullet was lodged substantially deeper than had been thought when the state court granted the motion to compel surgery, and the surgeon concluded that a general anesthetic would be desirable.  Respondent unsuccessfully sought a rehearing in the state trial court, and the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed.  However, respondent then returned to the Federal District Court, which, after an evidentiary hearing, enjoined the threatened surgery.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held.  The proposed surgery would violate respondent's right to be secure in his person and the search would be ""unreasonable"" under the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  470 U. S. 758-767.
(a) A compelled surgical intrusion into an individual's body for evidence implicates expectations of privacy and security of such magnitude that the intrusion may be ""unreasonable"" even if likely to produce evidence 
Page 470 U. S. 754
 of a crime.  The reasonableness of surgical intrusions beneath the skin depends on a case-by-case approach, in which the individual's interests in privacy and security are weighed against society's interests in conducting the procedure to obtain evidence for fairly determining guilt or innocence.  The appropriate framework of analysis for such cases is provided in Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, which held that a State may, over the suspect's protest, have a physician extract blood from a person suspected of drunken driving without violating the suspect's Fourth Amendment rights.  Beyond the threshold requirements as to probable cause and warrants, Schmerber's inquiry considered other factors for determining ""reasonableness"" -- including the extent to which the procedure may threaten the individual's safety or health, the extent of intrusion upon the individual's dignitary interests in personal privacy and bodily integrity, and the community's interest in fairly and accurately determining guilt or innocence.  Pp.  470 U. S. 758-763.
(b) Under the Schmerber balancing test, the lower federal courts reached the correct result here.  The threats to respondent's safety posed by the surgery were the subject of sharp dispute, and there was conflict in the testimony concerning the nature and scope of the operation.  Thus, the resulting uncertainty about the medical risks was properly taken into account.  Moreover, the intrusion on respondent's privacy interests and bodily integrity can only be characterized as severe.  Surgery without the patient's consent, performed under a general anesthetic to search for evidence of a crime, involves a virtually total divestment of the patient's ordinary control over surgical probing beneath his skin.  On the other hand, the Commonwealth's assertions of compelling need to intrude into respondent's body to retrieve the bullet are not persuasive.  The Commonwealth has available substantial additional evidence that respondent was the individual who accosted the victim.  Pp.  470 U. S. 763-766.

No. 83-5954
Argued December 3, 1984
Decided March 20, 1985
470 U.S. 768

Syllabus 
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) ""determine[s] questions of disability and dependency"" in administering the Federal Government's disability retirement program.  5 U.S.C.  8347(c).  Its ""decisions . . . concerning these matters are final and conclusive, and are not subject to review,"" ibid., except to the extent that administrative review by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) is provided by  8347(d)(1).  In 1979, petitioner, who was employed as a security guard at a naval shipyard, was informed by the Navy that he was to be retired on disability resulting from acute and chronic bronchitis, and he did not contest this assessment.  But several months after petitioner had been retired, OPM denied his application for a disability retirement annuity on the ground that the evidence failed to establish that his disability was severe enough to prevent him from performing his job.  Petitioner appealed to the MSPB, which sustained the denial.  He then filed a complaint in the Court of Claims, invoking jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C.  7703 (which at the time provided for review of MSPB decisions in that court and the regional courts of appeals) and the Tucker Act.  He alleged that the MSPB had violated its regulations by placing the burden of proving disability on him, rather than requiring the Navy to disprove disability, and that the Navy had dismissed him while he was attempting to obtain disability retirement benefits, in violation of regulations requiring an agency that initiates a disability retirement action to retain the employee pending OPM's resolution of the employee's disability status.  After  7703 was amended in 1982, the case was transferred to the Federal Circuit, which dismissed the complaint as barred by  8347(c).  The court concluded that the plain words of  8347(c), along with the structure of the civil service laws and the import of a 1980 amendment adding  8347(d)(2) -- which provides for both MSPB and judicial review of involuntary mental disability retirement decisions -- overcome the usual presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action, and, except as qualified by  8347(d)(2), preclude any judicial review of OPM decisions in voluntary disability retirement cases.  While acknowledging that courts had previously interpreted  8347(c) to permit judicial review 
Page 470 U. S. 769
 of alleged legal and procedural errors, the court found that such interpretation was wrong and, in any event, overruled by the 1980 amendment.
Held:
1. Section 8347(c) does not bar judicial review altogether of an MSPB judgment affirming OPM's denial of a disability retirement claim, but bars review only of factual determinations, while permitting review to determine whether
""there has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error 'going to the heart of the administrative determination.'""
Pp.  470 U. S. 778-791.
(a) It is ""only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence' of a contrary legislative intent"" that access to judicial review will be restricted.  Whether a statute precludes judicial review
""is determined not only from its express language, but also from the structure of the statutory scheme, its objectives, its legislative history, and the nature of the administrative action involved.""
Pp.  470 U. S. 778-779.
(b) While  8347(c) plausibly can be read as imposing an absolute bar to judicial review, it also quite naturally can be read as precluding review only of OPM's factual determinations about questions of disability and dependency.  Under this latter reading, the factual ""question"" whether an applicant is disabled is quite distinct from questions of what laws and procedures OPM must apply in administering the Civil Service Retirement Act.  In addition, the application of  8347(c) as completely preclusive is problematic when a disability applicant, as here, challenges not only OPM's determinations but also the standards and procedures used by the MSPB in reviewing those determinations.  Finally, Congress' failure to use the unambiguous and comprehensive language in  8347(c) that it typically uses when intending to bar all judicial review reinforces the possibility that the finality bar may extend only to OPM's factual determinations with respect to disability questions.  Pp.  470 U. S. 779-780.
(c) Under the Scroggins standard (so-called after Scroggins v. United States, 184 Ct.Cl. 530, 397 F.2d 295, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 952), courts prior to the 1980 amendment had interpreted  8347(c) as allowing for review of legal and procedural errors in disability retirement decisions.  There is nothing in the legislative history of the 1980 amendment adding  8347(d)(2) to suggest that Congress intended to discard the Scroggins standard. To the contrary, the legislative history demonstrates that Congress was well aware of the Scroggins standard, amended  8347 on its understanding that that standard applied to judicial review of disability retirement decisions generally, and intended that Scroggins review continue except to the extent augmented by the more exacting standards of  8347(d)(2).

2. The Federal Circuit has jurisdiction directly to review MSPB disability retirement decisions pursuant to the jurisdictional grants in 5 U.S.C.  7703(b)(1), providing that a petition to review a final decision of the MSPB shall be filed in the Federal Circuit, and 28 U.S.C.  1295(a)(9), providing the Circuit with exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from a final decision of the MSPB.  Pp.  470 U. S. 791-799.
(a) An applicant, such as petitioner, whose appeal is rejected by the MSPB is not required to file a Tucker Act suit in the Claims Court or a district court, and then seek review of any adverse decision in the Federal Circuit.  To require such a two-step judicial process would not accord with the jurisdictional framework established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) and the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 (FCIA).  Sections 7703(b)(1) and 1295(a)(9) together provide the Federal Circuit with exclusive jurisdiction over MSPB decisions, and do not admit any exceptions for disability retirement claims.  Pp.  470 U. S. 791-796.
(b) Congress in the FCIA intended to channel those Tucker Act cases in which the Court of Claims performed an appellate function into the Federal Circuit, and to leave cases requiring de novo factfinding in the Claims Court and district courts.  Review of an MSPB order involving a disability retirement claim not only is explicitly encompassed in the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction, but also makes logical sense, given that the court considers only legal and procedural questions, and does not review the factual bases of the administrative decision.  A contrary conclusion would result in exactly the sort of ""duplicative, wasteful and inefficient"" judicial review that the CSRA and FCIA were intended to eradicate.  Pp.  470 U. S. 796-799.

No. 83-6766
Argued January 9, 1985
Decided March 20, 1985
470 U.S. 811

Syllabus 
After concluding that petitioner was the principal suspect in a burglary-rape committed in Punta Gorda, Florida, the police, without a warrant, went to his home to obtain fingerprints.  Arriving at the home, the police spoke to petitioner on his front porch, and when he expressed reluctance to accompany them to the station house, one officer said that they would arrest him.  Petitioner replied that he would rather go to the station than be arrested.  He was then taken to the station and fingerprinted.  When it was determined that his prints matched those taken at the scene of the crime, he was arrested.  The trial court denied his pretrial motion to suppress the fingerprint evidence, and he was convicted.  The Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed, holding, although finding neither consent by petitioner to be taken to the station nor probable cause to arrest, that the police could transport petitioner to the station house and take his fingerprints on the basis of their reasonable suspicion that he was involved in the crime.
Held:  Where there was no probable cause to arrest petitioner, no consent to the journey to the police station, and no prior judicial authorization for detaining him, the investigative detention at the station for fingerprinting purposes violated petitioner's rights under the Fourth Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth; hence, the fingerprints taken were the inadmissible fruits of an illegal detention.  Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U. S. 721.  When the police, without probable cause or a warrant, forcibly remove a person from his home and transport him to the station, where he is detained, although briefly, for investigative purposes, such a seizure, at least where not under judicial supervision, is sufficiently like an arrest to invoke the traditional rule that arrests may constitutionally be made only on probable cause.

			"|"Hayes v. Florida
No. 83-6766
Argued January 9, 1985
Decided March 20, 1985
470 U.S. 811

Syllabus 
After concluding that petitioner was the principal suspect in a burglary-rape committed in Punta Gorda, Florida, the police, without a warrant, went to his home to obtain fingerprints.  Arriving at the home, the police spoke to petitioner on his front porch, and when he expressed reluctance to accompany them to the station house, one officer said that they would arrest him.  Petitioner replied that he would rather go to the station than be arrested.  He was then taken to the station and fingerprinted.  When it was determined that his prints matched those taken at the scene of the crime, he was arrested.  The trial court denied his pretrial motion to suppress the fingerprint evidence, and he was convicted.  The Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed, holding, although finding neither consent by petitioner to be taken to the station nor probable cause to arrest, that the police could transport petitioner to the station house and take his fingerprints on the basis of their reasonable suspicion that he was involved in the crime.
Held:  Where there was no probable cause to arrest petitioner, no consent to the journey to the police station, and no prior judicial authorization for detaining him, the investigative detention at the station for fingerprinting purposes violated petitioner's rights under the Fourth Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth; hence, the fingerprints taken were the inadmissible fruits of an illegal detention.  Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U. S. 721.  When the police, without probable cause or a warrant, forcibly remove a person from his home and transport him to the station, where he is detained, although briefly, for investigative purposes, such a seizure, at least where not under judicial supervision, is sufficiently like an arrest to invoke the traditional rule that arrests may constitutionally be made only on probable cause.  Pp.  470 U. S. 813-817.

Syllabus 
Respondent prison inmates were convicted of capital offenses and sentenced to death by lethal injection of drugs.  They petitioned the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), alleging that use of the drugs for such a purpose violated the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and requesting that the FDA take various enforcement actions to prevent those violations.  The FDA refused the request.  Respondents then brought an action in Federal District Court against petitioner Secretary of Health and Human Services, making the same claim and seeking the same enforcement actions.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner, holding that nothing in the FDCA indicated an intent to circumscribe the FDA's enforcement discretion or to make it reviewable.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Noting that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) only precludes judicial review of federal agency action when it is precluded by statute, 5 U.S.C.  701(a)(1), or ""committed to agency discretion by law,""  701(a)(2), the court held that  701(a)(2)'s exception applies only where the substantive statute leaves the courts with ""no law to apply,"" that here there was ""law to apply,"" that therefore the FDA's refusal to take enforcement action was reviewable, and that, moreover, such refusal was an abuse of discretion.
Held:  The FDA's decision not to take the enforcement actions requested by respondents was not subject to review under the APA.  Pp.  470 U. S. 827-838.
(a) Under  701(a)(2), judicial review of an administrative agency's decision is not to be had if the statute in question is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion.  In such a case, the statute (""law"") can be taken to have ""committed"" the decisionmaking to the agency's judgment absolutely.  An agency's decision not to take enforcement action is presumed immune from judicial review under  701(a)(2).  Such a decision has traditionally been ""committed to agency discretion,"" and it does not appear that Congress, in enacting the APA, intended to alter that tradition.  Accordingly, such a decision is unreviewable unless Congress has indicated an intent to circumscribe agency enforcement 
Page 470 U. S. 822
 discretion, and has provided meaningful standards for defining the limits of that discretion.  Pp. 827- 470 U. S. 835.
(b) The presumption that agency decisions not to institute enforcement proceedings are unreviewable under  701(a)(2) is not overcome by the enforcement provisions of the FDCA.  Those provisions commit complete discretion to the Secretary to decide how and when they should be exercised.  The FDCA's prohibition of ""misbranding"" of drugs and introduction of ""new drugs,"" absent agency approval, does not supply this Court with ""law to apply.""   Nor can the FDA's ""policy statement"" indicating that the agency considered itself ""obligated"" to take certain investigative actions be plausibly read to override the agency's rule expressly stating that the FDA Commissioner shall object to judicial review of a decision to recommend or not to recommend civil or criminal enforcement action.  And the section of the FDCA providing that the Secretary need not report for prosecution minor violations of the Act does not give rise to the negative implication that the Secretary is required to investigate purported, ""major"" violations of the Act.

No. 83-1362
Argued December 3, 1984
Decided March 19, 1985*
470 U.S. 532

Syllabus 
In No. 83-1362, petitioner Board of Education hired respondent Loudermill as a security guard.  On his job application, Loudermill stated that he had never been convicted of a felony.  Subsequently, upon discovering that he had in fact been convicted of grand larceny, the Board dismissed him for dishonesty in filling out the job application.  He was not afforded an opportunity to respond to the dishonesty charge or to challenge the dismissal.  Under Ohio law, Loudermill was a ""classified civil servant,"" and by statute, as such an employee, could be terminated only for cause, and was entitled to administrative review of the dismissal.  He filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission, which, after hearings before a referee and the Commission, upheld the dismissal some nine months after the appeal had been filed.  Although the Commission's decision was subject to review in the state courts, Loudermill instead filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the Ohio statute providing for administrative review was unconstitutional on its face because it provided no opportunity for a discharged employee to respond to charges against him prior to removal, thus depriving him of liberty and property without due process.  It was also alleged that the statute was unconstitutional as applied, because discharged employees were not given sufficiently prompt postremoval hearings.  The District Court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, holding that, because the very statute that created the property right in continued employment also specified the procedures for discharge, and because those procedures were followed, Loudermill was, by definition, afforded all the process due; that the post-termination hearings also adequately protected Loudermill's property interest; and that, in light of the Commission's crowded docket, the delay in processing his appeal was constitutionally acceptable.  In No. 83-1363, petitioner Board of Education fired respondent Donnelly from his job as a bus mechanic because he had 
Page 470 U. S. 533
 failed an eye examination.  He appealed to the Civil Service Commission, which ordered him reinstated, but without backpay.  He then filed a complaint in Federal District Court essentially identical to Loudermill's, and the court dismissed for failure to state a claim.  On a consolidated appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed in part and remanded, holding that both respondents had been deprived of due process and that the compelling private interest in retaining employment, combined with the value of presenting evidence prior to dismissal, outweighed the added administrative burden of a pretermination hearing.  But with regard to the alleged deprivation of liberty and Loudermill's 9-month wait for an administrative decision, the court affirmed the District Court, finding no constitutional violation.
Held:  All the process that is due is provided by a pretermination opportunity to respond, coupled with post-termination administrative procedures as provided by the Ohio statute; since respondents alleged that they had no chance to respond, the District Court erred in dismissing their complaints for failure to state a claim.  Pp.  470 U. S. 538-548.
(a) The Ohio statute plainly supports the conclusion that respondents possess property rights in continued employment.  The Due Process Clause provides that the substantive rights of life, liberty, and property cannot be deprived except pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures.  The categories of substance and procedure are distinct.  ""Property"" cannot be defined by the procedures provided for its deprivation.  Pp.  470 U. S. 538-541.
(b) The principle that, under the Due Process Clause, an individual must be given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant property interest requires ""some kind of hearing"" prior to the discharge of an employee who has a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment.  The need for some form of pretermination hearing is evident from a balancing of the competing interests at stake:  the private interest in retaining employment, the governmental interests in expeditious removal of unsatisfactory employees and the avoidance of administrative burdens, and the risk of an erroneous termination.  Pp.  470 U. S. 542-545.
(c) The pretermination hearing need not definitively resolve the propriety of the discharge, but should be an initial check against mistaken decisions essentially a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.  The essential requirements of due process are notice and an opportunity to respond.  Pp.  470 U. S. 545-546.
(d) The delay in Loudermill's administrative proceedings did not constitute a separate constitutional violation.  The Due Process Clause 
Page 470 U. S. 534
 requires provision of a hearing ""at a meaningful time,"" and here the delay stemmed in part from the thoroughness of the procedures.  Pp.  470 U. S. 546-547.

No. 83-1623
Argued December 3, 1984
Decided March 19, 1985
470 U.S. 564

Syllabus 
In 1975, respondent city set about to hire a new Recreation Director to manage the city's recreational facilities and to develop recreational programs.  A committee, consisting of four men and one woman, was responsible for choosing the Director.  Eight persons applied for the position, including petitioner, the only woman applicant.  At the time, petitioner was a 39-year-old schoolteacher with college degrees in social studies and education.  The committee offered the position to a 24-year-old male applicant, who had recently graduated from college with a degree in physical education.  The four men on the committee voted to offer the job to him, and only the woman voted for petitioner.  Petitioner then filed discrimination charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which, upon finding that there was reasonable cause to believe that petitioner's charges were true, invited the parties to engage in conciliation proceedings.  When these efforts proved unsuccessful, the EEOC issued petitioner a right-to-sue letter, and she filed an action in Federal District Court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  After a trial in which testimony from petitioner, the applicant who was hired, and members of the selection committee was heard, the court issued a memorandum announcing its finding that petitioner was entitled to judgment because she had been denied the position on account of her sex.  The memorandum requested petitioner to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law expanding upon those set forth in the memorandum.  When petitioner complied with this request, the court requested and received a response setting forth respondent's objections to the proposed findings.  The court then issued its own findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The court's finding that petitioner had been denied employment because of her sex was based on findings of fact that she was the most qualified candidate, that she had been asked questions during her interview regarding her spouse's feelings about her application for the position that other applicants were not asked, and that the male committee members were biased against hiring a woman.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court's findings were clearly erroneous and that the court had therefore erred in finding that petitioner had been discriminated against on account of sex. 
Page 470 U. S. 565

Held:  The Court of Appeals misapprehended and misapplied the clearly erroneous standard, and accordingly erred in denying petitioner relief under Title VII.  Pp.  470 U. S. 571-581.
(a) Where the District Court did not simply adopt petitioner's proposed findings, but provided respondent with an opportunity to respond to those findings, and the findings ultimately issued varied considerably from those proposed by petitioner, there is no reason to doubt that the ultimate findings represented the court's own considered conclusions or to subject those findings to a more stringent appellate review than is called for by the applicable rules.  Pp.  470 U. S. 571-573.
(b) Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) -- which provides that
""[f]indings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witness""
--
""[a] finding is 'clearly erroneous' when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.""
United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364,  333 U. S. 394-395.  If the district court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that, had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.  This is so even when the district court's findings do not rest on credibility determinations, but are based on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.  When findings are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses, Rule 52(a) demands even greater deference to the trial court's finding.  Pp.  470 U. S. 573-576.
(c) Application of the above principles to the facts of this case discloses that the Court of Appeals erred in its employment of the clearly erroneous standard.  The District Court's finding that petitioner was better qualified was entitled to deference, notwithstanding it was not based on credibility determinations, and the record contains nothing that mandates a holding that the finding was clearly erroneous.  As to the District Court's finding that petitioner was the only applicant asked questions regarding her spouse's feelings about her application for the position, the Court of Appeals erred in failing to give due regard to the District Court's ability to interpret and discern the credibility of oral testimony, especially that of the woman member of the selection committee, whose testimony the District Court felt supported the finding.  Given that that finding was not clearly erroneous, the District Court's finding of bias cannot be termed erroneous.  It is supported not only by the treatment of petitioner in her interview but also by the testimony of one committee member that he believed it would have been difficult for a woman to perform the job, and by evidence that another member solicited applications only from men.  Because the findings on which the 
Page 470 U. S. 566
 District Court based its finding of sex discrimination were not clearly erroneous, its finding of discrimination was also not clearly erroneous.  Pp.  470 U. S. 576-581.

(a) Where the District Court did not simply adopt petitioner's proposed findings, but provided respondent with an opportunity to respond to those findings, and the findings ultimately issued varied considerably from those proposed by petitioner, there is no reason to doubt that the ultimate findings represented the court's own considered conclusions or to subject those findings to a more stringent appellate review than is called for by the applicable rules.  Pp.  470 U. S. 571-573.
(b) Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) -- which provides that
""[f]indings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witness""
--
""[a] finding is 'clearly erroneous' when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.""
United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364,  333 U. S. 394-395.  If the district court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that, had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.  This is so even when the district court's findings do not rest on credibility determinations, but are based on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.  When findings are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses, Rule 52(a) demands even greater deference to the trial court's finding.  Pp.  470 U. S. 573-576.
(c) Application of the above principles to the facts of this case discloses that the Court of Appeals erred in its employment of the clearly erroneous standard.  The District Court's finding that petitioner was better qualified was entitled to deference, notwithstanding it was not based on credibility determinations, and the record contains nothing that mandates a holding that the finding was clearly erroneous.  As to the District Court's finding that petitioner was the only applicant asked questions regarding her spouse's feelings about her application for the position, the Court of Appeals erred in failing to give due regard to the District Court's ability to interpret and discern the credibility of oral testimony, especially that of the woman member of the selection committee, whose testimony the District Court felt supported the finding.  Given that that finding was not clearly erroneous, the District Court's finding of bias cannot be termed erroneous.  It is supported not only by the treatment of petitioner in her interview but also by the testimony of one committee member that he believed it would have been difficult for a woman to perform the job, and by evidence that another member solicited applications only from men.  Because the findings on which the 
Page 470 U. S. 566
 District Court based its finding of sex discrimination were not clearly erroneous, its finding of discrimination was also not clearly erroneous.  Pp.  470 U. S. 576-581.

Effective in 1980, a Georgia statute imposed a property tax on the fair market value of the shares of stockholders of banks.  The fair market value of a bank's share was to be determined by dividing the bank's net worth by the number of outstanding shares.  In calculating net worth, a bank was not allowed to deduct the value of United States obligations it held.  Appellant bank's predecessor in interest, nevertheless, in its 1980 tax return, deducted from its net worth the total value of the federal securities it held.  Appellee Bartow County Board of Tax Assessors disallowed the deduction.  The county Superior Court agreed.  The Georgia Supreme Court construed the Georgia statute to allow a bank to deduct from its net worth not the full value of United States obligations it held, but only the percentage of the federal obligations attributable to assets.

470 U.S. 598

Syllabus 
A July, 1980, Presidential Proclamation directed certain young male citizens to register with the Selective Service System during a specified week.  Petitioner fell within the prescribed class, but did not register.  Instead, he wrote letters to Government officials, including the President, stating that he had not registered and did not intend to do so.  These letters were added to a Selective Service file of young men who advised that they had failed to register or who were reported by others as having failed to register.  Subsequently, Selective Service adopted a policy of passive enforcement under which it would investigate and prosecute only the nonregistration cases contained in this file.  In furtherance of this policy, Selective Service, in June, 1981, sent a letter to each reported nonregistrant warning that a failure to register could result in criminal prosecution.  Petitioner received such a letter, but did not respond.  Thereafter, Selective Service transmitted to the Department of Justice, for investigation and potential prosecution, the names of petitioner and others identified under the passive enforcement policy.  The Department of Justice, after screening out those who appeared not to be required to register, referred the remaining names to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and appropriate United States Attorneys.  Petitioner's name was one of those so referred.  Then, pursuant to the Department of Justice's so-called ""beg"" policy, whereby United States Attorneys, assisted by the FBI, made an effort to persuade nonregistrants to change their minds, the United States Attorney for petitioner's district sent him a letter urging him to register or face possible prosecution.  Again petitioner failed to respond.  Nor did he register during an authorized grace period or after further urging by FBI agents to do so.  Accordingly, he was indicted for knowingly and willfully failing to register in violation of the Military Selective Service Act.  The District Court dismissed the indictment on the ground that the Government had failed to rebut petitioner's prima facie case of selective prosecution.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, although petitioner had shown that others similarly situated had not been prosecuted for conduct similar to his, he had not shown that the Government focused its investigation on him because of his protest activities. 
Page 470 U. S. 599

Held:  The Government's passive enforcement policy, together with its ""beg"" policy, did not violate either the First or Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  470 U. S. 607-614.
(a) Selective prosecution claims may appropriately be judged according to ordinary equal protection standards.  These standards require petitioner to show both that the passive enforcement policy had a discriminatory effect and that it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.  Petitioner has not met this burden.  All he has shown is that those eventually prosecuted, along with many not prosecuted, reported themselves as having violated the law.  He has not shown that the enforcement policy selected nonregistrants for prosecution on the basis of their speech.  The fact that the Government prosecuted those nonregistrants who reported themselves or who were reported by others demonstrates that the Government treated all reported nonregistrants equally, and did not subject vocal nonregistrants to any special burden.  But even if the passive policy had a discriminatory effect, petitioner has not shown that the Government intended such a result.  Absent a showing that the Government prosecuted petitioner because of his protest activities, his claim of selective prosecution fails.  Pp.  470 U. S. 607-610.
(b) With respect to the First Amendment, Government regulation is justified if (1) it is within the Government's constitutional power, (2) it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest, (3) the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free speech, and (4) the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.  United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367.  In this case, neither the first nor third requirement is disputed, and the passive enforcement policy meets both the second and fourth requirements.  The reasons the Government offers in defense of the passive enforcement policy -- it promotes prosecutorial efficiency, the nonregistrants' letters to Selective Service provided strong evidence of their intent not to comply, and prosecution of visible nonregistrants was an efficient way to promote general deterrence -- are sufficiently compelling to satisfy the second requirement as to either those who reported themselves or those who were reported by others.  The passive enforcement policy meets the fourth requirement, for it placed no more limitation on speech than was necessary to ensure registration, and was the only effective interim solution available to carry out the Government's compelling interest.

In earlier proceedings in this litigation, this Court, reversing the Court of Appeals' judgment, held that the Federal Government may recover misused funds from States that provided assurances that federal grants would be spent only on eligible programs under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, which provided for grants to support compensatory education for disadvantaged children in low-income areas.  Bell v. New Jersey, 461 U. S. 773.  However, the Court expressly declined to address the issue whether substantive provisions of the 1978 Amendments to the Act apply retroactively for determining if Title I funds were misused in earlier years.  On remand, New Jersey argued that the 1978 Amendments, which relaxed the eligibility requirements for local schools to receive Title I funds, should be applied in determining whether funds were misused during the years 1970-1972.  The Court of Appeals agreed, and remanded the case to petitioner Secretary of Education to determine whether the disputed expenditures conformed to the 1978 standards.
Held:   The substantive standards of the 1978 Amendments do not apply retroactively for determining if Title I funds were misused under previously made grants.  Pp.  470 U. S. 638-646.
(a) The Court of Appeals' reliance -- based on language from Bradley v. Richmond School Board, 416 U.

Both the nature of the obligations that arose under the Title I program and Bradley itself suggest that changes in substantive requirements for federal grants should not be presumed to operate retroactively.  Moreover, practical considerations related to the administration of federal grant programs imply that obligations generally should be determined by reference to the law in effect when the grants were made.  Retroactive application of changes in the substantive requirements of a federal grant program would deny both federal auditors and grant recipients fixed, predictable standards to determine if expenditures are proper.

(b) Neither the statutory language nor the legislative history indicates that Congress intended the substantive standards of the 1978

Both the general purpose of the 1978 Amendments to clarify and simplify provisions concerning implementation of Title I, and specific references in the statute and legislative history, suggest that the new requirements were intended to apply prospectively.

No. 83-1798
Argued January 8, 1985

470 U.S. 656

Syllabus 
Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, provided for federal grants to States to support compensatory education programs for disadvantaged children upon the States' assurances that the grants would be used only for eligible programs under Title I.  At the time of the grants involved in this case, both the statute and its implementing regulations required that Title I funds be used to supplement, not to supplant, state and local expenditures for education.  Federal auditors found that Kentucky had approved Title I programs for fiscal year 1974 -- involving ""readiness classes"" offered by some local education agencies for educationally disadvantaged children in place of regular first- and second-grade classes -- that violated the prohibitions on supplanting state and local expenditures.  Administrative proceedings ultimately resulted in a determination by the Secretary of Education (Secretary) that supplanting had occurred, and the Secretary demanded repayment from the State of the misused Title I funds.  In reviewing the administrative order, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Secretary's interpretation of the supplanting prohibitions was reasonable, and would govern subsequent grants, but concluded that it would be unfair to assess a penalty against Kentucky, since there was no evidence of bad faith and the disputed programs complied with a reasonable interpretation of the law.
Held:   The Secretary properly determined that Kentucky violated its assurances of compliance with Title I requirements by approving the ""readiness classes,"" and thereby misused Title I funds.  Pp.  470 U. S. 662-674.
(a) The Court of Appeals erred in characterizing the issue to be the fairness of imposing sanctions against the State for its failure to comply substantially with Title I requirements.  Although recovery of misused funds clearly is intended to promote compliance with the requirements of the grant program, a demand for repayment is more in the nature of an effort to collect upon a debt than a penal sanction.  Because of the nature of the obligation to repay misused funds, ""substantial compliance"" with applicable legal requirements does not affect liability.  Nor does the absence of bad faith absolve a State from liability if funds were in fact spent contrary to the terms of the grant agreement.  And recovery of 
Page 470 U. S. 657
 the misused funds was not barred on the asserted ground that the State did not accept the grant with ""knowing acceptance"" of its terms.  Title I clearly provided that States that chose to participate in the program agreed to abide by Title I's requirements as a condition for receiving funds.  Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, distinguished.  Pp.  470 U. S. 662-666.

Given the structure of the grant program, the Federal Government simply cannot prospectively resolve every possible ambiguity concerning particular applications of Title I's requirements.

			"|"Bennett v. Kentucky Department of Education
No. 83-1798
Argued January 8, 1985
Decided March 19, 1985
470 U.S. 656

Syllabus 
Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, provided for federal grants to States to support compensatory education programs for disadvantaged children upon the States' assurances that the grants would be used only for eligible programs under Title I.  At the time of the grants involved in this case, both the statute and its implementing regulations required that Title I funds be used to supplement, not to supplant, state and local expenditures for education.  Federal auditors found that Kentucky had approved Title I programs for fiscal year 1974 -- involving ""readiness classes"" offered by some local education agencies for educationally disadvantaged children in place of regular first- and second-grade classes -- that violated the prohibitions on supplanting state and local expenditures.  Administrative proceedings ultimately resulted in a determination by the Secretary of Education (Secretary) that supplanting had occurred, and the Secretary demanded repayment from the State of the misused Title I funds.  In reviewing the administrative order, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Secretary's interpretation of the supplanting prohibitions was reasonable, and would govern subsequent grants, but concluded that it would be unfair to assess a penalty against Kentucky, since there was no evidence of bad faith and the disputed programs complied with a reasonable interpretation of the law.
Held:   The Secretary properly determined that Kentucky violated its assurances of compliance with Title I requirements by approving the ""readiness classes,"" and thereby misused Title I funds.  Pp.  470 U. S. 662-674.
(a) The Court of Appeals erred in characterizing the issue to be the fairness of imposing sanctions against the State for its failure to comply substantially with Title I requirements.  Although recovery of misused funds clearly is intended to promote compliance with the requirements of the grant program, a demand for repayment is more in the nature of an effort to collect upon a debt than a penal sanction.  Because of the nature of the obligation to repay misused funds, ""substantial compliance"" with applicable legal requirements does not affect liability.  Nor does the absence of bad faith absolve a State from liability if funds were in fact spent contrary to the terms of the grant agreement.  And recovery of 
Page 470 U. S. 657
 the misused funds was not barred on the asserted ground that the State did not accept the grant with ""knowing acceptance"" of its terms.  Title I clearly provided that States that chose to participate in the program agreed to abide by Title I's requirements as a condition for receiving funds.  Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, distinguished.  Pp.  470 U. S. 662-666.
(b) In reviewing a determination by the Secretary that a State has misused Title I funds, a court should consider whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence and reflect an application of the proper legal standards.  Although, as asserted by Kentucky, Title I grant agreements have a contractual aspect, the program cannot be viewed in the same manner as a bilateral contract governing a discrete transaction, so as to require that any ambiguities with respect to the State's obligations invariably be resolved against the Federal Government as the party who drafted the grant agreement.

Syllabus 
The Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), as amended in 1972, provides compensation for the death or disability of any person engaged in ""maritime employment"" (status requirement), if the disability or death results from an injury incurred upon the navigable waters of the United States or any adjoining pier or other area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel (situs requirement).  Respondent Gray (hereinafter respondent), who worked for petitioner Herb's Welding, Inc., was injured while welding a gas flow line on a fixed offshore oil-drilling platform in Louisiana territorial waters.  When petitioner United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., the workers' compensation carrier for Herb's Welding, Inc., denied LHWCA benefits, respondent filed a complaint with the Department of Labor.  Administrative proceedings ultimately resulted in the conclusion that respondent could recover by virtue of a provision of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (Lands Act) that grants LHWCA benefits to offshore oil workers injured on the Outer Continental Shelf, since, even though respondent had been injured in state waters, rather than on the shelf, his injury could be said to have occurred ""as a result of"" operations on the shelf.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but relied directly on the LHWCA, rather than on the Lands Act, concluding that both the status and the situs requirements of the LHWCA were met.
Held:  Because respondent's employment was not ""maritime,"" he does not qualify for benefits under the LHWCA.  Pp.  470 U. S. 419-427.
(a) The Court of Appeals' construction of the LHWCA -- that offshore drilling is maritime commerce and that anyone performing any task that is part and parcel of that activity is in maritime employment for LHWCA purposes -- is foreclosed by earlier decisions of this Court, and the legislative history of both the 1972 Amendments to the LHWCA and the Lands Act.  Congress' purpose under the 1972 Amendments to the LHWCA was to cover those workers on a covered situs who are involved in the essential elements of the loading or unloading, or construction, of vessels.  Respondent's welding work was far removed from such traditional LHWCA activities.  Pp.  470 U. S. 421-426.
(b) The argument that to deny coverage to someone in respondent's position would result in the sort of inconsistent, checkered coverage that Congress sought to avoid in 1972 is not compelling.  The inconsistent 
Page 470 U. S. 415
 coverage here results primarily from the explicit geographic limitations to the Lands Act's incorporation of the LHWCA.  If Congress' coverage decisions are mistaken as a matter of policy, it is for Congress to change them.   470 U. S.  426-427.

Syllabus 
The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (Act or RPSA) was enacted in an attempt to revive the failing intercity passenger train industry.  For this purpose, the Act established the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), a private, for-profit corporation, authorized to operate, or contract with private railroads for the operation of, intercity rail passenger service.  Most private railroads offering such service entered into ""Basic Agreements"" with Amtrak, and thereby, as provided by the Act, shed their intercity rail passenger obligations.  Section 7.5 of each Basic Agreement, which concerned railroad employees' privileges to travel on Amtrak trains for free or at reduced fares, gave Amtrak discretion to determine such privileges.  When a controversy arose over Amtrak's decision to cut back on these privileges, Congress in 1972 added  405(f) to the RPSA to restore the privileges as they existed when Amtrak took over passenger rail service in 1971.  But  405(f) also required the railroads to pay, at a reimbursement rate determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission, for such costs as might be incurred by Amtrak in providing for the pass privileges.  In 1979, Congress decided that the ICC's reimbursement rate resulted in inadequate compensation to Amtrak, and accordingly amended  405(f) to require the railroads to reimburse Amtrak for pass-rider service at the rate of ""25 percent of the systemwide average monthly yield per revenue passenger mile"" for two years.  In 1981,  405(f) was again amended to provide that the 25 percent reimbursement requirement remain in effect indefinitely.  Five railroads filed suit against Amtrak in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of  405(f) on the grounds that the reimbursement requirement violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The United States intervened in the suit as a defendant.  The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Amtrak and the United States, holding that the Act did not constitute a contract between the United States and the railroads, that therefore 
Page 470 U. S. 452
  405(f) did not impair an obligation of the United States under a contract, and that, moreover,  405(f) did not impair the Basic Agreements.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the railroads could be compelled to reimburse Amtrak for the incremental cost of carrying the pass riders, but that the ""windfall"" to Amtrak under the 1979 amendment, whereby the railroads were required to pay more than the incremental cost, violated the Due Process Clause, because it unreasonably and illegally impaired the railroads' rights under the Basic Agreements.
Held:
1. Section 405(f) is constitutional.   470 U. S.  465-479.
(a) The RPSA does not constitute a binding obligation of Congress.  Neither the language of the Act nor the circumstances surrounding its passage manifest any intent on Congress' part to bind itself contractually to the railroads.  Pp.  470 U. S. 465-470.
(b) The Basic Agreements do not grant the railroads a contractual right against the United States to be free from all obligation to provide passenger service.  Those Agreements are not contracts between the railroads and the United States, but simply between the railroads and Amtrak.  Pp.  470 U. S. 470-471.
(c) Section 405(f)'s payment obligation does not unconstitutionally impair the railroads' private contractual rights under the Basic Agreements.  Those Agreements relieved the railroads only of common carriage responsibilities, and not of the responsibility to provide their employees with pass privileges, for no state or federal law imposed that responsibility on them, as common carriers, when the Agreements were executed.  It was not until after the Agreements were signed and Amtrak operations were underway that Congress imposed new obligations on both parties to the Agreements.  Pp.  470 U. S. 472-475.
(d) Even if the railroads have a private contractual right not to pay more than the incremental cost of the pass privileges, the Due Process Clause does not limit Congress' power to choose a different reimbursement scheme.  Congress' decision to assess the railroads was rational, and the railroads have not met their burden of proving irrationality, and thus have not proved a due process violation.  Pp.  470 U. S. 475-478.
2. The railroads have no contractual right to be free from the obligation to make any payments to Amtrak, even for incremental costs.

470 U.S. 480

Syllabus 
The Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act (Fund Act) offers the Presidential candidates of major political parties the option of receiving public financing for their general election campaigns.  If the candidate elects public financing, the Act, in 26 U.S.C.  9012(f), makes it a criminal offense for an independent ""political committee"" to expend more than $1,000 to further that candidate's election.  Believing that  9012(f) would prohibit appellee independent political committees' intended substantial expenditures in support of President Reagan's reelection in 1984, appellant Democratic Party and appellant Democratic National Committee (Democrats) filed an action in Federal District Court against appellees, seeking a declaration that  9012(f) is constitutional.  Appellant Federal Election Commission (FEC) brought a separate action against the same defendants seeking the same relief, and the two actions were consolidated.  The District Court held that the Democrats had standing under 26 U.S.C.  9011(b)(1) -- which authorizes the FEC, ""the national committee of any political party, and individuals eligible to vote for President"" to institute such actions ""as may be appropriate to implement or con[s]true any provisions of [the Fund Act]"" -- to seek the requested declaratory relief, but that the Democrats and the FEC were not entitled to a declaration that  9012(f) is constitutional.  The court then held  9012(f) unconstitutional on its face because it violated First Amendment freedoms of speech and association.
Held:
1. The Democrats lack standing under  9011(b)(1).   470 U. S.  484-489.
(a) Contrary to the Democrats' assertion that there is no need to resolve the issue of their standing, raised in the FEC's appeal, because the FEC clearly has standing and the legal issues and relief requested are the same in both actions, this Court will decide the issue.  It is squarely presented in the Democrats' appeal from the District Court's 
Page 470 U. S. 481
 determination that  9011(b)(1) is unconstitutional, and if the District Court's decision that the Democrats have standing is allowed to stand, it could seriously interfere with the FEC's exclusive jurisdiction to determine how and when to enforce the Fund Act.  Pp.  470 U. S. 484-486.
(b) The plain language of  9011(b)(1) and  306(b)(1) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) -- which provides that the FEC ""shall administer, seek to obtain compliance with, and formulate policy with respect to"" the Fund Act and confers on the FEC ""exclusive jurisdiction with respect to the civil enforcement"" of the Act -- clearly shows that the Democrats have no standing to bring a private action against another private party.  The Democratic Party is clearly not included within those authorized by  9011(b)(1) to bring an action.  And, while the Democratic National Committee is authorized to bring an action, the action must be ""appropriate"" to implement or construe the provision of the Fund Act at issue.  Reading  306(b)(1) of the FECA and 26 U.S.C.  9010(a) -- which authorizes the FEC to appear in and defend against any action filed under  9011 -- together with  9011, ""appropriate"" actions by private parties are those that do not interfere with the FEC's responsibilities for administering and enforcing the Fund Act.  Accordingly, private suits to construe or enforce the Act are inappropriate interference with those responsibilities.  Pp.  470 U. S. 486-489.
2. Section 9012(f) violates the First Amendment.  Pp.  470 U. S. 490-501.
(a) The expenditures at issue are squarely prohibited by  9012(f).  And, as producing speech at the core of the First Amendment and implicating the freedom of association, they are entitled to full protection under that Amendment.  Pp.  470 U. S. 490-496.
(b) Section 9012(f)'s limitation on independent expenditures by political committees is constitutionally infirm, absent any indication that such expenditures have a tendency to corrupt or to give the appearance of corruption.  But even assuming that Congress could fairly conclude that large-scale political action committees have a sufficient tendency to corrupt,  9012(f) is a fatally overbroad response to that evil.  It is not limited to multimillion dollar war chests, but applies equally to informal discussion groups that solicit neighborhood contributions to publicize their views about a particular Presidential candidate.  Pp.  470 U. S. 496-500.
(c) Section 9012(f) cannot be upheld as a prophylactic measure deemed necessary by Congress.  The groups and associations in question here, designed expressly to participate in political debate, are quite different from the traditional organizations organized for economic gain that may properly be prohibited from making contributions to political candidates.

Believing that  9012(f) would prohibit appellee independent political committees' intended substantial expenditures in support of President Reagan's reelection in 1984, appellant Democratic Party and appellant Democratic National Committee (Democrats) filed an action in Federal District Court against appellees, seeking a declaration that  9012(f) is constitutional.  Appellant Federal Election Commission (FEC) brought a separate action against the same defendants seeking the same relief, and the two actions were consolidated.  The District Court held that the Democrats had standing under 26 U.S.C.  9011(b)(1) -- which authorizes the FEC, ""the national committee of any political party, and individuals eligible to vote for President"" to institute such actions ""as may be appropriate to implement or con[s]true any provisions of [the Fund Act]"" -- to seek the requested declaratory relief, but that the Democrats and the FEC were not entitled to a declaration that  9012(f) is constitutional.  The court then held  9012(f) unconstitutional on its face because it violated First Amendment freedoms of speech and association.
Held:
1. The Democrats lack standing under  9011(b)(1).   470 U. S.  484-489.
(a) Contrary to the Democrats' assertion that there is no need to resolve the issue of their standing, raised in the FEC's appeal, because the FEC clearly has standing and the legal issues and relief requested are the same in both actions, this Court will decide the issue.  It is squarely presented in the Democrats' appeal from the District Court's 
Page 470 U. S. 481
 determination that  9011(b)(1) is unconstitutional, and if the District Court's decision that the Democrats have standing is allowed to stand, it could seriously interfere with the FEC's exclusive jurisdiction to determine how and when to enforce the Fund Act.  Pp.  470 U. S. 484-486.
(b) The plain language of  9011(b)(1) and  306(b)(1) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) -- which provides that the FEC ""shall administer, seek to obtain compliance with, and formulate policy with respect to"" the Fund Act and confers on the FEC ""exclusive jurisdiction with respect to the civil enforcement"" of the Act -- clearly shows that the Democrats have no standing to bring a private action against another private party.  The Democratic Party is clearly not included within those authorized by  9011(b)(1) to bring an action.  And, while the Democratic National Committee is authorized to bring an action, the action must be ""appropriate"" to implement or construe the provision of the Fund Act at issue.  Reading  306(b)(1) of the FECA and 26 U.S.C.  9010(a) -- which authorizes the FEC to appear in and defend against any action filed under  9011 -- together with  9011, ""appropriate"" actions by private parties are those that do not interfere with the FEC's responsibilities for administering and enforcing the Fund Act.  Accordingly, private suits to construe or enforce the Act are inappropriate interference with those responsibilities.  Pp.  470 U. S. 486-489.
2. Section 9012(f) violates the First Amendment.  Pp.  470 U. S. 490-501.
(a) The expenditures at issue are squarely prohibited by  9012(f).  And, as producing speech at the core of the First Amendment and implicating the freedom of association, they are entitled to full protection under that Amendment.  Pp.  470 U. S. 490-496.
(b) Section 9012(f)'s limitation on independent expenditures by political committees is constitutionally infirm, absent any indication that such expenditures have a tendency to corrupt or to give the appearance of corruption.  But even assuming that Congress could fairly conclude that large-scale political action committees have a sufficient tendency to corrupt,  9012(f) is a fatally overbroad response to that evil.  It is not limited to multimillion dollar war chests, but applies equally to informal discussion groups that solicit neighborhood contributions to publicize their views about a particular Presidential candidate.  Pp.  470 U. S. 496-500.
(c) Section 9012(f) cannot be upheld as a prophylactic measure deemed necessary by Congress.  The groups and associations in question here, designed expressly to participate in political debate, are quite different from the traditional organizations organized for economic gain that may properly be prohibited from making contributions to political candidates.  P.  470 U. S. 500.

No. 84-690
Decided March 18, 1985
470 U.S. 522

Syllabus 
At a recess during respondents' Federal District Court trial for participation in a cocaine distribution conspiracy, the bailiff informed the judge -- in the presence of respondents, their respective counsel, and the Assistant United States Attorney, but outside the jury's presence -- that one of the jurors had expressed concern because he had noticed respondent Gagnon sketching jurors during the trial.  After Gagnon's attorney admitted that Gagnon had been sketching jurors, the judge ordered that the practice cease immediately, and, upon such attorney's suggestion, the judge stated that she would speak with the juror in chambers.  No respondent filed any objection or requested to be present at the discussion in chambers.  At the in camera meeting, which Gagnon's counsel attended, the juror was informed that Gagnon was an artist and meant no harm, that the sketchings had been confiscated, and that Gagnon would sketch no more.  The juror, upon being questioned by the judge and by Gagnon's counsel, indicated his willingness to continue as an impartial juror.  The trial then resumed; a transcript of the in camera proceeding was made available to all of the parties; no objections to the proceeding or motions to disqualify the juror were made; and, after guilty verdicts were returned against all of the respondents, no post-trial motions concerning the incident were made.  On a consolidated appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed all of the respondents' convictions, holding that the in camera proceeding violated their rights under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 to be present ""at every stage of the trial,"" as well as their right to be present under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Held:
1. Respondents' rights under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause were not violated by the in camera discussion with the juror.  The defense has no constitutional right to be present at every interaction between a judge and a juror.  The right to presence, while rooted to a large extent in the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, is protected by the Due Process Clause in some situations where the defendant is not actually confronting witnesses or evidence against him.  However, a defendant's presence is a condition of due process only to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence.  Here, the presence of respondents and their counsel at the in camera 
Page 470 U. S. 523
 discussion was not required to ensure fundamental fairness or a reasonably substantial opportunity to defend against the charge.
2. Assuming that the conference with the juror was a ""stage of the trial"" for purposes of Rule 43, the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that respondents had not waived their rights under the Rule to be present at the conference.  Respondents neither requested to attend the conference nor, either before or after the conference, filed any objections to or motions concerning the conference.  A district court need not get an express waiver from a defendant for every trial conference which a defendant may have a right to attend.  The conclusion that respondents waived their Rule 43 rights comports both with the Rule's language and with the every-day practicalities of conducting a trial.
Certiorari granted; 721 F.2d 672, reversed.

This Court is certain to grant certiorari in the immediate future to resolve this issue, and our resolution will govern the question whether Witt's death sentence is constitutional. Under these circumstances, a denial of Witt's application for a stay is manifestly unjust.

 Witt was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. After exhausting Florida's postconviction remedies, he sought federal habeas corpus relief. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld Witt's conviction but reversed his sentence on the basis of Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968 ). Witt v. Wainwright, 714 F.2d 1069 (CA11 1983). This Court reversed and remanded. Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412d 841 (1985). A second federal habeas petition was filed in Federal District Court on February 26, 1985, while Witt was simultaneously exhausting state remedies. On March 1, 1985, the District Court denied habeas relief and an application for stay of execution pending appeal. On March 4, the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of habeas relief and denied an application for a stay of execution pending disposition of a petition for certiorari to this Court. On the same day Witt petitioned this Court for certiorari and applied for a stay of execution pending disposition of that petition. Barring a stay by this Court, Witt will be executed at 7 a.m. on March 6, 1985. 
 Witt alleges that his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated when the State submitted the general venire to a process of "" death-qualification."" The crux of Witt's argument is that the currently permissible, but constitutionally circumscribed, voir dire process in capital cases of excluding jurors opposed to the death penalty, see Wainwright v. Witt, supra, has the unconstitutional effect of rendering juries more predisposed to find a defendant guilty than would a jury from which those opposed to the death penalty had not been excused. This argument implicates both the right to an impartial jury and the right to a jury from which an identifiable segment of the community has not been excluded. See, e.g., Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 538, 701 (1975). 
 Witherspoon explicitly left open the question that Witt raises. The Court declined to address the question primarily because the empirical data then available were too fragmentary to permit conclusive resolution of the question whether ""death-qualified"" juries are unconstitutionally prone to convict.

Syllabus 
In 1981, respondent invested $160,000 in securities through petitioner broker-dealer.  The parties had a written agreement to arbitrate any disputes that might arise out of the account.  Thereafter, the value of the account declined by more than $100,000.  Respondent then filed an action against petitioner in Federal District Court, alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and of various state law provisions.  Petitioner filed a motion to compel arbitration of the pendent state claims under the parties' agreement and to stay arbitration pending resolution of the federal action.  Petitioner argued that the Federal Arbitration Act -- which provides that arbitration agreements
""shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for revocation of any contract""
-- required the District Court to compel arbitration of the state claims.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court erred in refusing to grant petitioner's motion to compel arbitration of the state claims.  Pp.  470 U. S. 216-224.
(a) The Arbitration Act requires district courts to compel arbitration of pendent arbitrable claims when one of the parties files a motion to compel, even when the result would be the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums.  By its terms, the Act leaves no room for the exercise of discretion by a district court, but instead mandates that district courts shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an arbitration agreement has been signed.  The Act's legislative history establishes that its principal purpose was to ensure judicial enforcement of privately made arbitration agreements, and not to promote the expeditious resolution of claims.  By compelling arbitration of state law claims, a district court successfully protects the parties' contractual rights and their rights under the Arbitration Act.  Pp.  470 U. S. 216-221.
(b) Neither a stay of arbitration proceedings nor joined proceedings is necessary to protect the federal interest in the federal court proceeding.  The formulation of collateral estoppel rules affords adequate protection to that interest.  Pp.  470 U. S. 221-223.

|470 u.s. 226|"County of Oneida, New York v. Oneida Indian Nation
of New York State
No. 83-1065
Argued October 1, 1984
Decided March 4, 1985*
470 U.S. 226

Syllabus 
Respondent Indian Tribes (hereafter respondents) brought an action in Federal District Court against petitioner counties (hereafter petitioners), alleging that respondents' ancestors conveyed tribal land to New York State under a 1795 agreement that violated the Nonintercourse Act of 1793 -- which provided that no person or entity could purchase Indian land without the Federal Government's approval -- and that thus the transaction was void.  Respondents sought damages representing the fair rental value, for a specified 2-year period, of that part of the land presently occupied by petitioners.  The District Court found petitioners liable for wrongful possession of the land in violation of the 1793 Act, awarded respondents damages, and held that New York, a third-party defendant brought into the case by petitioners' cross-claim, must indemnify petitioners for the damages owed to respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the liability and indemnification rulings, but remanded for further proceedings on the amount of damages.
Held:
1. Respondents have a federal common law right of action for violation of their possessory rights.  Pp.  470 U. S. 233-240.
(a) The possessory rights claimed by respondents are federal rights to the lands at issue.  Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661,  414 U. S. 671.  It has been implicitly assumed that Indians have a federal common law right to sue to enforce their aboriginal land rights, and their right of occupancy need not be based on a treaty, statute, or other Government action.  Pp.  470 U. S. 233-236.
(b) Respondents' federal common law right of action was not preempted by the Nonintercourse Acts.  In determining whether a federal statute preempts common law causes of action, the relevant inquiry is whether the statute speaks directly to the question otherwise answered by federal common law.  Here, the 1793 Act did not speak directly to the question of remedies for unlawful conveyances of Indian land, and there is no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to preempt common law remedies.  Milwaukee v. Illinois, 
Page 470 U. S. 227
 451 U. S. 304, distinguished.  And Congress' actions subsequent to the 1793 Act and later versions thereof demonstrate that the Acts did not preempt common law remedies.  Pp.  470 U. S. 236-240.
2. There is no merit to any of petitioners' alleged defenses.  Pp.  470 U. S. 240-250.
(a) Where, as here, there is no controlling federal limitations period, the general rule is that a state limitations period for an analogous cause of action will be borrowed and applied to the federal action, provided that application of the state statute would not be inconsistent with underlying federal policies.  In this litigation, the borrowing of a state limitations period would be inconsistent with the federal policy against the application of state statutes of limitations in the context of Indian claims.  Pp.  470 U. S. 240-244.
(b) This Court will not reach the issue of whether respondents' claims are barred by laches where the defense was unsuccessfully asserted at trial but not reasserted on appeal, and thus not ruled upon by the Court of Appeals.  Pp.  470 U. S. 244-245.
(c) Respondents' cause of action did not abate when the 1793 Act expired.  That Act merely codified the principle that a sovereign act was required to extinguish aboriginal title, and thus that a conveyance without the sovereign's consent was void ab initio.  All subsequent versions of the Act contain substantially the same restraint on alienation of Indian lands.  Pp.  470 U. S. 245-246.
(d) In view of the principles that treaties with Indians should be construed liberally in favor of the Indians, and that congressional intent to extinguish Indian title must be plain and unambiguous, and will not be lightly implied, the 1798 and 1802 Treaties in which respondents ceded additional land to New York are not sufficient to show that the United States ratified New York's unlawful purchase of the land in question.  Pp.  470 U. S. 246-248.
(e) Nor are respondents' claims barred by the political question doctrine.  Congress' constitutional authority over Indian affairs does not render the claims nonjusticiable, and, a fortiori, Congress' delegation of authority to the President does not do so either.  Nor have petitioners shown any convincing reasons for thinking that there is a need for ""unquestioning adherence"" to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs' declining to bring an action on respondents' behalf with respect to the claims in question.  Pp.  470 U. S. 248-250.
3. The courts below erred in exercising ancillary jurisdiction over petitioners' cross-claim for indemnity by the State.  The cross-claim raises a question of state law, and there is no evidence that the State has waived its constitutional immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to suit in federal court on this question.  Pp.  470 U. S. 250-253.

			"|"County of Oneida, New York v. Oneida Indian Nation
of New York State
No. 83-1065
Argued October 1, 1984
Decided March 4, 1985*
470 U.S. 226

Syllabus 
Respondent Indian Tribes (hereafter respondents) brought an action in Federal District Court against petitioner counties (hereafter petitioners), alleging that respondents' ancestors conveyed tribal land to New York State under a 1795 agreement that violated the Nonintercourse Act of 1793 -- which provided that no person or entity could purchase Indian land without the Federal Government's approval -- and that thus the transaction was void.  Respondents sought damages representing the fair rental value, for a specified 2-year period, of that part of the land presently occupied by petitioners.  The District Court found petitioners liable for wrongful possession of the land in violation of the 1793 Act, awarded respondents damages, and held that New York, a third-party defendant brought into the case by petitioners' cross-claim, must indemnify petitioners for the damages owed to respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the liability and indemnification rulings, but remanded for further proceedings on the amount of damages.
Held:
1. Respondents have a federal common law right of action for violation of their possessory rights.  Pp.  470 U. S. 233-240.
(a) The possessory rights claimed by respondents are federal rights to the lands at issue.  Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661,  414 U. S. 671.  It has been implicitly assumed that Indians have a federal common law right to sue to enforce their aboriginal land rights, and their right of occupancy need not be based on a treaty, statute, or other Government action.  Pp.  470 U. S. 233-236.
(b) Respondents' federal common law right of action was not preempted by the Nonintercourse Acts.  In determining whether a federal statute preempts common law causes of action, the relevant inquiry is whether the statute speaks directly to the question otherwise answered by federal common law.  Here, the 1793 Act did not speak directly to the question of remedies for unlawful conveyances of Indian land, and there is no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to preempt common law remedies.  Milwaukee v. Illinois, 
Page 470 U. S. 227
 451 U. S. 304, distinguished.  And Congress' actions subsequent to the 1793 Act and later versions thereof demonstrate that the Acts did not preempt common law remedies.  Pp.  470 U. S. 236-240.
2. There is no merit to any of petitioners' alleged defenses.  Pp.  470 U. S. 240-250.
(a) Where, as here, there is no controlling federal limitations period, the general rule is that a state limitations period for an analogous cause of action will be borrowed and applied to the federal action, provided that application of the state statute would not be inconsistent with underlying federal policies.  In this litigation, the borrowing of a state limitations period would be inconsistent with the federal policy against the application of state statutes of limitations in the context of Indian claims.  Pp.  470 U. S. 240-244.
(b) This Court will not reach the issue of whether respondents' claims are barred by laches where the defense was unsuccessfully asserted at trial but not reasserted on appeal, and thus not ruled upon by the Court of Appeals.  Pp.  470 U. S. 244-245.
(c) Respondents' cause of action did not abate when the 1793 Act expired.  That Act merely codified the principle that a sovereign act was required to extinguish aboriginal title, and thus that a conveyance without the sovereign's consent was void ab initio.  All subsequent versions of the Act contain substantially the same restraint on alienation of Indian lands.  Pp.  470 U. S. 245-246.
(d) In view of the principles that treaties with Indians should be construed liberally in favor of the Indians, and that congressional intent to extinguish Indian title must be plain and unambiguous, and will not be lightly implied, the 1798 and 1802 Treaties in which respondents ceded additional land to New York are not sufficient to show that the United States ratified New York's unlawful purchase of the land in question.  Pp.  470 U. S. 246-248.
(e) Nor are respondents' claims barred by the political question doctrine.  Congress' constitutional authority over Indian affairs does not render the claims nonjusticiable, and, a fortiori, Congress' delegation of authority to the President does not do so either.  Nor have petitioners shown any convincing reasons for thinking that there is a need for ""unquestioning adherence"" to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs' declining to bring an action on respondents' behalf with respect to the claims in question.  Pp.  470 U. S. 248-250.
3. The courts below erred in exercising ancillary jurisdiction over petitioners' cross-claim for indemnity by the State.  The cross-claim raises a question of state law, and there is no evidence that the State has waived its constitutional immunity under the Eleventh Amendment to suit in federal court on this question.  Pp.  470 U. S. 250-253.
719 F.2d 525, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

470 U.S. 274

Syllabus 
Appellee, a resident of Vermont, was allowed to take, and passed, the New Hampshire bar examination.  But pursuant to Rule 42 of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, which limits bar admission to state residents, she was not permitted to be sworn in.  After the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied appellee's request that an exception to the Rule be made in her case, she filed an action in Federal District Court, alleging that Rule 42 violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV,  2, of the United States Constitution.  The District Court agreed, and granted appellee's motion for a summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Rule 42 violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV,  2.  Pp.  470 U. S. 279-288.
(a) Derived, like the Commerce Clause, from the fourth of the Articles of Confederation, the Privileges and Immunities Clause was intended to create a national economic union.
""[O]ne of the privileges which the Clause guarantees to citizens of State A is that of doing business in State B on terms of substantial equality with the citizens of that State.""
Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 396.  Moreover, although a lawyer is ""an officer of the court,"" he does not hold a position that can be entrusted only to a ""full-fledged member of the political community"" and thus is not an ""officer"" of the State in any political sense.  In re Griffiths, 413 U. S. 717.  Therefore, a nonresident's interest in practicing law is a ""privilege"" protected by the Clause.  Pp.  470 U. S. 279-283.
(b) A State may discriminate against nonresidents only where its reasons are ""substantial"" and the difference in treatment bears a close or substantial relationship to those reasons.  None of the reasons offered by appellant for its refusal to admit nonresidents to the bar -- nonresidents would be less likely to keep abreast of local rules and procedures, to behave ethically, to be available for court proceedings, and to do pro bono and other volunteer work in the State -- meets the test of ""substantiality,"" and the means chosen do not bear the necessary relationship to the State's objectives.

No. 83-773
Argued October 3, 1984
Decided March 4, 1985
470 U.S. 298

Syllabus 
When officers of the Polk County, Ore., Sheriff's Office picked up respondent at his home as a suspect in a burglary, he made an incriminating statement without having been given the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  After he was taken to the station house, and after he was advised of and waived his Miranda rights, respondent executed a written confession.  In respondent's subsequent prosecution for burglary, the state trial court excluded from evidence his first statement because he had not been given Miranda warnings, but admitted the written confession.  Respondent was convicted, but the Oregon Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the confession should also have been excluded.  The court concluded that, because of the brief period separating respondent's initial, unconstitutionally obtained statement and his subsequent confession, the ""cat was sufficiently out of the bag to exert a coercive impact"" on respondent's confession, rendering it inadmissible.
Held:  The Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not require the suppression of a confession, made after proper Miranda warnings and a valid waiver of rights, solely because the police had obtained an earlier voluntary but unwarned admission from the suspect.  Pp.  470 U. S. 303-318.
(a) A procedural Miranda violation differs in significant respects from violations of the Fourth Amendment, which have traditionally mandated a broad application of the ""fruits"" doctrine that requires exclusion as ""fruit of the poisonous tree"" of evidence discovered as a result of an unconstitutional search.  The Fifth Amendment prohibits use by the prosecution in its case in chief only of compelled testimony, and failure to administer Miranda warnings creates a presumption of compulsion, requiring that unwarned statements that are otherwise voluntary within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment be excluded from evidence.  But the Miranda presumption does not require that fruits of otherwise voluntary statements be discarded as inherently tainted.  It is an unwarranted extension of Miranda to hold that a simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect's ability to exercise his free will, so taints the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period.  Pp.  470 U. S. 304-309. 
Page 470 U. S. 299

(b) The failure of police to administer Miranda warnings does not mean that the statements received have actually been coerced, but only that courts will presume the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination has not been intelligently exercised.  Absent deliberate coercion or improper tactics in obtaining an unwarned statement, a careful and thorough administration of Miranda warnings cures the condition that rendered the unwarned statement inadmissible.  The warnings convey the relevant information, and thereafter the suspect's choice whether to exercise his privilege to remain silent should ordinarily be viewed as an act of free will.  Endowing the psychological effects of voluntary unwarned admissions -- such as the psychological impact of the suspect's conviction that he has ""let the cat out of the bag"" -- with constitutional implications would, practically speaking, disable the police from obtaining the suspect's informed cooperation even when the official coercion proscribed by the Fifth Amendment played no part in either his warned or unwarned confessions.  Pp.  470 U. S. 309-314.
(c) Respondent knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent before he executed his written confession, and his earlier statement was voluntary, within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.  Neither the environment nor the manner of either ""interrogation"" was coercive.  To impose a requirement, suggested by respondent, that he should also have been given an additional warning at the station house that his prior statement could not be used against him, is neither practicable nor constitutionally necessary.  Pp.  470 U. S. 314-317.
(d) The dictates of Miranda and the goals of the Fifth Amendment proscription against use of compelled testimony are fully satisfied in the circumstances of this case by barring use of the unwarned statement in the case in chief.  No further purpose is served by imputing ""taint"" to subsequent statements obtained pursuant to a voluntary and knowing waiver.  Pp.  470 U. S. 317-318.

No. 83-1452
Argued December 4, 1984
Decided March 4, 1985
470 U.S. 373

Syllabus 
After being denied membership in respondent American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, petitioner orthopaedic surgeons each filed an action in an Illinois Circuit Court, alleging that the denial of membership violated their associational rights under Illinois common law.  After the Illinois Appellate Court ultimately held that the complaint in one action failed to state a cause of action, the Circuit Court then dismissed the other complaint.  Subsequently, petitioners filed an action in Federal District Court, alleging that the denial of membership constituted a boycott in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  Respondent filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that claim preclusion barred the federal antitrust claim because the state actions concerned the same facts and were dismissed with prejudice.  The District Court denied the motion, holding, in reliance on federal law, that the state judgments did not bar the Sherman Act claim.  Thereafter, the District Court held respondent in criminal contempt for refusing to comply with a discovery order as to its membership application files.  Respondent then appealed from the contempt order, and, while this appeal was pending, the District Court certified its denial of the motion to dismiss for immediate appeal.  The Court of Appeals authorized an interlocutory appeal and ordered it consolidated with the appeal from the contempt order.  Ultimately, the Court of Appeals held that, as a matter of federal law, claim preclusion barred the federal antitrust action, and reversed the contempt order because the discovery order was invalid.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to review the District Court's denial of the motion to dismiss.  The pendency of the appeal from the contempt order did not prevent the District Court from certifying such denial for immediate appeal.  Pp.  470 U. S. 378-379.
2. The courts below erred in not considering Illinois law in determining the preclusive effect of the state judgments.  Pp.  470 U. S. 379-386.
(a) Title 28 U.S.C.  1738 which provides that state judicial proceedings
""shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States . . . as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State . . . from which they are taken""
-- requires a federal court to look  
Page 470 U. S. 374
 first to state law in determining the preclusive effects of a state court judgment.  Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., 456 U. S. 461.  The fact that petitioners' antitrust claim is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts does not necessarily make  1738 inapplicable in this case.  While a state court will have no occasion to address the question whether a state judgment has issue or claim preclusive effect in a later action that can be brought only in federal court, a federal court may nevertheless rely in the first instance on state preclusion principles to determine the extent to which an earlier state judgment bars subsequent litigation.  Pp.  470 U. S. 379-382.
(b) Reference to state preclusion law may make it unnecessary to determine if a federal court, as an exception to  1738, should refuse to give preclusive effect to a state court judgment.  Here, unless application of Illinois preclusion law suggests that petitioners' federal antitrust claim is barred, there will be no need to decide if there is an exception to  1738.  This Court will not create a special exception to  1738 for federal antitrust claims that would give state court judgments greater preclusive effect than would the courts of the State rendering judgment, and that effectively holds as a matter of federal law that a plaintiff can bring state law claims initially in state court only at the cost of forgoing subsequent federal antitrust claims.  Pp.  470 U. S. 383-386.

Syllabus 
Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention makes air carriers liable for injuries sustained by a passenger
""if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.""
Respondent, while a passenger on petitioner's jetliner as it descended to land in Los Angeles on a trip from Paris, felt severe pressure and pain in her left ear, and the pain continued after the jetliner landed.  Shortly thereafter, respondent consulted a doctor, who concluded that she had become permanently deaf in her left ear.  She then filed suit in a California state court, alleging that her hearing loss was caused by negligent maintenance and operation of the jetliner's pressurization system.  After the case was removed to Federal District Court, petitioner moved for summary judgment on the ground that respondent could not prove that her injury was caused by an ""accident"" within the meaning of Article 17, the evidence indicating that the pressurization system had operated in a normal manner.  Relying on precedent that defines the term ""accident"" in Article 17 as an ""unusual or unexpected"" happening, the District Court granted summary judgment to petitioner.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the language, history, and policy of the Warsaw Convention and the Montreal Agreement (a private agreement among airlines that has been approved by the Federal Government) impose absolute liability on airlines for injuries proximately caused by the risks inherent in air travel; and that normal cabin pressure changes qualify as an ""accident"" within the definition contained in Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation as meaning ""an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft.""
Held:  Liability under Article 17 arises only if a passenger's injury is caused by an unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger, and not where the injury results from the passenger's own internal reaction to the usual, normal, and expected operation of the aircraft, in which case it has not been caused by an accident under Article 17.  Pp.  470 U. S. 396-408.
(a) The text of the Warsaw Convention suggests that the passenger's injury must be so caused.  The difference in the language of Article 17, imposing liability for injuries to passengers caused by an ""accident"" and 
Page 470 U. S. 393
 Article 18, imposing liability for destruction or loss of baggage by an ""occurrence,"" implies that the drafters of the Convention understood the word ""accident"" to mean something different than the word ""occurrence.""  Moreover, Article 17 refers to an accident which caused the passenger's injury, and not to an accident which is the passenger's injury.  The text thus implies that, however ""accident"" is defined, it is the cause of the injury that must satisfy the definition, rather than the occurrence of the injury alone.  And, since the Warsaw Convention was drafted in French by continental jurists, further guidance is furnished by the French legal meaning of ""accident"" -- when used to describe a cause of injury, rather than the event of injury -- as being a fortuitous, unexpected, unusual, or unintended event.  Pp. 397-400.
(b) The above interpretation of Article 17 is consistent with the negotiating history of the Warsaw Convention, the conduct of the parties thereto, and the weight of precedent in foreign and American courts.  Pp.  470 U. S. 400-405.
(c) While any standard requiring courts to distinguish causes that are ""accidents"" from causes that are ""occurrences"" requires drawing a line that may be subject to differences as to where it should fall, an injured passenger is only required to prove that some link in the chain of causes was an unusual or unexpected event external to the passenger.  Enforcement of Article 17's ""accident"" requirement cannot be circumvented by reference to the Montreal Agreement.  That Agreement, while requiring airlines to waive ""due care"" defenses under Article 20(1) of the Warsaw Convention, did not waive Article 17's ""accident"" requirement.  Nor can enforcement of Article 17 be escaped by reference to the equation of ""accident"" with ""occurrence"" in Annex 13, which, with its corresponding Convention, expressly applies to aircraft accident investigations, and not to principles of liability to passengers under the Warsaw Convention.

Syllabus 
Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention makes air carriers liable for injuries sustained by a passenger
""if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.""
Respondent, while a passenger on petitioner's jetliner as it descended to land in Los Angeles on a trip from Paris, felt severe pressure and pain in her left ear, and the pain continued after the jetliner landed.  Shortly thereafter, respondent consulted a doctor, who concluded that she had become permanently deaf in her left ear.

Syllabus 
Respondent railroad employee brought a personal injury action in a Missouri court against petitioner employer under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), alleging that a permanent disabling injury he received in a fall from a railroad car he was inspecting was the result of petitioner's negligence.  Respondent introduced evidence that his future wage losses would be about $1 million, and petitioner requested that the judge instruct the jury that, since respondent would have the use of any money awarded in a lump sum for loss of earnings in the future, the jury must determine the present value of the money awarded for such future loss.  The judge refused to submit the instruction, because such an instruction was not provided for in the Missouri Approved Instructions promulgated by the Missouri Supreme Court for use in FELA cases.  The jury found for respondent, awarding $1 million in damages, and the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  As a general matter, FELA cases adjudicated in state courts are subject to state procedural rules, but the propriety of jury instructions concerning the measure of damages in such cases is an issue of ""substance"" to be determined by federal law.  As a matter of federal law, a defendant in an FELA case is entitled to have the jury instructed that,
""when future payments or other pecuniary benefits are to be anticipated, the verdict should be made up on the basis of their present value only.""

In particular, Peralta sought to recover freight collected on vessels and not turned over to it, and money advanced by petitioner to pay suppliers but diverted by respondent. Addressing cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court on its own questioned its subject- matter jurisdiction.

Syllabus 
Under the Clean Water Act (Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to promulgate regulations establishing categories of pollution sources and setting effluent limitations for those categories.  Because of the difficulties involved in collecting adequate information to promulgate regulations, EPA has developed a ""fundamentally different factor"" (FDF) variance as a mechanism for ensuring that its necessarily rough-hewn categories of sources do not unfairly burden atypical dischargers of waste.  Any interested party may seek an FDF variance to make effluent limitations either more or less stringent if the standards applied to a given source, because of factors fundamentally different from those considered by EPA in setting the limitation, are either too lenient or too strict.  In a consolidated lawsuit, the Court of Appeals held that EPA was barred from issuing FDF variances from toxic pollutant effluent limitations by  301(1) of the Act, which provides that EPA may not ""modify"" any effluent limitation requirement of  301 insofar as toxic materials are concerned.  The court rejected EPA's view that  301(1) prohibits only modifications as to toxic materials otherwise permitted by other provisions of  301 on economic or water quality grounds, and that  301(1) does not address the issue of FDF variances.
Held:  The view of the agency charged with administering the statute is entitled to considerable deference, and EPA's understanding of the statute is sufficiently rational to preclude a court from substituting its judgment for that of EPA.  Pp.  470 U. S. 125-133.
(a) The statutory language does not foreclose EPA's view of the statute.  Although the word ""modify,"" if read in its broadest sense in  301(1), would encompass any change in effluent limitations, it makes little sense to construe the section to forbid EPA to amend its own standards, even to correct an error or to impose stricter requirements.  The word ""modify"" has no plain meaning as used in  301(1), and is the proper subject of construction by EPA and the courts.  Pp.  470 U. S. 125-126. 
Page 470 U. S. 117

(b) The legislative history does not evince an unambiguous congressional intent to forbid FDF waivers with respect to toxic materials.  An indication that Congress did not intend to forbid FDF waivers is its silence on the issue when it amended  301 with regard to waivers on other grounds.  Pp.  470 U. S. 126-129.
(c) EPA's construction of  301(1) as not prohibiting FDF variances is consistent with the Act's goals and operation.  EPA's regulation as to such variances explains that its purpose is to remedy categories that were not accurately drawn because information was either not available to or not considered by EPA in setting the original categories and limitations.  An FDF variance does not excuse compliance with a correct requirement, but instead represents an acknowledgment that not all relevant factors were taken sufficiently into account in framing that requirement originally, and that those relevant factors, properly considered, would have justified -- indeed, required -- the creation of a subcategory for the discharger in question.  The availability of FDF variances makes bearable the enormous burden faced by EPA in promulgating categories of sources and setting effluent limitations.  Pp.  470 U. S. 129-133.

O'CONNOR, J., filed a dissenting opinion, post, p.  470 U. S. 165. 
Page 470 U. S. 118

These cases present the question whether the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may issue certain variances from toxic pollutant effluent limitations promulgated under the Clean Water Act, 86 Stat. 816, as amended, 33 U.S.C.  1251 et seq. [Footnote 1]

As part of a consolidated lawsuit, respondent Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) sought a declaration that  301(1) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.  1311(1), prohibited EPA from issuing ""fundamentally different factor"" (FDF) variances for pollutants listed as toxic under the Act. [Footnote 2]  Petitioners EPA and Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) argued otherwise.  To understand the nature of this controversy, some background with respect to the statute and the case law is necessary.
The Clean Water Act, the basic federal legislation dealing with water pollution, assumed its present form as the result of extensive amendments in 1972 and 1977.  For direct dischargers -- those who expel waste directly into navigable waters -- the Act calls for a two-phase program of technology-based effluent limitations, commanding that dischargers comply with the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT) by July 1, 1977, and subsequently meet the generally more stringent effluent standard consistent with the best available technology economically achievable (BAT). [Footnote 3] 
Page 470 U. S. 119

Indirect dischargers -- those whose waste water passes through publicly owned treatment plants -- are similarly required to comply with pretreatment standards promulgated by EPA under  307 of the Act, 33 U.S.C.  1317(b), for pollutants not susceptible to treatment by sewage systems or which would interfere with the operation of those systems.  Relying upon legislative history suggesting that pretreatment standards are to be comparable to limitations for direct dischargers, see H.R.Rep. No. 95-830, p. 87 (1977), and pursuant to a consent decree, [Footnote 4] EPA has set effluent limitations for indirect dischargers under the same two-phase approach applied to those discharging waste directly into navigable waters.
Thus, for both direct and indirect dischargers, EPA considers specific statutory factors [Footnote 5] and promulgates regulations creating categories and classes of sources and setting uniform discharge limitations for those classes and categories.  Since 
Page 470 U. S. 120
 application of the statutory factors varies on the basis of the industrial process used and a variety of other factors, EPA has faced substantial burdens in collecting information adequate to create categories and classes suitable for uniform effluent limits, a burden complicated by the time deadlines it has been under to accomplish the task. [Footnote 6]  Some plants may find themselves classified within a category of sources from which they are, or claim to be, fundamentally different in terms of the statutory factors.  As a result, EPA has developed its FDF variance as a mechanism for ensuring that its necessarily rough-hewn categories do not unfairly burden atypical plants. [Footnote 7]  Any interested party may seek an FDF 
Page 470 U. S. 121
 variance to make effluent limitations either more or less stringent if the standards applied to a given source, because of factors fundamentally different from those considered by 
Page 470 U. S. 122
 EPA in setting the limitation, are either too lenient or too strict. [Footnote 8]
The 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act reflected Congress' increased concern with the dangers of toxic pollutants.  The Act, as then amended, allows specific statutory modifications of effluent limitations for economic and water 
Page 470 U. S. 123
 quality reasons in  301(c) and (g). [Footnote 9]  Section 301(1), however, added by the 1977 amendments, provides:
""The Administrator may not modify any requirement of this section as it applies to any specific pollutant which is on the toxic pollutant list under section 307(a)(1) of this Act.""
91 Stat. 1590.  In the aftermath of the 1977 amendments, EPA continued its practice of occasionally granting FDF variances for BPT 
Page 470 U. S. 124
 requirements.  The Agency also promulgated regulations explicitly allowing FDF variances for pretreatment standards [Footnote 10] and BAT requirements. [Footnote 11]  Under these regulations, EPA granted FDF variances, but infrequently. [Footnote 12]
As part of its consolidated lawsuit, respondent NRDC here challenged pretreatment standards for indirect dischargers and sought a declaration that  301(1) barred any FDF variance with respect to toxic pollutants. [Footnote 13]  In an earlier case, the Fourth Circuit had rejected a similar argument, finding that  301(1) was ambiguous on the issue of whether it applied to FDF variances, and therefore deferring to the administrative agency's interpretation that such variances were permitted.  Appalachian Power Co. v. Train, 620 F.2d 1040, 1047-1048 (1980).  Contrariwise, the Third Circuit here ruled in favor of NRDC, and against petitioners EPA and CMA, holding that  301(1) forbids the issuance of FDF variances for toxic pollutants.  National Assn. of Metal Finishers 
Page 470 U. S. 125
 v. EPA, 719 F.2d 624 (1983).  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict between the Courts of Appeals and to decide this important question of environmental law.  466 U.S. 957 (1984).  We reverse.

Section 301(1) states that EPA may not ""modify"" any requirement of  301 insofar as toxic materials are concerned.  EPA insists that  301(1) prohibits only those modifications expressly permitted by other provisions of  301, namely, those that  301(c) and  301(g) would allow on economic or water quality grounds.  Section 301(1), it is urged, does not address the very different issue of FDF variances.  This view of the agency charged with administering the statute is entitled to considerable deference; and to sustain it, we need not find that it is the only permissible construction that EPA might have adopted, but only that EPA's understanding of this very ""complex statute"" is a sufficiently rational one to preclude a court from substituting its judgment for that of EPA.  Train v. NRDC, 421 U. S. 60,  421 U. S. 75,  421 U. S. 87 (1975); See also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U. S. 837 (1984).  Of course, if Congress has clearly expressed an intent contrary to that of the Agency, our duty is to enforce the will of Congress.  Chevron, supra, at  467 U. S. 843, n. 9; SEC v. Sloan, 436 U. S. 103,  436 U. S. 117-118 (1978).
A
NRDC insists that the language of  301(1) is itself enough to require affirmance of the Court of Appeals, since on its face it forbids any modifications of the effluent limitations that EPA must promulgate for toxic pollutants.  If the word ""modify"" in  301(1) is read in its broadest sense, that is, to encompass any change or alteration in the standards, NRDC is correct.  But it makes little sense to construe the section to forbid EPA to amend its own standards, even to correct an error or to impose stricter requirements.  Furthermore, 
Page 470 U. S. 126
 reading  301(1) in this manner would forbid what  307(b)(2) expressly directs:  EPA is there required to ""revise"" its pretreatment standards ""from time to time, as control technology, processes, operating methods, or other alternatives change.""  As NRDC does and must concede, Tr. of Oral Arg. 25-26,  301(1) cannot be read to forbid every change in the toxic waste standards.  The word ""modify"" thus has no plain meaning as used in  301(1), and is the proper subject of construction by EPA and the courts.  NRDC would construe it to forbid the kind of alteration involved in an FDF variance, while the Agency would confine the section to prohibiting the partial modifications that  301(c) would otherwise permit.  Since EPA asserts that the FDF variance is more like a revision permitted by  307 than it is like a  301(c) or (g) modification, and since, as will become evident, we think there is a reasonable basis for such a position, we conclude that the statutory language does not foreclose the Agency's view of the statute.  We should defer to that view unless the legislative history or the purpose and structure of the statute clearly reveal a contrary intent on the part of Congress.  NRDC submits that the legislative materials evince such a contrary intent.  We disagree.
B
The legislative history of  301(1) is best understood in light of its evolution.  The 1972 amendments to the Act added  301(c), which allowed EPA to waive BAT and pretreatment requirements on a case-by-case basis when economic circumstances justified such a waiver.  Pub.L. 92-500, 86 Stat. 845.  In 1977, the Senate proposed amending  301(c) by prohibiting such waivers for toxic pollutants.  See S.1952, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 30 (1977), Leg.Hist. 584, [Footnote 14] and S.Rep. 
Page 470 U. S. 127
 No. 95-370, p. 44 (1977), Leg.Hist. 677.  At the same time, the Senate bill added what became  301(g), which allowed waivers from BAT and pretreatment standards where such waivers would not impair water quality, but which, like  301(c), prohibited waivers for toxic pollutants.  S.1952, at 28-29, Leg.Hist. 582-583. [Footnote 15]  The bill did not contain  301(1).  That section was proposed by the Conference Committee, which also deleted the toxic pollutant prohibition in  301(c) and redrafted  301(g) to prohibit water quality waivers for conventional pollutants and thermal discharges as well as for toxic pollutants. [Footnote 16]  While the Conference Committee Report did not explain the reason for proposing  301(1), Representative Roberts, the House floor manager, stated:
""Due to the nature of toxic pollutants, those identified for regulation will not be subject to waivers from or modification of the requirements prescribed under this section, specifically, neither section 301(c) waivers based on the economic capability of the discharger nor 301(g) waivers based on water quality considerations shall be available.""
Leg.Hist. 328-329 (emphasis added).
Another indication that Congress did not intend to forbid FDF waivers as well as  301(c) and (g) modifications is its silence on the issue.  Under NRDC's theory, the Conference Committee did not merely tinker with the wording of the Senate bill, but boldly moved to eliminate FDF variances.  But if that was the Committee's intention, it is odd that the 
Page 470 U. S. 128
 Committee did not communicate it to either House, for, only a few months before, we had construed the Act to permit the very FDF variance NRDC insists the Conference Committee was silently proposing to abolish.  In E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Train, 430 U. S. 112 (1977), we upheld EPA's class and category effluent limitations, relying on the availability of FDF waivers.  Id. at  430 U. S. 128.  Congress was undoubtedly aware of Du Pont, [Footnote 17] and absent an expression of legislative will, we are reluctant to infer an intent to amend the Act so as to ignore the thrust of an important decision.  Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantiqe, 443 U. S. 256,  443 U. S. 266-267 (1979). [Footnote 18] 
Page 470 U. S. 129
 NRDC argues that Congress' discussion of the Act's provisions supports its position.  Several legislators' comments seemed to equate ""modifications"" with ""waivers"" or ""variances."" [Footnote 19]  Many of these statements, however, came in the specific context of discussing the ""waiver"" provisions of  301(c) and (g), not the prohibition in  301(1).  See, e.g., 123 Cong.Rec. 39183-39184 (1977), Leg.Hist. 458, 461 (Sen. Muskie); 123 Cong.Rec. 38961 (1977), Leg.Hist. 331 (Rep. Roberts); S.Rep. No. 95-370, pp. 40-44, Leg.Hist. 673677 (discussing water quality based modifications).  Simply because Members of Congress or Committees referred to modifications authorized by  301(c) and (g) as ""variance"" provisions, does not mean that FDF variances are also modifications barred by  301(1).
After examining the wording and legislative history of the statute, we agree with EPA and CMA that the legislative history itself does not evince an unambiguous congressional intention to forbid all FDF waivers with respect to toxic materials.  Chevron, 467 U.S. at  467 U. S. 842-843, and n. 9.
C
Neither are we convinced that FDF variances threaten to frustrate the goals and operation of the statutory scheme set 
Page 470 U. S. 130
 up by Congress.  The nature of FDF variances has been spelled out both by this Court and by the Agency itself.  The regulation explains that its purpose is to remedy categories which were not accurately drawn because information was either not available to or not considered by the Administrator in setting the original categories and limitations.  40 CFR  403.13(b) (1984).  An FDF variance does not excuse compliance with a correct requirement, but instead represents an acknowledgment that not all relevant factors were taken sufficiently into account in framing that requirement originally, and that those relevant factors, properly considered, would have justified -- indeed, required -- the creation of a subcategory for the discharger in question.  As we have recognized, the FDF variance is a laudable corrective mechanism,
""an acknowledgment that the uniform . . . limitation was set without reference to the full range of current practices, to which the Administrator was to refer.""
EPA v. National Crushed Stone Assn., 449 U. S. 64,  449 U. S. 77-78 (1980).  It is, essentially, not an exception to the standard-setting process, but rather a more fine-tuned application of it. [Footnote 20]
We are not persuaded by NRDC's argument that granting FDF variances is inconsistent with the goal of uniform effluent limitations under the Act.  Congress did intend uniformity among sources in the same category, demanding that ""similar point sources with similar characteristics . . . meet similar effluent limitations,"" S.Rep. No. 92-1236, p. 126 (1972).  EPA, however, was admonished to take into account the diversity within each industry by establishing appropriate subcategories.  Leg.Hist. 455. 
Page 470 U. S. 131

NRDC concedes that EPA could promulgate rules under  307 of the Act [Footnote 21] creating a subcategory for each source which is fundamentally different from the rest of the class under the factors the EPA must consider in drawing categories.  The same result is produced by the issuance of an FDF variance for the same failure properly to subdivide a broad category. [Footnote 22]  Since the dispute is therefore reduced to an argument over the means used by EPA to define subcategories of indirect dischargers in order to achieve the goals of the Act, these are particularly persuasive cases for deference to the Agency's interpretation.  Cf. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U. S. 519,  435 U. S. 543 (1978); NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267,  416 U. S. 293 (1974).
NRDC argues, echoing the concern of the Court of Appeals below, that allowing FDF variances will render meaningless the  301(1) prohibition against modifications on the basis of economic and water quality factors.  That argument ignores the clear difference between the purpose of FDF waivers and that of  301(c) and (g) modifications, a difference we explained in National Crushed Stone.  A discharger that satisfies the requirements of  301(c) qualifies for a variance
""simply because [it] could not afford a compliance cost that is not fundamentally different from those the Administrator has already considered""
in creating a category and setting an effluent limitation.  449 U.S. at  449 U. S. 78.  A  301(c) modification forces
""a displacement of calculations already performed, not because those calculations were incomplete or had unexpected effects, but only because the costs happened to fall on 
Page 470 U. S. 132
 one particular operator, rather than on another who might be economically better off.""
Ibid.  FDF variances are specifically unavailable for the grounds that would justify the statutory modifications.  40 CFR  403.13(e)(3) and (4) (1984).  Both a source's inability to pay the foreseen costs, grounds for a  301(c) modification, and the lack of a significant impact on water quality, grounds for a  301(g) modification, are irrelevant under FDF variance procedures.  Ibid.; see also Crown Simpson Pulp Co. v. Costle, 642 F.2d 323 (CA9), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1053 (1981).
EPA and CMA point out that the availability of FDF variances makes bearable the enormous burden faced by EPA in promulgating categories of sources and setting effluent limitations.  Acting under stringent timetables, [Footnote 23] EPA must collect and analyze large amounts of technical information concerning complex industrial categories. [Footnote 24]  Understandably, 
Page 470 U. S. 133
 EPA may not be apprised of, and will fail to consider, unique factors applicable to atypical plants during the categorical rulemaking process, and it is thus important that EPA's nationally binding categorical pretreatment standards for indirect dischargers be tempered with the flexibility that the FDF variance mechanism offers, a mechanism repugnant to neither the goals nor the operation of the Act. [Footnote 25] 
Page 470 U. S. 134


Viewed in its entirety, neither the language nor the legislative history of the Act demonstrates a clear congressional intent to forbid EPA's sensible variance mechanism for tailoring the categories it promulgates.  In the absence of a congressional directive to the contrary, we accept EPA's conclusion that  301(1) does not prohibit FDF variances.  That interpretation gives the term ""modify"" a consistent meaning in  301(c), (g), and (1), and draws support from the legislative evolution of  301(1) and from congressional silence on whether it intended to forbid FDF variances altogether and thus to obviate our decision in Du Pont.
Here we are not dealing with an agency's change of position with the advent of a different administration, but rather with EPA's consistent interpretation since the 1970's. [Footnote 26]  NRDC argues that its construction of the statute is better supported by policy considerations.  But we do not sit to judge the relative wisdom of competing statutory interpretations.  Here EPA's construction, fairly understood, is not inconsistent with the language, goals, or operation of the Act.  Nor does the administration of EPA's regulation undermine the will of Congress. [Footnote 27]

It is so ordered.

[Footnote 2]
EPA is required, under  307(a)(1) of the Act, 33 U.S.C.  1317(a)(1), to publish a list of toxic pollutants.  Upon designation of a pollutant as toxic,  307(a)(2), 33 U.S.C.  1317(a)(2), requires EPA to set standards for its discharge.
[Footnote 3]
See E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Train, 430 U. S. 112,  430 U. S. 121 (1977).  BAT standards are set on the basis of categories and classes of sources under rules promulgated by the EPA under  304(b), 33 U.S.C.  1314(b).  Although the statute indicated that BPT standards be established for point sources, rather than categories of sources, we held in Du Pont that the EPA could also set BPT limitations on the basis of classes and categories, as long as allowance was made for variations in individual plants through a variance procedure.  430 U.S. at  430 U. S. 128.
[Footnote 4]
Lawsuits by NRDC resulted in a consent decree placing EPA under deadlines for promulgating categorical pretreatment standards based on BPT and BAT criteria.  NRDC v. Train, 8 ERC 2120, 6 Env.L.Rep. 20588 (DC 1976), modified sub nom. NRDC v. Costle, 12 ERC 1833, 9 Env.L.Rep. 20176 (DC 1979), modified sub nom. NRDC v.

In the 1977 amendments to the Act, Congress sanctioned this approach to establishing pretreatment standards for indirect dischargers.  Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Costle, 205 U.S.App.D.C. 101, 115-116, 636 F.2d 1229, 1243-1244 (1980).
[Footnote 5]
The factors relating to the assessment of BAT standards, set out in  304(b)(2)(B) of the Act, include the age of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed, the engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques, the cost of achieving effluent reduction, and nonwater quality environmental impacts.  33 U.S.C.  1314(b)(2)(B).

[Footnote 7]
The challenged FDF variance regulation with respect to indirect dischargers, 40 CFR  403.13 (1984), provides in relevant part:
"" 403.13  Variances from categorical pretreatment standards for fundamentally different factors.""
""(a) Definition.  The term 'Requester' means an Industrial User or a [publicly owned treatment work] or other interested person seeking a variance from the limits specified in a categorical Pretreatment Standard.""
""(b) Purpose and scope.  (1) In establishing categorical Pretreatment Standards for existing sources, the EPA will take into account all the information it can collect, develop and solicit regarding the factors relevant to pretreatment standards under section 307(b).  In some cases, information which may affect these Pretreatment Standards will not be available or, for other reasons, will not be considered during their development.  As a result, it may be necessary on a case-by-case basis to adjust the limits in categorical Pretreatment Standards, making them either more or less stringent, as they apply to a certain Industrial User within an industrial category or subcategory.  This will only be done if data specific to that Industrial User indicates it presents factors fundamentally different from those considered by EPA in developing the limit at issue.  Any interested person believing that factors relating to an Industrial User are fundamentally different from the factors considered during development of a categorical Pretreatment Standard applicable to that User and further, that the existence of those factors justifies a different discharge limit from that specified in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard, may request a fundamentally different factors variance under this section or such a variance request may be initiated by the EPA.""
""*    *    *    *"" 
""(c) Criteria -- (1) General Criteria.  A request for a variance based upon fundamentally different factors shall be approved only if:""
""(i) There is an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard which specifically controls the pollutant for which alternative limits have been requested; and""
""(ii) Factors relating to the discharge controlled by the categorical Pretreatment Standard are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA in establishing the Standards; and""
""(iii) The request for a variance is made in accordance with [applicable procedural requirements].""
""(2) Criteria applicable to less stringent limits.  A variance request for the establishment of limits less stringent than required by the Standard shall be approved only if:""
""(i) The alternative limit requested is no less stringent than justified by the fundamental difference;""
""(ii) The alternative limit will not result in a violation of prohibitive discharge standards prescribed by or established under  403.5;""
""(iii) The alternative limit will not result in a non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the Pretreatment Standards; and""
""(iv) Compliance with the Standards (either by using the technologies upon which the Standards are based or by using other control alternatives) would result in either:""
""(A) A removal cost (adjusted for inflation) wholly out of proportion to the removal cost considered during development of the Standards; or""
""(B) A non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the Standards.""
""(3) Criteria applicable to more stringent limits.  A variance request for the establishment of limits more stringent than required by the Standards shall be approved only if:""
""(i) The alternative limit request is no more stringent than justified by the fundamental difference; and""
""(ii) Compliance with the alternative limit would not result in either:""
""(A) A removal cost (adjusted for inflation) wholly out of proportion to the removal cost considered during development of the Standards; or""
""(B) A non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the Standards.""
""(d) Factors considered fundamentally different.  Factors which may be considered fundamentally different are:""
""(1) The nature or quality of pollutants contained in the raw waste load of the User's process wastewater:""
""(2) The volume of the User's process wastewater and effluent discharged;""
""(3) Non-water quality environmental impact of control and treatment of the User's raw waste load;""
""(4) Energy requirements of the application of control and treatment technology;""
""(5) Age, size, land availability, and configuration as they relate to the User's equipment or facilities; processes employed; process changes and engineering aspects of the application of control technology;""
""(6) Cost of compliance with required control technology.""
""(e) Factors which will not be considered fundamentally different.  A variance request or portion of such a request under this section may not be granted on any of the following grounds:""
""(1) The feasibility of installing the required waste treatment equipment within the time the Act allows;""
""(2) The assertion that the Standards cannot be achieved with the appropriate waste treatment facilities installed, if such assertion is not based on factors listed in paragraph (d) of this section;""
""(3) The User's ability to pay for the required waste treatment; or""
""(4) The impact of a Discharge on the quality of the [publicly owned treatment works'] receiving waters.""
The regulation also provides for public notice of the FDF application and opportunity for public comments and a public hearing.  EPA has promulgated an analogous provision for direct dischargers, 40 CFR  125.30 (1984).
[Footnote 8]
Sources subject to new source performance standards (NSPS) under the Act are those who begin construction after the publication of proposed new source standards, 33 U.S.C.  1316, and they are ineligible for FDF variances.  See 40 CFR  403.13(b) (1984).

33 U.S.C. 1311(c) and (g).  Those provisions explain in relevant part:
""(c) The Administrator may modify the requirements of [ 301's effluent limitations] with respect to any point source for which a permit application is filed after July 1, 1977, upon a showing by the owner or operator of such point source satisfactory to the Administrator that such modified requirements (1) will represent the maximum use of technology within the economic capability of the owner or operator; and (2) will result in reasonable further progress toward the elimination of the discharge of pollutants.""
""*    *    *    *"" 
""(g)(1) The Administrator, with the concurrence of the State, shall modify the requirements of [ 301's effluent limitations] with respect to the discharge of any pollutant (other than pollutants identified pursuant to section 1314(a)(4) of this title, toxic pollutants subject to section 1317(a) of this title, and the thermal component of discharges) from any point source upon a showing by the owner or operator of such a point source satisfactory to the Administrator that -- ""

""(C) such modification will not interfere with the attainment or maintenance of that water quality which shall assure protection of public water supplies, and the protection and propagation of a balanced population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife, and allow recreational activities, in and on the water and such modification will not result in the discharge of pollutants in quantities which may reasonably be anticipated to pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. . . .""
EPA and NRDC appear to be at odds as to whether  301(c) and  301(g) modifications are available to indirect dischargers, as well as direct dischargers.  Compare Brief for EPA 33, n. 23, and Reply Brief for EPA 2-3, with Brief for NRDC 29, and n. 41.  Resolution of the seeming disagreement is not necessary to adjudicate these cases.

NRDC acknowledges the limited availability of FDF variances.  Brief for NRDC in Opposition 7-8.  By 1977, only 50 of 4,000 major industrial dischargers covered by BPT limits had applied for FDF variances, and only two variances had been granted.  Id. at 12.  By 1984, a total of four FDF variances had been granted to direct dischargers, and none had been granted to an indirect discharger.  EPA estimates that, in the entire country, approximately 40 FDF variance requests filed by indirect dischargers are still pending.  Brief for EPA 36, n. 28.
[Footnote 13]
In the Court of Appeals, NRDC also argued that EPA had neither statutory nor inherent authority to issue FDF variances from either BAT or pretreatment standards, even when toxic pollutants were not involved.  The court below did not reach this argument, National Assn. of Metal Finishers v. EPA, 719 F.2d 624, 643-645 (1983), and we need not address it.  For present purposes, we assume, without deciding, that EPA would have authority under the Act to issue the FDF variances in question here absent the provisions of  301(1).

The 1977 House bill to amend the Clean Water Act contained no comparable water quality waiver provision.  H.R. 3199, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), Leg.Hist. 1167.
[Footnote 16]
In view of  301(1), the ban on toxic waste waivers in  301(g) was unnecessary.  But there can be no doubt that  301(1) forbade  301(c) and (g) modifications for toxic materials, and the presence of a similar ban in  301(g) lends little support for the notion that  301(1) forbids FDF variances.
[Footnote 17]
A representative of NRDC testified before Congress that a ""fundamental variance provision"" was integral to the Act's system of ""national, uniform, minimum effluent limitations.""  See Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1977, Hearings before the Subcommittee on Environmental Pollution, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., Ser. No. 95-H25, pt. 9, p. 37 (1977).
There is other evidence that both this Court's decision in Du Pont and an earlier decision of the Fourth Circuit approving variances that took all statutory factors into account in Appalachian Power Co. v. Train, 545 F.2d 1351 (1976), were brought to the attention of Congress during the debates on the 1977 amendments.  Referring to a Library of Congress report, Representative Clausen, ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources, stated during the House debate on the Conference Report to the final 1977 amendments that
""full understanding of [the 1972 Clean Water Act amendments] can only be achieved by having an understanding of the case law interpreting the public law.""
123 Cong.Rec. 38976 (1977), Leg.Hist. 374.  The Library of Congress report Senator Clausen referred to specifically discussed both Du Pont and Appalachian Power. See Case Law Under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Committee Print compiled for the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 95-35, pp. 20, 28 (1977).
[Footnote 18]
NRDC suggests that eliminating FDF variances would not overrule Du Pont, because the rationale for Du Pont's holding applied only to BPT standards.  Since BPT standards were due to be phased out, NRDC suggests, Congress had no reason to address Du Pont's requirements of FDF waivers.  Even if we were to accept NRDC's narrow reading of Du Pont -- and we recognize that the Du Pont opinion arguably applies to BAT standards as well, 430 U.S. at  430 U. S. 128; Brief for EPA 20-21 -- this argument ignores that the BPT regulations at issue in Du Pont contained a variance clause, and applied to pollutants that Congress declared toxic in the 1977 amendments.  See, e.g., 40 CFR  415.62 and 415.172 (1976).  Moreover, BPT standards remain in effect even today.  For many industries -- as a result of a consent decree authored in relevant part by NRDC -- EPA is required to promulgate BPT level pretreatment standards as an interim measure pending development of potentially more technology-forcing BAT standards.  See NRDC v. Train, 8 ERC, at 2128, 6 Env.L.Rep. at 20588.  The electroplating pretreatment standards unsuccessfully challenged in the consolidated lawsuit below were one such regulation.

[Footnote 20]
As EPA itself has explained:
""No discharger . . . may be excused from the Act's requirement to meet . . . a pretreatment standard through this variance clause.  A discharger may instead receive an individualized definition of such a . . . standard where the nationally prescribed limit is shown to be more or less stringent than appropriate for the discharger under the Act.""

[Footnote 22]
In the aftermath of the decision by the Court of Appeals below, EPA announced that it would entertain petitions for amended rulemaking by certain indirect dischargers previously eligible for FDF variances, explaining that, in such cases,
""it may be appropriate to issue specific categorical standards for such facilities, treating them as a separate subcategory with more, or less, stringent standards as appropriate.""
48 Fed.Reg. 52396 (1983).
[Footnote 23]
EPA was directed by  304(g) of the Act, 33 U.S.C.  1314(g), to publish promptly guidelines for the establishment of pretreatment standards and categories.  As with the statutory deadlines for the setting of guidelines for direct dischargers, 33 U.S.C.  1314(c), the time limits proved beyond the Agency's capability.  As a result of lawsuits brought by NRDC, EPA has been placed under court-ordered deadlines for promulgating effluent limitations.  See n 4, supra.
[Footnote 24]
Typically, EPA must engage in an extensive data-collection effort, compiling information on the pollutants discharged by an industry, the process employed, the treatment technologies used by the industry or available for use, the treatability of the pollutants, and the economics of the industry.  Often, the data indicate differences among segments of the industry, and EPA will establish subcategories to reflect those differences in the effluent limitations and standards that are promulgated.
The scope of the task of formulating national categorical standards is illustrated by the procedures followed by EPA in developing the BPT-level pretreatment standards for electroplating, which were unsuccessfully challenged in the consolidated lawsuit below.  Of the 500 plants identified as potentially within the category of sources and sent questionnaires by EPA, approximately 200 provided some of the requested information.  EPA conducted on-site visits of 82 of these in order to take samples of raw and treated waste water over several days, inspect treatment technology already in place, and collect other firsthand information.  From these visits, EPA determined that 25 of the plants were representative in treatment technology, character of raw waste water, and other factors.  The data from these plants were then used to derive achievable effluent limitations, using a combination of statistical methodologies and engineering judgments.  Brief for EPA 5, n. 3.
The FDF variances at issue here are available only for sources fundamentally different in a way which would have required EPA to place them initially in a separate category had their situation been considered.  EPA v. National Crushed Stone Assn., 449 U. S. 64,  449 U. S. 77-78 (1980).  Particularly in light of the limited availability of FDF variances, see n 12, supra, and the requirement that such variances are permissible only when standards were originally set after considering a range of facilities which did not include those similar to the source covered by the requested variance, we harbor no fear that the variance scheme will lead to the breakdown of the categorical approach taken by Congress, so long as the EPA, as it is required, grants variances only for sources fundamentally different.  40 CFR  403.13(b) (1984).  This does not allow EPA to single out for different treatment the least or most efficient plants legitimately within a category that was drawn after considering the relevant range of factors.
[Footnote 25]
In the aftermath of Du Pont, Congress well may have chosen to allow the FDF variance procedure in order to ensure that the Act's pretreatment standards were not overturned.  This Court has previously upheld regulations in part because of a provision for an exception or variance helped assure the parties of due process.  See United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corp., 406 U. S. 742,  406 U. S. 755 (1972); FPC v. Texaco, Inc., 377 U. S. 33,  377 U. S. 40-41 (1964); United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U. S. 192,  351 U. S. 205 (1956).  Other courts have found that the YDF variance procedure is critical to EPA's promulgation of treatment requirements of existing sources.  See, e.g., Kennecott Copper Corp. v. EPA, 612 F.2d 1232, 1243-1244 (CA10 1979) (upholding regulations challenged for failure to take the statutory factors into account across the industry, since FDF variance procedures were available to apply those factors to fundamentally different plants); Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Costle, 191 U.S.App.D.C. 309, 338-339, 590 F.2d 1011, 1040-1041 (1978) (upholding the promulgation of industry-wide effluent limitations because the ""crucial"" variance mechanism provided the necessary flexibility).

Syllabus 
Under the Clean Water Act (Act), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to promulgate regulations establishing categories of pollution sources and setting effluent limitations for those categories.  Because of the difficulties involved in collecting adequate information to promulgate regulations, EPA has developed a ""fundamentally different factor"" (FDF) variance as a mechanism for ensuring that its necessarily rough-hewn categories of sources do not unfairly burden atypical dischargers of waste.  Any interested party may seek an FDF variance to make effluent limitations either more or less stringent if the standards applied to a given source, because of factors fundamentally different from those considered by EPA in setting the limitation, are either too lenient or too strict.  In a consolidated lawsuit, the Court of Appeals held that EPA was barred from issuing FDF variances from toxic pollutant effluent limitations by  301(1) of the Act, which provides that EPA may not ""modify"" any effluent limitation requirement of  301 insofar as toxic materials are concerned.  The court rejected EPA's view that  301(1) prohibits only modifications as to toxic materials otherwise permitted by other provisions of  301 on economic or water quality grounds, and that  301(1) does not address the issue of FDF variances.
Held:  The view of the agency charged with administering the statute is entitled to considerable deference, and EPA's understanding of the statute is sufficiently rational to preclude a court from substituting its judgment for that of EPA.  Pp.  470 U. S. 125-133.
(a) The statutory language does not foreclose EPA's view of the statute.  Although the word ""modify,"" if read in its broadest sense in  301(1), would encompass any change in effluent limitations, it makes little sense to construe the section to forbid EPA to amend its own standards, even to correct an error or to impose stricter requirements.  The word ""modify"" has no plain meaning as used in  301(1), and is the proper subject of construction by EPA and the courts.  Pp.  470 U. S. 125-126. 
Page 470 U. S. 117

(b) The legislative history does not evince an unambiguous congressional intent to forbid FDF waivers with respect to toxic materials.  An indication that Congress did not intend to forbid FDF waivers is its silence on the issue when it amended  301 with regard to waivers on other grounds.  Pp.  470 U. S. 126-129.
(c) EPA's construction of  301(1) as not prohibiting FDF variances is consistent with the Act's goals and operation.  EPA's regulation as to such variances explains that its purpose is to remedy categories that were not accurately drawn because information was either not available to or not considered by EPA in setting the original categories and limitations.  An FDF variance does not excuse compliance with a correct requirement, but instead represents an acknowledgment that not all relevant factors were taken sufficiently into account in framing that requirement originally, and that those relevant factors, properly considered, would have justified -- indeed, required -- the creation of a subcategory for the discharger in question.  The availability of FDF variances makes bearable the enormous burden faced by EPA in promulgating categories of sources and setting effluent limitations.  Pp.  470 U. S. 129-133.

These cases present the question whether the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may issue certain variances from toxic pollutant effluent limitations promulgated under the Clean Water Act, 86 Stat. 816, as amended, 33 U.S.C.  1251 et seq. [Footnote 1]

As part of a consolidated lawsuit, respondent Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) sought a declaration that  301(1) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.  1311(1), prohibited EPA from issuing ""fundamentally different factor"" (FDF) variances for pollutants listed as toxic under the Act. [Footnote 2]  Petitioners EPA and Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) argued otherwise.  To understand the nature of this controversy, some background with respect to the statute and the case law is necessary.
The Clean Water Act, the basic federal legislation dealing with water pollution, assumed its present form as the result of extensive amendments in 1972 and 1977.  For direct dischargers -- those who expel waste directly into navigable waters -- the Act calls for a two-phase program of technology-based effluent limitations, commanding that dischargers comply with the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT) by July 1, 1977, and subsequently meet the generally more stringent effluent standard consistent with the best available technology economically achievable (BAT). [Footnote 3] 
Page 470 U. S. 119

Indirect dischargers -- those whose waste water passes through publicly owned treatment plants -- are similarly required to comply with pretreatment standards promulgated by EPA under  307 of the Act, 33 U.S.C.  1317(b), for pollutants not susceptible to treatment by sewage systems or which would interfere with the operation of those systems.  Relying upon legislative history suggesting that pretreatment standards are to be comparable to limitations for direct dischargers, see H.R.Rep. No. 95-830, p. 87 (1977), and pursuant to a consent decree, [Footnote 4] EPA has set effluent limitations for indirect dischargers under the same two-phase approach applied to those discharging waste directly into navigable waters.
Thus, for both direct and indirect dischargers, EPA considers specific statutory factors [Footnote 5] and promulgates regulations creating categories and classes of sources and setting uniform discharge limitations for those classes and categories.  Since 
Page 470 U. S. 120
 application of the statutory factors varies on the basis of the industrial process used and a variety of other factors, EPA has faced substantial burdens in collecting information adequate to create categories and classes suitable for uniform effluent limits, a burden complicated by the time deadlines it has been under to accomplish the task. [Footnote 6]  Some plants may find themselves classified within a category of sources from which they are, or claim to be, fundamentally different in terms of the statutory factors.  As a result, EPA has developed its FDF variance as a mechanism for ensuring that its necessarily rough-hewn categories do not unfairly burden atypical plants. [Footnote 7]  Any interested party may seek an FDF 
Page 470 U. S. 121
 variance to make effluent limitations either more or less stringent if the standards applied to a given source, because of factors fundamentally different from those considered by 
Page 470 U. S. 122
 EPA in setting the limitation, are either too lenient or too strict. [Footnote 8]
The 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act reflected Congress' increased concern with the dangers of toxic pollutants.  The Act, as then amended, allows specific statutory modifications of effluent limitations for economic and water 
Page 470 U. S. 123
 quality reasons in  301(c) and (g). [Footnote 9]  Section 301(1), however, added by the 1977 amendments, provides:
""The Administrator may not modify any requirement of this section as it applies to any specific pollutant which is on the toxic pollutant list under section 307(a)(1) of this Act.""
91 Stat. 1590.  In the aftermath of the 1977 amendments, EPA continued its practice of occasionally granting FDF variances for BPT 
Page 470 U. S. 124
 requirements.  The Agency also promulgated regulations explicitly allowing FDF variances for pretreatment standards [Footnote 10] and BAT requirements. [Footnote 11]  Under these regulations, EPA granted FDF variances, but infrequently. [Footnote 12]
As part of its consolidated lawsuit, respondent NRDC here challenged pretreatment standards for indirect dischargers and sought a declaration that  301(1) barred any FDF variance with respect to toxic pollutants. [Footnote 13]  In an earlier case, the Fourth Circuit had rejected a similar argument, finding that  301(1) was ambiguous on the issue of whether it applied to FDF variances, and therefore deferring to the administrative agency's interpretation that such variances were permitted.  Appalachian Power Co. v. Train, 620 F.2d 1040, 1047-1048 (1980).  Contrariwise, the Third Circuit here ruled in favor of NRDC, and against petitioners EPA and CMA, holding that  301(1) forbids the issuance of FDF variances for toxic pollutants.  National Assn. of Metal Finishers 
Page 470 U. S. 125
 v. EPA, 719 F.2d 624 (1983).  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict between the Courts of Appeals and to decide this important question of environmental law.  466 U.S. 957 (1984).  We reverse.

Section 301(1) states that EPA may not ""modify"" any requirement of  301 insofar as toxic materials are concerned.  EPA insists that  301(1) prohibits only those modifications expressly permitted by other provisions of  301, namely, those that  301(c) and  301(g) would allow on economic or water quality grounds.  Section 301(1), it is urged, does not address the very different issue of FDF variances.  This view of the agency charged with administering the statute is entitled to considerable deference; and to sustain it, we need not find that it is the only permissible construction that EPA might have adopted, but only that EPA's understanding of this very ""complex statute"" is a sufficiently rational one to preclude a court from substituting its judgment for that of EPA.  Train v. NRDC, 421 U. S. 60,  421 U. S. 75,  421 U. S. 87 (1975); See also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U. S. 837 (1984).  Of course, if Congress has clearly expressed an intent contrary to that of the Agency, our duty is to enforce the will of Congress.  Chevron, supra, at  467 U. S. 843, n. 9; SEC v. Sloan, 436 U. S. 103,  436 U. S. 117-118 (1978).
A
NRDC insists that the language of  301(1) is itself enough to require affirmance of the Court of Appeals, since on its face it forbids any modifications of the effluent limitations that EPA must promulgate for toxic pollutants.  If the word ""modify"" in  301(1) is read in its broadest sense, that is, to encompass any change or alteration in the standards, NRDC is correct.  But it makes little sense to construe the section to forbid EPA to amend its own standards, even to correct an error or to impose stricter requirements.  Furthermore, 
Page 470 U. S. 126
 reading  301(1) in this manner would forbid what  307(b)(2) expressly directs:  EPA is there required to ""revise"" its pretreatment standards ""from time to time, as control technology, processes, operating methods, or other alternatives change.""  As NRDC does and must concede, Tr. of Oral Arg. 25-26,  301(1) cannot be read to forbid every change in the toxic waste standards.  The word ""modify"" thus has no plain meaning as used in  301(1), and is the proper subject of construction by EPA and the courts.  NRDC would construe it to forbid the kind of alteration involved in an FDF variance, while the Agency would confine the section to prohibiting the partial modifications that  301(c) would otherwise permit.  Since EPA asserts that the FDF variance is more like a revision permitted by  307 than it is like a  301(c) or (g) modification, and since, as will become evident, we think there is a reasonable basis for such a position, we conclude that the statutory language does not foreclose the Agency's view of the statute.  We should defer to that view unless the legislative history or the purpose and structure of the statute clearly reveal a contrary intent on the part of Congress.  NRDC submits that the legislative materials evince such a contrary intent.  We disagree.
B
The legislative history of  301(1) is best understood in light of its evolution.  The 1972 amendments to the Act added  301(c), which allowed EPA to waive BAT and pretreatment requirements on a case-by-case basis when economic circumstances justified such a waiver.  Pub.L. 92-500, 86 Stat. 845.  In 1977, the Senate proposed amending  301(c) by prohibiting such waivers for toxic pollutants.  See S.1952, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 30 (1977), Leg.Hist. 584, [Footnote 14] and S.Rep. 
Page 470 U. S. 127
 No. 95-370, p. 44 (1977), Leg.Hist. 677.  At the same time, the Senate bill added what became  301(g), which allowed waivers from BAT and pretreatment standards where such waivers would not impair water quality, but which, like  301(c), prohibited waivers for toxic pollutants.  S.1952, at 28-29, Leg.Hist. 582-583. [Footnote 15]  The bill did not contain  301(1).  That section was proposed by the Conference Committee, which also deleted the toxic pollutant prohibition in  301(c) and redrafted  301(g) to prohibit water quality waivers for conventional pollutants and thermal discharges as well as for toxic pollutants. [Footnote 16]  While the Conference Committee Report did not explain the reason for proposing  301(1), Representative Roberts, the House floor manager, stated:
""Due to the nature of toxic pollutants, those identified for regulation will not be subject to waivers from or modification of the requirements prescribed under this section, specifically, neither section 301(c) waivers based on the economic capability of the discharger nor 301(g) waivers based on water quality considerations shall be available.""
Leg.Hist. 328-329 (emphasis added).
Another indication that Congress did not intend to forbid FDF waivers as well as  301(c) and (g) modifications is its silence on the issue.  Under NRDC's theory, the Conference Committee did not merely tinker with the wording of the Senate bill, but boldly moved to eliminate FDF variances.  But if that was the Committee's intention, it is odd that the 
Page 470 U. S. 128
 Committee did not communicate it to either House, for, only a few months before, we had construed the Act to permit the very FDF variance NRDC insists the Conference Committee was silently proposing to abolish.  In E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Train, 430 U. S. 112 (1977), we upheld EPA's class and category effluent limitations, relying on the availability of FDF waivers.  Id. at  430 U. S. 128.  Congress was undoubtedly aware of Du Pont, [Footnote 17] and absent an expression of legislative will, we are reluctant to infer an intent to amend the Act so as to ignore the thrust of an important decision.  Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantiqe, 443 U. S. 256,  443 U. S. 266-267 (1979). [Footnote 18] 
Page 470 U. S. 129
 NRDC argues that Congress' discussion of the Act's provisions supports its position.  Several legislators' comments seemed to equate ""modifications"" with ""waivers"" or ""variances."" [Footnote 19]  Many of these statements, however, came in the specific context of discussing the ""waiver"" provisions of  301(c) and (g), not the prohibition in  301(1).  See, e.g., 123 Cong.Rec. 39183-39184 (1977), Leg.Hist. 458, 461 (Sen. Muskie); 123 Cong.Rec. 38961 (1977), Leg.Hist. 331 (Rep. Roberts); S.Rep. No. 95-370, pp. 40-44, Leg.Hist. 673677 (discussing water quality based modifications).  Simply because Members of Congress or Committees referred to modifications authorized by  301(c) and (g) as ""variance"" provisions, does not mean that FDF variances are also modifications barred by  301(1).
After examining the wording and legislative history of the statute, we agree with EPA and CMA that the legislative history itself does not evince an unambiguous congressional intention to forbid all FDF waivers with respect to toxic materials.  Chevron, 467 U.S. at  467 U. S. 842-843, and n. 9.
C
Neither are we convinced that FDF variances threaten to frustrate the goals and operation of the statutory scheme set 
Page 470 U. S. 130
 up by Congress.  The nature of FDF variances has been spelled out both by this Court and by the Agency itself.  The regulation explains that its purpose is to remedy categories which were not accurately drawn because information was either not available to or not considered by the Administrator in setting the original categories and limitations.  40 CFR  403.13(b) (1984).  An FDF variance does not excuse compliance with a correct requirement, but instead represents an acknowledgment that not all relevant factors were taken sufficiently into account in framing that requirement originally, and that those relevant factors, properly considered, would have justified -- indeed, required -- the creation of a subcategory for the discharger in question.  As we have recognized, the FDF variance is a laudable corrective mechanism,
""an acknowledgment that the uniform . . . limitation was set without reference to the full range of current practices, to which the Administrator was to refer.""
EPA v. National Crushed Stone Assn., 449 U. S. 64,  449 U. S. 77-78 (1980).  It is, essentially, not an exception to the standard-setting process, but rather a more fine-tuned application of it. [Footnote 20]
We are not persuaded by NRDC's argument that granting FDF variances is inconsistent with the goal of uniform effluent limitations under the Act.  Congress did intend uniformity among sources in the same category, demanding that ""similar point sources with similar characteristics . . . meet similar effluent limitations,"" S.Rep. No. 92-1236, p. 126 (1972).  EPA, however, was admonished to take into account the diversity within each industry by establishing appropriate subcategories.  Leg.Hist. 455. 
Page 470 U. S. 131

NRDC concedes that EPA could promulgate rules under  307 of the Act [Footnote 21] creating a subcategory for each source which is fundamentally different from the rest of the class under the factors the EPA must consider in drawing categories.  The same result is produced by the issuance of an FDF variance for the same failure properly to subdivide a broad category. [Footnote 22]  Since the dispute is therefore reduced to an argument over the means used by EPA to define subcategories of indirect dischargers in order to achieve the goals of the Act, these are particularly persuasive cases for deference to the Agency's interpretation.  Cf. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U. S. 519,  435 U. S. 543 (1978); NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267,  416 U. S. 293 (1974).
NRDC argues, echoing the concern of the Court of Appeals below, that allowing FDF variances will render meaningless the  301(1) prohibition against modifications on the basis of economic and water quality factors.  That argument ignores the clear difference between the purpose of FDF waivers and that of  301(c) and (g) modifications, a difference we explained in National Crushed Stone.  A discharger that satisfies the requirements of  301(c) qualifies for a variance
""simply because [it] could not afford a compliance cost that is not fundamentally different from those the Administrator has already considered""
in creating a category and setting an effluent limitation.  449 U.S. at  449 U. S. 78.  A  301(c) modification forces
""a displacement of calculations already performed, not because those calculations were incomplete or had unexpected effects, but only because the costs happened to fall on 
Page 470 U. S. 132
 one particular operator, rather than on another who might be economically better off.""
Ibid.  FDF variances are specifically unavailable for the grounds that would justify the statutory modifications.  40 CFR  403.13(e)(3) and (4) (1984).  Both a source's inability to pay the foreseen costs, grounds for a  301(c) modification, and the lack of a significant impact on water quality, grounds for a  301(g) modification, are irrelevant under FDF variance procedures.  Ibid.; see also Crown Simpson Pulp Co. v. Costle, 642 F.2d 323 (CA9), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1053 (1981).
EPA and CMA point out that the availability of FDF variances makes bearable the enormous burden faced by EPA in promulgating categories of sources and setting effluent limitations.  Acting under stringent timetables, [Footnote 23] EPA must collect and analyze large amounts of technical information concerning complex industrial categories. [Footnote 24]  Understandably, 
Page 470 U. S. 133
 EPA may not be apprised of, and will fail to consider, unique factors applicable to atypical plants during the categorical rulemaking process, and it is thus important that EPA's nationally binding categorical pretreatment standards for indirect dischargers be tempered with the flexibility that the FDF variance mechanism offers, a mechanism repugnant to neither the goals nor the operation of the Act. [Footnote 25] 
Page 470 U. S. 134


Viewed in its entirety, neither the language nor the legislative history of the Act demonstrates a clear congressional intent to forbid EPA's sensible variance mechanism for tailoring the categories it promulgates.  In the absence of a congressional directive to the contrary, we accept EPA's conclusion that  301(1) does not prohibit FDF variances.  That interpretation gives the term ""modify"" a consistent meaning in  301(c), (g), and (1), and draws support from the legislative evolution of  301(1) and from congressional silence on whether it intended to forbid FDF variances altogether and thus to obviate our decision in Du Pont.
Here we are not dealing with an agency's change of position with the advent of a different administration, but rather with EPA's consistent interpretation since the 1970's. [Footnote 26]  NRDC argues that its construction of the statute is better supported by policy considerations.  But we do not sit to judge the relative wisdom of competing statutory interpretations.  Here EPA's construction, fairly understood, is not inconsistent with the language, goals, or operation of the Act.  Nor does the administration of EPA's regulation undermine the will of Congress.

EPA is required, under  307(a)(1) of the Act, 33 U.S.C.  1317(a)(1), to publish a list of toxic pollutants.  Upon designation of a pollutant as toxic,  307(a)(2), 33 U.S.C.  1317(a)(2), requires EPA to set standards for its discharge.
[Footnote 3]
See E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Train, 430 U. S. 112,  430 U. S. 121 (1977).  BAT standards are set on the basis of categories and classes of sources under rules promulgated by the EPA under  304(b), 33 U.S.C.  1314(b).  Although the statute indicated that BPT standards be established for point sources, rather than categories of sources, we held in Du Pont that the EPA could also set BPT limitations on the basis of classes and categories, as long as allowance was made for variations in individual plants through a variance procedure.  430 U.S. at  430 U. S. 128.
[Footnote 4]
Lawsuits by NRDC resulted in a consent decree placing EPA under deadlines for promulgating categorical pretreatment standards based on BPT and BAT criteria.  NRDC v. Train, 8 ERC 2120, 6 Env.L.Rep. 20588 (DC 1976), modified sub nom. NRDC v. Costle, 12 ERC 1833, 9 Env.L.Rep. 20176 (DC 1979), modified sub nom. NRDC v.

In the 1977 amendments to the Act, Congress sanctioned this approach to establishing pretreatment standards for indirect dischargers.  Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Costle, 205 U.S.App.D.C. 101, 115-116, 636 F.2d 1229, 1243-1244 (1980).
[Footnote 5]
The factors relating to the assessment of BAT standards, set out in  304(b)(2)(B) of the Act, include the age of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed, the engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques, the cost of achieving effluent reduction, and nonwater quality environmental impacts.  33 U.S.C.  1314(b)(2)(B).

The challenged FDF variance regulation with respect to indirect dischargers, 40 CFR  403.13 (1984), provides in relevant part:
"" 403.13  Variances from categorical pretreatment standards for fundamentally different factors.""
""(a) Definition.  The term 'Requester' means an Industrial User or a [publicly owned treatment work] or other interested person seeking a variance from the limits specified in a categorical Pretreatment Standard.""
""(b) Purpose and scope.  (1) In establishing categorical Pretreatment Standards for existing sources, the EPA will take into account all the information it can collect, develop and solicit regarding the factors relevant to pretreatment standards under section 307(b).  In some cases, information which may affect these Pretreatment Standards will not be available or, for other reasons, will not be considered during their development.  As a result, it may be necessary on a case-by-case basis to adjust the limits in categorical Pretreatment Standards, making them either more or less stringent, as they apply to a certain Industrial User within an industrial category or subcategory.  This will only be done if data specific to that Industrial User indicates it presents factors fundamentally different from those considered by EPA in developing the limit at issue.  Any interested person believing that factors relating to an Industrial User are fundamentally different from the factors considered during development of a categorical Pretreatment Standard applicable to that User and further, that the existence of those factors justifies a different discharge limit from that specified in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard, may request a fundamentally different factors variance under this section or such a variance request may be initiated by the EPA.""
""*    *    *    *"" 
""(c) Criteria -- (1) General Criteria.  A request for a variance based upon fundamentally different factors shall be approved only if:""
""(i) There is an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard which specifically controls the pollutant for which alternative limits have been requested; and""
""(ii) Factors relating to the discharge controlled by the categorical Pretreatment Standard are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA in establishing the Standards; and""
""(iii) The request for a variance is made in accordance with [applicable procedural requirements].""
""(2) Criteria applicable to less stringent limits.  A variance request for the establishment of limits less stringent than required by the Standard shall be approved only if:""
""(i) The alternative limit requested is no less stringent than justified by the fundamental difference;""
""(ii) The alternative limit will not result in a violation of prohibitive discharge standards prescribed by or established under  403.5;""
""(iii) The alternative limit will not result in a non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the Pretreatment Standards; and""
""(iv) Compliance with the Standards (either by using the technologies upon which the Standards are based or by using other control alternatives) would result in either:""
""(A) A removal cost (adjusted for inflation) wholly out of proportion to the removal cost considered during development of the Standards; or""
""(B) A non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the Standards.""
""(3) Criteria applicable to more stringent limits.  A variance request for the establishment of limits more stringent than required by the Standards shall be approved only if:""
""(i) The alternative limit request is no more stringent than justified by the fundamental difference; and""
""(ii) Compliance with the alternative limit would not result in either:""
""(A) A removal cost (adjusted for inflation) wholly out of proportion to the removal cost considered during development of the Standards; or""
""(B) A non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the Standards.""
""(d) Factors considered fundamentally different.  Factors which may be considered fundamentally different are:""
""(1) The nature or quality of pollutants contained in the raw waste load of the User's process wastewater:""
""(2) The volume of the User's process wastewater and effluent discharged;""
""(3) Non-water quality environmental impact of control and treatment of the User's raw waste load;""
""(4) Energy requirements of the application of control and treatment technology;""
""(5) Age, size, land availability, and configuration as they relate to the User's equipment or facilities; processes employed; process changes and engineering aspects of the application of control technology;""
""(6) Cost of compliance with required control technology.""
""(e) Factors which will not be considered fundamentally different.  A variance request or portion of such a request under this section may not be granted on any of the following grounds:""
""(1) The feasibility of installing the required waste treatment equipment within the time the Act allows;""
""(2) The assertion that the Standards cannot be achieved with the appropriate waste treatment facilities installed, if such assertion is not based on factors listed in paragraph (d) of this section;""
""(3) The User's ability to pay for the required waste treatment; or""
""(4) The impact of a Discharge on the quality of the [publicly owned treatment works'] receiving waters.""
The regulation also provides for public notice of the FDF application and opportunity for public comments and a public hearing.  EPA has promulgated an analogous provision for direct dischargers, 40 CFR  125.30 (1984).
[Footnote 8]
Sources subject to new source performance standards (NSPS) under the Act are those who begin construction after the publication of proposed new source standards, 33 U.S.C.  1316, and they are ineligible for FDF variances.  See 40 CFR  403.13(b) (1984).
[Footnote 9]
33 U.S.C. 1311(c) and (g).  Those provisions explain in relevant part:
""(c) The Administrator may modify the requirements of [ 301's effluent limitations] with respect to any point source for which a permit application is filed after July 1, 1977, upon a showing by the owner or operator of such point source satisfactory to the Administrator that such modified requirements (1) will represent the maximum use of technology within the economic capability of the owner or operator; and (2) will result in reasonable further progress toward the elimination of the discharge of pollutants.""
""*    *    *    *"" 
""(g)(1) The Administrator, with the concurrence of the State, shall modify the requirements of [ 301's effluent limitations] with respect to the discharge of any pollutant (other than pollutants identified pursuant to section 1314(a)(4) of this title, toxic pollutants subject to section 1317(a) of this title, and the thermal component of discharges) from any point source upon a showing by the owner or operator of such a point source satisfactory to the Administrator that -- ""

""(C) such modification will not interfere with the attainment or maintenance of that water quality which shall assure protection of public water supplies, and the protection and propagation of a balanced population of shellfish, fish, and wildlife, and allow recreational activities, in and on the water and such modification will not result in the discharge of pollutants in quantities which may reasonably be anticipated to pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. . . .""
EPA and NRDC appear to be at odds as to whether  301(c) and  301(g) modifications are available to indirect dischargers, as well as direct dischargers.  Compare Brief for EPA 33, n. 23, and Reply Brief for EPA 2-3, with Brief for NRDC 29, and n. 41.  Resolution of the seeming disagreement is not necessary to adjudicate these cases.
[Footnote 10]
40 CFR  403.13 (1984).  This variance regulation was issued on June 26, 1978, 43 Fed.Reg. 27736-27773, and amended on January 28, 1981, 46 Fed.Reg. 9404-9460.  The 1978 regulation differed in respects not relevant here.
[Footnote 11]
See 44 Fed.Reg. 32854, 32893-32894 (1979).
[Footnote 12]
NRDC acknowledges the limited availability of FDF variances.  Brief for NRDC in Opposition 7-8.  By 1977, only 50 of 4,000 major industrial dischargers covered by BPT limits had applied for FDF variances, and only two variances had been granted.  Id. at 12.  By 1984, a total of four FDF variances had been granted to direct dischargers, and none had been granted to an indirect discharger.  EPA estimates that, in the entire country, approximately 40 FDF variance requests filed by indirect dischargers are still pending.  Brief for EPA 36, n. 28.
[Footnote 13]
In the Court of Appeals, NRDC also argued that EPA had neither statutory nor inherent authority to issue FDF variances from either BAT or pretreatment standards, even when toxic pollutants were not involved.  The court below did not reach this argument, National Assn. of Metal Finishers v. EPA, 719 F.2d 624, 643-645 (1983), and we need not address it.  For present purposes, we assume, without deciding, that EPA would have authority under the Act to issue the FDF variances in question here absent the provisions of  301(1).

[Footnote 15]
The 1977 House bill to amend the Clean Water Act contained no comparable water quality waiver provision.  H.R. 3199, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), Leg.Hist. 1167.
[Footnote 16]
In view of  301(1), the ban on toxic waste waivers in  301(g) was unnecessary.  But there can be no doubt that  301(1) forbade  301(c) and (g) modifications for toxic materials, and the presence of a similar ban in  301(g) lends little support for the notion that  301(1) forbids FDF variances.
[Footnote 17]
A representative of NRDC testified before Congress that a ""fundamental variance provision"" was integral to the Act's system of ""national, uniform, minimum effluent limitations.""  See Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1977, Hearings before the Subcommittee on Environmental Pollution, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., Ser. No. 95-H25, pt. 9, p. 37 (1977).
There is other evidence that both this Court's decision in Du Pont and an earlier decision of the Fourth Circuit approving variances that took all statutory factors into account in Appalachian Power Co. v. Train, 545 F.2d 1351 (1976), were brought to the attention of Congress during the debates on the 1977 amendments.  Referring to a Library of Congress report, Representative Clausen, ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources, stated during the House debate on the Conference Report to the final 1977 amendments that
""full understanding of [the 1972 Clean Water Act amendments] can only be achieved by having an understanding of the case law interpreting the public law.""
123 Cong.Rec. 38976 (1977), Leg.Hist. 374.  The Library of Congress report Senator Clausen referred to specifically discussed both Du Pont and Appalachian Power. See Case Law Under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Committee Print compiled for the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 95-35, pp. 20, 28 (1977).
[Footnote 18]
NRDC suggests that eliminating FDF variances would not overrule Du Pont, because the rationale for Du Pont's holding applied only to BPT standards.  Since BPT standards were due to be phased out, NRDC suggests, Congress had no reason to address Du Pont's requirements of FDF waivers.  Even if we were to accept NRDC's narrow reading of Du Pont -- and we recognize that the Du Pont opinion arguably applies to BAT standards as well, 430 U.S. at  430 U. S. 128; Brief for EPA 20-21 -- this argument ignores that the BPT regulations at issue in Du Pont contained a variance clause, and applied to pollutants that Congress declared toxic in the 1977 amendments.  See, e.g., 40 CFR  415.62 and 415.172 (1976).  Moreover, BPT standards remain in effect even today.  For many industries -- as a result of a consent decree authored in relevant part by NRDC -- EPA is required to promulgate BPT level pretreatment standards as an interim measure pending development of potentially more technology-forcing BAT standards.  See NRDC v. Train, 8 ERC, at 2128, 6 Env.L.Rep. at 20588.  The electroplating pretreatment standards unsuccessfully challenged in the consolidated lawsuit below were one such regulation.
[Footnote 19]

[Footnote 20]
As EPA itself has explained:
""No discharger . . . may be excused from the Act's requirement to meet . . . a pretreatment standard through this variance clause.  A discharger may instead receive an individualized definition of such a . . . standard where the nationally prescribed limit is shown to be more or less stringent than appropriate for the discharger under the Act.""
44 Fed.Reg. 32854, 32893 (1979).
[Footnote 21]
33 U.S.C.  1317(b)(2).
[Footnote 22]
In the aftermath of the decision by the Court of Appeals below, EPA announced that it would entertain petitions for amended rulemaking by certain indirect dischargers previously eligible for FDF variances, explaining that, in such cases,
""it may be appropriate to issue specific categorical standards for such facilities, treating them as a separate subcategory with more, or less, stringent standards as appropriate.""
48 Fed.Reg. 52396 (1983).
[Footnote 23]
EPA was directed by  304(g) of the Act, 33 U.S.C.  1314(g), to publish promptly guidelines for the establishment of pretreatment standards and categories.  As with the statutory deadlines for the setting of guidelines for direct dischargers, 33 U.S.C.  1314(c), the time limits proved beyond the Agency's capability.  As a result of lawsuits brought by NRDC, EPA has been placed under court-ordered deadlines for promulgating effluent limitations.  See n 4, supra.
[Footnote 24]
Typically, EPA must engage in an extensive data-collection effort, compiling information on the pollutants discharged by an industry, the process employed, the treatment technologies used by the industry or available for use, the treatability of the pollutants, and the economics of the industry.  Often, the data indicate differences among segments of the industry, and EPA will establish subcategories to reflect those differences in the effluent limitations and standards that are promulgated.
The scope of the task of formulating national categorical standards is illustrated by the procedures followed by EPA in developing the BPT-level pretreatment standards for electroplating, which were unsuccessfully challenged in the consolidated lawsuit below.  Of the 500 plants identified as potentially within the category of sources and sent questionnaires by EPA, approximately 200 provided some of the requested information.  EPA conducted on-site visits of 82 of these in order to take samples of raw and treated waste water over several days, inspect treatment technology already in place, and collect other firsthand information.  From these visits, EPA determined that 25 of the plants were representative in treatment technology, character of raw waste water, and other factors.  The data from these plants were then used to derive achievable effluent limitations, using a combination of statistical methodologies and engineering judgments.  Brief for EPA 5, n. 3.
The FDF variances at issue here are available only for sources fundamentally different in a way which would have required EPA to place them initially in a separate category had their situation been considered.  EPA v. National Crushed Stone Assn., 449 U. S. 64,  449 U. S. 77-78 (1980).  Particularly in light of the limited availability of FDF variances, see n 12, supra, and the requirement that such variances are permissible only when standards were originally set after considering a range of facilities which did not include those similar to the source covered by the requested variance, we harbor no fear that the variance scheme will lead to the breakdown of the categorical approach taken by Congress, so long as the EPA, as it is required, grants variances only for sources fundamentally different.  40 CFR  403.13(b) (1984).  This does not allow EPA to single out for different treatment the least or most efficient plants legitimately within a category that was drawn after considering the relevant range of factors.
[Footnote 25]
In the aftermath of Du Pont, Congress well may have chosen to allow the FDF variance procedure in order to ensure that the Act's pretreatment standards were not overturned.  This Court has previously upheld regulations in part because of a provision for an exception or variance helped assure the parties of due process.  See United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corp., 406 U. S. 742,  406 U. S. 755 (1972); FPC v. Texaco, Inc., 377 U. S. 33,  377 U. S. 40-41 (1964); United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U. S. 192,  351 U. S. 205 (1956).  Other courts have found that the YDF variance procedure is critical to EPA's promulgation of treatment requirements of existing sources.  See, e.g., Kennecott Copper Corp. v. EPA, 612 F.2d 1232, 1243-1244 (CA10 1979) (upholding regulations challenged for failure to take the statutory factors into account across the industry, since FDF variance procedures were available to apply those factors to fundamentally different plants); Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Costle, 191 U.S.App.D.C. 309, 338-339, 590 F.2d 1011, 1040-1041 (1978) (upholding the promulgation of industry-wide effluent limitations because the ""crucial"" variance mechanism provided the necessary flexibility).

Syllabus 
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act provides that covered States or political subdivisions may not implement any election practices different from those in force on November 1, 1964, without first obtaining approval from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, alternatively, from the Attorney General.  As of November 1, 1964, the public schools of Hampton County, South Carolina, a covered jurisdiction, were governed by an appointed County Board of Education and an elected Superintendent of Education.  The county consists of two School Districts, one where the vast majority of white students live and the other predominantly black.  Each District was governed by a Board of Trustees, who were appointed by the County Board of Education.  In 1982, the South Carolina General Assembly enacted Act No. 547, providing that the members of the County Board of Education were to be elected at large, rather than appointed.  The first election was to be held simultaneously with the general election in November, 1982, and prospective candidates were required to file with appellee Election Commission at least 45 days before the election.  Act No. 547 was submitted to the Attorney General for approval under  5 of the Voting Rights Act, and he informed the State that he had no objection to the change.  But in the meantime, before the Attorney General had approved Act No. 547, Act No. 549 was enacted to abolish the County Board of Education and Superintendent and to devolve their duties upon the District Boards of Trustees, which were to be elected separately.  The first trustee election was also scheduled to be held with the November general election, and candidates were required to file between August 16 and 31.  Act No. 549 was also submitted to the Attorney General for clearance under  5, and he initially interposed an objection.  Nevertheless, the Election Commission, contemplating a reconsideration, continued to accept candidate filings under Act No. 549, and at the same time began accepting filings under Act No. 547.  Since the Attorney General had not yet responded to the State's request for reconsideration of his objection to Act No. 549 by the date of the November general election, elections for the County Board of Education were held on that date 
Page 470 U. S. 167
 pursuant to Act No. 547, and no elections were held pursuant to Act No. 549.  Thereafter the Attorney General withdrew his objection to Act No. 549, thereby rendering null and void Act No. 547 and the November elections held pursuant thereto.  The South Carolina Attorney General then informed the Election Commission that Act No. 549 was in effect, and that an election pursuant thereto should be held.  Accordingly, the Commission set March 15, 1983, as election day.  Appellants, two civil rights organizations and several residents of Hampton County, filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking to enjoin the election as illegal under  5 of the Voting Rights Act.  The court denied relief, holding that no violation of  5 had occurred, since, although Act No. 549 itself was a change under the Voting Rights Act, the scheduling of the election and the filing period were simply ""ministerial acts necessary to accomplish the statute's purpose, and thus did not require preclearance.""  The court further held that, even if these acts were ""changes,"" they had now been precleared along with the remaining provisions of Act No. 549.
Held:  The use of an August filing period in conjunction with a March election, and the setting of the March election itself, were changes that should have been submitted to the Attorney General under  5 of the Voting Rights Act.  Pp.  470 U. S. 174-183.
(a) By opening the filing period for School District Trustees before preclearance and scheduling the election for a date four months later than that approved by the Attorney General, the county effectively altered the filing deadline from a date approximately two months before the election to one that was almost six months before the election.  These changes cannot fairly be characterized as ""ministerial"" in light of the sweeping objectives of the Voting Rights Act.  They possibly prevented relative latecomers from entering the race, and, in addition, a March election is likely to draw significantly fewer voters than an election held simultaneously with a November general election.  The inquiry here is limited to whether the challenged changes have the potential for discrimination.  These changes did have such a potential, and therefore should have been precleared under  5.  Pp.  470 U. S. 174-181.
(b) The changes cannot be said to have been implicitly approved when the Attorney General withdrew his objection to Act No. 549.  Berry v. Doles, 438 U.S. 190, distinguished.  Nor can the Attorney General be said to have validated the changes, retroactively or otherwise, because they were never before him.  Pp.  470 U. S. 181-182.

No. 83-1097
Argued October 9, 1984
Decided February 27, 1985
470 U.S. 184

Syllabus 
Section 402(a)(7)(A) of the Social Security Act (Act) provides that the responsible agency of a State participating in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program must, in determining a family's need, take into consideration ""any other income and resources"" of the family.  Before 1981,  402(a)(7) also required the state agency to consider any ""expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of any such income,"" and under such provision virtually all States deducted mandatory payroll-tax withholdings in determining ""income.""  In 1981, the Act was amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) so as to (1) eliminate the requirement of  402(a)(7) that the State consider expenses ""reasonably attributable"" to the earning of income, and (2) provide in  402(a)(8)(A)(ii) that the state agency shall ""disregard from the earned income"" a monthly flat sum of $75.  Petitioner Secretary of Health and Human Services then advised the responsible state agencies that mandatory payroll deductions were to be included in the new $75 work expense disregard, which was to be taken from gross, rather than net, income, and the State of California issued regulations implementing petitioner's directions.  In a class action in Federal District Court challenging the California regulations, the court held that the regulations misconstrued the term ""income"" in  402(a)(7) to mean gross income, rather than net income, and thereby incorrectly subsumed mandatory tax withholdings within the work expenses covered by the flat-sum disregard of  402(a)(8)(A)(ii), rather than independently deducting such withholdings when calculating income under  402(a)(7).  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  In calculating a family's need for AFDC benefits, the responsible state agency must treat mandatory tax withholdings as a work expense encompassed within the flat-sum disregard of  402(a)(8)(A)(ii), rather than as a separate deduction in determining ""income"" under  402(a)(7) (A).  Pp.  470 U. S. 193-212.
(a) The Act makes no explicit provision for the deduction of mandatory payroll-tax withholdings, nor does it qualify the meaning of income.  But a common-sense meaning of ""earned income,"" as reflected in existing regulations, includes tax withholdings since portions of salary or wages 
Page 470 U. S. 185
 withheld to meet tax obligations are ""earned.""  Since earned income includes tax withholdings, so, too, does the broader category of ""income.""  The congressional Reports accompanying the OBRA amendments make clear that Congress provided the flat-sum disregard in lieu of itemized work expenses, and there is no support in the statutory language or structure for any inference that Congress contemplated an additional but unmentioned deduction for tax liabilities.  The administrative background against which the OBRA Congress worked also supports the conclusion that mandatory tax withholdings were among the items Congress intended to include within the flat-sum disregard.  Pp.  470 U. S. 193-199.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the substitution of the flat-sum disregard for the work expense disregard of  402(a)(7) had no effect on the treatment of mandatory tax withholdings, because they always had been excluded from a working recipient's ""income"" for purposes of  402(a)(7) by virtue of the principle of ""actual availability"" of income, and thus should continue to be deducted from earnings as the first step in any determination of need.  The principle of actual availability has not been understood to distinguish the treatment of tax withholdings from that of other work expenses.  Pp. 470 U. S. 199-204.
(c) By concluding that the OBRA Congress could not have intended to include mandatory tax withholdings in the flat-sum disregard because such a rule would dilute financial incentives to work, the Court of Appeals ignored the congressional choices manifest in the departure from approaches previously favored.  The legislative history indicates that Congress embarked on a new course, emphasizing work requirements over financial incentives.  Pp.  470 U. S. 204-208.
(d) Subsequent congressional action dispels any doubt as to the OBRA Congress' intention that mandatory tax withholdings be treated as standard work expenses subsumed by the flat-sum disregard, not as an independent deduction.  Particularly, the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (which became law after certiorari was granted in this case) amended  402(a)(8) to provide that,
""in implementing [the section], the term 'earned income' shall mean gross earned income, prior to any deductions for taxes or for any other purposes.""

			"|"Heckler v. Turner
No. 83-1097
Argued October 9, 1984
Decided February 27, 1985
470 U.S. 184

Syllabus 
Section 402(a)(7)(A) of the Social Security Act (Act) provides that the responsible agency of a State participating in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program must, in determining a family's need, take into consideration ""any other income and resources"" of the family.  Before 1981,  402(a)(7) also required the state agency to consider any ""expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of any such income,"" and under such provision virtually all States deducted mandatory payroll-tax withholdings in determining ""income.""  In 1981, the Act was amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) so as to (1) eliminate the requirement of  402(a)(7) that the State consider expenses ""reasonably attributable"" to the earning of income, and (2) provide in  402(a)(8)(A)(ii) that the state agency shall ""disregard from the earned income"" a monthly flat sum of $75.  Petitioner Secretary of Health and Human Services then advised the responsible state agencies that mandatory payroll deductions were to be included in the new $75 work expense disregard, which was to be taken from gross, rather than net, income, and the State of California issued regulations implementing petitioner's directions.  In a class action in Federal District Court challenging the California regulations, the court held that the regulations misconstrued the term ""income"" in  402(a)(7) to mean gross income, rather than net income, and thereby incorrectly subsumed mandatory tax withholdings within the work expenses covered by the flat-sum disregard of  402(a)(8)(A)(ii), rather than independently deducting such withholdings when calculating income under  402(a)(7).  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  In calculating a family's need for AFDC benefits, the responsible state agency must treat mandatory tax withholdings as a work expense encompassed within the flat-sum disregard of  402(a)(8)(A)(ii), rather than as a separate deduction in determining ""income"" under  402(a)(7) (A).  Pp.  470 U. S. 193-212.
(a) The Act makes no explicit provision for the deduction of mandatory payroll-tax withholdings, nor does it qualify the meaning of income.  But a common-sense meaning of ""earned income,"" as reflected in existing regulations, includes tax withholdings since portions of salary or wages 
Page 470 U. S. 185
 withheld to meet tax obligations are ""earned.""  Since earned income includes tax withholdings, so, too, does the broader category of ""income.""  The congressional Reports accompanying the OBRA amendments make clear that Congress provided the flat-sum disregard in lieu of itemized work expenses, and there is no support in the statutory language or structure for any inference that Congress contemplated an additional but unmentioned deduction for tax liabilities.  The administrative background against which the OBRA Congress worked also supports the conclusion that mandatory tax withholdings were among the items Congress intended to include within the flat-sum disregard.  Pp.  470 U. S. 193-199.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the substitution of the flat-sum disregard for the work expense disregard of  402(a)(7) had no effect on the treatment of mandatory tax withholdings, because they always had been excluded from a working recipient's ""income"" for purposes of  402(a)(7) by virtue of the principle of ""actual availability"" of income, and thus should continue to be deducted from earnings as the first step in any determination of need.

|470 u.s. 93|"United States v. Louisiana
(Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case)
No. 9, Orig.
Syllabus 
This case involves the issue whether Mississippi Sound, a body of water immediately south of the mainland of Alabama and Mississippi, consists of inland waters, so as to establish in those States, rather than in the United States, ownership of the lands submerged under the Sound.  Following extended proceedings, the Special Master filed a Report in which he concluded, inter alia, that the whole of Mississippi Sound qualifies as a historic bay under the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone (Convention), and thus constitutes inland waters.  Accordingly, he recommended that a decree be entered in favor of Alabama and Mississippi.  The United States filed exceptions.
Held:  On the record, the Special Master correctly determined that the whole of Mississippi Sound is a historic bay, and that its waters therefore are inland waters.  Pp.  470 U. S. 101-115.
(a) While the term ""historic bay"" is not defined in the Convention, this Court has stated that a historic bay is a bay ""over which a coastal nation has traditionally asserted and maintained dominion with the acquiescence of foreign nations.""  United States v. California, 381 U. S. 139,  381 U. S. 172.  The facts in this case establish that the United States effectively has exercised sovereignty over Mississippi Sound as inland waters from the time of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 until 1971, and has done so without protest by foreign nations.  Pp.  470 U. S. 101-111.
(b) Since historic title to Mississippi Sound as inland waters had ripened prior to the United States' disclaimer of the inland-waters status of the Sound in 1971, that disclaimer was insufficient to divest the States of their entitlement to the submerged lands under the Sound.  And although the record does not contain evidence of acts of exclusion from the Sound of foreign navigation in innocent passage, such evidence is not invariably essential to a valid claim of historic inland water status.  Pp.  470 U. S. 111-115.
Exception of United States to Special Master's recommended ruling that the whole of Mississippi Sound constitutes historic inland waters overruled, and Special Master's Report to that extent confirmed.

 This case raises important constitutional questions regarding the rights of public employees to maintain and express their private sexual preferences.

 1975, the respondent School District acting through its School Board decided not to renew petitioner's contract. A jury later made unchallenged findings that petitioner was suspended and not rehired solely because she was bisexual and had told her secretary and some fellow teachers that she was bisexual, and not for ""any other reason."" See id., at 460 (Special Verdict VIII). The jury also found that petitioner's mention of her bisexuality did not ""in any way interfere with the proper performance of [her or other school staff members'] duties or with the regular operation of the school generally."" Id., at 456-458 (Special Verdicts I, II, and III). The jury concluded that petitioner had suffered damages as a result of the decisions to suspend and not rehire her in the form of personal humiliation, mental anguish, and lost earnings. 
 The trial judge ruled that these findings supported petitioner's claims for violation of her constitutional right to free speech under Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563 (1968), and to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. [Footnote 1] He therefore entered a judgment for damages for petitioner.

Second, the court held that no equal protection claim could possibly have been made out, because there was presented ""no evidence of how other employees with different sexual preferences were treated."" Ibid. Without citation to any precedent, the court characterized the judgment for petitioner in the absence of such comparative evidence as ""plain error."" 2

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 25, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice O'CONNOR, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 This petition raises important and unresolved issues concerning the protection afforded by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to applicants for general assistance. Because the decision below relies on a questionable reading of this Court's precedent to hold that such applicants are entitled to no procedural safeguards whatsoever and, alternatively, that state law remedies provide sufficient due process, I would grant certiorari. 
 Petitioner Cindy Gregory and her husband on April 13, 1982, filed an application with respondent town of Pittsfield, Maine, seeking general assistance in order to pay their rent. The Town Manager, respondent Gene Moyers, denied this request on the grounds that Mrs. Gregory had quit her job and had spent an Aid to Families with Dependent Children check to obtain her husband's release from jail. Contrary to the requirements of state law, Moyers did not provide a written notice of this decision 
Page 470 U.S. 1018 , 1019
 informing Mrs. Gregory of her right to an administrative hearing. [Footnote 1] Mrs. Gregory unsuccessfully requested assistance again on April 16. On the morning of April 23, she filed an action in the Superior Court of Somerset County, State of Maine, requesting a temporary restraining order against the town's denial of general assistance. The court directed Mrs. Gregory to exhaust the administrative hearing procedure established by Me.Rev.Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, 4507 (1980), and instructed the town's hearing authority to follow the decision of the Maine Supreme Court in Page v. City of Auburn, 440 A.2d 363 (1982), which held that voluntary termination of employment is not a valid ground for denying general assistance. On the afternoon of April 23, Mrs. Gregory went to the Pittsfield Municipal Office and filed written requests for general assistance and for an administrative hearing on the denial of her April 13 application. The request for assistance was denied, and the town again failed to provide Mrs. Gregory with written notice of the decision. On April 29, 1983, the town's hearing authority upheld the denial of benefits requested on April 13 and refused to review the denial of the April 23 application. 
 Thwarted in her efforts to obtain assistance, Mrs. Gregory then filed an action in Superior Court requesting review of the hearing authority's decision pursuant to state law and also seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for alleged constitutional deprivations. The Superior Court held that Mrs. Gregory was entitled to an award of assistance based on the April 13 application and that the town's hearing authority had violated statutory requirements by refusing to hold a hearing on her April 23 application.

No. 83-469
Argued October 2, 1984
Decided February 20, 1985
470 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Respondent was charged with various federal offenses involving a scheme to defraud a refinery by submitting false certifications that oil purchased by the refinery from respondent's company was crude oil when in fact it was less valuable fuel oil.  At the trial in District Court, defense counsel in his closing argument impugned the prosecutor's integrity and charged that the prosecutor did not believe in the Government's case.  No objection to defense counsel's summation was made at the time, but in rebuttal arguments, the prosecutor stated his opinion that respondent was guilty and urged the jury to ""do its job""; defense counsel made no objection.  Respondent was convicted on several counts, and on appeal alleged that he was unfairly prejudiced by the prosecutor's response to defense counsel's argument.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that, under case law of that Circuit, such remarks constituted misconduct and were plain error, and that appellate review was not precluded by defense counsel's failure to object at trial.
Held:  The prosecutor's remarks during the rebuttal argument, although error, did not constitute ""plain error"" that a reviewing court could properly act on under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), absent a timely objection by defense counsel; on the record, the challenged argument did not undermine the fairness of the trial.  Pp.  470 U. S. 6-20.
(a) The kind of advocacy on both sides as shown by the record has no place in the administration of justice, and should neither be permitted nor 
Page 470 U. S. 2
 rewarded; the appropriate solution is for the trial judge to deal promptly with any breach by either counsel.  Pp.  470 U. S. 6-11.
(b) The issue is not the prosecutor's license to make otherwise improper arguments, but whether his ""invited response,"" taken in context, unfairly prejudiced the defendant.  Lawn v. United States, 355 U. S. 339.  In order to make an appropriate assessment, the reviewing court must not only weigh the impact of the prosecutor's remarks, but must also take into account defense counsel's conduct.  The impact of the evaluation has been that, if the prosecutor's remarks were ""invited"" and did no more than respond substantially in order to ""right the scale,"" such comments would not warrant reversing a conviction.  Pp.  470 U. S. 11-14.
(c) The plain error exception of Rule 52(b) to the contemporaneous objection requirement is to be used only in those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.  Especially when addressing plain error, a reviewing court cannot properly evaluate a case except by viewing such a claimed error against the entire record.  When reviewed under these principles, the prosecutor's remarks in this case did not rise to the level of plain error.  Viewed in context, the remarks, although inappropriate and amounting to error, were not such as to undermine the fundamental fairness of the trial and contribute to a miscarriage of justice.  Pp.  470 U. S. 14-20.

At the trial in District Court, defense counsel in his closing argument impugned the prosecutor's integrity and charged that the prosecutor did not believe in the Government's case.  No objection to defense counsel's summation was made at the time, but in rebuttal arguments, the prosecutor stated his opinion that respondent was guilty and urged the jury to ""do its job""; defense counsel made no objection.  Respondent was convicted on several counts, and on appeal alleged that he was unfairly prejudiced by the prosecutor's response to defense counsel's argument.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that, under case law of that Circuit, such remarks constituted misconduct and were plain error, and that appellate review was not precluded by defense counsel's failure to object at trial.
Held:  The prosecutor's remarks during the rebuttal argument, although error, did not constitute ""plain error"" that a reviewing court could properly act on under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), absent a timely objection by defense counsel; on the record, the challenged argument did not undermine the fairness of the trial.  Pp.  470 U. S. 6-20.
(a) The kind of advocacy on both sides as shown by the record has no place in the administration of justice, and should neither be permitted nor 
Page 470 U. S. 2
 rewarded; the appropriate solution is for the trial judge to deal promptly with any breach by either counsel.  Pp.  470 U. S. 6-11.
(b) The issue is not the prosecutor's license to make otherwise improper arguments, but whether his ""invited response,"" taken in context, unfairly prejudiced the defendant.  Lawn v. United States, 355 U. S. 339.  In order to make an appropriate assessment, the reviewing court must not only weigh the impact of the prosecutor's remarks, but must also take into account defense counsel's conduct.  The impact of the evaluation has been that, if the prosecutor's remarks were ""invited"" and did no more than respond substantially in order to ""right the scale,"" such comments would not warrant reversing a conviction.  Pp.  470 U. S. 11-14.
(c) The plain error exception of Rule 52(b) to the contemporaneous objection requirement is to be used only in those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.  Especially when addressing plain error, a reviewing court cannot properly evaluate a case except by viewing such a claimed error against the entire record.  When reviewed under these principles, the prosecutor's remarks in this case did not rise to the level of plain error.  Viewed in context, the remarks, although inappropriate and amounting to error, were not such as to undermine the fundamental fairness of the trial and contribute to a miscarriage of justice.  Pp.  470 U. S. 14-20.

Syllabus 
In 1951, the Shoshone Tribe sought compensation for the loss of aboriginal title to lands in several Western States.  The Indian Claims Commission (Commission) entered an interlocutory order holding that aboriginal title had been extinguished and later awarded $26 million in compensation.  The Court of Claims affirmed, and the award was certified to the General Accounting Office.  Pursuant to 31 U.S.C.  724a (1976 ed., Supp. V), this certification automatically appropriated the amount of the award, which was then deposited for the Tribe in an interest-bearing trust account in the United States Treasury.  The Secretary of the Interior is required by statute, after consulting with the Tribe, to submit to Congress a plan for distribution of the fund, but has not yet done so, owing to the Tribe's refusal to cooperate.  Subsequently, the United States brought a trespass action in Federal District Court against respondent Tribe members, alleging that in grazing livestock without a permit on land involved in the prior Commission proceeding respondents were violating certain regulations.  Respondents claimed that they have aboriginal title to the land, and that thus the Government was precluded from requiring grazing permits.  The District Court held that aboriginal title had been extinguished when the Commission's final award was certified for payment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that ""payment"" had not occurred within the meaning of  22(a) of the Indian Claims Commission Act, which provided that
""payment of any claim [of an Indian tribe], after its determination in accordance with this [Act], shall be a full discharge of the United States of all claims and demands touching any of the matters involved in the controversy.""
The court reasoned that until a plan of distribution of the fund in question is adopted, there remain significant blocks in the way of delivery to the payee, and that thus the ""ordinary meaning"" of payment was not satisfied.
Held:  ""Payment"" occurred under  22(a) when the funds in question were placed by the United States into an account in the Treasury for the Tribe.  Pp.  470 U. S. 44-50.
(a) To hold that payment under  22(a) does not occur until a final plan of distribution has been approved by Congress would frustrate the Indian Claims Commission Act's purpose to dispose of Indian claims with 
Page 470 U. S. 40
 finality, and would also conflict with the Act's purpose of transferring from Congress to the Commission the responsibility for determining the merits of Indian claims.  Pp.  470 U. S. 46-47.
(b) To construe the word ""payment"" as the Court of Appeals did gives the word a markedly different meaning than it has under the general common law rule, relied upon in Seminole Nation v. United States, 316 U. S. 286, that a debtor's payment to a fiduciary for the creditor's benefit satisfies the debt.  Here, the Commission ordered the Government qua judgment debtor to pay $26 million to the Government qua trustee for the Tribe as beneficiary.  Once the money was deposited into the trust account, payment was effected.  Pp.  470 U. S. 47-60.

Syllabus 
After petitioner was arrested on armed robbery charges in Louisiana, he was taken to the police station for questioning by detectives.  Upon being read his Miranda rights, he said that he did not wish to make any statement until he saw a lawyer, and the interview was then terminated.  But the next day, before petitioner had communicated with a lawyer, one of the same detectives, without inquiring whether petitioner had spoken with an attorney and without any indication from petitioner that he was willing to be interrogated, asked if he was willing to talk about the case.  After Miranda rights were again read to petitioner, he orally confessed that he had committed the robberies.  Over petitioner's objections, the confession was admitted into evidence at his trial and he was convicted.  In the meantime, subsequent to petitioner's trial and convictions, and, while his appeal to the Louisiana Supreme Court was pending, this Court ruled in Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, that a criminal defendant's rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were violated by the use of his confession obtained by police-instigated interrogation -- without counsel present -- after he requested an attorney.  While acknowledging the presence of an Edwards violation, the Louisiana Supreme Court went on to hold that Edwards was not to be applied to petitioner's case.

Syllabus 
Respondent, a retail automobile parts and gasoline dealer, is a closely held corporation owned equally by three brothers, who serve as officers and are actively involved in running the business.  In 1981, a union filed with the National Labor Relations Board a petition requesting that a representation election be held among respondent's employees.  Thereafter, an election was held and the union received a plurality of the votes, but enough ballots were challenged on each side to place the outcome in doubt.  Among the ballots challenged by the union were those of one owner's wife, who works as a clerk at the same location as her husband and occasionally takes coffee breaks in his office, and of the owners' mother, who is a cashier at one of respondent's stores and lives with one of the owners.  Concluding that the wife's interests were different from those of other clerical employees and that the mother's interests were more closely aligned with management than with the employees, but without making a finding that the wife and mother enjoyed special job-related benefits, the Board's hearing officer recommended that the union's challenge to the ballots be sustained.  The Board adopted this recommendation and, after all qualified votes were counted, certified the union as the exclusive bargaining representative.  When respondent refused to bargain, the union filed charges with the Board, which held that respondent had violated  8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), and ordered respondent to bargain.  The Court of Appeals denied enforcement of the Board's order, holding that the Board had no authority under  9(b) of the Act to exclude employees from a bargaining unit based solely on their close family relationship with those who own and operate the business, that an employee's family ties may be a factor justifying exclusion only when the employee receives job-related benefits that flow from the relationship, and that, in this case, there was insufficient evidence that the wife and mother enjoyed such benefits.
Held:  The Board did not exceed its authority in excluding from collective bargaining units close relatives of management, without making a finding that the relatives enjoy special job-related privileges.  Pp.  469 U. S. 494-499.
(a) The Board's policy of considering a variety of factors in deciding whether an employee's familial ties are sufficient to align his interests

 with management so as to warrant his exclusion from a bargaining unit, is a reasonable application of the Board's standard whereby, in defining bargaining units, its focus is on whether the employees share a ""community of interest.""  The Board's decision to exclude some family members is entitled to deference, and is not inconsistent with the Act's fundamental structure or policies.

Syllabus 
The United States brought this action against the 13 States that border the Atlantic Ocean to determine whether the United States had exclusive rights to the seabed and subsoil underlying the ocean beyond three geographical miles from each State's coastline.  In due course, this Court concluded that the States held interests in the seabeds only to a distance of three geographical miles from their respective coastlines, but did not fix the precise coastline of any of the States.  After the United States filed a motion for supplementary proceedings to determine the exact coastline of Rhode Island, a Special Master was appointed, and he subsequently permitted New York to participate in those proceedings.  The purpose of these supplemental proceedings is to determine the legal coastline of the United States in the area of Block Island Sound and the eastern portion of Long Island Sound.  This determination turns on whether the Sounds constitute, in whole or in part, a juridical bay under Article 7(6) of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, since to the extent the Sounds constitute a juridical bay, the waters of that bay are then internal waters subject to the adjacent States' jurisdiction, and the line that closes the bay is coastline for the purpose of fixing the seaward boundaries of the States.  The Special Master filed a Report in which he concluded (a) that the Sounds in part constitute a juridical bay under Article 7(6), Long Island being an extension of the mainland and the southern headland of the bay, and (b) that the bay closed at the line drawn from Montauk Point at the eastern tip of Long Island to Watch Hill Point on the Rhode Island shore, the waters of the bay west of the closing line being internal state waters, and the waters of Block Island Sound east of that line being territorial waters and high seas.

No. 82-1913

Reargued October 1, 1984
Decided February 19, 1985*
469 U.S. 528

Syllabus 
Appellee San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (SAMTA) is a public mass transit authority that is the major provider of transportation in the San Antonio, Tex., metropolitan area.  It has received substantial federal financial assistance under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964.  In 1979, the Wage and Hour Administration of the Department of Labor issued an opinion that SAMTA's operations are not immune from the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) under National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833, in which it was held that the Commerce Clause does not empower Congress to enforce such requirements against the States ""in areas of traditional governmental functions.""  Id. at  426 U. S. 852.  SAMTA then filed an action in Federal District Court, seeking declaratory relief.  Entering judgment for SAMTA, the District Court held that municipal ownership and operation of a mass transit system is a traditional governmental function, and thus, under National League of Cities, is exempt from the obligations imposed by the FLSA.
Held:  In affording SAMTA employees the protection of the wage and hour provisions of the FLSA, Congress contravened no affirmative limit on its power under the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  469 U. S. 537-557.
(a) The attempt to draw the boundaries of state regulatory immunity in terms of ""traditional governmental functions"" is not only unworkable but is also inconsistent with established principles of federalism and, indeed, with those very federalism principles on which National League of Cities purported to rest.  That case, accordingly, is overruled.  Pp.  469 U. S. 537-547.
(b) There is nothing in the overtime and minimum wage requirements of the FLSA, as applied to SAMTA, that is destructive of state sovereignty or violative of any constitutional provision.  The States' continued role in the federal system is primarily guaranteed not by any externally 
Page 469 U. S. 529
 imposed limits on the commerce power, but by the structure of the Federal Government itself.  In these cases, the political process effectively protected that role.  Pp.  469 U. S. 547-555.

No. 82-1913

Syllabus 
Appellee San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (SAMTA) is a public mass transit authority that is the major provider of transportation in the San Antonio, Tex., metropolitan area.  It has received substantial federal financial assistance under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964.  In 1979, the Wage and Hour Administration of the Department of Labor issued an opinion that SAMTA's operations are not immune from the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) under National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833, in which it was held that the Commerce Clause does not empower Congress to enforce such requirements against the States ""in areas of traditional governmental functions.""  Id. at  426 U. S. 852.  SAMTA then filed an action in Federal District Court, seeking declaratory relief.  Entering judgment for SAMTA, the District Court held that municipal ownership and operation of a mass transit system is a traditional governmental function, and thus, under National League of Cities, is exempt from the obligations imposed by the FLSA.
Held:  In affording SAMTA employees the protection of the wage and hour provisions of the FLSA, Congress contravened no affirmative limit on its power under the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  469 U. S. 537-557.
(a) The attempt to draw the boundaries of state regulatory immunity in terms of ""traditional governmental functions"" is not only unworkable but is also inconsistent with established principles of federalism and, indeed, with those very federalism principles on which National League of Cities purported to rest.  That case, accordingly, is overruled.  Pp.  469 U. S. 537-547.
(b) There is nothing in the overtime and minimum wage requirements of the FLSA, as applied to SAMTA, that is destructive of state sovereignty or violative of any constitutional provision.  The States' continued role in the federal system is primarily guaranteed not by any externally 
Page 469 U. S. 529
 imposed limits on the commerce power, but by the structure of the Federal Government itself.  In these cases, the political process effectively protected that role.  Pp.  469 U. S. 547-555.
557 F.Supp. 445, reversed and remanded.

An application to vacate the Court of Appeals' partial stay of the District Court's order is denied.  In proceedings involving a class of Cuban nationals (including applicants) who, having unlawfully entered the United States, have been detained in a federal penitentiary pending Cuba's acceptance of their return, have had exclusion orders entered against them, and assert that they would be subject to persecution if returned to Cuba and thus are eligible for asylum, the District Court ordered that certain test cases be remanded to the Board of Immigration Appeals and that the exclusion orders be set aside.  The Court of Appeals' stay, pending respondents' appeal from the District Court, among other things, (1) refused to delay deportation of class members who would not be eligible for asylum, regardless of the outcome on the merits of the test cases, because they had committed serious crimes or otherwise posed a danger to the security of the United States, but (2) shifted to the Government the burden of proving that the alien was excludable on such grounds.  Applicants simply have not made a showing of irreparable injury that would warrant interference with the Court of Appeals' partial stay.

Syllabus 
After respondent was convicted of a drug offense in a Kentucky state court, his retained counsel filed a timely notice of appeal to the Kentucky Court of Appeals.  But because counsel failed to file the statement of appeal required by a Kentucky Rule of Appellate Procedure when he filed his brief and record on appeal, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal and later denied a motion for reconsideration.  The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed, and the trial court denied a motion to vacate the conviction or grant a belated appeal.  The respondent then sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, challenging the dismissal of his appeal on the ground that it deprived him of the right to effective assistance of counsel on appeal guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus, ordering respondent's release unless the Commonwealth either reinstated his appeal or retried him.  The United States Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the effective assistance of counsel on his first appeal as of right.  Pp.  469 U. S. 391-405.
(a) Nominal representation on an appeal as of right -- like nominal representation at trial -- does not suffice to render the proceedings constitutionally adequate; a party whose counsel is unable to provide effective representation is in no better position than one who has no counsel at all.  A first appeal as of right therefore is not adjudicated in accord with due process of law if the appellant does not have the effective assistance of an attorney.  The promise of Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353, that a criminal defendant has a right to counsel on his first appeal as of right -- like the promise of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, that a criminal defendant has a right to counsel at trial -- would be a futile gesture unless it comprehended the right to effective assistance of counsel.  Pp.  469 U. S. 391-400.
(b) When a State opts to act in a field where its action has significant discretionary elements, such as where it establishes a system of appeals as of right although not required to do so, it must nonetheless act in 
Page 469 U. S. 388
 accord with the dictates of the Constitution, and, in particular, in accord with the Due Process Clause.  Pp.  469 U. S. 400-401.
(c) Under any reasonable interpretation of the line drawn in Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, between discretionary appeals in which a criminal defendant has no right to counsel and appeals as of right in which he does, a criminal defendant's appeal of a connection to the Kentucky Court of Appeals is an appeal as of right.  The Kentucky Constitution requires that at least one appeal as of right be allowed in all cases, civil and criminal.  And a criminal defendant appealing to the Kentucky Court of Appeals has not previously had an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of the State's appellate process.  It follows that for purposes of analysis under the Due Process Clause, respondent's appeal was an appeal as of right, thus triggering the right to counsel recognized in Douglas v. California, supra.  Pp.  469 U. S. 401-402.
(d) Petitioners' argument that the Due Process Clause has no bearing on the Commonwealth's actions in this case because the constitutional requirements recognized in Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12 (the transcript of the trial is a prerequisite to a decision on the merits of an appeal), Douglas v. California, supra, and the cases that followed had their source in the Equal Protection Clause, not the Due Process Clause, rests on a misunderstanding of the diverse sources of this Court's holdings in this area of the law.  Both due process and equal protection concerns were implicated in Griffin and Douglas and both Clauses supported those decisions.  Pp.  469 U. S. 402-405.

Syllabus 
Respondent was tried by a jury in a Florida state court and convicted of first-degree murder.  In accordance with the jury's recommendation, he was sentenced to death.  On appeal, respondent claimed that several prospective jurors had been improperly excluded for cause because of their opposition to capital punishment, in violation of the decision in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, but the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence.  After unsuccessfully seeking postconviction review in the state courts, respondent filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court under 28 U.S.C.  2254.  That court denied the petition.  The Court of Appeals reversed and granted the writ, holding that, on the basis of the voir dire questioning by the prosecutor, one of the prospective jurors was improperly excused for cause under Witherspoon.  The court drew the standard for determining when a juror may properly be excluded from Witherspoon, supra, at  391 U. S. 522, n. 21, which states that jurors may be excluded for cause if they make it ""unmistakably clear"" that they would ""automatically"" vote against capital punishment without regard to the evidence or that their attitude toward the death penalty would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to the defendant's ""guilt.""
Held:
1. The proper standard for determining when a prospective juror may be excluded for cause because of his views on capital punishment is whether the juror's views would ""prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath."" Adams v. Texas, 448 U. S. 38,  448 U. S. 45.  In addition to dispensing with Witherspoon's reference to ""automatic"" decisionmaking, this standard does not require that a juror's bias be proved with ""unmistakable clarity.""  Here, given this standard, the Court of Appeals at a minimum erred in focusing unduly on the lack of clarity of the questioning of the prospective juror, and in focusing on whether her answers indicated that she would ""automatically"" vote against the death penalty.  Pp.  469 U. S. 418-426.
2. On a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C.  2254, the question of challenge of a prospective juror for bias is a ""factual issue"" 
Page 469 U. S. 413
 subject to  2254(d), which requires a federal reviewing court to accord any findings of the state courts on ""factual issues"" a ""presumption of correctness.""  Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025.  This rule applies to a trial court's determination, such as the one made in this case, that a prospective capital sentencing juror was properly excluded for cause.  Pp.  469 U. S. 426-430.
3. Under the facts of this case, the prospective juror in question was properly excused for cause.  There were adequate ""written indicia"" of the trial judge's factual finding to satisfy  2254(d).  The transcript of voir dire shows that the prospective juror was questioned in the presence of both counsel and the trial judge, that at the end of the colloquy between the prosecutor and the juror the prosecutor challenged for cause, and that the challenge was sustained.  Nothing more was required.  The judge was not required to write a specific finding or announce for the record his conclusion that, or his reasons why, the prospective juror was biased.  The judge's finding is therefore ""presumed correct"" absent anything in the record showing one of the reasons enumerated in the statute for avoiding the presumption.  The question under the statute is whether the trial court's findings are fairly supported by the record, and here there is ample support for the trial judge's finding that the prospective juror's views would have prevented or substantially impaired the performance of her duties as a juror.

In petitioners' action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, they alleged and proved that they had been assaulted by an officer of the Memphis Police Department who had a history of violent behavior that was well known within the Department.  The court's judgment for petitioners, in addition to awarding compensatory and punitive damages against the officer, also awarded compensatory damages against the then Director of the Police Department ""in his official capacity,"" the court having found that, although the Director had no actual knowledge of the officer's disciplinary record because of the Department's administrative policies, he should have known of the officer's dangerous propensities.  The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment against the Director, holding that he had acted in good faith and was accordingly entitled to immunity.  The court rejected petitioners' contention that the action against the Director was tantamount to an action against the city of Memphis, which could not claim the qualified immunity that its agents could assert, and thus was liable for the damages awarded against the Director.  The court concluded that the suit was against an individual, not the city.

Pursuant to an investigation of a suspected drug smuggling operation, United States Customs officers, by ground and air surveillance, observed two pickup trucks as they traveled to a remote private airstrip in Arizona and the arrival and departure there of two small airplanes.

After arresting certain of the respondents at the airstrip, the officers took the trucks back to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) headquarters, and the packages were then placed in a DEA warehouse.  Three days after the packages were seized from the trucks, Government agents, without obtaining a search warrant, opened some of the packages and took samples that later proved to be marihuana.

Syllabus 
A teacher at a New Jersey high school, upon discovering respondent, then a 14-year-old freshman, and her companion smoking cigarettes in a school lavatory in violation of a school rule, took them to the Principal's office, where they met with the Assistant Vice Principal.  When respondent, in response to the Assistant Vice Principal's questioning, denied that she had been smoking and claimed that she did not smoke at all, the Assistant Vice Principal demanded to see her purse.  Upon opening the purse, he found a pack of cigarettes and also noticed a package of cigarette rolling papers that are commonly associated with the use of marihuana.  He then proceeded to search the purse thoroughly and found some marihuana, a pipe, plastic bags, a fairly substantial amount of money, an index card containing a list of students who owed respondent money, and two letters that implicated her in marihuana dealing.  Thereafter, the State brought delinquency charges against respondent in the Juvenile Court, which, after denying respondent's motion to suppress the evidence found in her purse, held that the Fourth Amendment applied to searches by school officials, but that the search in question was a reasonable one, and adjudged respondent to be a delinquent.  The Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the trial court's finding that there had been no Fourth Amendment violation, but vacated the adjudication of delinquency and remanded on other grounds.  The New Jersey Supreme Court reversed and ordered the suppression of the evidence found in respondent's purse, holding that the search of the purse was unreasonable.
Held:
1. The Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures applies to searches conducted by public school officials, and is not limited to searches carried out by law enforcement officers.  Nor are school officials exempt from the Amendment's dictates by virtue of the special nature of their authority over schoolchildren.  In carrying out searches and other functions pursuant to disciplinary policies mandated by state statutes, school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents of students, and they cannot claim the parents immunity from the Fourth Amendment's strictures.  Pp.  469 U. S. 333-337. 
Page 469 U. S. 326

2. Schoolchildren have legitimate expectations of privacy.  They may find it necessary to carry with them a variety of legitimate, noncontraband items, and there is no reason to conclude that they have necessarily waived all rights to privacy in such items by bringing them onto school grounds.  But striking the balance between schoolchildren's legitimate expectations of privacy and the school's equally legitimate need to maintain an environment in which learning can take place requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject.  Thus, school officials need not obtain a warrant before searching a student who is under their authority.  Moreover, school officials need not be held subject to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause to believe that the subject of the search has violated or is violating the law.  Rather, the legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness, under all the circumstances, of the search.  Determining the reasonableness of any search involves a determination of whether the search was justified at its inception and whether, as conducted, it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference in the first place.  Under ordinary circumstances, the search of a student by a school official will be justified at its inception where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.  And such a search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search, and not excessively intrusive in light of the student's age and sex and the nature of the infraction.  Pp.  469 U. S. 337-343.
3. Under the above standard, the search in this case was not unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes.  First, the initial search for cigarettes was reasonable.  The report to the Assistant Vice Principal that respondent had been smoking warranted a reasonable suspicion that she had cigarettes in her purse, and thus the search was justified despite the fact that the cigarettes, if found, would constitute ""mere evidence"" of a violation of the no-smoking rule.  Second, the discovery of the rolling papers then gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that respondent was carrying marihuana as well as cigarettes in her purse, and this suspicion justified the further exploration that turned up more evidence of drug-related activities.  Pp.  469 U. S. 343-347.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 15, 1985
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death scheduled for Wednesday, January 16, 1985, presented to Justice WHITE and by him referred to the Court is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 I  
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, see Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 1950 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), I would grant the application for a stay of execution. 
Page 469 U.S. 1182 , 1183
 II 
 Even if I believed otherwise, however, I would stay the applicant's execution pending this Court's resolution of Heckler v. Chaney, No. 83- 1878, cert granted, 467 U.S. 1251 (1984), which has been argued to this Court and currently awaits decision. I cannot participate in the cruel irony visited on this applicant by the Court today. 
 Doyle Edward Skillern is one of the eight plaintiffs in Chaney. Those plaintiffs allege that lethal drugs used to carry out death sentences in Texas and Oklahoma cause ""agonizingly slow and painful deaths"" and consequently are not ""safe and effective"" for their intended use in executions, as allegedly is required under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed that the Food and Drug Administration has a statutory duty to investigate this claim, and indicated that it was prepared to ""compel"" the FDA to take action against the lethal drugs. Chaney v. Heckler, 231 U.S.App.D.C. 136, 153, 718 F.2d 1174, 1191 (1983). 
 The merits of the Court of Appeals' action and order in Chaney are not before us on this application. In March 1984, the Solicitor General of the United States filed an application for stay of the Court of Appeals' mandate in Chaney, arguing that the decision was ""likely to interfere with state enforcement of capital punishment statutes. . . ."" Application in Heckler v. Chaney, No. 83-1878, p. 6. ""[I]f the mandate is not stayed, the FDA will in all likelihood be required . . . to regulate the method of capital punishment used in several states,"" including Texas. Id., at 10. THE CHIEF JUSTICE granted the motion for stay of the mandate based on this understanding of the effect of the judgment. 
 Thus the Government and this Court have proceeded in the Chaney case on the assumption that success by the plaintiffs will delay and perhaps ultimately preclude their execution by lethal injection. Yet today the Court decides to send one of those plaintiffs to his death by the very method challenged in Chaney. The Court obviously considers the issues in Chaney substantial enough to warrant plenary consideration. But despite our assertion of jurisdiction over applicant and his claim in Chaney, Texas subsequently has determined to execute applicant by lethal injection tomorrow morning. I am aware of no precedent that has permitted [469 U.S. 1182 , 1184]

 Charles WRIGHTv. NEW JERSEYNo. 84-5060 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 14, 1985
 The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 The appellant Charles Wright was convicted of possessing an ""exacto"" knife. Under New Jersey law, possession of this sort of object is entirely legal in most circumstances; possession becomes unlawful only "" under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for such lawful uses as it may have."" N.J.Stat.Ann. 2C:39-5d (West 1982) (emphasis added).1 As construed by the state courts, although this statute requires proof that the defendant ""knowingly"" possessed the object in question, there is no requirement that he have done so with any unlawful purpose. 
 The Supreme Court of New Jersey affirmed the constitutionality of 2C:39-5d in this and a companion case, see State v. Wright, 96 N.J. 170, 475 A.2d 38 (1984); State v. Lee, 96 N.J. 156, 475 
Page 469 U.S. 1146 , 1147
 A.2d 31 (1984), with one justice arguing in dissent that the operative standard ""not manifestly appropriate"" is ""so lacking in any precise meaning as to defy definition,"" State v. Lee, supra, at 168, 475 A.2d, at 37 (Clifford, J., dissenting). I believe this appeal presents the substantial question whether 2C:39-5d is impermissibly vague in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court's dismissal of the appeal for want of a substantial federal question. 
 I  
 Wright, the subject of several outstanding arrest warrants, was apprehended while conversing with a friend on a street corner in Teaneck, New Jersey. The arresting officers searched Wright at police headquarters, where they found the exacto knife in question concealed inside one of his socks. The instant prosecution for violation of 2C:39-5d followed. 
 At trial, Wright contended that he had not intended to use the knife against person or property and that the statute is unconstitutionally vague. The trial court rejected these arguments. With respect to the question of Wright's intent, the court instructed the jury that it was "" not necessary that the State prove that [the] defendant possessed the weapon with a purpose to use it unlawfully against the person or property of another."" Juris. Statement 4. As for the definition of the ""not manifestly appropriate"" standard, which Wright contended was meaningless, the court instructed: ""If you . . . find that the circumstances under which the weapon was possessed could not be easily understood or recognized as being appropriate to a lawful use of the instrument in question here then possession of the weapon . . . is prohibited."" State v. Wright, supra, at 172, 475 A.2d, at 39 (emphasis added). Wright was convicted as charged and sentenced to 200 days in the Bergen County jail. 
 The Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, reversed Wright's conviction, reasoning that the legislature could not have intended to impose criminal sanctions on one whose conduct merely ""was not 'easily understood or recognized' from the circumstances."" 187 N.J.Super. 160, 164, 453 A.2d 1352, 1354 (1982).

 Harold VINCENTv. LOUISIANANo. 83-6865 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 14, 1985
 Rehearing Denied March 4, 1985. 
 See 470 U.S. 1039. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 I  
 The petitioner Harold Vincent was convicted in 1974 of armed robbery and second-degree murder by a jury in Vernon Parish, Louisiana. Vincent's trial had been delayed for over two years while he underwent evaluation and treatment for schizophrenia. This mental illness was so severe that psychiatrists at the Louisiana State Penitentiary General Hospital had certified that Vincent did not meet the constitutional standard of triability in that he could neither ""realiz[e] the nature of the charges against him"" nor properly ""assist his attorney."" 1 Record 17, 18. After intensive treatment with psychotropic drugs, particularly Thorazine, these psychiatrists notified the trial court that, so long as Vincent remained on his regulated dosage, he would have the mental capacity to proceed with trial. Id., at 18. They emphasized at Vincent's pretrial sanity hearing that Vincent was dependent on Thorazine and that it was ""almost a sure thing"" that he would revert to episodes of psychosis if he stopped taking the medication. Id., at 64; see also id., at 20-23. 
 According to Vincent's subsequent habeas petition, which Vincent prepared with the assistance of an inmate paralegal: 
 ""On July 6, 1974, petitioner was transferred from the Louisiana State Penitentiary to Vernon Parish without any of his medication. Petitioner immediately inquired with Vernon Parish officials about his 
Page 469 U.S. 1166 , 1167
 medication, but no one seemed to know anything about it. Consequently, on the morning trial was scheduled to commence, petitioner intentionally cut his leg to get to the hospital to see someone about receiving some Thorozine [sic].

 Supreme Court of the United States

 Rehearing Denied March 4, 1985. 
 See 470 U.S. 1039.

 The petitioner Harold Vincent was convicted in 1974 of armed robbery and second-degree murder by a jury in Vernon Parish, Louisiana. Vincent's trial had been delayed for over two years while he underwent evaluation and treatment for schizophrenia. This mental illness was so severe that psychiatrists at the Louisiana State Penitentiary General Hospital had certified that Vincent did not meet the constitutional standard of triability in that he could neither ""realiz[e] the nature of the charges against him"" nor properly ""assist his attorney."" 1 Record 17, 18. After intensive treatment with psychotropic drugs, particularly Thorazine, these psychiatrists notified the trial court that, so long as Vincent remained on his regulated dosage, he would have the mental capacity to proceed with trial. Id., at 18. They emphasized at Vincent's pretrial sanity hearing that Vincent was dependent on Thorazine and that it was ""almost a sure thing"" that he would revert to episodes of psychosis if he stopped taking the medication. Id., at 64; see also id., at 20-23. 
 According to Vincent's subsequent habeas petition, which Vincent prepared with the assistance of an inmate paralegal: 
 ""On July 6, 1974, petitioner was transferred from the Louisiana State Penitentiary to Vernon Parish without any of his medication. Petitioner immediately inquired with Vernon Parish officials about his 
Page 469 U.S. 1166 , 1167
 medication, but no one seemed to know anything about it. Consequently, on the morning trial was scheduled to commence, petitioner intentionally cut his leg to get to the hospital to see someone about receiving some Thorozine [sic]. When he appeared in court with his pants leg rolled up and a rag wrapped around his lower leg, petitioner's mother and sisters became upset and rushed to talk with him.

 Russell SWEAT and Richard ""Bud"" Sweatv. ARKANSASNo. 84-49 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 14, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Arkansas. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 After the State of Arkansas had initiated formal criminal proceedings against the petitioners Russell and Richard (""Bud"") Sweat, a state undercover agent contacted the Sweats and, in a series of telephone conversations and face-to-face meetings, deliberately elicited incriminating statements from them. Because the Sweats' right to counsel had accrued when formal criminal proceedings were begun, the prosecution's introduction at trial of these subsequent statements clearly violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. See, e.g., United States v. Henry, 447 
Page 469 U.S. 1172 , 1173
 U.S. 264 (1980); Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387 (1977); Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201 (1964). The Arkansas Court of Appeals held, however, that the Sweats' right to counsel had not yet attached at the time the undercover agent elicited their statements on the ground that, since they had not ""been arrested or deprived of [their] freedom in any significant way,"" they were not entitled to notification of their rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). 5 Ark.App. 284, 288, 635 S.W.2d 296, 299 (1982), subsequent appeal, 11 Ark.App. XIX (1984). 
 This reasoning is clearly erroneous. We have made clear time and again that Miranda and concepts of ""custody"" have nothing to do with the accrual of a defendant's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel. See, e.g., United States v. Henry, supra, 447 U.S., at 273, n. 11, 100 S. Ct., at 2188, n. 11; Massiah v. United States, supra, 377 U.S., at 206. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court's failure to correct a state court's clear disregard of controlling federal constitutional precedent. 
 I  
 During an undercover investigation in Blytheville, Arkansas, Sergeant John Chappelle of the Arkansas State Police Criminal Investigation Division learned that Bud Sweat and his son, Russell, might be engaged in marihuana trafficking. Chappelle had an unwitting intermediary introduce him to the Sweats, and he proposed to sell them several hundred pounds of marihuana. Chappelle and the Sweats had several meetings and telephone conversations from early February through late March 1980, and they ultimately agreed that Chappelle would deliver 500 pounds of marihuana to Blytheville in exchange for $150,000. Chappelle surreptitiously taped these meetings and conversations. 
 When he felt that he had obtained enough evidence to prosecute the Sweats, Chappelle met on March 27 with David Burnett, Prosecuting Attorney for the Second Judicial District of the State of Arkansas. Burnett reviewed the evidence with Chappelle and decided to file a felony information against the Sweats charging them with criminal conspiracy in violation of Ark.Stat.Ann. 41-707 (1977).1 Chappelle was present while Burnett prepared [469 U.S. 1172 , 1174]

No. 83-1266
Argued October 10, 1984
Decided January 9, 1985
469 U.S. 241

Syllabus 
Respondent, executor of his mother's will, retained an attorney to handle the estate.  Respondent provided the attorney with all relevant information and records for filing a federal estate tax return, which under  6075(a) of the Internal Revenue Code was required to be filed within nine months of the decedent's death.  Respondent inquired of the attorney from time to time as to the preparation of the return, and was assured that it would be filed on time.  But the return was filed three months late, apparently because of a clerical oversight in omitting the filing date from the attorney's calendar.  Acting pursuant to  6651(a)(1) of the Code, which provides a penalty for failure to file a return when due ""unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect,"" the Internal Revenue Service assessed a penalty for the late filing.  Respondent paid the penalty and filed a suit in Federal District Court for a refund, contending that the penalty was unjustified because his failure to file the return on time was ""due to reasonable cause,"" i.e., reliance on his attorney.  The District Court agreed and granted summary judgment for respondent.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The failure to make a timely filing of a tax return is not excused by the taxpayer's reliance on an agent, and such reliance is not ""reasonable cause"" for a late filing under  6651(a)(1).  While engaging an attorney to assist in probate proceedings is plainly an exercise of the ""ordinary business care and prudence"" that the relevant Treasury Regulation requires the taxpayer to demonstrate to excuse a late filing, this does not answer the question presented here.  To say that it was ""reasonable"" for respondent to assume that the attorney would meet the statutory deadline may resolve the matter as between them, but not with respect to the respondent's obligation under that statute.  It requires no special training or effort on the taxpayer's part to ascertain a deadline and ensure that it is met.  That the attorney, as respondent's agent, was expected to attend to the matter does not relieve the principal of his duty to meet the deadline.  Pp.  469 U. S. 245-252.

Syllabus 
The Payment in Lieu of Taxes Act compensates local governments for the loss of tax revenues resulting from the tax-immune status of federal lands, such as wilderness areas and national parks, located in their jurisdictions, and for the cost of providing services associated with these lands.  The Act in 31 U.S.C.  6902(a) requires the Secretary of the Interior to make an annual payment to each unit of local government in which such lands are located, and further provides that the local unit ""may use the payment for any governmental purpose.""  A South Dakota statute requires local governments to distribute federal payments in lieu of taxes in the same way they distribute general tax revenues.  Since appellant county allocates 60% of its general tax revenues to its school districts, the state statute would require the county to give its school districts 60% of the  6902(a) payments it receives.  After the county refused to distribute the funds in accordance with the state statute, claiming that  6902(a) gave it the discretion to spend the federal funds for any governmental purpose it chose, appellee School District filed a mandamus complaint in a State Circuit Court, seeking to compel the county to distribute the federal funds in accordance with the state statute.  The Circuit Court held that the state statute conflicted with federal law, and was therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  The South Dakota Supreme Court reversed, holding that the only limit  6902(a) imposed on a local government is that the federal funds must be used for a ""governmental purpose,"" and that, since support of school districts is a valid governmental purpose, the state statute was consistent with federal requirements.
Held:  The state statute is invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.  469 U. S. 260-270.
(a) The language of  6902(a) appears to endow local governments with the discretion to spend in-lieu payments for any governmental purpose.  At the very least, the statute is ambiguous with respect to the degree of such discretion.  But the Department of the Interior has consistently taken the view that local governments retain the discretion to spend the in-lieu payments for any governmental purpose they choose.  And the legislative history evidences a congressional purpose to ensure that such payments would reach and be placed at the disposal of the 
Page 469 U. S. 257
 affected local governments to spend as they see fit.  The South Dakota statute runs directly counter to this purpose.  Pp.  469 U. S. 260-268.
(b) The South Dakota statute's intrusion on a county's discretion in spending  6902(a) funds would not be negligible or even modest.  To allocate such funds in the same proportion as local revenues would most likely result in a windfall for school districts and other entities that are already fully funded by local revenues, and the federal money would thus not serve its intended purpose of compensating local governments for extraordinary or additional expenditures associated with federal lands.  As to any concerns of federalism, the Federal Government has not presumed to dictate the manner in which counties may spend state in-lieu-of-tax payments, but, rather, has merely imposed a condition that counties should not be denied the discretion to spend  6902(a) funds for any governmental purpose.

469 U.S. 274

Syllabus 
Petitioner State of Ohio obtained an injunction in state court ordering respondent and other defendants to clean up a hazardous waste disposal site.  When the injunction was not complied with, the State obtained the appointment in state court of a receiver, who was directed to take possession of the defendants' property and other assets and to implement the injunction.  The receiver took possession of the site but had not completed his tasks when respondent filed a personal bankruptcy petition.  Seeking to require part of respondent's post-bankruptcy income to be applied to the receiver's unfinished tasks, the State filed a motion in state court to discover respondent's income and assets.  At respondent's request, the Bankruptcy Court stayed these proceedings.  The State then filed a complaint in the Bankruptcy Court seeking a declaration that respondent's obligation under the state injunction was not dischargeable in bankruptcy because it was not a ""debt"" or ""liability on a claim"" within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code.  For bankruptcy purposes, a debt is a liability on a claim.  Section 101(4)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code in pertinent part defines a claim as the
""right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right of payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured, or unsecured.""
The Bankruptcy Court ruled against the State, as did the District Court.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the State essentially sought from respondent only a monetary payment, and that such a required payment was a liability on a claim that was dischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code.
Held:
1. The fact that the Army Corps of Engineers, using funds recovered from those concerns that generated the wastes in question, has removed the wastes from the site does not render the case moot.

Syllabus 
Petitioner State of Ohio obtained an injunction in state court ordering respondent and other defendants to clean up a hazardous waste disposal site.  When the injunction was not complied with, the State obtained the appointment in state court of a receiver, who was directed to take possession of the defendants' property and other assets and to implement the injunction.  The receiver took possession of the site but had not completed his tasks when respondent filed a personal bankruptcy petition.  Seeking to require part of respondent's post-bankruptcy income to be applied to the receiver's unfinished tasks, the State filed a motion in state court to discover respondent's income and assets.  At respondent's request, the Bankruptcy Court stayed these proceedings.  The State then filed a complaint in the Bankruptcy Court seeking a declaration that respondent's obligation under the state injunction was not dischargeable in bankruptcy because it was not a ""debt"" or ""liability on a claim"" within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code.  For bankruptcy purposes, a debt is a liability on a claim.  Section 101(4)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code in pertinent part defines a claim as the
""right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right of payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured, or unsecured.""
The Bankruptcy Court ruled against the State, as did the District Court.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the State essentially sought from respondent only a monetary payment, and that such a required payment was a liability on a claim that was dischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code.
Held:
1. The fact that the Army Corps of Engineers, using funds recovered from those concerns that generated the wastes in question, has removed the wastes from the site does not render the case moot.  The State still has a stake in the outcome of the case based on its claim that the removal of the wastes did not satisfy all of respondent's obligation to clean up the site since the ground remains permeated with toxic materials that must be removed to avoid further pollution.  Pp.  469 U. S. 277-278.
2. Respondent's obligation under the injunction is a ""debt"" or ""liability on a claim"" subject to discharge under the Bankruptcy Code.  Contrary

Syllabus 
Faced with Medicaid costs beyond its budget, Tennessee proposed to reduce from 20 to 14 the number of annual inpatient hospital days that state Medicaid would pay hospitals on behalf of a Medicaid recipient.  Before the reduction took effect, respondent Medicaid recipients brought a class action in Federal District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief.  Respondents alleged that the proposed 14-day limitation would have a disproportionate effect on the handicapped, and hence was discriminatory in violation of  504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 -- which provides that no otherwise qualified handicapped person shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be subjected to discrimination under any program receiving federal financial assistance -- and its implementing regulations, and moreover that any annual limitation on inpatient coverage would disadvantage the handicapped disproportionately in violation of  504.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the 14-day limitation was not the type of discrimination that  504 was intended to proscribe.  The Court of Appeals held that respondent had established a prima facie case of a  504 violation, because both the 14-day and any annual limitation on inpatient coverage would disproportionately affect the handicapped.
Held:  Assuming that  504 or its implementing regulations reach some claims of disparate impact discrimination, the effect of Tennessee's reduction in annual inpatient hospital coverage is not among them.  Pp.  469 U. S. 292-309.
(a) The 14-day limitation is neutral on its face, is not alleged to rest on a discriminatory motive, and does not deny the handicapped meaningful access to or exclude them from the particular package of Medicaid services Tennessee has chosen to provide.  The State has made the same benefit equally accessible to both handicapped and nonhandicapped persons, and is not required to assure the handicapped ""adequate health care"" by providing them with more coverage than the nonhandicapped.  Nothing in the Rehabilitation Act's legislative history supports the conclusion that the Act requires the States to view certain illnesses, i.e., those particularly affecting the handicapped, as more important than others and more worthy of cure through government subsidization.  Section 504 does not require the State to alter its definition of the benefit 
Page 469 U. S. 288
 it will be providing as 14 days of inpatient coverage simply to meet the reality that the handicapped have greater medical needs.  While  504 seeks to assure even-handed treatment and the opportunity for handicapped individuals to participate in and benefit from programs receiving federal financial assistance, the Act does not guarantee the handicapped equal results from the provision of state Medicaid.  Pp.  469 U. S. 302-306.
(b) In addition, the State is not obligated to modify its Medicaid program by abandoning reliance on annual durational limitations on inpatient coverage.  Section 504 does not require the State to redefine its Medicaid program, and nothing in its legislative history suggests that Congress desired to make major inroads on the States' longstanding discretion to choose the proper mix of amount, scope, and durational limitations on services covered by Medicaid.  Moreover,  504 does not require that federal grantees make a broad-based distributive decision always in the way most favorable, or least disadvantageous, to the handicapped.  To do so would impose a virtually unworkable requirement on state Medicaid administrators.  Pp.  469 U. S. 306-309.

Petitioners are a holding company and its tax-shelter-promoting subsidiaries.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued summonses to petitioners pursuant to  7602(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, which empowers the IRS to serve summons on any person, without prior judicial approval, if the information sought is necessary to ascertain that person's tax liability.  The summonses requested petitioners' financial statements for certain fiscal years, as well as the names of persons who had licenses from petitioners to distribute a certain medical device.  When petitioners refused to comply with the summonses, the Government brought an enforcement action in Federal District Court.  Petitioners opposed enforcement on the ground that the IRS's request for the licensees' names indicated that the IRS's ""primary purpose"" was to audit the licensees, not petitioners.  Petitioners contended that, if the IRS wanted the licensees' names, it could not proceed solely under  7602(a), but would have to comply also with the ""John Doe"" summons procedures of  7609(f), which requires the IRS to obtain prior judicial approval to serve a summons seeking information on the tax liability of unnamed taxpayers.  The District Court found that the IRS had made a sufficient showing of its interest in auditing petitioners' returns and enforced the summonses.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that  7609(f) applies only when the IRS issues a summons to an identifiable party with whom it has no interest in order to investigate the unnamed third parties' tax liabilities.
Held:  Where, pursuant to  7602(a), the IRS serves a summons on a known taxpayer with the dual purpose of investigating both that taxpayer's tax liability and unnamed parties' tax liabilities, it need not comply with  7609(f), as long as all the information sought is relevant to a legitimate investigation of the summoned taxpayer.  Where the summoned party is itself being investigated, that party's self-interest provides sufficient protection against the evils that Congress sought to remedy when it enacted  7609(f), which serves as a restraint on the IRS's exercise of its summons power in the ""John Doe"" context.

Syllabus 
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) was amended in 1978 to prohibit the mandatory retirement of a protected employee because of his age.  Concerned that its retirement policy, at least as it applied to flight engineers, violated the ADEA, petitioner Trans World Airlines (TWA) adopted a plan permitting any employee in ""flight engineer status"" at age 60 to continue working in that capacity.  The plan, however, does not give 60-year-old captains (pilots) the right automatically to begin training as flight engineers.  Instead, a captain may remain with the airline only if he has been able to obtain ""flight engineer status"" through the bidding procedures outlined in the collective bargaining agreement between TWA and petitioner Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA).  These procedures require a captain, prior to his 60th birthday, to submit a ""standing bid"" for the position of flight engineer.  When a vacancy occurs, it is assigned to the most senior captain with a standing bid.  If no vacancy occurs prior to his 60th birthday, or if he lacks sufficient seniority to bid successfully for those vacancies that do occur, the captain is retired.  Under the collective bargaining agreement, a captain displaced for any reason besides age need not resort to the bidding procedure.  For example, a captain who is medically disabled or whose position is eliminated due to reduced manpower may displace automatically, or ""bump,"" a less senior flight engineer.  Respondent former TWA captains (hereafter respondents) were retired upon reaching age 60.  Each was denied an opportunity to ""bump"" a less senior flight engineer.  Two of them were forced to retire before TWA adopted its new plan and thus were denied an opportunity to become flight engineers through the bidding procedures.  The third filed a standing bid for the position of flight engineer but no vacancies occurred prior to his 60th birthday, and he too was forced to retire.  Respondents filed an action against TWA and ALPA in Federal District Court, claiming that TWA's transfer policy violated  4(a)(1) of the ADEA -- which proscribes differential treatment of older workers ""with respect to . . . [a] privileg[e] of employment"" -- because, while it allowed captains displaced for reasons 
Page 469 U. S. 112
 other than age to ""bump"" less senior flight engineers, it did not allow the same ""privilege of employment"" to captains compelled to vacate their positions upon reaching age 60.  The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of TWA and ALPA, holding that respondents had failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under the test set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, and that the affirmative defenses provided by  4(f)(1) -- an employer may take ""any action otherwise prohibited"" where age is a ""bona fide occupational qualification [BFOQ]"" -- and  4(f)(2) -- it is not unlawful for an employer to adopt a ""bona fide seniority system"" -- of the ADEA justified TWA's transfer policy.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the McDonnell Douglas test was inapposite because respondents had adduced direct proof of age discrimination; that TWA was required by  4(a)(1) to afford 60-year-old captains the same ""privilege of employment,"" i.e., ""bumping"" less senior flight engineers, allowed captains disqualified for reasons other than age; that the affirmative defenses of the ADEA did not justify TWA's discriminatory transfer policy; and that TWA was liable for ""liquidated"" or double damages under  7(b) of the ADEA, because its violation of the ADEA was ""willful"" within the meaning of that section.
Held:
1. TWA's transfer policy denies 60-year-old captains a ""privilege of employment"" on the basis of age in violation of  4(a)(1) of the ADEA.  Captains disqualified because of age are not afforded the same ""bumping"" privilege as captains disqualified for reasons other than age, but instead must resort to the bidding procedures.  While the ADEA does not require TWA to grant transfer privileges to disqualified captains, nevertheless, if it does grant some disqualified captains the ""privilege"" of ""bumping"" less senior flight engineers, it may not deny the opportunity to others because of their age.  The McDonnell Douglas test is inapplicable where the plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination.  Here, there is direct evidence that the transfer method available to a captain depends on his age.  Since it allows captains disqualified for any reason other than age to ""bump"" less senior flight engineers, TWA's transfer policy is discriminatory on its face.  Pp.  469 U. S. 120-122.
2. The affirmative defenses provided by  4(f)(1) and (2) do not support the argument that TWA's discriminatory transfer policy is justified.  The BFOQ defense is meritless because age is not a BFOQ for the position of flight engineer.  Nor can TWA's policy be viewed as part of a bona fide seniority system.  A system that includes this discriminatory transfer policy permits the forced retirement of captains on the basis of age.  Pp.  469 U. S. 122-125. 
Page 469 U. S. 113

3. TWA's violation of the ADEA was not willful within the meaning of  7(b), and therefore respondents are not entitled to ""liquidated"" or double damages.  A violation is ""willful"" within the meaning of  7(b) if the employer knew its conduct was prohibited by the ADEA or showed a ""reckless disregard"" for whether it was prohibited, but not if the employer simply knew of the potential applicability of the ADEA or that ADEA was ""in the picture.""  The latter broad standard would result in an award of double damages in almost every case.  TWA certainly did not ""know"" that its conduct violated the ADEA.  Nor can it fairly be said that the TWA adopted its transfer policy in ""reckless disregard"" of the ADEA's requirements.  The record makes clear that TWA officials acted reasonably and in good faith in attempting to determine whether their policy would violate the ADEA.  Pp.  469 U. S. 125-130.

Syllabus 
Pursuant to a merger plan whereby Commerce Savings and Loan Association, a state-chartered stock savings and loan association, was merged in 1976 into Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association, a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association, petitioners, husband and wife, exchanged their ""guaranty stock"" in Commerce for passbook savings accounts and time certificates of deposit in Citizens representing share interests in Citizens.  Relying on  354(a)(1) and 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provide an exception to recognizing a gain on the sale or exchange of property for corporate reorganizations, petitioners did not report on their 1976 income tax return the gain they realized on the exchange, because they considered the merger to be a tax-free reorganization.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, however, issued a notice of deficiency and found petitioners liable for tax on the entire gain.  Petitioners then sought redetermination of the deficiency in the Tax Court, which rendered a decision in petitioners' favor.  The court reasoned that the savings accounts and certificates of deposit were the only forms of equity in Citizens, and held that the requisite continuity of interest existed under the rule that, even though the literal terms of the reorganization provisions of the statute are satisfied, the statute also requires that the taxpayer's ownership interest in the prior organization must continue in a meaningful fashion in the reorganized enterprise, and the retained interest must represent a substantial part of the value of the thing transferred, Helvering v. Minnesota Tea Co., 296 U. S. 378.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, despite certain equity characteristics, the Citizens savings accounts and certificates of deposit were indistinguishable from ordinary savings accounts and were essentially the equivalent of cash.
Held:  Petitioners were not entitled to treat the Commerce-Citizens merger as a tax-free reorganization under  354(a)(1) and 368(a)(1)(A), and thus are taxable on the gain they realized on the exchange in question.  Pp.  469 U. S. 137-143.
(a) Petitioners' Citizens passbook accounts and certificates of deposit were cash equivalents.  The debt characteristics of Citizens' shares (the passbook accounts and certificates of deposit are not subordinated to

Pp.  469 U. S. 137-140.
(b) Petitioners have failed to satisfy the continuity of interest required to qualify the merger as a tax-free reorganization.  The debt value of the Citizens shares was the same as the face value; because no one would pay more than this for the shares, the incremental value attributable to the equity features was, practically, zero.  Thus, this retained equity interest in the reorganized enterprise was not a ""substantial"" part of the value of the Commerce stock that was given up.  Pp.  469 U. S. 140-142.

No. 83-832

Decided January 8, 1985
469 U.S. 131

Syllabus 
Pursuant to a merger plan whereby Commerce Savings and Loan Association, a state-chartered stock savings and loan association, was merged in 1976 into Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association, a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association, petitioners, husband and wife, exchanged their ""guaranty stock"" in Commerce for passbook savings accounts and time certificates of deposit in Citizens representing share interests in Citizens.  Relying on  354(a)(1) and 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provide an exception to recognizing a gain on the sale or exchange of property for corporate reorganizations, petitioners did not report on their 1976 income tax return the gain they realized on the exchange, because they considered the merger to be a tax-free reorganization.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, however, issued a notice of deficiency and found petitioners liable for tax on the entire gain.  Petitioners then sought redetermination of the deficiency in the Tax Court, which rendered a decision in petitioners' favor.  The court reasoned that the savings accounts and certificates of deposit were the only forms of equity in Citizens, and held that the requisite continuity of interest existed under the rule that, even though the literal terms of the reorganization provisions of the statute are satisfied, the statute also requires that the taxpayer's ownership interest in the prior organization must continue in a meaningful fashion in the reorganized enterprise, and the retained interest must represent a substantial part of the value of the thing transferred, Helvering v.

Syllabus 
This case involves a controversy between petitioner publisher and respondent heirs of the author of the 1923 copyrighted song ""Who's Sorry Now"" over the division of royalty income that the sound recordings of the song have generated.  In 1940, the author assigned his entire interest in all renewals of the copyright to petitioner in exchange for an advance royalty and petitioner's commitment to pay a cash royalty on sheet music and 50 percent of all net royalties that petitioner received for mechanical reproductions.  In 1951, petitioner registered a renewal copyright.  Thereafter, petitioner directly or through an agent issued over 400 licenses to record companies authorizing the use of the song in phonograph records, and obligating the companies to pay royalties to petitioner, who in turn was obligated to pay 50 percent of those royalties to the author.  Separate recordings were then prepared that generated the disputed royalty income.  After the author's death, respondents succeeded to his interest in the arrangement with petitioner.  Pursuant to 304(c)(2) of the Copyright Act, as revised in 1976, respondents terminated the author's grant to petitioner of rights in the renewal copyright.  Under  304(c)(6), this termination caused all rights ""covered by the terminated grant"" to revert to respondents, except that under  304 (c)(6)(A) a
""derivative work prepared under the authority of the grant before its termination may continue to be utilized under the terms of the grant after its termination.""
The sound recordings in question come within the statutory definition of a ""derivative work.""  When respondents demanded of petitioner's agent that the royalties on the recordings be remitted to them, the agent placed the disputed funds in escrow and brought an interpleader action in Federal District Court, which entered judgment for petitioner.  The court held that the recordings had been ""prepared under authority of the grant"" from the author to petitioner, that the statute made no distinction between grantees who themselves make or own derivative works and those who license others to do so, that therefore the terms of the agreement that had been in effect prior to the termination governed the record companies' obligation to pay royalties, and that under those agreements petitioner and respondents were each entitled to a 50 percent share in the net royalty.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the  304(c)(6)(A) exception preserved only the 
Page 469 U. S. 154
 grants from petitioner to the record companies; that the reversion of the copyright to respondents carried with it petitioner's right to collect the royalties payable under those grants; that  304 was enacted for the benefit of authors and that the exception was designed to protect ""utilizers"" of derivative works; that, because petitioner was neither an author nor a ""utilizer,"" it was not a member of either class that  304 was intended to benefit; and that the legislative history indicated that Congress had not contemplated a situation in which the authority to prepare derivative works was derived from two successive grants rather than a single grant directly from an author to a ""utilizer.""
Held:  Petitioner is entitled pursuant to  304(c)(6)(A) to a share of the royalty income in dispute under the terms of the author's grant to petitioner in 1940.  A consistent reading of the word ""grant"" in the text of  304 (c)(6)(A) encompasses that grant.  Nothing in the legislative history or the language of the statute indicates that Congress intended to draw a distinction between authorizations to prepare derivative works that are based on a single direct grant and those that are based on successive grants.  Rather, the consequences of a termination that  304 authorizes do not apply to derivative works that are protected by the  304(c)(6)(A) exception.  The boundaries of that exception are defined by reference to the scope of the privilege that had been authorized under the terminated grant and by reference to the time the derivative works were prepared.  The record companies' derivative works involved in this case are unquestionably within those boundaries.  Pp.  469 U. S. 164-178.

469 U.S. 189

Syllabus 
Petitioner operates long-term parking lots near airports in St. Louis Cleveland, Houston, Boston, Memphis, and San Francisco.  In 1969, petitioner applied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office to register a service mark consisting of the logo of an airplane and the words ""Park 'N Fly.""  The registration issued in 1971, and nearly six years later petitioner filed an affidavit with the Patent and Trademark Office to establish the incontestable status of the mark under  33(b) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act), which provides that ""registration shall be conclusive evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark,"" subject to the provisions of  15 and  33(b) itself.  Respondent provides long-term airport parking services called ""Dollar Park and Fly,"" but only operates in Portland, Ore.  Petitioner filed an infringement action in Federal District Court seeking to enjoin respondent from using the words ""Park and Fly"" in connection with its business.  The District Court granted the injunction, rejecting, inter alia, respondent's defense that petitioner's mark is unenforceable because it is merely descriptive.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that incontestability provides a defense against the cancellation of a mark but may not be used offensively to enjoin another's use, that, under this analysis, petitioner could obtain an injunction only if its mark would be entitled to continued registration without regard to its incontestable status, and that therefore respondent could defend by showing that the mark was merely descriptive.  The court then determined that petitioner's mark is merely descriptive and respondent should not be enjoined from using the words ""Park and Fly.""
Held:  The holder of a registered mark may rely on incontestability to enjoin infringement, and an infringement action may not be defended on the grounds that the mark is merely descriptive.  Pp.  469 U. S. 193-205.
(a) The Lanham Act nowhere distinguishes between a registrant's offensive and defensive use of an incontestable mark, but, on the contrary,  33(b)'s declaration that the registrant has an ""exclusive right"" to use the mark indicates that incontestable status may be used to enjoin infringement.  The Act's language also refutes any conclusion that an incontestable mark may be challenged as merely descriptive.  Pp.  469 U. S. 193-197. 
Page 469 U. S. 190

(b) Nothing in the Lanham Act's legislative history supports a departure from the plain language of the provisions concerning incontestability.  Indeed, a conclusion that incontestable status may provide the basis for enforcement of the registrant's exclusive right to use a mark promotes the Act's goals in providing national protection of trademarks in order to secure to the mark's owner the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers.  Pp.  469 U. S. 197-202.
(c) There is no merit to respondent's argument that the Court of Appeals' decision should be upheld because trademark registrations are issued after an ex parte proceeding and generally without inquiry into the merits of an application.  The facts of this case belie the suggestion that registration is virtually automatic, and respondent is simply wrong to suggest that third parties do not have an opportunity to challenge applications for trademark registration.  The power of courts under  34 of the Lanham Act to grant injunctions ""according to principles of equity"" does not encompass a substantive challenge to the validity of an incontestable mark on the grounds that it lacks secondary meaning.  Otherwise, the meaning of ""equity"" would be expanded to the point of vitiating the Act's more specific provisions.  Similarly, the power of courts to cancel registrations and ""otherwise rectify the register"" under  37 of the Act must be subject to the specific provisions concerning incontestability.  Pp.  469 U. S. 202-203.
(d) The Court of Appeals was not justified in relying on its decision in Tillamook County Creamery v. Tillamook Cheese & Dairy Assn., 345 F.2d 158, cert. denied, 382 U.S. 903, for the proposition that a registrant may not rely on incontestability to enjoin the use of a mark.  Pp.  469 U. S. 203-205.

No. 83-1330
Argued November 5, 1984
Decided January 8, 1985
469 U.S. 221

Syllabus 
Following an armed robbery in the Cincinnati suburb of St. Bernard, Ohio, a St. Bernard police officer, on the basis of information obtained from an informant that respondent had driven the getaway car during the robbery, issued a ""wanted flyer"" to other police departments in the area.  The flyer stated that respondent was wanted for investigation of the robbery, described him and the date and location of the robbery, and asked the other departments to pick up and hold him for the St. Bernard police.  Subsequently, on the basis of the flyer and after inquiring without success as to whether a warrant was outstanding for respondent's arrest, police officers from Covington, Ky., another Cincinnati suburb, stopped an automobile that respondent was seen driving.  One of the officers recognized a passenger in the car as a convicted felon and, upon observing a revolver butt protruding from underneath the passenger's seat, arrested the passenger.  After a search of the car uncovered other handguns, respondent was also arrested.  Respondent was then indicted on the federal charge of being a convicted felon in possession of firearms.  Respondent moved to suppress the handguns from evidence on the grounds that the Covington police had stopped him in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the principles announced in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1.  The Federal District Court denied respondent's motion, and he was convicted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the stop of respondent's car was improper because the crime being investigated was not imminent or ongoing, but rather was already completed, that the ""wanted flyer"" was insufficient to create a reasonable suspicion that respondent had committed a crime, and that therefore his conviction rested on evidence obtained through an illegal arrest.
Held:
1. Where police have been unable to locate a person suspected of involvement in a past crime, the ability to briefly stop that person, ask questions, or check identification in the absence of probable cause promotes the strong government interest in solving crimes and bringing offenders to justice.  Restraining police action until after probable cause is obtained would not only hinder the investigation but might also enable the suspect to flee and remain at large.  The law enforcement interests at stake in these circumstances outweigh the individual's interest to be 
Page 469 U. S. 222
 free of a stop and detention that is no more extensive than permissible in the investigation of imminent or ongoing crimes.  When police have a reasonable suspicion, grounded in specific and articulable facts, that a person they encounter was involved in or is wanted in connection with a completed felony, then a Terry stop may be made to investigate that suspicion.  Pp.  469 U. S. 227-229.
2. If a ""wanted flyer"" has been issued on the basis of articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that the person wanted has committed an offense, then reliance on that flyer justifies a stop to check identification, to pose questions, or to detain the person briefly while attempting to obtain further information.  It is the objective reading of the flyer that determines whether police officers from a department other than the one that issued the flyer can defensibly act in reliance on it.  Assuming that the police make a Terry stop in objective reliance on a flyer, the evidence uncovered in the course of the stop is admissible if the police who issued the flyer possessed a reasonable suspicion justifying the stop, and if the stop that occurred was not significantly more intrusive than would have been permitted the issuing department.  Pp.  469 U. S. 229-233.
3. Under the above principles, the investigatory stop of respondent was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, and therefore the evidence discovered during the stop was admissible.  The justification for a stop did not evaporate when the armed robbery was completed.  Respondent was reasonably suspected of involvement in a felony and was at large from the time the suspicion arose until the stop by the Covington police.  A brief stop and detention at the earliest opportunity after the suspicion arose was fully consistent with Fourth Amendment principles.  The flyer issued by the St. Bernard police, objectively read and supported by a reasonable suspicion on the part of the issuing department, justified the length and intrusiveness of the stop and detention that occurred.  And it is irrelevant whether the Covington police intended to detain respondent only long enough to confirm the existence of a warrant, or for a longer period.  Pp.  469 U. S. 233-236.

Ohio, 392 U. S. 1.  The Federal District Court denied respondent's motion, and he was convicted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the stop of respondent's car was improper because the crime being investigated was not imminent or ongoing, but rather was already completed, that the ""wanted flyer"" was insufficient to create a reasonable suspicion that respondent had committed a crime, and that therefore his conviction rested on evidence obtained through an illegal arrest.
Held:
1. Where police have been unable to locate a person suspected of involvement in a past crime, the ability to briefly stop that person, ask questions, or check identification in the absence of probable cause promotes the strong government interest in solving crimes and bringing offenders to justice.  Restraining police action until after probable cause is obtained would not only hinder the investigation but might also enable the suspect to flee and remain at large.  The law enforcement interests at stake in these circumstances outweigh the individual's interest to be 
Page 469 U. S. 222
 free of a stop and detention that is no more extensive than permissible in the investigation of imminent or ongoing crimes.  When police have a reasonable suspicion, grounded in specific and articulable facts, that a person they encounter was involved in or is wanted in connection with a completed felony, then a Terry stop may be made to investigate that suspicion.  Pp.  469 U. S. 227-229.
2. If a ""wanted flyer"" has been issued on the basis of articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that the person wanted has committed an offense, then reliance on that flyer justifies a stop to check identification, to pose questions, or to detain the person briefly while attempting to obtain further information.  It is the objective reading of the flyer that determines whether police officers from a department other than the one that issued the flyer can defensibly act in reliance on it.  Assuming that the police make a Terry stop in objective reliance on a flyer, the evidence uncovered in the course of the stop is admissible if the police who issued the flyer possessed a reasonable suspicion justifying the stop, and if the stop that occurred was not significantly more intrusive than would have been permitted the issuing department.  Pp.  469 U. S. 229-233.
3. Under the above principles, the investigatory stop of respondent was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, and therefore the evidence discovered during the stop was admissible.  The justification for a stop did not evaporate when the armed robbery was completed.  Respondent was reasonably suspected of involvement in a felony and was at large from the time the suspicion arose until the stop by the Covington police.  A brief stop and detention at the earliest opportunity after the suspicion arose was fully consistent with Fourth Amendment principles.  The flyer issued by the St. Bernard police, objectively read and supported by a reasonable suspicion on the part of the issuing department, justified the length and intrusiveness of the stop and detention that occurred.  And it is irrelevant whether the Covington police intended to detain respondent only long enough to confirm the existence of a warrant, or for a longer period.  Pp.  469 U. S. 233-236.

Decided January 7, 1985
469 U.S. 105

Syllabus 
In passing through Customs at Los Angeles International Airport, respondent checked the ""no"" box of the usual form with respect to the question whether he or any family member was carrying over $5,000.  However, after being questioned by customs officials and informed that he would be subjected to a search, he admitted that he and his wife were carrying over $20,000 cash, which they then produced.  Respondent was subsequently convicted and sentenced to consecutive sentences in Federal District Court under two counts in an indictment charging him with the felony of making a false statement to a United States agency in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1001, and with the misdemeanor of willfully failing to report that he was carrying more than $5,000 into the United States, in violation of 31 U.S.C.  1058, 1101 (1976 ed.).  Both counts were based on the same conduct -- answering ""no"" to the customs form question.  However, the felony false statement conviction was reversed by the Court of Appeals, which held that Congress intended someone in respondent's position to be punished only for the currency reporting misdemeanor.  The court applied the rule of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, for determining whether Congress intended to permit cumulative punishment -- that is, whether each statutory provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not -- and concluded that every currency reporting offense necessarily entails a violation of the false statement law.
Held:  The Court of Appeals misapplied the Blockburger rule.  Proof of a currency reporting violation does not necessarily include proof of a false statement offense, since  1001 proscribes the nondisclosure of a material fact only if the fact is concealed ""by any trick, scheme, or device,"" and a person could, without employing a ""trick, scheme, or device,"" simply and willfully fail to file a currency disclosure report.  There is no evidence that Congress did not intend to allow separate punishment for the two different offenses here.  Moreover, Congress' intent to allow punishment for both offenses is shown by the fact that the statutes are directed to separate evils.
Certiorari granted; 726 F.2d 1320, reversed in part and remanded.

 Monte R. MORDAUNT and Dorothy Mordaunt v. INCOMCO et alNo. 83-2025 Supreme Court of the United States January 7, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice BRENNAN join, dissenting. 
 Responding to a magazine advertisement, petitioners entered into discretionary commodities futures contracts with respondents. Petitioners gave respondents over $45,000 to invest in the commodities futures market. Investment decisions were left entirely to respondents, who received a commission for each transaction they conducted. The accounts were soon worth far less than $45,000, and petitioners canceled the agreements. They then brought the present action in Federal District Court, alleging violations of federal and state securities laws. The District Court entered judgment for petitioners, concluding that the advertisement had been false and misleading and that the accounts constituted ""investment contracts"" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. See 15 U.S. C. 77b. The Court of Appeals reversed. 686 F.2d 815 (CA9 1982). It held that because respondents' prosperity did not hinge on the success or failure of petitioners' investments-respondents earned $20,000 in commissions while petitioners were losing $27,000-the required ""common enterprise"" was lacking. 
 Section 2(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 defines ""security"" to include an ""investment contract."" 48 Stat. 74, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 77b(1). Almost 40 years ago this Court held that an ""investment contract"" is a ""contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party . . . ."" SEC v. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 298-299, 1102-1103 (1946). The lower courts have disagreed over whether a trading account like that involved here satisfies the requirement of a ""common enterprise."" Some require a pooling of investments-horizontal commonality. See Curran v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, 
Page 469 U.S. 1115 , 1116
 Fenner & Smith, Inc., 622 F.2d 216 (CA6 1980), aff'd on other grounds, 456 U.S. 353 (1982); Hirk v. Agri-Research Council, Inc., 561 F.2d 96 (CA7 1977); Wasnowic v. Chicago Board of Trade, 352 F.Supp. 1066 (MD Pa.1972), aff'd, 491 F.2d 752 (CA3 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 994 (1974). Under this approach, discretionary futures contracts do not qualify as securities. Other courts require only the existence of a relationship between an investor and a broker-vertical commonality-and reach the opposite result. SEC v. Continental Commodities Corp., 497 F.2d 516 (CA5 1974); cf. Commercial Iron & Metal Co. v. Bache & Co., 478 F.2d 39 (CA10 1973), cert. denied; Booth v. Peavey Co. Commodities Services, 430 F.2d 132 (CA8 1970 ). The SEC in the past seems to have taken the position that discretionary commodities futures contracts are securities. In re Carlson, 46 S.E.C. 1125 (1977) (horizontal pooling promised but not implemented); see also SEC v. Continental Commodities Corp., supra, at 520. 
 Like the Fifth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit has rejected the horizontal commonality requirement. E.g., Meyer v. Thomas & McKinnon Auchincloss Kohlmeyer, Inc., 686 F.2d 818 (CA9 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1023 (1983); Brodt v. Bache & Co., 595 F.2d 459, 461 (CA9 1978). However, its conception of vertical commonality is more stringent. The Fifth Circuit has stated that the ""critical inquiry"" is whether there is ""promoter dominance,"" that is, ""whether the fortuity of the investments collectively is essentially dependent upon promoter expertise."" SEC v. Continental Commodities Corp., supra, at 522, and n. 12; see also Taylor v. Bear Stearns & Co., 572 F.Supp. 667, 671 (ND Ga. 1983). Under the Ninth Circuit's rule it is not enough that the promoter has control of the investments. ""Vertical commonality"" also requires a correlation between the success of the promoter and that of the accounts themselves. See 686 F.2d, at 817; Brodt v. Bache & Co., supra, at 462. 
 The importance of this conflict is not limited to the classification of discretionary commodities futures contracts. In related areas the lower courts are similarly divided as to whether Howey requires vertical or horizontal commonality. For example, the Ninth Circuit relied on its decision in this case in concluding that vertical commonality rendered a sale/leaseback transaction a security. United States v. Jones, 712 F.2d 1316 (CA9 1983), cert. denied, sub nom. Webber v. United States, 464 U.S. 986 (1983). In con- [469 U.S. 1115 , 1117]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice WHITE join, dissenting. 
 In Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 ( 1979), this Court held that a private employer does not violate Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act when it voluntarily undertakes ""affirmative action,"" as long as that action is taken ""to eliminate conspicuous racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories."" Id., at 209, 99 S. Ct., at 2730. But the Weber Court began its analysis by stating: 
 ""We emphasize at the outset the narrowness of our inquiry. Since the Kaiser-USWA plan does not involve state action, this case does not present an alleged violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."" Id., at 200. 
 I believe that this case squarely presents the question left open in Weber. 
 The controversy here centers on a written examination required of all applicants seeking the position of ""Correction Captain"" in the New York State prison correctional system. The exam results are combined with credit for seniority and Armed Forces service to arrive at a ranking list, which list is used to fill positions as they become open. The specific test in issue was administered to 275 candidates on January 30, 1982. Thirty-two of these were minority candidates, and 243 were nonminority. The test was an 
Page 469 U.S. 1117 , 1118
 objective test consisting of 103 questions. Of the minority candidates, eight, or 25%, passed the examination by scoring 70% or higher. Forty- eight percent of the nonminorities passed. 
 The State reviewed these results in light of a rule of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which states that evidence that an employer selects minority candidates for employment positions at a rate that is less than 80% of the selection rate for nonminorities ""will generally be regarded . . . as evidence of adverse impact,"" see 29 CFR 1607.4(D) (1984). It concluded that the test's minority selection rate of approximately 50% demonstrated an adverse impact on minority candidates. Given this statistical disparity, the fact that the State had been sued by minorities with respect to two prior examinations for correctional officer positions,1 and the lack of any indication that minorities would not perform equally well in the position of Correction Captain, the State unilaterally decided to raise the scores of minority candidates by establishing a separate normalization curve for minority candidates and equating the mean of that curve with the mean for nonminorities. The upshot of this action was that eight more minority candidates passed the test; although no nonminority candidates were taken off the list the scores of all minority candidates were increased, and the highest scoring minority candidate became the highest scoring of all the candidates. 
 Petitioners are several nonminority candidates who claim they were injured by the State's action because they were ""bumped"" down the ranking list by minority candidates whose scores were increased. They brought suit claiming that the State's unilateral adoption of race-conscious employment policies violated Title VII and the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court agreed that the State's action violated Title VII 2 for three reasons: first, it did not believe that the evidence supplied by the State established a prima facie case of discrimination; second, it did not believe in [469 U.S. 1117 , 1119]

 GOULD, INC. and First Trust Company of St. Paul, Minnesotav. Robert J. ADAMS et alNo. 84-384 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 7, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Gould, Inc. (Gould), discontinued its operations at the Wilkening plant, where it had employed respondents. Under a pension plan negotiated with respondents' union, assets were to be used first to pay pensions to ""current retirees""-beneficiaries who had already retired. If any assets then remained, they were to go to employees with vested rights to benefits, as they reached retirement age. When the plant closed, however, the pension fund's relevant assets were insufficient to pay even the current retirees. [ Gould, Inc. v. Adams 469 U.S. 1122 (1985) ][1122-Continued.] 
 Respondents' union brought a grievance under the collective- bargaining agreement, seeking to force Gould to fund pension benefits for the beneficiary former employees in full. The grievance proceeded to arbitration, and although the arbitrator held that Gould did not have to fund the plan in full, he found that Gould improperly changed its actuarial assumptions to reduce its contributions at the time it began to consider closing the plant. The arbitrator ordered the parties to determine by negotiations the amount by which Gould's contributions were less than they would have been if proper actuarial assumptions had been used, and he directed Gould to pay that amount into the pension fund. After negotiations, Gould and respondents' union agreed that the undercontribution amount was $570,600. However, without notice to respondents, Gould and the union then negotiated a settlement. Under the settlement, Gould agreed to guarantee full pension rights for the current retirees through a supplemental annuity, but Gould was absolved of the responsibility to deposit $570,600 with the plan's trustee, petitioner First Trust Co. Vested employees were not entitled to any benefits under the settlement. 
 Respondents, all vested employees, brought suit. In their amended complaint, respondents for the first time alleged that Gould's failure to place the $570,600 in the trust violated the arbitrator's award, and thus the collective-bargaining agreement; and that in negotiating the settlement, their union breached its duty of fair representation. See Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171 (1967); Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., 424 U.S. 554 ( 1976).

 The Court of Appeals found that this amendment was timely despite our recent decision in DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151 (1983), where we held that the uniform national 6-month statute of limitations found in 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 160(b), was applicable by analogy in Vaca v. Sipes cases. 739 F.2d 858 (1984). Instead, the Court of Appeals borrowed the 3-year statute of limitations in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA), 29 U.S.C. 1113(a)(2),* as ""arguably more appropriate."" 739 F.2d 866. The Court of Appeals reasoned that while speed and finality are paramount in most Vaca v. Sipes situations, these policies are less relevant in pension disputes because the effect of the dispute on day-to- day management of the business is slight. The absence of an immediate effect on any employees except those currently retired also makes it likely that employees will not be aware of their grievance immediately. In the end, the Court of Appeals concluded that this was a pension matter governed by the ERISA limitations period, not an ordinary Vaca v. Sipes claim covered by the rule we announced in DelCostello. 
 The rule adopted below departs from the policy we recently announced in DelCostello of having a single statute of limitations for fair representation suits. Petitioners argue that the effect of this decision will be to reintroduce much of the uncertainty and lack of uniformity which marked the pre-DelCostello period. If the limitations period for a union's resolution of a wide variety of disputes turns on the nature of the issue, rather than the nature of the union's discharge of its duty of representation, petitioners assert that the DelCostello decision will have been rendered largely meaningless. 
 I would grant certiorari to decide this important question involving the reach and application of the rule we announced in DelCostello. 
[Footnote *] In relevant part, that Act provides for a 3-year statute of limitations dating from ""the earliest date (A) on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach."" 29 U.S.C. 1113(a)(2).

 Supreme Court of the United States

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Gould, Inc. (Gould), discontinued its operations at the Wilkening plant, where it had employed respondents. Under a pension plan negotiated with respondents' union, assets were to be used first to pay pensions to ""current retirees""-beneficiaries who had already retired. If any assets then remained, they were to go to employees with vested rights to benefits, as they reached retirement age. When the plant closed, however, the pension fund's relevant assets were insufficient to pay even the current retirees. [ Gould, Inc. v. Adams 469 U.S. 1122 (1985) ][1122-Continued.]

 Carl Ray SONGER v. Louie L. WAINWRIGHT, Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections, et alNo. 84-5690 Supreme Court of the United States January 7, 1985
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Carl Songer was sentenced to death in 1974. At the sentencing hearing, Songer's attorney did not offer available character evidence in mitigation, not because he had none, or as a strategic maneuver, but because he reasonably concluded that Florida law did not permit admission of such evidence. We have consistently held, however, that in capital cases ""the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer . . . not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record."" Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 2964 (1978) (opinion of BURGER, C.J.). We have applied this rule not only when the preclusion of mitigating evidence results under the plain terms of a statute, as in Lockett, but also where a nonstatutory application of state law violates the rule. Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104 ( 1982). In Songer's case, the District Court ruled that Florida's capital sentencing statute was, in 1974, reasonably understood to preclude introduction of mitigating evidence unless the evidence fit into certain statutorily defined categories. Because that understanding, and Songer's consequent death sentence, violated clear principles expressed in Lockett and Eddings, this Court should vacate Songer's sentence and remand the case for a proper proceeding. 
 I  
 Songer was convicted in February 1974 of the first-degree murder of a Florida highway patrolman. The evidence at trial showed that Songer was asleep in the back seat of a car lawfully stopped off the highway when the investigating patrolman reached 
Page 469 U.S. 1133 , 1134
 into the car with his pistol in a ready position. Suddenly thus awakened, Songer grabbed his own gun, and both Songer and the patrolman fired multiple shots. The patrolman died from the injuries he received. 
 After returning a verdict of guilty, the jury separately heard evidence under Florida's recently enacted capital sentencing statute. Fla. Stat. 921.141 (1973).1 At the time, that statute listed eight aggravating circumstances and seven mitigating circumstances. 921.141( 6) and (7).2 Although Songer informed his attorney that members of his family and friends were willing and available to testify to his general good character and normally non-violent personality, Songer's counsel called no witnesses other than Songer and offered no other mitigating evidence for the jury to consider. The jury recommended death, and the judge imposed that sentence. 
 In 1980, Songer filed a motion to vacate sentence in his Florida trial court. [Footnote 3] He raised his Lockett claim as part of a broad challenge to his trial attorney's effective assistance and to the jury instructions used at sentencing.

 Louie L. WAINWRIGHT, Secretary, Florida Department of Correctionsv. Stephen Todd BOOKER. 
 A-220. 
 Sept. 24, 1985. 
 For majority opinion see . 

 Justice POWELL, concurring.* 
 My vote was to grant Florida's application to vacate the stay of execution in this case. I write as it seems important to address two points raised by Justice MARSHALL's dissent. 
 I 
 The dissent contends that our action in this case conflicts with our customary deference to the decisions of courts of appeals on stay applications. Such deference is not absolute. We have noted previously that ""stays of execution are not automatic pending the filing and consideration of a petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court to the court of appeals that has denied a writ of habeas corpus."" Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895, 3396 (1983). To the contrary, stays in cases of this sort should be granted only when ( i) it is reasonably probable that four Members of the Court would vote to grant certiorari or to note probable jurisdiction, and also (ii) there is a significant possibility that this Court will reverse the decision below. Ibid. 1 In this case, after examining the State's application to vacate, the respondent's response, the application for a stay filed with the Court of Appeals, and the opinions of the Court of Appeals and the District Court, I concluded that there was no basis for finding that either prong of the Barefoot v. Estelle test was satisfied. The Court of Appeals offered no reasons for its decision to grant the stay application, and no plausible reason appeared from the record. 
Page 473 U.S. 935 , 936
 Deference is a two-way street. Although my vote did not depend on speculation as to the Court of Appeals' reason for granting respondent's stay application, it would not be surprising if that court was confused by the seeming absence of deference in our decisions in Pinkerton v. McCotter, 473 U.S. 925, 106 S.Ct. and Darden v. Wainwright, 473 U.S. 928, 106 S.Ct . ___, --L.Ed.2d ___. In both of those cases, this Court reversed denials of stays of execution, on the ground that four Justices either had voted to grant certiorari or had suggested that such a vote was likely. I joined those decisions out of a concern that the Court ordinarily should not permit an execution to moot our consideration of a case that we had agreed, or probably would agree, to hear on the merits. I noted, however, that in my view the petitions in those cases were wholly without merit. Darden, 473 U.S. 928, 106 S.Ct. ---(POWELL, J., concurring); Pinkerton, 473 U.S. at 926, 106 S.Ct. at ---(POWELL, J., concurring). Consequently, and given the Court of Appeals' greater familiarity with the case, there was a strong argument that the proper course was to accept that court's evaluation of the likelihood of reversal. I declined to accept that argument in those cases, although the decision was a close one. [Footnote 2] 

 If affirmance was not required in Pinkerton and Darden under an appropriately deferential standard of review, it cannot be necessary here. In Pinkerton and Darden, the Court of Appeals' judgment that reversal on the merits was unlikely had substantial force; in this case, the Court of Appeals' decision lacks a plausible justification. Only a generalized preference for delay in capital punishment cases would justify affirming the issuance of a stay solely on deference grounds, while according little or no deference where a stay has been denied below. In my view, the degree of deference accorded court of appeals rulings on stay applications cannot properly depend so completely on the result reached below.

 Justice POWELL, concurring.* 
 My vote was to grant Florida's application to vacate the stay of execution in this case. I write as it seems important to address two points raised by Justice MARSHALL's dissent. 
 I 
 The dissent contends that our action in this case conflicts with our customary deference to the decisions of courts of appeals on stay applications. Such deference is not absolute. We have noted previously that ""stays of execution are not automatic pending the filing and consideration of a petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court to the court of appeals that has denied a writ of habeas corpus."" Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895, 3396 (1983). To the contrary, stays in cases of this sort should be granted only when ( i) it is reasonably probable that four Members of the Court would vote to grant certiorari or to note probable jurisdiction, and also (ii) there is a significant possibility that this Court will reverse the decision below. Ibid. 1 In this case, after examining the State's application to vacate, the respondent's response, the application for a stay filed with the Court of Appeals, and the opinions of the Court of Appeals and the District Court, I concluded that there was no basis for finding that either prong of the Barefoot v. Estelle test was satisfied. The Court of Appeals offered no reasons for its decision to grant the stay application, and no plausible reason appeared from the record. 
Page 473 U.S. 935 , 936
 Deference is a two-way street. Although my vote did not depend on speculation as to the Court of Appeals' reason for granting respondent's stay application, it would not be surprising if that court was confused by the seeming absence of deference in our decisions in Pinkerton v. McCotter, 473 U.S. 925, 106 S.Ct. and Darden v. Wainwright, 473 U.S. 928, 106 S.Ct . ___, --L.Ed.2d ___. In both of those cases, this Court reversed denials of stays of execution, on the ground that four Justices either had voted to grant certiorari or had suggested that such a vote was likely. I joined those decisions out of a concern that the Court ordinarily should not permit an execution to moot our consideration of a case that we had agreed, or probably would agree, to hear on the merits. I noted, however, that in my view the petitions in those cases were wholly without merit. Darden, 473 U.S. 928, 106 S.Ct. ---(POWELL, J., concurring); Pinkerton, 473 U.S. at 926, 106 S.Ct. at ---(POWELL, J., concurring).

 UNITED STATES TRUST COMPANY OF NEW YORK et al.v. Augustin J. SAN FILIPPO and Robert M. Morgenthau, District Attorney For County of New YorkNo. 84-1018 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 4, 1985
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 Augustin San Filippo sued United States Trust Company and two of its officers under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for malicious prosecution. San Filippo alleged that the U.S. Trust officers had conspired with a New York County Assistant District Attorney to present false testimony to a grand jury that was investigating San Filippo's alleged fraud in obtaining loans from U.S. Trust for two of his clients. Although the grand jury had returned an indictment against San Filippo, a jury had subsequently acquitted him of all charges. 
 The defendants asserted several affirmative defenses in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, including their absolute immunity from 1983 liability for their grand jury testimony or prior discussions with the prosecutor. Partly on the basis of this claimed immunity, they sought a protective order against further discovery and also moved for dismissal or summary judgment. These motions were denied by the 
Page 470 U.S. 1035 , 1036
 District Court, and the defendants appealed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the denials of these motions were properly before it under the ""collateral final order"" doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546, 1225 (1949), at least insofar as they were premised on a rejection of the defendants' absolute immunity defense. 737 F.2d 246, 254 ( 1984). On the merits, the court reasoned that the defendants were entitled to absolute immunity for their actual testimony before the grand jury, citing Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.S. 325 ( 1983), but not for any extrajudicial conspiracy between themselves and the prosecutor leading to the giving of the allegedly false testimony. The court then went on, however, to hold that San Filippo's ""completely unsubstantiated allegations of conspiracy"" were insufficient to state a valid claim for relief under 1983. Recognizing that this ground for relief did not ""in its own right merit interlocutory review under Cohen,"" the court held that it had jurisdiction to consider the issue ""under the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction,"" and determined to exercise that jurisdiction in this case in view of ""the waste of judicial resources"" were the suit to go forward on remand. 737 F.2d, at 255-256. 
 In reaching that holding, the Court of Appeals failed to mention our decision in Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651d 651 (1977). In that case, we held that a court of appeals may exercise jurisdiction under Cohen over an appeal from a pretrial order denying a motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds. We further concluded, however, that this jurisdiction did not extend to ""other claims presented to, and rejected by, the district court in passing on the accused's motion to dismiss."" Id., at 663. We specifically cautioned that ""such claims are appealable if, and only if, they too fall within Cohen' collateral-order exception to the final- judgment rule."" Any other rule, we reasoned, would encourage the assertion of frivolous but appealable claims in order to obtain premature appellate review of otherwise unappealable ""pendent"" claims. 
 The decision below is clearly in tension with our rationale in Abney. Moreover, it is in direct conflict with the holding of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Akerly v. Red Barn System, Inc., 551 F.2d 539, 542-543 (1977). In Akerly -like this, a civil case-the Third Circuit concluded that a District Court's refusal to disqualify counsel was a "" collateral order"" under 28 U.S.C. 1291, and that it therefore had appellate jurisdiction [470 U.S. 1035 , 1037]

 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the Supreme Court of South Carolina. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 In spite of this Court's repeated declarations that a capital "" 'sentencer . . . not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character . . . that the 
Page 471 U.S. 1036 , 1037
 defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death,' "" Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110, 874 (1982) ( quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 2964d 973 (1978)), the South Carolina Supreme Court has determined that evidence of a capital defendant's likely nondangerousness within a prison environment is legally irrelevant to the capital sentencer's choice between death or life in prison. In these cases, the petitioners were sentenced to death. They had offered such evidence in mitigation of death but were denied the opportunity of submitting the evidence to their sentencing juries. 
 The death sentences in these cases were imposed in glaring violation of two lines of this Court's capital sentencing jurisprudence. First, and most obviously, the sentences are contrary to the Lockett-Eddings line of authority, which makes unmistakably clear that it is for the sentencer to determine the weight to be given to proffered evidence of mitigation. Second, they are equally in conflict with those decisions of this Court that make equally clear that the question of a capital defendant's future dangerousness is a legitimate penological concern relevant to a capital sentencing hearing. See California v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992, 1001-1003, 3453-3454 (1983); Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 896-905, 3396-3401 (1983); Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262, 274-276, 2957-2958 ( 1976). 
 While this latter group of cases affirmed the penological relevance of future dangerousness in contexts in which the State urged it as a factor in aggravation, the hitherto relevant factor of future dangerousness cannot become suddenly and cruelly ""irrelevant"" as a matter of law when a defendant wishes to assert its absence as a factor in mitigation. As was declared in a precursor to Lockett and Eddings, ""a jury must be allowed to consider on the basis of all relevant evidence not only why a death sentence should be imposed, but also why it should not be imposed."" Jurek v. Texas, supra, at 271. Rather than allow Lockett and Eddings to be eroded through such a cruelly inequitable view of relevance, I would grant these petitions.

 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting. 
 In the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, 49 U.S.C. 10101 et seq., Congress took a significant step away from the traditionally pervasive federal regulation of railroads. Displaying evident distrust of the regulatory model, the Act includes a 15-point National Rail Transportation Policy. 10101a. Among the policies identified are ""(1) to allow, to the maximum extent possible, competition and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates for transportation by rail; [and] (2) to minimize the need for Federal regulatory control over the rail transportation system."" Ibid. The Act also provides that the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) "" shall exempt"" persons or transactions from an otherwise applicable regulation if the regulation ""is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101a"" and ""either (A) the transaction or service is of limited scope, or (B) the application of a provision of this subtitle is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power."" 10505(a). 
 Justice O'CONNOR took no part in the consideration or decision of these petitions. 
Page 471 U.S. 1069 , 1070
 These cases arise out of an ICC rulemaking regarding the deregulation of boxcar traffic. Exemption from Regulation-Boxcar Traffic, 367 I.C.C. 423 (1983); Alaska Railroad Certification, 367 I.C.C. 745 (1983). The Commission granted far-reaching exemptions pursuant to 10505(a). First, it eliminated ceilings on boxcar rates. Particularly in light of economic pressures caused by competition from the trucking industry, the Commission found that rail carriers lacked market power and that regulation of boxcar rates was not necessary to further the National Rail Transportation Policy . Second, it extended this exemption to ""joint rates."" A joint rate is the charge to a shipper for transportation over connected lines by more than one carrier. The revenues are divided among the carriers pursuant to joint rate agreements, which are regulated by 49 U.S.C. 10705. The Commission concluded that elimination of joint rate regulation would not lead to the demise of joint rates, long haul routes, or cooperation between large and small carriers. Third, the Commission exempted negotiated agreements from its ""car hire rules."" Under the otherwise applicable rules, the owner of a boxcar could charge a per diem rental fee to the railroad with control over the boxcar for the entire time the car was on that railroad's tracks, even if it was empty and still. The Commission found that in practice these rules resulted in extreme inefficiency, higher operating costs, an incentive for excessive purchases of boxcars, and a lack of responsiveness to market conditions. 
 Respondents sought judicial review in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The court sustained the exemption of boxcar traffic from maximum rate regulation, but set aside the other two rulings. 238 U.S.App.D.C. 352, 740 F.2d 1023 (1984). With regard to the joint rate exemption, it found that the Commission's consideration of the need for regulation and the possible adverse consequences of its elimination had been inadequate. Noting congressional concern about the possibility of large carriers squeezing profits from captive small carriers, it held the Commission's failure to consider the effect of joint rate exemption on the fair division of joint rate revenue among carriers had been arbitrary and capricious. Turning to the car hire issue, the Court of Appeals, echoing the position of dissenting ICC Chairman Taylor, held that the Commission's decision was, in reality, not an exemption but a new regulation. As such, it exceeded the Com- [471 U.S. 1069 , 1071]

 These cases arise out of an ICC rulemaking regarding the deregulation of boxcar traffic. Exemption from Regulation-Boxcar Traffic, 367 I.C.C. 423 (1983); Alaska Railroad Certification, 367 I.C.C. 745 (1983). The Commission granted far-reaching exemptions pursuant to 10505(a). First, it eliminated ceilings on boxcar rates. Particularly in light of economic pressures caused by competition from the trucking industry, the Commission found that rail carriers lacked market power and that regulation of boxcar rates was not necessary to further the National Rail Transportation Policy . Second, it extended this exemption to ""joint rates."" A joint rate is the charge to a shipper for transportation over connected lines by more than one carrier. The revenues are divided among the carriers pursuant to joint rate agreements, which are regulated by 49 U.S.C. 10705. The Commission concluded that elimination of joint rate regulation would not lead to the demise of joint rates, long haul routes, or cooperation between large and small carriers. Third, the Commission exempted negotiated agreements from its ""car hire rules."" Under the otherwise applicable rules, the owner of a boxcar could charge a per diem rental fee to the railroad with control over the boxcar for the entire time the car was on that railroad's tracks, even if it was empty and still. The Commission found that in practice these rules resulted in extreme inefficiency, higher operating costs, an incentive for excessive purchases of boxcars, and a lack of responsiveness to market conditions. 
 Respondents sought judicial review in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The court sustained the exemption of boxcar traffic from maximum rate regulation, but set aside the other two rulings. 238 U.S.App.D.C. 352, 740 F.2d 1023 (1984). With regard to the joint rate exemption, it found that the Commission's consideration of the need for regulation and the possible adverse consequences of its elimination had been inadequate. Noting congressional concern about the possibility of large carriers squeezing profits from captive small carriers, it held the Commission's failure to consider the effect of joint rate exemption on the fair division of joint rate revenue among carriers had been arbitrary and capricious. Turning to the car hire issue, the Court of Appeals, echoing the position of dissenting ICC Chairman Taylor, held that the Commission's decision was, in reality, not an exemption but a new regulation. As such, it exceeded the Com- [471 U.S. 1069 , 1071]

 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting. [ Interstate Commerce Commission v. Coal Exporters Association 471 U.S. 1072 (1985) ][1072-Continued.] 
 Like ICC v. Brae Corp. and Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Ahnapee & W.R. Co., 471 U.S. 1069 these cases involve implementation of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, 49 U.S.C. 10101 et seq. That Act begins with a 15-point National Rail Transportation Policy with a decidedly antiregulatory bent. 10101a. It goes on to provide that the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) ""shall exempt a person, class of persons, or a transaction or service"" from any regulation that is not necessary to carry out the policies detailed in 10101a or to ""protect shippers from the abuse of market power."" 10505(a). 
 Pursuant to this provision, the ICC exempted the rail transportation of coal bound for export from all regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act. Railroad Exemption-Export Coal, 367 I.C.C. 570 (1983). In the view of the Commission, relief from regulation would lead to improved efficiency, stronger railroads, and greater pricing flexibility. The resulting benefits would promote a variety of goals set out in 10101a. In addition, continued regulation was not needed to protect against abuse of market power by the railroads. They had an interest in the shippers' success, and the competitive international coal market would prevent them from raising prices so high that producers would not be competitive abroad . In addition, as experience had shown, the shippers formed a concentrated industry with bargaining power essentially equal to that of the railroads. The Commission also noted that antitrust remedies were available should the railroads abuse what market power they had, and that the railroads were unlikely to do so even if they could because the Commission would respond by revoking the exemption.

 v. United States, 240 U.S.App.D.C. 256, 745 F.2d 76 (1984). It found that the Commission had overlooked a key element of National Transportation Policy: ""to maintain reasonable rates where there is an absence of effective competition and where rail rates provide revenues which exceed the amount necessary to maintain the rail system and to attract capital."" 49 U.S.C. 10101a(6). Reading this provision in tandem with 10505's requirement that an exemption not subject shippers to ""the abuse of market power,"" the court held that the Commission had too narrow an understanding of the latter phrase. As it read the Commission's opinion, there would be no abuse of market power as long as the shippers had some bargaining power, however minimal, and received some share of the economic rents, however slight. The court condemned this view as ""wholly unreasonable,"" 240 U.S. App.D.C., at 275, 745 F.2d, at 95, and indifferent to the Act's concern for protecting the revenues of shippers, id., 278, 745 F.2d, at 98. 
 The railroads and the ICC, supported by the United States, petition for certiorari. They argue that the decision below effectively forecloses any use of the exemption provision. While this seems an overstatement, the opinion below does criticize the ICC for failing to quantify its conclusions with a precision that would appear unattainable. Moreover, the Court of Appeals involved itself in details of regulatory decisionmaking that might more properly be left to the agency. Precisely where hard bargaining leaves off and ""abuse of market power"" begins is the sort of issue best left to the agency's expertise, and the Court of Appeals' identification of abuse with any inequality is open to question. 
 More important, the decision below is set against the background of a fundamental clash between the Court of Appeals and the ICC concerning the deregulatory mandate of the Staggers Act. See ICC v. Brae Corp., 471 U.S., at 1069, 105 S.Ct. at 2150. The exemption provision is the key mechanism by which that mandate is to be effected, and the Commission has had some difficulty in getting its exemptions past the Court of Appeals. As I noted in dissenting from the Court's refusal to consider the Brae case, the effective implementation of the Staggers Act requires that the scope of the exemption requirement be settled. 
 I respectfully dissent.

 Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting. 
 In his cross-petition for certiorari Walter P. Coons seeks review of the New Jersey Supreme Court's holding that the New Jersey tolling statute, N.J.Stat.Ann. 2A:14-22 (West 1952), violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution because it tolls the statute of limitations for claims against corporations not represented in New Jersey. Coons v. American Honda Motor Co., 94 N.J. 307, 463 A.2d 921 (1983). We upheld the constitutionality of this statute against equal protection and due process challenges in G.D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U.S. 404 (1982). We expressly reserved the Commerce Clause question in Searle because the applicable New Jersey law was unclear. Id., at 413-414. We also vacated the judgment below and remanded to New Jersey courts a previous appeal arising out of Coons' lawsuit, for reconsideration in light of Searle. Honda Motor Co. v. Coons, 455 U.S. 996 (1982). That remand resulted in the New Jersey Supreme Court holding here, which Coons claims misapplies the Commerce Clause. Coons' suit has clarified the New Jersey law on the subject, and in striking down the New Jersey statute I think that the Supreme Court of New Jersey has gone beyond any of our Commerce Clause decisions. I would grant certiorari to review its decision. 
 Coons was burned badly when the fuel filler cap on his Honda motorcycle malfunctioned during a collision. New Jersey provides a 2-year statute of limitations for the type of injury suffered by Coons. N.J.Stat. Ann. 2A:14-2 (West 1952). Coons waited four years, however, and brought suit in state court against Honda Motor Co. (American Honda) and its parent Honda Motor Co. of Japan (Honda of Japan). American Honda had a certificate to do business in New Jersey, as required by N.J.Stat.Ann. 14A:13-4 (West 1969); Honda of Japan had no certificate. Because Honda of Japan had no certificate it was not ""represented"" in New Jersey under N. J.Stat.Ann. 2A:14-22 (West 1952), and that statute therefore tolled the 2-year limitations period for all unrepresented corporations. [Footnote 1] Thus American Honda [469 U.S. 1123 , 1125]

 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Before 1982, 18 U.S.C. 1503 (1976 ed.) prohibited influencing or intimidating ""any witness in any court of the United States,"" or any juror or court officer in the discharge of his or her duty. The section also contained a residual clause forbidding anyone to obstruct or attempt to obstruct the ""due administration of justice."" In 1982, Congress amended 1503 to remove all references to witnesses. At the same time, it enacted the Victim and Witness Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. 1512, addressed specifically to protecting witnesses, informants, and crime victims from harassment and intimidation. Congress did not, however, remove from 1503 the residual ""obstruction of justice"" clause. 
Page 471 U.S. 1130 , 1131
 Petitioners in these cases were charged with violating both 1503 and 1512 by attempting to influence a witness to testify falsely. They argued that such conduct could no longer support a conviction under 1503, because 1512 was now the only statute covering witness tampering. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected this contention and affirmed petitioners' convictions under 1503, reasoning that certain kinds of witness tampering could still be reached under the provision's "" obstruction of justice"" clause. 748 F.2d 962 (5 Cir.1984). The court observed that 1512 did not proscribe ""urging and advising"" a witness to testify falsely, which was the conduct that was charged to have violated 1503 in these cases. If urging a witness to commit perjury was not prohibited by 1512, and if witnesses had been removed entirely from the scope of 1503, the conduct with which petitioners were charged would violate neither section. The Court of Appeals saw no indication that in enacting 1512 to broaden witness protection, Congress had intended to create such a gap. 
 In reaching this result, the Court of Appeals explicitly rejected the reasoning of United States v. Hernandez, 730 F.2d 895 (CA2 1984). In that case, the Second Circuit vacated a conviction under 1503 that was based on witness intimidation. Reviewing the language and legislative history of 1503 and 1512, the court held that Congress ""affirmatively intended to remove witnesses entirely from the scope of 1503."" Id., at 898. The argument that the residual clause of that statute still covered witness harassment, the court stated, ""def[ied] common sense."" Id., at 899. 
 The Courts of Appeals of two large Circuits have thus arrived at contrary interpretations of an important criminal statute. I would grant certiorari in these cases to resolve the conflict.
